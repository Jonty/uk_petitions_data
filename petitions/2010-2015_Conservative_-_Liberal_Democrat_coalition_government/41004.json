        "additional_details": "A recent Panorama program revealed tourists from all over the world are purchasing illegal UK European Health Insurance Cards, receiving health care in any other EU Member State, and then charging the UK NHS.  What this means is, twenty million or so UK taxpayers are funding other people's health care from all over the world.  The cards are being sold on the black-market, which enables those who hold one to receive all kinds of health care for free - it is us, the UK Taxpayers who are funding their health care.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder why it doesn't matter how much of our taxes are allocated to the UK NHS, there is never enough money for those who pay in to it, and other genuine UK citizens?\r\n\r\nThe health cards should, therefore, be abolished immediately and no further health care costs paid for foreign tourists.",
