The pension money should be protected and ALL funds should have set a minimum target of return which is above the inflation. At the end of tax year value of pension fund should be considered as capital and be protected.\r\nAll individual must pay in full any loan, bills, etc. - together with interest. It seems big institutions are immune and not punished for not paying back what was given to them for managing and safe keeping. Moreover, annual management charge should be a function of return not capital - if they manage monies in improper way and fail to get returns above inflation AMC shall not be paid!",
