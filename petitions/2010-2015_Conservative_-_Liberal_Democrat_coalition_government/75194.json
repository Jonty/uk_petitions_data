        "additional_details": "Cot bumpers have, for years, been to blame for the injury and deaths of babies, due to strangulation and  overheating causing S.I.D.S (cot death), yet manufacturers are allowed to keep producing these items and shops are allowed to keep selling them. How many more parents need to suffer the loss of a baby before these things are removed from sale? Fortunately I never bought one as I had been made aware of the dangers but some parents are not aware unfortunately - seeing bumpers remain in shops and reading posts or articles about affected families dealing with the loss, or near loss, of a child, I felt it was time something was done - they are dangerous, fatally so, stop selling them! Do you agree? Please sign and ask the government to prevent the sale of these items, thanks. ",
