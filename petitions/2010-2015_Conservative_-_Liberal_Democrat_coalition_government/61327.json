        "additional_details": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nThe M11 currently goes from the A406 in north east London to the A14, north west of Cambridge. The county of South Lincolnshire currently has no motorways and business leaders say extending the M11 would boost the local economy. Boston and Skegness people have  written to the government in past for extension of M11 Motorway to Humber Bridge through this area.\r\n\r\nLincolnshire County Council has pushed for the M11 to be extended through the county and up to the Humber Bridge without a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL\r\n\r\nA motorway in South Lincolnshire is long overdue. We strongly support the proposal of M11 extension to Humber Bridge. The route should pass near Boston and  Grimsby. It will provide us a direct link  to London. This will boost the economy of South and East Lincolnshire tremendously.\r\n\r\nI want the government to  extend the M11 motorway from Cambridge to Humber Bridge via near Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
