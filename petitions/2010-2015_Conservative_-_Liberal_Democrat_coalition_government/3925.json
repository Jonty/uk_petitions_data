If found to be in possession of a knife for a second or more times, the person should be locked up in prison for 5 years or more. Too many of our citizens, especially the young, are getting hurt or killed by mindless people using knives as weapons. Life is too precious and too short for most of us at the best of times. We must protect each other. Not enough is being done at the moment to deter knife crime. *My family, I am sorry to say, is a victim of knife crime. Think about it.",
