Judges could easily and far more efficiently decide the facts in criminal proceedings. Juries are a sacred cow that needs to be slayed. Most countries use judges not juries to determine guilt. Many who have sat as jurors have horror stories to tell about how they reach their decisions - the Vicky Price case is a classic example. The money could be far better spent on helping the poorest in society.",
