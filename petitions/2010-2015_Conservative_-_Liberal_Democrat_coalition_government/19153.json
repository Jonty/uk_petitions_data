        "additional_details": "To encourage the DWP to open a dialogue with SME employers nationwide to propose that young unemployed people out of work for more than six months are given the opportunity of a 3-month internship, which the government will pay for under the Jobseeker scheme. Interns who successfully encourage SME employers to keep them on after this period to commit to enrol the interns into an apprenticeship or similar scheme. This would resolve the triple problem of hopelessness in young people, reduce the unemployment figures and encourage SMEs to give young people a chance, who they couldn't previously afford to employ.
