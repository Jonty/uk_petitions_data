Increase higher tax bands proportionately.\r\n\r\nCurrently the government spends more than it receives hence the huge debt.  This cannot go on. If we want the level of governemment spending we have then we have to pay for it and NOT by borrowing, which caused the problems in the first place. Reducing interest rates to half percent only enciurages more borrowing which is wrong.",
