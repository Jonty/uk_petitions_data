To do this, I'd like the government to introduce the following\u2026\r\n\r\nWhat I call a www.lockdown12.org of zones 1 and 2, even 3, where foreign investment is not allowed, regulated by a UK passport having to be owned and proof that the buyer works in the UK at least 70% of the year. This would increase the number of UK passport holders and London-based workers living in the central area. Potentially reducing crime, increasing productivity, releasing a transport burden and making housing really more \"affordable\".",
