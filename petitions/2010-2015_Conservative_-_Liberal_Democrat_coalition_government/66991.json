        "additional_details": "The General Dental Council is proposing an increase in the ARF for dentists by 64% to 945.00\r\n\r\nWe believe that such an increase is unjustified. The increase in the number of cases and costs incurred by the General Dental Council has happened because of the poor inefficient running of the counncil.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, their encouragement and creating avenues which encourage patients to complain has created an issue where the costs are higher. Most problems were being solved locally previously.\r\n\r\nThe activities of GDC have also led to increased litigation and increase in Dental indemnity fees.\r\n\r\nAll in all this is unsustainable and we do not believe the council is fit for purpose any more in protecting the public or serving the profession for its purpose.\r\n\r\nwe recommend disbandment of this council with a vote of no confidence from the profession it regulates",
