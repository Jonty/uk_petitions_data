        "additional_details": "The SORN and MID schemes were ostensibly introduced to clamp-down on Jack-The-Lads who were allegedly driving around without any tax or insurance.\r\n\r\nThese schemes have done NOTHING to reduce Crime.  Instead they just victimise decent people who have a \u201cproject car\u201d in their backyard.  They are in effect a Stealth Tax.\r\n\r\nSearching the Internet looking for \u201cBurglars torch car\u201d one sees a very common MO.  The burglars break into an empty house and locate the car keys.  The house is then looted and the swag is put into the car.  Later the car is torched to eliminate fingerprints and DNA evidence.\r\n\r\nThe writer therefore regards MID and SORN as being UNFIT FOR PURPOSE as they are merely Nu Labour Stealth Taxes.\r\n\r\nThe writer considers that the fines should be abolished or reduced to a nominal fee such as \u00a310.",
