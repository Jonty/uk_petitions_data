        "additional_details": "Fuel Bills are currently high and present a concern for Pensioners who will not know how big their bill will be. By setting a Cap it removes that worry\r\n\r\nThe limit could be say \u00a360 a month so that they know their bill will never exceed \u00a360 for a month. If it is less they pay the actual amount.\r\n\r\nThe cost of this scheme could be kept down by scrapping the existing \u00a3200 a year fuel allowance and the severe weather payments\r\n\r\nThe scheme could also be restrict by income possible restricted to those whose income does not exceed the age related allowance of \u00a324000 a year\r\n\r\nSavings would also be made by the NHS as hopefully this scheme should ensure pensioners properly heat their homes in the winter without having to worry about the bill\r\n",
