        "additional_details": "In light of the analysis of background to the currently used BMI figure described here: http://bit.ly/VJNKCO it is clear that the current formula, which uses an exponent of 2, rather than 2.5, is prone to identify tall people as obese when they are not, and fails to identify obese people who are short.  The only reason for using an exponent of 2 was that it made calculations simpler \u2013 relevant in the 19th century, but hardly so today!\r\n\r\nGiven the importance of obesity as a health issue in the modern world, it is vital that people get clear and accurate information about their weight, and whether or not they have a weight problem.\r\n\r\nWe therefore petition the government to instruct the NHS, NICE and other UK organisations that use the BMI to identify weight issues, to move to the use of a revised formula that more accurately reflects the relationship between height and weight in the normal adult population, and to also raise this concern with the WHO.",
