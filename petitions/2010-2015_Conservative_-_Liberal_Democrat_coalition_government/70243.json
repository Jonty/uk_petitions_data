        "additional_details": "Dear Right Honourable members of the Cabinet,\r\n\r\nHundreds of Thousands of Hongkongers are now taking part in the pro-democracy Umbrella Revolution movement in Hong Kong, in light of a recent decision ruling out full and real universal suffrage for 2017 elections by Chinese Parliament. They have been staying on the streets since last Saturday night (27/9).\r\n\r\nAs full democracy in Hong Kong was solemnly promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration which Britain was a signatory, WE, by this our humble Petition, request Her Majesty's Government to uphold Britain's duties to monitor:\r\n1) the implementation of the Joint Declaration, and;\r\n2) the rule of law, and;\r\n3) protection of civil rights and freedoms\r\nin Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nWe also appeal to Her Majesty's government to make it clear to the Chinese central authorities that any effort to crackdown peaceful demonstrations by force will be strongly opposed and severely punished in the international community.\r\n\r\nThank you",
