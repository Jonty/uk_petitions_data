        "additional_details": "Sat again today in approx 3 miles of traffic queuing to pass through the Dartford tolls.\r\nOn passing through I saw roughly the same amount of traffic trying to pass in the other direction.\r\nThe charge was to be abolished once the bridge had been paid for.\r\nTo date it hasn't ! Why ?\r\nI assume it's because it generates thousands of pounds on a daily basis for someone.\r\nThe government, the French owner.\r\nThe M25 is a major traffic artery around London with regular, long delays caused by the tolls.\r\nIt's about time someone realised free flowing traffic was more important that profits.\r\n",
