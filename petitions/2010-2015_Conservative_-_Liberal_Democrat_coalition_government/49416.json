Secret societies have infiltrated the very foundations of our society, in secrecy, through secret oaths and secret alliances.\r\n\r\nMedia, politics, judicial system, law enforcement, military, space organisation, science & medicine, education, religion to give examples, have fallen to secret societies who work in the shadows.",
