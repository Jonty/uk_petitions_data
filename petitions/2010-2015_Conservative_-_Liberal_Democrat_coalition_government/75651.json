Where I live we have quite a few potholes, but will it effect my life, forever? No. Whereas area's of life like poverty and abuse, can and do effect people's lives forever! I think we spend an 'ok' amount on the health sector, but not enough on poverty and abuse, why are the government missing this out? We are a very wealthy country, so why is poverty high? Now on to abuse, there should more help and support to children who are abused to be able to escape from just really non-loving parents, who don't really care. You could you know a child who is currently being abused, they cover it up. You could know the parents? I think that the reason that the government does so little is because they think that there are so many charities, which there are, but not well funded. The government need to change this.
