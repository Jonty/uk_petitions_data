        "additional_details": "We currently have to pay a fixed amount of road tax per car per year.  We also hear of complex \"black box\" pay as you go road tax ideas.  However black boxes are expensive, and will require a huge number of people to run the scheme, costing tax payers money.  Why not simply abolish road tax and put some \"road tax\" on fuel.  If you use the roads more, you use more fuel thus pay more tax.  If your car produces more CO2 you use more fuel so pay more tax, if you have an eco car you pay less.  It also gives people the choice of what to pay, not a fixed overhead.  It would also be impossible for people to avoid road tax and a huge amount of money could be saved as we wouldn't need all the people who sort out road tax, and chase up people who dont pay it etc.  We would also save paper, postage, and a general headache for everyone having to remember when it is up for renewal.
