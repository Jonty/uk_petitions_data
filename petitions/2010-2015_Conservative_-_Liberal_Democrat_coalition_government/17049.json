        "additional_details": "If as a worker are given private health insurance as a perk of your job, why should you be taxed on it ? It takes pressure off the NHS and in a time of austerity, it makes sense not to tax such a perk.\r\n\r\nSecondly, should anyone purchase private health insurance privately, they should be given extra tax credits as they are not a burden on the NHS.\r\n\r\nThis petition is calling for tax credits for anyone purchasing private health insurance and an end to taxing individuals who receive private health insurance as part of their employment package.",
