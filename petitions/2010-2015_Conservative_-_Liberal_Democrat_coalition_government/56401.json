        "additional_details": "Researchers have released a report saying there has been a \"50 percent increase in emergency room admissions and deaths related to E coli\" in cities that instituted a ban on plastic bags. Reusable grocery bags are breeding grounds for bacteria that cause intestinal diseases. Ban adherents can sell the gullible on the \"benefits\" of eliminating plastic bags but will deliberately overlook or defend the cost of human lives and suffering caused by the ban. The truth is, not everyone will understand or be able to wash reusable bags as they should and, according to this scientific report, will suffer or even die. And here is my case for FREE PLASTIC BAGS for everyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
