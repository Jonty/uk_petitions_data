        "action": "Say NO to stoppage of Heathrow runway alternation",
        "additional_details": "The government when in opposition promised no change to Heathrow runway alternation. In November the government has announced there will be a trial using both runways to clear backlogs of planes in the sky. This must not be allowed. Anyone fighting the expansion of Heathrow knows that the airport will use this facility very sparingly until the trial ends. When the trial ends and the Government looks at how many times the two runways have been used they will see very little usage. BUT once full permission has been given suddenly it will be used all the time. That is how Heathrow works.Our half day of peace will be gone forever. Please support this petition ",
