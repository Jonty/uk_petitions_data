        "additional_details": "I am starting a petition to raise awareness of bullying in schools, and show the true effects of what bullying does to young people. No young person deserves to be bullied and by letting the public know that bullying is a lot more serious that people originally thought, we can help young people and stop things from escalating. I hope to get more clubs and support groups started, to show young people that they are not alone, and they do have support. Thank you.",
