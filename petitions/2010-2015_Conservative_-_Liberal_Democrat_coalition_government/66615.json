The individual is entitled to a life free from company rules, guidance and policy.\r\n\r\nCompanies and employers can find objection in most everything thesedays and by allowing such policies not only are you allowing companies to effectively say what is acceptable behaviour for a person off the clock but also creating an opportunity where significant stress and unemployment can occur.\r\n\r\nIt is an overeach by companies that should be stopped immediately.",
