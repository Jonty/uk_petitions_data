        "additional_details": "The lottery prises make no social sense. One person wins tens of millions of pounds that they can't spend and the rest get close to nothing. The winning system as it stands have a harmful effect on society because it increases the wealth and social gaps in society tremendously. I propose that the lottery system should help more people who need it rather than give one person more than they will ever need! This can be done by capping the top prise to a reasonable six figure sum and increase the lower category of wins and prises. This way the lottery would benefit more people and serve the society as a whole.",
