        "additional_details": "There is currently little regulation on the sale of fireworks to the general public - if you are 18 or over it is perfectly legal for you to purchase fireworks from a licensed outlet in the UK with no training or experience in the use of pyrotechnics. There are no risk assessments or health and safety requirements for people to set off fireworks close to houses, individuals, public spaces and pets.\r\n\r\nGiven the dangers of handling (albeit minor) explosive devices, and the likelihood of misuse, it would surely be pertinent to introduce the requirement for some kind of licence to be issued to an individual before they can purchase fireworks or to ban the sale to the general public. There are many organised displays that carry the relevant health and safety requirements and the displays are usually far more impressive.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to be able to buy a box of fireworks from the supermarket with our weekly shop.",
