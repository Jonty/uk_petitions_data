There is no single action that can deal with this, it requires a standard  to be included in the legal terms of reference for every body and everybody to act with principle and not just for gain or for other narrow or selfish motives.\r\n\r\nNot only do we now have rioters in our streets and litter accumulating long term in too many places, we have businesses and even some government departments sometimes knowingly acting in an unethical manner. Many companies that we used to believe acted honourably invade our privacy. Others shamelessly confuse and trick us in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nIt is not only at the margins that reform is needed but across the board.\r\n",
