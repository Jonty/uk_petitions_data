        "additional_details": "Most transgendered individuals suffer abuse which often goes unreported due to not being taken seriously by authorities and attitudes towards the issues trans people face.\r\n\r\nOften fresh start in a new area is vital toward the wellbeing of a trans person, the ongoing treatment, to recover from surgical procedures and to have some where safe live.\r\n\r\nRecently more and more Councils are however adapting current policies which state that if someone has no local connection to the area they are applying for housing in, then the Council can refuse to let you apply for housing there. This goes against the human rights of transgendered people.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call on the Government to make sure Councils exempt Transgendered persons from these most damaging restrictions about 'local connection' and also do so while taking allegations of abuse and harassment against transsexuals seeking housing to escape violence and suffering more seriously.
