(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9964767/Iain-Duncan-Smith-I-could-live-on-53-per-week.html)\r\n\r\nWe the people call on him to prove his assertions by living on no more than \u00a353 per week, for a period of at least 2 months.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this will allow him to see in a realistic manner, what his reforms to the welfare system will have on those affected by the changes to this system.\r\n\r\nWe would also call on him to live in rented accommodation with at least one spare bedroom, and be deducted the necessary amount from his income,  so that he may feel the impact of the \"spare room subsidy\" introduced on 1st April 2013 by the DWP.
