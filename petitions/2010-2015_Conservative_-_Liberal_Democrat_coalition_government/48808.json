        "additional_details": "I am requesting justice for all animals across the country. The RSPCA should be banned from having animals. Any animal in their clutches should be turned over to rescue centres or animal sanctuaries that home for life. The RSPCA destroy perfectly good dogs, healthy dogs, problem dogs, boisterous dogs. They destroy animals for no good reason. They also lack the ability to know animal phsychology. The hurt people using tactics to take animals. There is no victim support provided. Save the animals now.",
