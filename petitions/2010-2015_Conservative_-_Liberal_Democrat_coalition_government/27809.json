        "additional_details": "An airport on the Isle of Grain will completely blight the lives of people living in both Essex and Kent who will have to endure excess aircraft noise and traffic on the already full to bursting roads.  The Thames crossings cannot cope now with the enormous traffic loads.  The Essex and North Kent areas already suffer with London City Airport and Gatwick traffic.\r\n\r\nThis also will be devastating to the RSPB locations on the flight path of these aircraft, causing untold damage to the environment and could possibly be dangerous to aircraft overhead with bird strikes.",
