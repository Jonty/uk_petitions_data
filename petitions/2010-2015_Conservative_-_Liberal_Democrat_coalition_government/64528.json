On that basis the Judge, who was appointed to office by the former Lord Chancellor, stuck out the case.  The Appeal Judge was also appointed by the former Lord Chancellor, he struck out an appeal that he had misled the tribunal.\r\n\r\nNow a whistle blow has come forward to say the former Lord Chancellor did receive the written complaint and he withheld them from disclosure because it was embarrassing to him.  We petition that the former Lord Chancellor be investigated as any other citizen would be and if appropriate charged with perverting the course of justice.",
