The older generation of our society have manners and respect, and more importantly had respect for themselves. With the armed forces numbers being reduced it would be more effective to send any person age 16-21 who is unemployed and not studying to serve our country and learn real skills that they can use for a lifetime. I worry about my sons growing up and having no aspirations, and lack of self respect. We need to address this issue soon and try and break the downwards spiral our country is falling in to.",
