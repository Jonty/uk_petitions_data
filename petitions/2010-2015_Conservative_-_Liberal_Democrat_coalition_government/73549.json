        "additional_details": "All disabled Blue Badge holders should be able to park for free in any car park in the country! Regardless of available disabled bays or locality. Hospitals we have to visit regularly now charge for parking. Local councils charge for parking if a disabled bay is not available, regardless of whether we have a blue badge or not. This is unfair and discriminatory! We have to pay for our badge but hardly receive any benefit for having it these days! Out of 80 parking bays, approximately 4 will be available for disabled patrons.",
