        "additional_details": "The cervical screening age in England needs to be lowered. Scotland and Wales start from the age of 20 why not England??\r\n\r\nCervical cancer is a cancer that affects young women, so starting to look for it with smear tests at 25 is simply too late. I've heard countless stories of women going to doctors with symptoms of cervical cancer only to be refused cervical smears because of the age limit. Many of whom have gone onto to find our that they do have cervical cancer but its been detected to late. This needs to stop, we do not have the right to mess with people's lives. If someone turned up at the doctors showing symptoms of a stomach ulcer, prostate cancer etc they would be sent for further tests. Why should someone with cervical cancer symptoms be treated any different especially when it's one of the only cancers that can be prevented when caught early.\r\n\r\n",
