        "additional_details": "Many individuals have passed away after travelling on, or being pedestrians along the A20, the most recent being the young Amy Clark (Ashford) and Rob Wiltshire (Maidstone). It is a common belief that street lights should have been installed along the most 'tricky' parts of the A20 for a long time now. It has also been widely rumoured that the Department for transport/Council will not act on this issue, until more individuals have died because of it. My proposal is for street lights to be placed along the most misleading and winding parts of the A20 spanning from Ashford to Maidstone and back. With these lights pedestrians will stand a better chance of being seen by traffic, drivers will be also be able to see where the road meets the pavement and be in better stead to judge the peculiar winds and turns in the road when driving at night. Even if street lights are only placed on the most dangerous parts of the road a massive impact will still be made to many lives. Thank you. ",
