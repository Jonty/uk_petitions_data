        "additional_details": "This petition is requesting that the Government may take action to start investing in research with international partners, to find a replacement for oil as a form of energy and a substance which makes up most products in our lives. It's unfortunate that in the future, our supply of oil will emptied and we need to make sure that an effective replacement is sought for generations of people in the future. If we don't take action, we may not be able to research and develop ways quickly in which we can tackle this challenge facing humankind.",
