        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the UK Government to do everything in its power to protect the beautiful and valuable greenbelt around Cheltenham from inappropriate development. The largest incursion on greenbelt land that the UK has ever seen has been proposed in North West Cheltenham. If the developers go ahead and built 4500 houses on the greenbelt here it would cause traffic chaos, exacerbate the serious flooding that\u2019s occurred in the area, stretch sewerage systems to their limits and beyond, destroy much loved fields and hedgerows and blight Cheltenham with urban sprawl and overcrowding. The Government must insist that brownfield sites and small sites that benefit rural settlements are built first before even considering the destruction of the greenbelt. ",
