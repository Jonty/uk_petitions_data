        "action": "Stop Ian Duncan Smith Rolling out Prepaid Benefit Cards",
        "additional_details": "Ian Duncan Smith wants to introduce Pre-paid benefits cards, which will have to be redeemed for food only, and only in predetermined shops, namely Tesco and Asda. This means that they cannot shop at cheaper places such as Aldi/Lidl or markets to stretch their meagre funds as far as possible. This is a major breach of Human Rights and takes away any dignity, ability to manage money, save, or pay the many other bills that come up. Childrens schools/nurseries need cash for snacks/trips etc, and in other places in the world where this is in force, these cards do not allow the purchase of  soap, but can be used to buy soda or chocolate?! We cannot allow this demeaning, and humiliating practice to come into force. We cannot treat every unemployed/sick/vulnerable person like criminals, removing their rights to a life without harrassment or judgement! Poor people deserve dignity and autonomy, and the right to choose where to shop, without their every move being tracked!! ",
