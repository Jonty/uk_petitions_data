        "additional_details": "This practice must be stopped and councils and housing associations should have powers to either enforce exchanges go ahead or those persons who continuously abuse the mutual exchange system in any capacity either via any website or council are penalised and prevented from applying to transfer their property via mutual exchange. It is wrong, unjust, unfair and disheartening for tenants to be messed around by others who are not actively seeking to move, therefore they shouldn't waste people's time. So many tenants are really suffering and going through this stress and heartache and housing departments across the UK need to do more to protect genuine tenants who need to move by this method which they themselves recommend as it's the most quickest and efficient way to move to different towns and other parts of the country.",
