Worse still, the new mapping software is not fit for purpose. This was highlighted by CEO Tim Cook's public apology to users.\r\n\r\nWe request the government takes action to persuade Apple to offer a choice to consumers between Apple's own mapping system, and the previous software run by Google. Apple should not block other companies providing services on their platform for their own corporate gains, and to the detriment of consumers.",
