        "additional_details": "The point in Milton Keynes is a huge part of the new city's history. It was the first multiplex cinema to be built within the UK and has become an iconic building to Milton Keynes that people do not forget.\r\n\r\nIt has been under untilised for many years, but that does not mean it should be knocked down. There are many things that could be done as an alternative.\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly that this building must stay, please sign the petition with your support. Does the city really need more of the same chain restaurants and shops?\r\n\r\nThis building is iconic and must stay!!",
