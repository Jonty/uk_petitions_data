        "additional_details": "There are currently proposals to reduce the speed limit to 60mph on the M1 for 30 miles. This is being done to reduce pollution, but is a total miss-use of the managed motorway technology.\r\n\r\nIt will frustrate drivers and may actually make the road more dangerous. This won't prevent a lot of bad drivers continuing to drive at 90-100 mph, but with them now arriving fast behind drivers doing 60.\r\n\r\nUnreasonable speed limits cause more people to ignore them. Speed limits should not be abused for other means. They are for safety. If they are abused they lose meaning and safety drops.\r\n\r\nMost of all, this is just irritating!\r\n\r\nPrevent this happening.\r\n\r\nhttp://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25619914",
