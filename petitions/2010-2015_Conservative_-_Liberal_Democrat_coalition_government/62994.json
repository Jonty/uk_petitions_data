        "additional_details": "Having travelled around the U.K. visiting various cities for shopping, sight seeing, leisure I enjoy going to my favourite restaurant TGI Fridays for a bite to eat. I find it appalling that a large city like Kingston Upon Hull does not offer its locals plus tourists to our lovely city this sort of place to eat. Imagine the amount of tourists we are going to have in the city having recently being voted the city of culture 2017 and we can't even offer them the sumptuous taste of a Jack Daniels burger! So come on everybody let's get this out there and bring TGI Fridays to Hull!!!!",
