Director  Danny Boyle is set to include 12 horses, 10 chickens, 70 sheep and nine geese when he transforms the arena into a \"British meadow\". What on earth possessed him to think this was a good idea? The Olympic stadium holds 80,000 people and will be packed for the opening ceremony. The noise, the lights, fireworks and the unnatural environment will be terrifying for those animals. This is pure exploitation and is completely unnecessary. If this is the best Boyle can come up with then they should get someone else for the job. Demand that the government put a stop to this wanton animal abuse by removing all live animals from the opening ceremony. ",
