The only way to stop him is to take away his office, freedom of movement and power base by sending him to the Hague for trial, based on the evidence of the last few months.- including among other offences:\r\n\r\n1. Human Rights Abuses of his own population- plenty well documented violent cases exist, and once he is safely behind bars, plenty will come forward to testify once his absence makes it possible to hold un-oppressed elections in Russia.\r\n\r\n2.Breach of sovereignty of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\n3.Breach of the Budapest memorandum at which Russia agreed to respect the territorial integrity of the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThus we must immediately apply for an international arrest warrant in support of these aims.",
