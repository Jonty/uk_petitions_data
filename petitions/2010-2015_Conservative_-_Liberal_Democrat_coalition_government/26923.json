        "additional_details": "This is a petition to set up development of a super laser as a  long term project to deal with the worlds problem of orbital space debris. As such this offers many possible benefits and is a major leap in abilities and technology. Costs are on the order of \u00a310 to 100 million for development, and approximately \u00a310 billion for construction, most of which could be recouped from the international community or recovered through commercial ventures. - - -\r\nThe primary purpose is to destroy space debris and provide a freer safer orbital environment around the Earth for future space infrastructure.  The project also has various other uses which raise its value substantially. - As a push laser for laser-lifter spacecraft. For use in power generation research as in nuclear fusion or in more experimental projects (such as a \u2018Quantum Converter\u2019), or in other more general research. Finally it offers a ready mechanism for pushing meteorites that pose a threat into safer orbits.",
