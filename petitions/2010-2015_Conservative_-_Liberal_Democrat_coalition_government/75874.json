        "additional_details": "Today Thursday 18th March, the current Chancellor of the Exchequer announced \"Trebling in \u00a315m fund for church roof appeals\"  (SKY NEWS 2015).  This would take funding from public purse to circa \u00a345M.  As an atheist I am against using my tax contributions towards this end and believe that if these cult institutions need roofs then they should raise their own funds from the people that wish to use them. I call upon all my fellow enlightened to sign this e-petition and prevent this allocation",
