        "additional_details": "The current format of bi-lingual road signs in Wales is confusing for both English and Welsh speakers and even more so for overseas visitors.\r\nThe adoption of different fonts or colours for the Welsh version would make it much easier for road users to identify the version they wish to read and thus contribute towards an improvement in road safety.\r\nIn Brittany, the Breton version is italicised whilst the French version is in normal text.\r\nI would urge the Welsh Assembly Government to progressively introduce a similar scheme in Wales. To minimise cost, the scheme should only be adopted for new and replacement signs.",
