        "additional_details": "Further to recent government policy proposal in respone to Dilnot report some inequities warrant further consideration:\r\n1) Care home residents currently not qualifying for free care should not be subsidising council/state funded residents. The council/state negotiated fee should be available to paying residents at the same level of service.\r\n2) The free care threshold should trigger from full costs, not just the care element, as the current 75k care cost threshold would seem to equate to six years, which is too long.  Alternatively a chargeable period limit should be agreed at the council rate, before care becomes free. The time basis would be clearer for all and regionally neutral.\r\n3) Care homes should be not for profit.",
