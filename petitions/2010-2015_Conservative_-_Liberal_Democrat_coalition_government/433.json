        "additional_details": "British Telecom is the sole provider of conventional Fixed Line telephony system and ADSL service in UK.\r\nTelecommunications Act 1984 forced BT to abolish its monopoly but BT discovered loophole within that Act and simply became \"BT Group\" with BT Retail as its retail wing however other so called providers (Sky, Talk Talk, Virgin National, etc. have to refer to BT group and buy services from them on wholesale basis which means other companies are now simply BT Group's resellers.\r\nThis monopoly allows BT to treat customers with an unprofessional and borderline spiteful manner and for some reason politicians and even media keep very quiet about this matter.\r\nLet us force this Government to finally force BT to sell majority of its infrastructure to competing companies who wish to have a presence in UK Telecommunications market.and offer a much better, much cheaper and a lot more honest service to the public",
