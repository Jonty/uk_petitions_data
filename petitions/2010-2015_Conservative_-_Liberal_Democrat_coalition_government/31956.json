        "additional_details": "The fact that this issue has been through the courts and back to the House of Commons does not justify the action of the Coalition Government in changing the indexation of pensions in the public services.  This change will remove all trust in future governments when they promise anything to their employees.  The RPI was the measure of indexation for 38 years before this change.  That is a working lifetime.",
