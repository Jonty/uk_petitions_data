        "additional_details": "The TVL \"enforcement\" campaign is deliberately designed to levy distress without there being proper grounds to believe a licence is required at a particular address before sending nasty letters scaring people into thinking there is an ongoing court action against them.\r\n\r\nCapita is a private company and they are running the TV Licensing \"service\" in the same way as a kneecap-finance payday loan lender. It's criminal.\r\n\r\nThey are wasting money on these letters.\r\n\r\nThe money used to send the evil correspondence would better be spent on TV programming instead.\r\n\r\nIf the letters were more appropriate, perhaps more people who require a licence would actually buy one, because I suppose there are a good many people who are so offended by the nature of the demand notices that they choose to completely disregard it, as any right-thinking person would, given the tone and content of the notices.",
