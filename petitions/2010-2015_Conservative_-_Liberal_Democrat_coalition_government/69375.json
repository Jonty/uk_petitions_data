They are having to beg for more money and most will be made homeless.  They have worked for years to buy their leases and they are the kind of people we need in Britain - industrious and creating a good economy.\r\nWe want a debate and a new law to ensure that they receive the full replacement value of a property in the same area of the same size and number of rooms so they can stay where they have lived and not suffer detriment.",
