        "additional_details": "3-months business rates relief for small independent retailers. The Government should be encouraging pop up units across Britain. This is potentially a sustainable solution to revitalising our empty high streets. Pop ups are the future breeding ground for next generation of Independent Retailers. The Government should offer business rates relief for qualifying small business tenants. We recommend a qualifying small business tenant can claim up to 3 months rates relief once per calendar year. The current business rates relief scheme allows landlords to qualify for up to 3 months rates relief if they let empty units BUT the small business tenants are still responsible for paying rates if the rateable value is above \u00a36000. This system is totally one sided because it does not encourage small businesses to rent empty shops. The suggested scheme encourages both the landlord and tenant to fill empty units.",
