        "additional_details": "Teenagers sitting their English Language GCSE in the 2013/14 academic year will see marks from a completed assessment on speaking and listening will not count towards their final grade, essentially downgrading the importance of this key communication skill in the overall GCSE.\r\n\r\nControlled assessments for this key skill had been due to count for 20% of the overall GCSE grade, but now will not count for any, a margin that will surely cause grade slippage for many pupils and a repeat of the marking debacle we saw in 2012.\r\n\r\nWhile I support the overall drive to protect standards in our education system, I find this grossly unfair to the pupils who have already completed their assessments. Let us not punish our children with poorly timed implementation of this change.\r\n\r\nI call for the speaking and listening assessments results to be reinstated towards the 2013/14 English Language GCSE grading.\r\n\r\n",
