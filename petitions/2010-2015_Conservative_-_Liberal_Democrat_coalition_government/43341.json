A bond that is holy, pure and sacred.\r\n\r\nThe current fashion for pretending that God does not exist is now accompanied by a governments drive to change a holy and God-ordained sacrament by turning it into something that God declares an abomination that of Gay Marriage.\r\n\r\nGod will not be mocked. To introduce a law to allow gay couples to marry is an offensive assault against God and the church by changing the meaning of the word Marriage.\r\n\r\nCivil partnerships are accepted or at least tolerated by the majority and that should be it.\r\n\r\nGod and religion needs to be respected. Governments should concentrate on politics NOT religion or changing the meaning of words.",
