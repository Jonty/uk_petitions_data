        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, appreciate the need for some developments in GCSE and A level education; however petition against the government's planned reforms including scrapping of January modules and the reintroduction of terminal exams.\r\n\r\nThese reforms will exacerbate the, already intense, pressure on students and prevent many from achieving their full capabilities. The changes will disadvantage young people who have missed school due to circumstances such as illness, bereavement or disability and take away the opportunity for students to become accustomed to the huge differences between the GCSE and  A level system.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we feel that these reforms do not reflect the views of those who partook in the A level reform consultation, which states that \u2018all stakeholders strongly supported retaining the AS qualification and its relationship with A2\u2019.",
