They are paying subsidised social housing rent rates at the expense of the tax payer (See the new Centre for London House-keeping report which suggests that there are 125000 London households alone that earn above London average wage). There are probably a further significant number of households with extensive undeclared income.\r\n\r\nCircumstances of many who start our needing rent subsidies change and therefore should be reviewed regularly.\r\n\r\nThe government should look at ways to ensure that council households that can afford to pay commercial rent rates do so.\r\n",
