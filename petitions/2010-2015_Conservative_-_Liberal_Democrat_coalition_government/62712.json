        "additional_details": "It has been brought to my attention by the family of Ryan  Brookhouse that there is a legislation that prevents babies who are under 2 months old from having their organs donated.\r\n\r\nSigning this petition you will be supporting the UK to come in line with the rest of the EU, America and Australia on organ donation rules.\r\n\r\nMany babies who die under the age of 2 months could be organ doners and save many young babies lives.\r\n\r\nI wish the Government to change existing legislation so that the organs of babies under 2 months old can be donated as many are going to waste and lives like Ryan's could be made better and saved.\r\n\r\nPlease see Ryan's facebook update page:\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RyanBrookhouse2013",
