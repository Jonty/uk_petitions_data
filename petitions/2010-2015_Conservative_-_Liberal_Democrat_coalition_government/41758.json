        "additional_details": "The newspapers claim that Speaker Bercow has undermined the independent expenses monitor IPSA and this has led to the resignations of 4 key board members. Mr Bercow\u2019s actions could be interpreted as Gerrymandering, and should be resisted by the UK electorate.  If Mr Bercow does not allow truly independent board members then we should vote to create a new IPSA  board with full independence, outside of the Speaker's jurisdiction.",
