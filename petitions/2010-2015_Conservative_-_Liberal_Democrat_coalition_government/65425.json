        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nFollowing the generation of nearly 2000 signatures in an attempt to keep the Oving Traffic Lights open, Oving Parish Council have now submitted a Planning Application to Chichester District Council (CDC) to remove the proposed permanent closure of the Oving Traffic Lights from the Outline Planning Consent granted in May 2013 to Hanbury Properties Ltd for the Shopwyke Lakes housing development. We are very keen to work with the CDC Planning Department to remove this condition and prevent the Highways Agency from closing this crossing; the most reliable and safe crossing of the A27 Chichester Bypass. Closure will isolate the residents and businesses to the southeast of Chichester, both in Oving Parish and beyond. Closure is certain to add to the already congested traffic on the Bypass. If you support this Planning Application please sign this petition in order to stimulate government support for the application.",
