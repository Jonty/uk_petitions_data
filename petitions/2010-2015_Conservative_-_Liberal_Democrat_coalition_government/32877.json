        "additional_details": "This e-petition is based on the view that primary school pupils are too young to understand differences in christian denominations. It is proposed that a primary school's religious education and culture should be based on a general christian primary school curriculum approved by the General Synod.\r\n\r\nIn particular it is proposed that the words \"Roman Catholic\",  \"Catholic\", \"Protestant\" or other christian denomination be removed from all christian faith primary school descriptions / titles in the UK and replaced with \"A Christian Primary School\" only instead.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed that this petition be extended to secondary schools. It is thought that pupils / parents entering the secondary school system are in a position to meaningfully discuss the issues and make a judgement that primary school children cannot - this decision should be left until older.\r\n   ",
