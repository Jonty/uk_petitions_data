Therefore they would be moving  onto the doorstep of that football club which is  part of the reason Barry Hearne has said should stop West Ham from moving there.\r\nIf they are allowed to move there would they not have to change their name as they would no longer be in Leyton or indeed Waltham Forest. What would they call themselves then?",
