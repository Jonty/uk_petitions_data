        "additional_details": "Speed cameras may or may not improve road safety.  However they certainly generate large revenues for the police.  When a police force is considering the location of a new speed camera they need to balance the potential benefit to road safety against the revenue generated at each location.  This petition proposes to remove this ulterior motive by requiring the police to donate all revenue from speed cameras to either independent charity or central government.  They will then use speed cameras only to improve road safety.",
