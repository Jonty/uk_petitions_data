Bouncers/nightlife marshalls to be placed inside of pubs and clubs not just on doors, to be fully trainined on how to deal with aggressive behaviour and how to calm a building aggressive or conforntation situation, alongside CCTV monitoring  - to create 'the big brother effect'.  More awareness of the effects of drunken violence from alcohol, in schools, young offenders, media advertising. On the bigger scale, laws to be passed on regulating alcohol,  maybe labelling glasses with unit measures on the side? Regulating prices as to avoid the binge drinking culture.  Fines/cautions given for drunken aggression? Tougher/definate sentancing for drunken violence related attacks (Full sentances to be completed/ no early release for good behaviour or if plead guilty)",
