        "action": "To reduce the speed limit to 40 mph from the national speed limit  on the B2099 from the railway bridge to the Frant end of road.",
        "additional_details": "After 2 deaths and 40 accidents on this stretch of road over the past 10 years,impacting on drivers,passengers,pedestrians and cyclists, Highways refuse to reduce the national speed limit . There has been a recent survey on this stretch of road, which again refused to reduce the speed limit. Typically cars before flipping, turn 360 degrees so that they are endangering drivers and passengers travelling up and down Wadhurst Road. Councillor Bob Tidy MBE, County Councillor for Wadhurst is prepared to support our petition to reduce the speed limit on this stretch of road. We intend to present it at the Committee meeting on 4th December.\r\nPlease add your signature to the petition and encourage anyone else you know who uses this road to sign too.\r\n",
