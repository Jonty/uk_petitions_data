Horses that are extremely underweight, horses without passports and microchips,  horses are stood in pens without water in hot weather, foals without bedding and some horses are beaten while awaiting their fate, we have evidence to back up the above.  In a lot of cases there is no welfare officers attending the sales to check all of the above. This needs to change, please sign our petition and help male a difference. ",
