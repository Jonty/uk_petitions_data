        "additional_details": "This is a petition in regards to the works being carried out in Hackbridge. Works began in November to renovate shop fronts and create additional parking and were due to be completed in April, however, works are still being carried out creating extremely bad traffic because of temporary lights and poor traffic control during the school and rush hours. Not only does this result in many pupils in local schools being late but also since all the zebra crossings have been removed it is extremely dangerous and hard to cross the roads safely especially at these times. Please sign this petition to get back the zebra crossings and make this road safe again!",
