        "additional_details": "The UK has seen a significant rise in heart disease, diabetes and obesity. A well researched and documented contributing factor is unhealthy food consumption.\r\n\r\nA consistent system combining colour coding and nutritional information was introduced in the UK a few years ago.\r\n\r\nThe colour coding offered a universally recognised traffic light system that provided consumers with a quick indicator to healthier options e.g. low in salt, sugar and saturated fat. Adults and children in the UK have been educated about the traffic light system and are able to make clearer informed healthier decisions based on these 'quick glance' indicators.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the scheme is voluntary with industries known for their unhealthy products lobbying against the system.\r\n\r\nI want the government to enforce traffic light labelling on all food and beverages sold in the UK ensuring all companies adhere to the system.
