But you'd not realise the Spanish government appreciate this by the way they are behaving at the moment over Gibraltar.  By putting a tax on Spanish holidays/flights it will deter British people from going to Spain for their holidays in preference for somewhere else without taxation.  This potentially further harmful blow to Spain's economy might convince Spain's government to behave and perhaps even stop contesting the Sovereignty of Gibraltar.    ",
