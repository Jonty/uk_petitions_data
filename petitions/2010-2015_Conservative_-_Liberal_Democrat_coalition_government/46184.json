        "action": "Cease cash payments for benefits, introduce vouchers and drugs tests.",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to pay benefits in vouchers redeemable for only non-essential items, claimants must pass regular drugs tests.\r\n\r\nThe current system has proven too open to abuse.\r\n\r\nThe issuing of vouchers should replace any benefits currently paid in cash, allowing claimants to purchase all that is essential for a healthy lifestyle. Such as fuels, food and clothes. Anything extra, such as alcohol, satellite TV, holidays, drugs and games computers, can be purchased once they are back to work and earning those luxury items.\r\n\r\nTo avoid any potential human rights or embarrassment issues, vouchers should take the style of a gift card. Allowing easy payments at all service providers, but only to those that are authorised.\r\n\r\nClaimants must be randomly drugs tested, just as our Armed Forces are. Failure will result in cessation of benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese changes will improve the economy, the attitudes and health of benefit claimants.",
