Naturalists and scientists alike have come out to give their opinion that THIS CULL WILL NOT WORK.\r\n\r\nI call upon the Government to pay attention to the e-peition submitted by Dr Brian May, which at last viewing had over 191,000 signatures.  Should this not happen, I call upon everyone who has signed this petition to also sign this one being created now - to say that SHOULD THIS CULL HAPPEN, THE GOVERNMENT WILL LOSE VOTES.\r\n\r\nMaybe - just maybe - they'll listen to that!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
