        "additional_details": "Many three year university courses are grossly overvalued and poor value for money.\r\n\r\nWith the impending hike in tuition fees, the government should ensure students receive the highest levels of teaching, competitive with other global institutions.\r\n\r\nI therefore suggest condensing the majority of three year courses into two years on the future annual tariff. This would ensure students are constantly engaged with their courses which will lead to higher academic performance, lower drop-out rates and a smaller burden of debt for the average student.",
