        "additional_details": "We are campaigning for the central funding of a national structured education programme for diabetics. We believe that a properly funded programme would ensure that the highest common denominator applies to the treatment of diabetic patients. The \u201cdiabetes in adults quality standard\u201d proposes \u2018structured education programmes that fulfil the nationally agreed criteria from the time of diagnosis\u2019. Studies show clinically and statistically significant improvement in glycaemic control, without increased severe hypoglycaemia; quality of life and treatment satisfaction resulting from one course which also pays for itself within 5 years according to an economic evaluation. National funding for structured education for diabetics would mean that we can put the \u2018National\u2019 back into the NHS instead of patients being subject to a post code lottery with very few diabetics having access to formal structured education.
