        "additional_details": "Farm subsidies support sheep grazing in otherwise unproductive upland areas. These areas where previously forested and have been proven to have played a significant role in controlling flooding further downstream. It is only through subsidies that these areas remain economic for farming. The government is struggling ti find the funds to pay for adequate flood defences. By redirecting the farming susidies to pay for reforestation of upland areas you provide a rich habitat for wildlife returning these areas to a more natural state and also provide significant defence for flooding.",
