        "additional_details": "The aim of this petition is to preserve Birmingham University's iconic 1950s redbrick main library building from demolition. The existing redbrick main library building could be preserved for use as additional student study space once the new main library building has been built to the west of it. The current plan is that the site of the old main library will not be built on and will form part of a larger green open space at the centre of the campus. However the redbrick 1950s main library complements the original early 1900s redbrick university building, which it looks across to over an already existing open green space. The original southern block and central block of the 1950s redbrick main library should be preserved. The later ugly extension to the north should be demolished, thus recreating the original 1950s redbrick main library. The interior space should be redeveloped as student study space, thus providing additional study space once the new main library has been built.",
