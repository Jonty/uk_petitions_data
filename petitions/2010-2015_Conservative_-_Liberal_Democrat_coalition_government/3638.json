        "additional_details": "This is an invitation for the government of the United Kingdom to consider the status of internships. The number of unpaid internships has climbed in recent years, which is very worrying given that more employers are illegally using such internships for free labor.\r\nIt is true to say that at present, the UK government is doing nothing to stop illegal internships. Nobody wants to work for free, yet thousands upon thousands of college students do it every year. They\u2019re not doing it out of the kindness of their hearts or because its for a good cause. They do it for \u201cexperience.\u201d Many internships offer fantastic learning opportunities, but more often than not the best internships also happen to be paid. Most internships offered by organizations in the UK are unpaid and breach national minimum wage laws.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and help raise awareness for change.",
