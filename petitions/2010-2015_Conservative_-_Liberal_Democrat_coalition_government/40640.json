Rail companies have done nothing over the last decade except watch profits flood in, despite eye-watering fare increases, as there has been no improvement in passenger unit cost over a decade. These facts are laid out in the damning McNulty Report.\r\nRail companies exploit weak regulatory regimes and FirstGroup made \u00a35m six-monthly profit in 2011 from its rail business alone. In Scotland, with a single franchise, rail travel is appalling, overpriced and insufferable, especially to commuters, despite record sums of taxpayers money invested in infrastructure in Scotland.",
