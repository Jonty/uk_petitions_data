        "additional_details": "This is a petition against police officers who consider it to be ok to blame the victim of a crime because she is wearing a dress.\r\n\r\nMore needs to be done to draw attention to the fact that it is the problem of the attacker and not that of the victim.\r\n\r\nUntil the justice system understands and addresses this issue, women will continue to be made to feel as if they have \"brought it on themselves\".\r\n\r\nI myself was hit by a man in a club and told by a police officer that as my friend and I are \"both pretty girls\" we should pretty much expect this kind of attention. If I were out in jeans and in daylight and this had happened then things would have been treated very differently. Location and appearance should not make a difference.\r\n\r\nThis type of thing happens all too often.",
