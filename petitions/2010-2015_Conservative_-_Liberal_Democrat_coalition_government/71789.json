        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, seek nomination for Jeff Lynne (Musician) to be Honoured with a long overdue Knighthood for his services to Music.\r\n\r\nJeff Lyne has contributed over 50 years to the music industry as a writer, performer and producer, and giving millions of people tremendous enjoyment. His contributions have equalled those of other honoured musicians, but as he is somewhat reluctant to take credit for himself, these are not always immediately apparent.\r\n\r\nWe therefore believe it is time to recognise Jeff Lynne for his outstanding contribution and achievements by honouring him with a Knighthood.",
