        "additional_details": "I call all road users to oppose the toll rise for the Dartford Crossing.\r\n82 per cent of people, who recently responded to a Government consultation, disagreed with any increase, despite that the Roads Minister Mike Penning announced tolls would be put up by 50p in October for cars and light goods vehicles and by \u00a31.30 for HGVs. Then in 2014, tolls will rocket to \u00a32.50 for cars, \u00a33 for light goods vehicles, and \u00a36 for HGVs. These hikes in tolls at Dartford crossing at a time when the economy is struggling are unacceptable.\r\nI petition for the toll increase to be scrapped and the prices for using the Dartford Crossing frozen.",
