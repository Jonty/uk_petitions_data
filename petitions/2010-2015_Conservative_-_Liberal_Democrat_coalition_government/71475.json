We would like to get the DVLA to PROPOSE changes to the motoring public and traders and dealers, not just introduce them without regard for any implications that may arise as a result of badly designed and planned changes.\r\nThe  current situation of the DVLA viewing themselves as untouchable is unacceptable. They need to work WITH the public/traders and not against them in order to create a better system for everyone.",
