        "additional_details": "In UK there are a large network of rural public footpaths, through fields etc but a shortage of bridleways that are easily accessible - Pedestrians & cyclists are able to use the bridleways but horses cannot use public footpaths. The combination of riders, horses  and other road users often leads to fatal clashes, despite precautions such as appropriate hi-viz clothing, road signage & common sense.\r\n\r\nA nationwide review of appropriate footpaths should be considered in order to reduce the unnecessary mix of horses, riders & other road users.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see more rural public footpaths turned into public bridleways to reduce the number of horse/rider vs vehicle accidents on UK roads & keep all road users safe.\r\n",
