Unfortunately nothing has and more people have been killed or maimed by cattle.\r\n\r\nA full grown cow can be up to tonne in weight, a bullock or bull more, such an animal can easily  inflict serious injury or death to a walker.\r\n\r\nThe National Farmers Union only advice seems to be carry a big stick and let your dog off his lead if you are attacked by cattle.\r\n\r\nNot good enough in light of the further killings including the one in April 2014 when a man was trampled and gored to death by a known dangerous bull on a public footpath and his wife received serious injury.\r\n\r\nWe demand that DEFRA make it a serious criminal offence to allow cattle of all types into a field containing a public footpath or bridal way without the cattle being fenced off from the public right of way.\r\n\r\nPortable electric fences are readily available.",
