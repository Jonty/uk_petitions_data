        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition to remove ALL private interests, lobbying and secondary jobs from Central and local Government.\r\n\r\nMP's should be 100% committed to their job and while serving this nation they should not be able to hold secondary positions in ANY company. Whether as advisors, board members CEO's etc... Politics is being moulded and perverted by certain individuals with private and personal agendas, driven by profit, while destroying the values and heart of the UK. Banks, Global corporations, lobbyists and many others have too much control in this current system, the government should be working for us. We put them there to do that very thing after all.\r\n\r\nIt's time for a true, honest and fair democracy in this country. If MP's have to earn more to secure this then so be it but this age of banks and big business guiding the course of the UK is at an end.\r\n\r\nWe the people demand this. ",
