        "additional_details": "Companies that OUTSOURCE work are taking TAX, and JOBS out of the UK economy.We constantly hear about how there is a huge deficit in the country's budget, cuts are being made in all services and the country suffers. Is it fair that these large companies make huger profits whilst employing less UK people, employing people thousands of miles away to give a service to people in this country, often resulting in a poor service that would be better delivered by people living in this country.If a company provides a service in this country then that service should be delivered by employees from this country.If every company that has outsourced jobs were forced to bring them home, how many jobs would come back? A Unison report (http://www.unison.org.uk/file/a3780.pdf) estimated that as much as 750,000 jobs could be outsourced by the year 2015.With 2.69 million unemployed in this country as of November 2011(bbc news) bringing jobs back to the UK would go a long way to bringing that figure down.",
