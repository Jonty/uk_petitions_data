        "action": "Allow preparation of gluten free foods in normal kitchens",
        "additional_details": "A few years ago, the EU decided that gluten free food must not be prepared in kitchens that prepare normal food, due to the possibility of cross-contamination. This has seriously cut back on the choice of gluten free products available. There is no such ban on preparing nut free foods, nor foods suitable for diabetics, it apparently being sufficient to mark these foods 'may contain nuts', or 'contains sugar'. People with gluten allergy who inadvertently ingest gluten usually just suffer an upset stomach. People with a nut allergy who inadvertently ingest nuts may collapse and die on the spot from anaphylactic shock, whilst diabetes sufferers can collapse from ingesting too much sugar.\r\nI call on the government have this ridiculous ban on preparation of gluten free foods overturned!!",
