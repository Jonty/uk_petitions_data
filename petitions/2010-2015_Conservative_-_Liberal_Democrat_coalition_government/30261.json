Quote from the BBC Website:\r\n\r\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron told parliament: \"This is a desperately sad reminder of the risks that journalists take to inform the world of what is happening, and the dreadful events in Syria.\"\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron is the one person in this country who can have an effect. Why doesn't he do anything about the dreadful events in Syria? Do they not have enough oil there?\r\n\r\nSend troops into Syria now.",
