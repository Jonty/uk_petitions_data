Invite bids from private companies to remove gum residue from town and city centres. National contract = investment in special kit & efficient workers.  If bids at say \u00a35/m2 = 30,000 km of pavements cleaned. My town, Exmouth, has spent \u00a31m on town centre in 10/11, paving is already badly marked !",
