        "additional_details": "The ability of welathy individuals and corporations to avoid paying income and corporation tax respectively is a direct consequence of a tax system which is impossible for a lay person to understand and so full of holes that a clever accountant can find ways to avoid payment. rather than continue with failed efforts to plug the holes, the entire tax system should be scrapped and replaced with something much simpler.\r\n\r\nAmong the consequences would be an efficient HMRC which cost less to run, more income for the Treasury and in all probability lower taxes all round. All three benefits are so compelling that this suggestion is really a no-brainer",
