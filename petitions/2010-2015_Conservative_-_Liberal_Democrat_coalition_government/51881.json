        "additional_details": "Abolish a department that was created to help familys in need, but has developed into state extorsion on a grand scale. Abilty to pay is not considered and is not means tested as is done with other parts of goverment.\r\n\r\nA system that spends more than is recovered for familys is unstanable, but for some reason is not acknowledged by this goverment, who cut payments to disabled children while spending your money on a system that has cost us billions on wasted computer systems and a completly unfair tool that only caused rifts in familys rather than the original intended vision.\r\n\r\nHow is it for 1 child working parents get \u00a320.30 a week child benefit and i have to pay \u00a345.00 a week to a child you never see!\r\n\r\nNot only that but they dont take into account that we have a mortgage/rent to pay and any other outgoing bils like fuel to get to work or any other basic household bills!!\r\n\r\nAbolish the CSA by 2014",
