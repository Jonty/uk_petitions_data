        "additional_details": "Maintain the fuel duty accelerator to (eventually) price fossil motorists off the roads and thus keep the country on course for a sustainable post-Peak Oil future. Spend the extra revenue on green technology research as a matter of urgency (pay the young to study engineering). Stimulate take-up of electric cars by giving a green light to massive wind farm expansion, combined with infinitely variable electricity pricing, a.k.a. \"smart grid\". Incentivize individual householders, businesses and communities to iron out demand peaks and supply troughs by storing when power is cheap and releasing when it is pricey (also paying them a premium for generating power when demand is high).",
