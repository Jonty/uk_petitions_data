The 12 month 'Free from debt' following the individuals Discharge does not apply.\r\nAs these products were mis-sold in the first instance incuring additional costs the Bank/Financial Instutions may have been culpable toward the individuals Bankruptcy. This is not right so must be changed so that any policies discovered to have been mis-sold should go directly to the individual and not back to Creditors.",
