        "additional_details": "We think that the massive wall which was erected during the renovation of Picadilly Gardens is, in its current grey, boring state a waste of a huge amount of potential.\r\n\r\nWe propose that something should be done to liven it up! The format of the 'sprucing up' should be left to the public to decide on, though we think the end product could be a great way to get people of all ages and backgrounds involved in a creative project that would benefit the city as a whole.\r\n\r\nGiven the recent 'I love MCR' campaign, we think this could be a great way to let people express their love for our city in a more direct way than being the target of a PR campaign.\r\n\r\n(Pictures included for reference)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.aidan.co.uk/md/ManPiccWall6717.jpg\r\nhttp://g.co/maps/czjz",
