We hereby petition the UK Government to withdraw the High Commissioner from Kampala, withdraw foreign aid with immediate effect and make immediate allowances to allow for Ugandans seeking asylum from this persecution.\r\n\r\nIf the UK Government is to lay claim to supporting human rights abroad then they must act now to stop this legalised violence against innocent people. If they are unable to do so then they must allow for individuals who are seeking to escape this persecution and find safety.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of right and wrong, and life and death. There can be no delay.",
