        "additional_details": "I was in an exam hall at a high school. It\u2019s very common throughout the country to use an old sports hall with a corrugated roof. It was raining horrendously. The volume inside the hall was incredible.  I couldn't hear my own voice (there wasn't an exam on at the time!). I think if a lot of parents heard the noise, they would be complaining a lot. There are rules about noises occurring during exams, and notes are made to go off to the boards for allowances to be made, but the volume in that hall causes problems for students to be able to concentrate properly and no note is made as it isn't a sudden noise, it's \"just rain\". I think that if schools wish to use older, uninsulated buildings then there should be a maximum background noise level. This poses obvious problems of \"where else do you sit 300 kids at once\", and \"what if it throws it down half way through the exam\", but these are things which can be considered and worked around.",
