        "additional_details": "The current system is over-complicated and impractical.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes GCSE exams should be controlled, set and marked by one exam board. Pupils will all sit the same exam. The marking system should be based on an uniform distribution of pupils taking the exams for that year. This would mean, for example:\r\nTop 10% - A grade\r\nNext 20% - B grade\r\nNext 40% - C Grade\r\nNext 20% - D Grade\r\nNext 10% - E Grade\r\n\r\nThank you.",
