        "additional_details": "The Internet is awash with stories of universities appropriating and selling students work to commercial entities without either permission or compensation. If universities were still state funded then this position can be understood but now that the average fees to go to university per year is around \u00a39,000 it is no longer acceptable.\r\n\r\nMany students, especially in IT, are holding back on any good ideas for their end of term projects as they will not see any rewards and even be unable to continue to work on them after the submission deadline.  The greed of the universities is causing students to lose marks and is damaging what they are supposed to foster by stealing work and stifling creativity.\r\n\r\nIf the universities want to charge you enough to put you in debt for the rest of your life they should not be allowed to exploit your work for commercial gain while you are there as well.\r\n\r\nI want the government to either make tuition free or give us the rights to our own work.\r\n",
