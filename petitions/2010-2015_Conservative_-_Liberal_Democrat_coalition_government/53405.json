        "additional_details": "This e-petition is asking the Government to prevent the \"giveaway\" of any further parking spaces to the new Town Center development in Bourne, Lincolnshire.  The ability to park in Bourne is a key factor in the continued economic success of our small Market Town.  The spaces are not the councils to give away or to sell (without consultation). The spaces are manged by our elected officials for the best interest of the majority.  If you feel there should be no further parking spaces lost to this development then please join this e-petition. You may wish to attend the council meeting at the Corn Exchange on the 6th of August at 07:30 pm.",
