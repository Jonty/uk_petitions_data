        "additional_details": "Police are facing more and more new proposals to change the way in which they work.  Whilst many of these proposals are welcome, the majority are not and are being raced through without proper consultation with officers.  Many officer's feel that the Federation have not supported them properly over many issues and seek a change to the current situation of not being allowed to choose who represents their interests.\r\n\r\nTo move to another staff support mechanism would allow officers to have confidence in who represents them at all levels.\r\n\r\nThe new staff support system, or the choice of a current established staff union would only be able to work within the current 'framework' of Police Regulations etc and therefore industrial rights for example would remain unchanged unless further legislation was considered.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition and help to ensure that the demands and roles of serving police officers are recognised and considered.",
