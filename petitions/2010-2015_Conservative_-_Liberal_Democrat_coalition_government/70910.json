        "additional_details": "Please support our effort to reduce the speed along the first stretch of the  A6195 Dearne Valley Parkway, between the Birdwell roundabout and the Rockingham roundabout.\r\n\r\nIt is very dangerous at present for pedestrians to cross the A6195 adjacent to the Birdwell roundabout on route between Birdwell and Hoyland Common.\r\n\r\nThe short stretch of road between the above mentioned roundabouts is currently a de-restricted 70 mph zone and we would propose this be reduced to 50 mph, which is the same speed limit as it is on the other side of the Birdwell roundabout on the A61 duel carriageway to Tankersley. Alternatively a Pedestrian Crossing across the entrance of the Dearne Valley Parkway at the Birdwell Roundabout would also be most useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
