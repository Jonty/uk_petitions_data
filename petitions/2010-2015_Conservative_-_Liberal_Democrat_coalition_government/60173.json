        "additional_details": "There is a worrying trend in the government today of designing policy by media opportunity and not based on facts or long term good for society. Except in times of national crisis members of the government are not allowed to change policy or reverse decisions within the time frame of the media cycle (i.e. 8-10 days). Decisions must stand for at least 1 month before the government is allowed to reverse their decision. This allows proper time to consider the consequences, and might promote a more considered approach to the design of policy that is not simply driven by the media. ",
