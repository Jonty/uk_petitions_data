        "action": "Migrate all government IT to Linux based systems",
        "additional_details": "In these austere times it seems that UK government is looking to save money everywhere except in it's own \"people nuetral\" infrastructure. Up to now all savings have come at a cost to the population. However, the vast majority of UK government IT systems are still running on Windows based systems, which come with hefty licensing costs.\r\n\r\nLinux operating systems have fully matured and are used by some of the largest institutions and governments in the world. Coming with no licesnsing costs, following initial migration costs and training costs the savings would be substantial.\r\n\r\nWe therefore petition the government to undertake a full review with a view to migrating systems to open source systems as soon as possible,",
