        "additional_details": "The Government wants to introduce new laws which will allow them to spy on the emails, texts, calls and website visits of everyone in the UK.\r\n\r\nThey plan to introduce the 'Orwellian' legislation in the upcoming Queens Speech in May this year.\r\n\r\nThe proposals could put the UK's surveillance on a similar footing to China and Iran. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said this is \"a pretty drastic step in a democracy.\"\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to:\r\n\r\nAbandon their plans to introduce a 'big brother' style monitoring system of the emails, texts, calls and internet usage of UK citizens.",
