        "additional_details": "It makes no sense for the United Kingdom to be represented by four separate teams; it should be represented by a single team.\r\n\r\nThe existence of four separate teams merely creates national disunity, reduces the qualifying Home Nations teams\u2019 chances winning any World Cup and leaves footballers in non-qualifying Home Nations teams underemployed.\r\n\r\nA permanent British team has been supported by people including Tony Banks, Jack Straw and Laurence Robertson. Opponents to a British football team have weak arguments against it, believing that existing footballing identities should not be sacrificed for better chances of success.\r\n\r\nThe teams and football associations of England, Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland should be merged, with players from the pre-existing teams being selected for the United Kingdom team via a knockout tournament process and meritocratic training programmes.",
