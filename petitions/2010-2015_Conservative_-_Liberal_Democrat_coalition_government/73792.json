        "additional_details": "The current state of affairs in Bangladesh is out of control. The leader of the largest opposition party and first women prime minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia has been under house arrest in her party office for the last 8 days. The current parliament has 154 automatic MP (51%) without a single vote being cast in their constituency, only 5-7% population participated in the election and no major countries around the globe recognised this election. The people of Bangladesh have no democracy, no freedom of speech and no safety & security in their own land. A free, fair an all inclusive election under caretaker government is the crying need of the nation. This government has killed the democracy but sadly UK government is still supporting financial, still trading with them.\r\nThe British Government should set up a financial and trade embargo on Bangladesh until they stop state terrorism and establish democracy.",
