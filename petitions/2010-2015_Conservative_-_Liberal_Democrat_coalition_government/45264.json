        "additional_details": "One day before tickets go on sale to the public there are 25 PAGES of tickets for The Who gig in June 2013 at the O2 arena in London FOR SALE ON VIAGOGO. These are most certainly not accounted for by the resale of tickets bought by pre-sale purchasers such as O2 customers. This is apparent from the number of sellers with six tickets available. The  best tickets are being sold for up to \u00a31800.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to investigate the malfunctioning of this market in the interests of music fans everywhere and to bring forward legislation to address this blatant profiteering. We were better off when the touts were only outside the venues.",
