In the end hardworking people who pay the contributions don't even get an appointment to see their local GP. Most of us are having to buy private health insurances because of this shambolic use of our NI money. NI contributions should be  made voluntary payment tax so people get a choice to buy private insurance/ pensions or pay into NI.",
