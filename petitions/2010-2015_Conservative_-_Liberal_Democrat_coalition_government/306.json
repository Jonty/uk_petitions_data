For high-definition coverage, we are talking \u00a3610. I know I cannot afford this, and so will many other people. This will only be a bad thing as fewer people will watch Formula 1 (an estimated 8 million viewers in the U.K. in 2011), and many casual fans will not bother to keep up with what races are broadcasted where. We want the government to ensure that Formula 1 remains free-to-air.",
