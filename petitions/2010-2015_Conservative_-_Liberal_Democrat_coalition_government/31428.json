(Formal dinners and receptions do NOT count as valid reasons for such travel - signing documents MAY count as valid depending on whether the documents can instead reasonably be posted back and forth. Attending the funerals of foreign heads of state requires SOME physical attendance, but such attendance should be held to the minimum number of persons possible.)",
