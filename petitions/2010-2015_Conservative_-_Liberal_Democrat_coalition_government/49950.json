They should also not receive any excessive \u2018expenses\u2019 in connection with such activities so there will be no \u2018under the radar\u2019 payments made or received.\r\n\r\nAt best they should receive a simple travel allowance that only covers the basic cost of the travel by the cheapest train fare or coach / bus fare possible and not be able to claim for flights, taxis, etc.  They should also not be able to claim for excessive accommodation and meals such as hotels and restaurants but at best should be given a basic subsistence allowance if they actually do stay somewhere overnight.",
