We are appalled at least three or four times a year at some of the acts carried out by our fellow people, and we accept that the perpetrators will more often than not be out and amongst us in a few seemingly short years, with aide and assistance from our society to pick up their lives and carry on as normal. We have had the clear view of right and wrong so blurred by a liberal view that I have never subscribed to and P.C. (Political Castration as I define it) Policies that are designed to stifle any normal way of objecting to any policy that we as a people disagree with, to the extent that the perpetrator seems to have an over emphasis on their rights, and not the victims and families left with inconsolable grief  where once stood a loved one. Proof of course must be paramount, and if irrefutable then Justice must be done for all the grieved parties.    ",
