        "additional_details": "I would like to set up a 72 hour window where families can evacuate their children from Gaza. Nothing more, nothing less. The children can be either moved to a refugee camp in a neutral zone or the United Kingdom and Europe homes them until the hostilities end.\r\n\r\nI appreciate there is high immigration at the moment, but in my eyes this is a humanitarian crisis, and needs priority over anything else.\r\n\r\nIf this was a conventional fight it would be just another conflict, but this endless shelling is indiscriminate and pretty much one sided.\r\n\r\nPlease either get the IDF to stop shelling or arrange time for an evacuation.\r\n\r\nMany thanks Nick Tregunna\r\n",
