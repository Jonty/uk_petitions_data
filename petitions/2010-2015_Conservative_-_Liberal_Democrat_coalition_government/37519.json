        "additional_details": "The European Commission proposes to introduce a definition for a roadworthiness test that components of the vehicle must comply with characteristics at the time of first registration. This may prevent most modifications to vehicles without further approval of the vehicle. (this will apply to many components and to all types of vehicle)\r\n\r\nThe Commission proposes to change the definition of an Historic Vehicle that may be exempt from periodic testing. This may allow vehicles older than 30 years to be exempt from testing providing the vehicle has been maintained in its original condition, including its appearance.\r\n\r\nThis WILL happen unless a member or the EC parliament forces reconsideration.\r\n\r\nFor more information\r\nhttp://www.the-ace.org.uk/armageddon/\r\n\r\nThis is to raise awareness and to hopefully make sure this does not get brought in.
