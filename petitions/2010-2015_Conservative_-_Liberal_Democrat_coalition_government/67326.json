The Wanless Inquiry is looking into criminal activity by politicians and other publicly prominent individuals who have received solid protection from prosecution by the Westminster Establishment and WE THE PUBLIC deserve a public assurance from our Prime Minister THAT THERE WILL BE NO POLITICAL INTERFERENCE WITH THE INQUIRY.",
