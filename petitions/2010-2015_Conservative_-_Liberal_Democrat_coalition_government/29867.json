        "additional_details": "Our friend Gracia is facing deportation to Congo. Grace is an amazing person. She is honest, kind and is by far the most hardworking person i know. She is a third year law student at university and desperately wishes to finish her law degree. However, for the past few months, the home office has  insisted on removing Gracia from the UK and putting an end to all her dreams and aspirations. This is all because Gracia's diplomatic visa has expired. Grace could still remain in the country if she were to be granted a student visa. Yet the home office refuses to grant her permission to apply for a student visa, on the grounds that Grace has no reason to remain in the UK as she has no friends or support. This is extremely unfair. PLease let us show the home office that there are people out there who do care about Grace and are willing to support her. Please sign this petition urging the Home Office to permit Grace to apply for a student Visa, just so she can finish her degree at least. ",
