        "additional_details": "This week saw reports of Rinkel Kumari kidmapped and forced to converrt and marry a Muslim. Her case was taken up by the Pakistan Hindu Council with the case of Asha Kumari and Dr Lata before Pakistan's Supreme Court which decided not to release them.  We have been seen how suffocatingly Pakistanies have been in the UK with ongoing abuse cases. The Supreme Court and the legal processes are compromised by the Islamic hegemony of Pakistan as to make the recourse to law almost meaningless. This Petition enjoins on the UK to provide them asylum and make any aid contingent on their release. ",
