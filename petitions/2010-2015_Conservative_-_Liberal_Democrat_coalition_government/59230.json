        "additional_details": "Government should financially support Animal Charities in the UK, from Lottery funds or other financial means. Animals should be protected, and never allowed to suffer, which is what is happening all over. Animal charities have to turn away homeless and sick animals by the hundreds, due to insufficient funds to employ paid staff to care for them. These charities depend on volunteers. Their funds barely pay for food. The cat protection say they could employ many more fosterers to care for stray and unwanted cats, in their own homes, if they had sufficiently funded. They also finance vet fees out of their funds. Government should also fund animal neutering as at present,vouchers for this vetinary service comes out of Animal Charity funds. If they did not have this expense they would have more money for food, vet fees, and heating, dog walkers, and fosterers.at Xmas many stray cats were turned away by rescues as they had no places for them, so they continue to live on the streets",
