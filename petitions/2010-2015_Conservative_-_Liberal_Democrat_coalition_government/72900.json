        "additional_details": "There was a case of a young boy who had taken 1g of AMT (Alpha-Methyltryptamine) and died... All over the Internet, there are people who have put their experiences down and how much to take to have a nice affect. There's plenty of information out there for people to know that 1g of this chemical is extremely dangerous. Banning it will only bring more dangerous and untested chemicals to the drug market. This particular drug was used in the 1960's as an anti-depressant so obviously we already know that it was tested enough to be used in medicine. The UK drug policy needs to be looked over because banning drugs thus creating more harmful substances is NOT the answer. The likes of LSD, MDMA and Psylocibin Mushrooms are all Class A drugs, yet they are less harmful than many of these legal highs. The legal high drugs only purely exist because of drug prohibition and so needs to be looked into. Keep AMT on the market and let's learn more about it instead of stopping research altogether. ",
