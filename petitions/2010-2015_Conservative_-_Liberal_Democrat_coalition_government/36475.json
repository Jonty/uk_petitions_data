Residents have the enjoyment of their homes and weekend rest violated by a minority. Some bikes adapted for scrambling have no effective silencing whatsoever. This, and their unnecessarily frequent gear changes, causes a severe depletion of others' rights to tranquility.\r\nMany responsible bikers ride almost undetected because of the efficient silencing and are able to enjoy their riding with no discomfort to others - it can be done.",
