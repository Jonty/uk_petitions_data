Politicians, therefore, perpetrated cruelty against wild animals which is illegal and they should be held to account for it, in the same way they would insist on that treatment for anybody who is not a politician who caused immense and inhuman suffering to a wild animal.  Politicians MUST NOT be seen to be above the law of the land.",
