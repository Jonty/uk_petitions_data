        "additional_details": "This e-petition aims to stimulate parliamentary discussion on provision of free home care (domiciliary care) for older people (aged 75+) living at home.\r\n\r\nUnder current legislation and local authority guidelines, older people are financial assessed for the provision of home care services.  A 32 year old person, working full time who needs assistance with bathing may be assessed as paying the same as an 93 year old stroke patient living alone at home.\r\n\r\nThe National Assistance Act 1948 promised you, in return for paying you national insurance contributions, you would be looked after from \u2018cradle until death\u2019 however, care provided by your local social services department, unlike services under the NHS are chargeable, and the cost is increasing.\r\n\r\nThis aim of this e-petition is to provide free home care to all individuals aged 75 and above if they require care and support to remain living at home.",
