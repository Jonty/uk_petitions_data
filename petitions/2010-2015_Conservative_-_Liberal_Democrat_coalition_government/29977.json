        "additional_details": "The junction of the A470 and B4416 has experienced many accidents  and near misses over the previous years. Accidents have become much more common in recent years due to the introduction of SAT NAV systems and the growing number of HGV's using the A470 as a direct link between North and South Wales. A reduction of the speed limit to 30mph on the A470 would allow cars greater time to leave the narrow junction and would lower the accident rates at this particular accident black-spot. ",
