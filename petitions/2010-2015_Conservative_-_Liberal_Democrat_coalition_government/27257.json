        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the monopolies comission has a disproportionate control over the policing of market domination\r\n\r\nAs ironic as this sounds, we believe that this is a serious issue, as the monopoly obtained by the comission allows it to act unilaterally, creating a disgustingly hypocritical situation where the very thing the monopolies commission aims to prevent is exactly what is occurring. We petition the Business Secretary, Dr Vince Cable to consider effecting remedial measures aimed at separating the commission into smaller competing organisations.\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely\r\n\r\nThe JCR of Somerville College, Oxford\r\n(Alma mater of Baroness Thatcher)\r\n\r\n",
