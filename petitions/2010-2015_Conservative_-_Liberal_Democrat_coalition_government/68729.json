        "additional_details": "Men dominate parliament. The House of Lords employ 26 Church of England Bishops similar to Iran and parliament promotes religious schools, meanwhile the majority of the population reject gods entirely not just those of other groups.\r\nIn August 2013 MPs voted a knife-edge 51% against military action against Syria whilst polls of the people showed a less gung-ho 67% against. The base salary of an MP without expenses is about 2.5 times the average wage in the UK. We conclude MPs do not well represent the people.\r\nMost of us have banked online securely for many years. Similar secure technology exists to allow e-voting on issues. The results would be binding on MPs. The role of MPs would be less of decision making to become more as advisers and implementers. Such a move would take democracy to a level that even surpasses the Swiss. Allow e-votes.",
