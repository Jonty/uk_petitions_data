        "additional_details": "18 million tonnes of food is being ploughed into Britain's landfill sites every year - all because it's cheaper and easier for the food industry to dump it than give it to those in need.\r\n\r\nThis petition is arguing that supermarkets should be given a fine if they throw away too much food, and a limit needs to be decided by experts as to what is acceptable. Please support this campaign as hopefully supermarkets will become much more careful when buying their quantities and may want to donate their in-date food to those in need to avoid fines. Thank you.",
