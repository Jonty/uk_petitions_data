        "additional_details": "There would be huge benefit in having a non-military National Civic Service (NCS), thus: All young people leaving school at 16 would go into NCS residential establishments until age 20.  Those staying on at school to qualify for higher education would go into NCS at 18, also until age 20. Those in NCS from 16 to 20 would be taught trades, such as building, computing, surveying, etc., as suited to their aptitudes, enabling them to take up beneficial employment on leaving. Those going into NCS at 18 would be given training in leadership skills, business studies, finance, etc., to enable them to put their academic studies into a constructive context.\r\nThe NCS regime would include rigorous discipline and fitness training.  It would take young people off the streets when they were most vulnerable to temptation and peer pressure.  All would wear uniform - no pressure to buy designer labels.\r\nThis petition calls on Government to implement a National Civic Service system as soon as possible.",
