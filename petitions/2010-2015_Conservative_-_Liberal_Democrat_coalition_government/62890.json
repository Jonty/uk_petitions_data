What will happen then? Currently, much of our waste is burnt or placed in landfill, contributing to global warming, pollution, and habitat destruction. And for every piece of rubbish we burn or bury, another raw material must be extracted. Schools have a vital role in society - they provide the underpinning for society's future.Recycling must start happening in schools, and we believe the government should be supporting this by paying for more recycling bins!",
