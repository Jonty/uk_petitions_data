        "action": "End the state subsidy of the PMs holiday home at Chequers",
        "additional_details": "On the 1st of April the government cut benefits for around 660,000 people who were deemed to have spare rooms. This petition would like to end the two tier system where those in need are penalised whilst the rich continue to have state subsidised luxury.  I urge David Cameron to pay back the state for the 10 bedrooms which go unused in his Chequers mansion for the majority of the year, and given the times of austerity, end the tradition of our taxes funding his holiday home set in 100 acres of countryside.",
