        "additional_details": "We are a Throw-Away Society in part because consumer products seem to have shortening lives. Bad for the planet, for energy, resource & waste management but, most of all, bad for us as consumers.   When products die, the 'norm'  is to discard & buy new\r\n\r\nDoes the desire for repeat business drive manufacturers to design in high mortality rates?\r\n\r\nConsumer Legislation falls short with regard to the definition of 'reasonable' in the context of product lifespan.\r\n\r\nManufacturers should be required to:\r\na) Provide an indication of what constitutes a 'reasonable' lifespan for each product i.e. normal use, not demonstrable misuse.\r\nb) Link Guarantees to that 'reasonable' lifespan.\r\n\r\nThus consumers will be able to make more informed decisions about value for money. And, in making manufacturers be transparent about how long an item should last, they would be put under positive pressure from consumers & competitors to produce more reliable products that last longer & work better.",
