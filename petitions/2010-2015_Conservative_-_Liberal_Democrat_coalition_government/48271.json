        "additional_details": "George Osbourne has been found parking in a disabled space. This is clearly a public offence, not only that, he has abused his position of authority in public office in doing so. This in Common law is malfeasance. For a public office person to commit malfeasance amounts to gross misconduct. I therefore demand his resignation.",
