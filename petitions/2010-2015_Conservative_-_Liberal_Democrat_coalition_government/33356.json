        "additional_details": "The parents of WDC school children would like a policy to encompass all schools within the area regarding children arriving at and leaving the school premises. Recently there have been two incidents which caused a panic among parents regarding child abduction. Some schools operate a no adult on school premises policy whilst other schools simply open their doors and allow the children to leave. It is suggested that all schools employ a no adult on premises policy and that all unused school gates are padlocked. The schools have a responsibility to work alongside the parents to ensure a secure school environment.",
