In their current form, Business Rates are an unfair constraint on British businesses and their ability to deliver the growth that UK PLC needs.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tBritish businesses pay more in Business Rates than any EU competitor (ie, paying more than France and Germany combined);\r\n\u2022\tBusiness Rates are the only tax that is index-linked to inflation \u2013 ie, guaranteed to rise, irrespective of business conditions;\r\n\u2022\tFor many businesses (especially retailers), Business Rates are almost the same as their property rent \u2013 without delivering matching services;\r\n\u2022\tBusiness Rates are geared to property values, but the Government cancelled the scheduled five-yearly revaluation that would have reduced Business Rates in line with the reduction in property values.\r\n",
