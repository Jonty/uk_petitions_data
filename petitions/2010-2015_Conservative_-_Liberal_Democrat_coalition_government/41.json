        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition our government to save our struggling British businesses and the jobs of those we employ by cutting the rate of VAT. Too many of UK's 4.2 million small to medium sized businesses (SMEs) are struggling to survive a desperately sluggish economic climate while being constantly battered by cost increases. Our reserves are depleted by years of recessional forces, many of us are now losing money. The rise in the rate of VAT is the last the last nail in our coffin - unless our government helps us by stimulating the economy. ",
