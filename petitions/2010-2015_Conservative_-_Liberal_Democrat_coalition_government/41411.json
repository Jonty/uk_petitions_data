        "additional_details": "Bicycles are becoming an increasing problem on the roads of the UK, they are neither identifiable or accountable for their actions. Under the blame culture anyone who is involved in an accident is libel to a claim except cyclists, unless I\u2019m mistaken even health and safety guidelines state that you are responsible for your actions that may affect others? Cyclist do affect others\r\n\r\nThe law permits the use of the highway as a racetrack and the people involved do not require any insurance for their actions or require the vehicle to be identifiable to others.\r\n\r\nThis law needs updating to allow people who must pay for the use of roads to be able to identify the cyclist and if the need arises be able to claim against that person\r\n",
