        "additional_details": "Our taxes should not be wasted on Thatchers funeral. If the goverment want to spend millions on such a funeral, the Thatcher fans can all club together, or the Queen can give up private helicopter rides for a short while. These are just suggestions. Either way, the goverment should not steal from our tax pot to pay for something they want for themselves. Thatcher should not be treated any different to any other citizen - when we die, it is up to our friends and family to take on board the cost of our funerals. 10 millions pounds is a lot of jobs. Jobs which are being cut by the goverment who claim we cannot afford them. Whats more important, the quality of one persons funeral, or the quality of lots of peoples lives?",
