The millions of pounds given to the people at the top of the ladder is disgraceful. We the workers and Tax-payers are ultimately paying for these bonuses.\r\n\r\nThere will be no recovery in the financial position of the country while millions of pounds are being taken out of the system and held in personal bank accounts.",
