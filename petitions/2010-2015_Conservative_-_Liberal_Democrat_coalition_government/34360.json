        "additional_details": "In 2012, the SQA allowed candidates to participate in, what I along with many others, believe to be an unjust, irrelevant and inconclusive Standard Grade Credit Biology examination. This particular examination did not include crucial topics and subtopics which allowed candidates to show their true potential and show their fluency and competence within this particular subject. This, in turn, led to candidates extremely dissapointed and upset feeling they were not given a fair shot at reaching maximum potential. When the SQA were contacted they then basically told distressed candidates it was \" too bad \". We are hoping that the SQA can realise this is deeply unfair and hopefully alter the examination to include the crucial topics to help the candidates fulfill and do their very best. ",
