The USA division already has it and have had it for many years and also Subway has it too. But not the UK division.\r\n\r\nSo I therefore believe that the Mcdonalds UK division should have unlimited refills on all soft drinks sold under the same conditions that the Subway restaurant division has in both the USA & UK.",
