I believe it is a travesty that the government can so easily go against the wish of its civilians and fight a war that will only have a detrimental effect on the UK population and economy (unneccessary UK expenditure on arms, military resources). The best example of this is the Iraq war demonstration, 1 million strong march in London, yet the UK went to war regardless. Stop this from happening again.",
