He is married to a UK national.\r\n\r\nBut disciplinary action for a 2010 fight with a colleague means he is considered to have a criminal record.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the British Government to grant British Citizenship to Isimeli Baleiwai after 13 years military service with the British Armed Forces.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the British Government to review immigration Law and Policy regarding Foreign and Commonwealth Soldiers.",
