        "additional_details": "The Dept of Health published its Corporate Plan for 2012/13 in May 2012.\r\n\r\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neurology by name was even mentioned in the plan. MS is not a priority despite the efforts of hardening lobbying by trusts, societies and political lobbyists.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change to help the 100,000 people who have MS and the 2,000,000 more it affects.\r\n\r\nWe need NHS Improvement to include MS in its portfolio. We need MS to be a priority. Knowing the amount the NHS spend on MSers it really needs to be a prioritised.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to send a message to Dr Janet Williamson, National Director,  NHS Improvement.\r\n",
