        "additional_details": "The Blue Badge Scheme is open to abuse even by the Badge Holder.\r\nIf a person purchases or leases a car through Mobility schemes then the car should be fitted with a number plate showing the Disabled wheelchair sign. this would be instanty recognised by emergency services in the event of accidents or incidents. It would also remove a lot of problems associated with stealing badges or lending badges out. Hundreds of thousands of pounds is lost in revenue from parking charges every year.\r\nIf a person has a Blue Badge and does not have a vehicle of their own then a Book of vouchers could be used as in many Cities throughout the U.K with a scratch off date. If an unacceptible numberof vouchers is required by the non car owner then an investigation by Social Services could be carried out. ",
