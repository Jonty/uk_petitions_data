Why not cosmetics/household products?\r\n\r\nThe government are willing to put warnings/images on cigarette packages because it affects humans health dramatically. Don't animals deserve the same? The torture and abuse they go through for testing is appalling and should be highlighted on packaging.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven that animal testing is unnecessary as there is a way of using donor skin cells to produce \"real\" skin for testing. So why is this still going ahead? Animals have as much right to be on this planet as humans do. They deserve a free and happy life.\r\n\r\nAnimal testing and the use of animals for research needs to stop NOW!   ",
