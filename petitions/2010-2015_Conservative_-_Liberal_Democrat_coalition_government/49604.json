        "additional_details": "royal mail privatisation will kill business\r\n\r\nRecent price changes in preparation for privatisation are punitive to small post dependent business and private auction sales. The full privatisation of the Royal Mail will see this problem increase and ruin many a small business as the overall price of goods delivered will render them uncompetititive. The Royal Mail was funded by us all for our benefit. We do not wish to hand it to private profiteers.\r\n\r\n**I appeal rejection of this petition as it addresses the core impact more pertinently than existent ones**",
