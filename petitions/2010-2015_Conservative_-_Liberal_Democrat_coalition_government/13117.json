Huge amounts of money and training have already been pumped into making sure our 7 - 11 year olds were able to learn another language - let's not see this wasted!\r\n\r\nUK Citizens, the majority of which only speak English, are being put at a huge disadvantage in today's world of global commerce and multicultural societies. British children need to be given the opportunity to learn a second language as early as possible when they are most receptive to learning new languages. Scientific research has shown that young children have a much richer capacity to develop and to acquire many languages simultaneously than adults have.",
