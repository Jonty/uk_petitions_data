        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want the government to scrap their current plans for reducing, and eventually handing over, all funding of the BBC's World Service from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the BBC by 2014.  We believe that this will not only damage the quality of the BBC's services in the UK, as funding will have to be stretched, but will also damage Britain's standing in the world, diplomacy, the spread of Western ideals, independent news to those in countries whose free speech is limited by oppressive regimes, education to those nations the UK government has already expressed an interest in developing by increasing the budget for International Development, and one of the best services that the BBC offers to the UK and to the World.
