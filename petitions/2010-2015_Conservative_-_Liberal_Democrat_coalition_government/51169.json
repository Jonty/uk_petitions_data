Failing a car on the basis of non-operation of value-added features which are not even required by Law is morally corrupt.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the new rules is 'wastemaking' -to scrap more serviceable cars and so boost sales.\r\n\r\nThis may even lead to a situation where buyers demand that no safety features beyond the bare minimum required by Law are present on any new car. If so it will harm road safety, and cost lives. ",
