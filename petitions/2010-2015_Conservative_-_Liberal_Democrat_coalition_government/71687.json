        "additional_details": "In 2012 the Coalition Government raised tuition fees to \u00a39000 a year, which means students now face crippling debt for decades to come. With the General Election coming up, we have to act now to put pressure on the new government to enforce change.\r\n\r\nEducation should be a right, not a privilege, and free for all to enjoy, regardless of their position in society.\r\n\r\nI call for the Government to abolish tuition fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
