        "additional_details": "We the petitioners call on the government to retain the current brackets for income tax in the United Kingdom (UK).\r\n\r\nWe believe that the 50% top tax rate is necessary and should not be lowered or abolished, because the money raised is crucial for the government, particularly in such times of austerity, and that wealthier individuals can afford to pay such a rate.\r\n\r\nWe also accept that the 50% rate should not be increased, and that such a move would be counter productive and unsustainable, as it would cause a lot of wealth to leave the UK.",
