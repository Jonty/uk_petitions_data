        "additional_details": "The UK is looking to become a world leader in something as we have lost our niche in the global market.\r\n\r\nAt one point in British history we were global leaders in shipbuilding, alas this is no more, or is it...........\r\n\r\nI would like to propose a new way we could once again lead the world, with British built ships that would run without fossil fuel engines. At current the average medium sized commercial cargo vessel will burn 60 tons of fossil fuel per day.\r\n\r\nThe new ships will have a large battery bank that will supply all the power the ship will need for approximately 18 hours.\r\n\r\nOcean power stations will have to be built approximately 75 - 100 Nm apart so the new ships can charge up. Indeed the UK can be the first country to create a global maritime electric motorway. Or, create a marine version of an overhead railway.\r\nThis new industry would create thousands of jobs and  it would make the UK once again be global leaders in the maritime sector.\r\n\r\n",
