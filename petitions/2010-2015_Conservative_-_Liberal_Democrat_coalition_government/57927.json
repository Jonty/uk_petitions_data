There are many UK passport holders who deliberately avoid paying any UK Tax, but they like having a British Passport, without any of the responsibilities.\r\n\r\nI am of the view that the Government should levy a 15% tax on all UK citizens/passport holders, who earn, transfer money overseas or use tax avoidance schemes.\r\n\r\nAll Americans pay US income tax wherever they live or work worldwide. What makes a UK citizens different? If you want a UK passport or be a UK citizen then you have to pay UK tax.\r\n",
