        "additional_details": "Scrap the catch all sentence of rape and enforce a graduated series of 'sexual assault' charges ranging from common sexual assault, through to aggravated rape with intent to kill/wound.  Then implement a series of sentences commensurate with the crime.  This will ensure that those offenders who may not be prosecuted with rape can be charged accordingly and the chances of successful prosecution increased.  Increasing the sentences of those more severe cases will also reassure the public that the justice system is fair and proportionate.",
