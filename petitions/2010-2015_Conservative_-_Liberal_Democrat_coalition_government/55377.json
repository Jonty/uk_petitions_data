        "additional_details": "The HMIC, Tom Winsor, was seen to wear a pseudo-police uniform to the National Police Memorial Day remembrance service. He has never held the office of Constable and is a career civil servant. This is an affront to anyone who has ever earned the right and worn the uniform of a Constable.\r\n\r\nHis department claim that it is not a police uniform, but the uniform of the HMIC. This role does to require a uniform. I call on the UK government to prevent him sullying the memory of those who have passed before, and those currently serving, by ordering him not to wear any item of uniform in his role as HMIC.",
