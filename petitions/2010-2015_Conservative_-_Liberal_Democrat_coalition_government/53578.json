We are about to purchase a property (our home) and you are taking \u00a311,700 in stamp duty from us.......DISGUSTING ! It feels like the only things you don`t tax is AIR and FOOD, but I am sure you are looking at ways to get these on the list. (Disappointed with you).\r\n\r\nThe action this country needs is for this Government to greatly lower or better still REMOVE this crippling property tax.\r\n\r\nMike Evans.",
