        "additional_details": "Private Stringer, of 23 Pioneer Regiment Royal Logistics Corps, was wounded in Afghanistan, while on duty.\r\n\r\nHe is a triple amputee.\r\n\r\nThe Thurrock Council has resettled him in a totally unsuitable apartment, some 16 floors up in a high rise appartment block and he is unable to use his wheelchair indoors.\r\n\r\nHe cannot get into the kitchen or his daughter\u2019s bedroom, and when the lifts for the building break down, he has no way of entering or leaving his home.\r\n\r\nThis is a clear breach of the Military Covenant and an insult to a HERO!\r\n\r\nWe, the petitioners, respectfully request that the Department exercise pressure to IMMEDIATELY rehouse Stringer in accommodation suitable to his needs, even if this means use of a Privately Leased Property, as normal in such situations.",
