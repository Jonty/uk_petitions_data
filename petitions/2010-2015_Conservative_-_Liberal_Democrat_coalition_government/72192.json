        "additional_details": "Will Pooley is a British born nurse who is working in West Africa helping to care for the victims of the latest Ebola outbreak.\r\nIn the course of undertaking this selfless work, Will contracted the deadly disease himself and had to return to the UK for treatment.\r\nThankfully, he was one of the minority of people who have managed to survive infection with this horrible virus.\r\nIn an act of unbelievable selflessness and compassion, Will has returned to Africa after recovering to once again help others suffering from Ebola.\r\nWe call on our Government to make some form of recognition for Will's amazing bravery and commitment to helping others less fortunate than himself, and all the other medical and aid workers who are risking and giving their lives in the fight against Ebola.",
