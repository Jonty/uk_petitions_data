        "action": "Force fuel retailers to reduce fuel prices by the same percentage that oil prices have changed by.",
        "additional_details": "Oil prices have fallen from approximately $115.00 per barrel to approximately $75.00, that is a 35% decline in the cost of oil. However, the price 'we' the public pay for our fuel has not fallen by anywhere near 35%. If it were to fall by the same percentage we would be paying about \u00a30.80p per litre for petrol and  \u00a30.85p per litre for diesel. This issue has not been addressed by our government because it receives 75% of fuel sales revenue in tax, which would therefore be reduced if fuel prices were to fall in line with oil price decline..... Sign this petition if you would like to see petrol and diesel prices fall, which will naturally reduce the cost of transport and therefore the cost of all items transported to market - such as all foods, consumer goods etc.... It would also save every driver 35% of their fuel spend every week - on average that would be about \u00a320.00 per week, equal to over \u00a31000.00 per year!!!",
