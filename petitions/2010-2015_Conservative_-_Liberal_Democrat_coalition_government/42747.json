        "additional_details": "We petition Her Majesty's Government to overturn the undemocratic and divisive decision of Belfast City Council (Monday 3rd December 2012) in banning the daily flying of our National Flag.  Ulster people fought and died in two World Wars and in 40 years of the \u2018Troubles\u2019 so that the flag may fly.  Every other region of the United Kingdom can freely fly the Union Flag.  We ask that this be debated in the House of Commons as a matter of urgency.\r\nGod Save the Queen",
