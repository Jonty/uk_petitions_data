Please do not allow councils to privatise playgrounds.They provide children with a place to play, exercise and socialize, all of which are important to maintaining children's health and achievement as outlined in the outcomes framework of the Every Child Matters policy. They provide families with a place to interact and bond and parents a chance to socialize with other parents, whilst children benefit from outdoor play. Privatising playgrounds would heap further deprivation on poor children and families and lead to segregated communities.",
