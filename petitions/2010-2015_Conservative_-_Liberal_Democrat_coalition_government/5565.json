A number of councils are beginning to consider, and some have implemented, an admission charge which does generate a profit for the museum and works towards its continuation but i) people will be less likely to visit (given todays economy) ii) disencourages people to observe and understand their past as well as iii) isolating audiences who can not afford.\r\n\r\nFunds can be made otherways, lets stop this now!",
