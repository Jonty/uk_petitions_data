Everything we eat, use or wear is delivered in one form or another, the resulting increase in retail prices will be astronomical. Those of us already on the poverty line will really suffer, especially the disabled who need their cars for mobility. Yet again this government is attacking the easy targets. This will see more people put out of work as more more businesses close. This must be stopped now!",
