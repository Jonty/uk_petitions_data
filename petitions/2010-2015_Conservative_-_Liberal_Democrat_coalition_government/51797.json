In my home I can not talk on the phone as they the riders pass by, they wake me at night and even drown out the TV and radio. They are louder than most car exhausts and only serve as some sort of 'street cred' between riders.\r\n\r\nI find the noise a constant distraction and annoyance that forces me to close windows on a warm day, this is not fair.
