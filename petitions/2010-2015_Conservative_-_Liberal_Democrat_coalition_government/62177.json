And yet hundreds of thousands every single day suffer slow agonising deaths.\r\nThis is unnecessary suffering and CAN be stopped.\r\n\r\nWe propose (as with farmed animals) that ALL wild animals be protected under the Animal Welfare Act, and that new legislation be passed to ensure that new procedures are introduced in commercial fishing and wild hunting, and that cruel, outdated and inhumane slaughter methods are put a stop to once and for all.\r\n",
