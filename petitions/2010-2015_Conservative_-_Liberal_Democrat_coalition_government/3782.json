        "additional_details": "Every year the Government spends more on Social Protection than on the NHS and Defence combined.\r\n\r\nI propose that this is amended, by reducing the overall payments to those who are able to work, but choose not to.  Furthermore, benefits should be paid entirely in the form of vouchers, which can be redeemed on items such as food, clothes and necessary home appliances. They could not be used to purchase luxury items such as alcohol or cigarettes.  The money saved could be used to launch schemes where the unemployed are forced to work in ways that benefit the public; litter picking, manual labour, assisting with road repair or data entry for local government.  This would improve the nation\u2019s work ethic and in exchange for their efforts, these individuals could be paid a small amount, which they could spend on luxury items.\r\n\r\nUnemployment should not be a lifestyle choice.",
