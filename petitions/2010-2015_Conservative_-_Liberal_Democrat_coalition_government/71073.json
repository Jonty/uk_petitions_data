        "additional_details": "The amount of days we have dedicated to human health charity raising is great, and we manage to raise millions for great causes to aid battles in bettering human lives. But I feel not enough is dedicated to the other species we share this world with! We have \"World Animal Day\", but why can't we fund raise for precious species conservation? Well, we can! By 2022, the Tiger could be extinct. Let's stop this. Let's dedicate fund raising days and events to animal based charities to aid conservation, rehoming and animal abuse prevention. Donating to charities and schemes to repay and protect this planets natural world. Assigning an annual date or week would be great! Let's make this as big as events such as Red Nose Day. Spread awareness of issues caused mainly by the human race, and help change/repair it. ",
