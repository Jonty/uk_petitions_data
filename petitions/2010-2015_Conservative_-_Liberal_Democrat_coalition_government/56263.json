        "additional_details": "Since 1944 RE has gained significant status in education, however, curriculum contents have never been capped. UK is a country that is based on Christian values. Education is important, however, what is taught to our children particularly in primary schools is VITAL! Some primary schools are teaching Satanism & Voodoo amongst other religions! These occult groups have a negative influence in society and exposing young people to these only creates problems in the future because of what children become exposed to. If the Christian Faith did not have such a great influence in this country, why should one swear in court touching a Bible and be trusted to tell nothing but the truth?  Therefore, it is critical that a curriculum should be decided in collaboration with parents, guardians and leaders of the church. ",
