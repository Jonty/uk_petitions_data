        "additional_details": "Children as young as ten years of age are said to have taken part in the riots that have caused havoc across the country.  A lack of responsible parenting has led to these youths thinking they have a right to behave maliciously; isolating themselves from society, intimidating communities and causing millions of pounds worth of damage to public and private property. Parents need to be held responsible for these intolerable crimes committed by their children. Any parent of a child arrested and/or convicted of rioting should face criminal charges of neglect and damage to personal/public property.",
