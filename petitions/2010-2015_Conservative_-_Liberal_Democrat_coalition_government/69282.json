        "additional_details": "If the people of Scotland vote to leave the Union, and the desire of any subsequent Scottish Government is to have a currency union with the Pound Sterling, then the people of Wales, Northern Ireland and England must have a referendum to agree to any such currency union. The vast majority of Welsh, Northern Irish and English citizens would demand a referendum if our Government tried to take the U.K. into a Euro currency union; so why is the Scottish First Minister permitted to declare a sterling currency union will exist by his decree? The Darien Disaster led to the Act of Union that joined two great nations together, the institution established to administer the money paid to clear Scotland\u2019s debts eventually became the Royal Bank of Scotland. So let\u2019s remind our Scottish family members of why we are better together, and make it clear that they should not be fooled by the claims of a William Wallace wannabe; he will not be making the decision if our Government holds a referendum.",
