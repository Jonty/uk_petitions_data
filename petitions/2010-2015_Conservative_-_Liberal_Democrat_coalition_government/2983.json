        "additional_details": "Please bring the eligibility criteria for allowing injury benefit to NHS employees, who have been injured at work and now have been diagnosed with mental health issues to the 21st century. Mental health problems are not a stigma anymore and the NHS Business service Authority need to update and review their handling of applicants who now have mental health problems that were caused by an accident or injury working for the NHS. Government need to review the application process and recognise mental health is as much as an illness as any physical injury and when applying the applicant does not need to feel degraded and besmirched by the process",
