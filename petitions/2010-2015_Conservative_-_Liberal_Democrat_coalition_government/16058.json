        "additional_details": "Student Finance England keeps losing student loan applications and/or personal information sent with them, which is preventing students from getting their money on time. The financial strain and stress caused by this is unacceptable. Also, by losing their personal information, there is increased risk of these families being victims of identity fraud. Call handlers have misled people about the progress of their applications when they've phoned up, and keep asking for letters from HMRC when the HMRC DOES NOT do letters. The government needs to stop the gross incompetence of Student Finance England by disciplining staff severely or sacking them when an application is delayed due to their incompetence. ",
