I'm creating this petition as 2 years ago my very best friend was murdered before me with a wine glass as it severed his jugular vein. Although we got justice and his attacker is imprisoned it doesn't bring him back. So in his name I want to create an environment where drunken attacks with glass and bottles is entirely prevented. Its a legacy and my way of stopping further injury or death and even to prevent someone having to witness an attack of this kind. I'd appreciate every signature I can get. Thank you. ",
