It is simply hypocritic that so much time can be spent testing a motorists speed, while meanwhile the police in plain driver training  vehicles, marked cars and unmarked cars simply do whatever speed they choose without lights or sirens. If the limit needs to be enforced for public safety then surely their behaviour endangers it. N.Yorks police is a perfect example as they milk the speedgun option for all that its worth and meanwhile the law doesnt apply to them. ",
