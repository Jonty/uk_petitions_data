        "additional_details": "The Government is proposing to introduce road tolls by number plate recognition at the Dartford Crossing which means there will be no easy method of payment. This is likely to result in some 5 million per year of fines for failure to pay where people do not understand how to pay or simply forget. In total, the scheme will extract \u00a37bn in new tax revenue from road users.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the first step in the introduction of more general road pricing under the excuse of tackling congestion. The agenda is clear - more taxation of road users and the introduction of an expensive bureaucracy to track and charge us.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned want to see the taxes paid by drivers spent on the roads, with no new charges. We do NOT agree with the Government\u2019s proposals for tolling roads in any form whatsoever.\r\n\r\nRoger Lawson, Alliance of British Drivers (ABD)\r\n",
