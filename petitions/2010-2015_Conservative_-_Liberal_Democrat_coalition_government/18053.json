It slows down the country's businesses and economy considerably.\r\n\r\nIf you travel from major town to town on inadquate single carraigeway roads you are slowed down even more to a 40mph crawling pace, 2/3rds of the speed limit for the roads, restricted by an old fashioned law.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that this law is not going to be lifted because of eco reasons, which is daft given 40mpt is not an optimum speed.\r\n\r\n60 MPH would be better but 50 mph is a start. .
