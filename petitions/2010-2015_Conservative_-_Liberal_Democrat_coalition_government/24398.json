        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to help working families with the childcare costs. For example - In Merton council there are 47 nurseries of which only 3 are Council run and all in same location, Mitcham. The rest are free to charge what they want, on average \u00a365- \u00a370 a day! Full time place in our nursery costs \u00a31380 / month!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to either subsidise the fees, or provide more Council run, affordable alternatives, or offer a bursary for women returning back to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt should be financially rewarding to return back to work rather than being better off at home on benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany women cannot afford to work, or are working two jobs just to cover the childcare. This is totally unacceptable\r\n\r\n",
