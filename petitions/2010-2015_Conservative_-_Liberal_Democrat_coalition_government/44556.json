        "additional_details": "I propose that any person who wishes to keep any animal in the UK should first undergo some form of theoretical study on thier chosen animal to learn how to care for them correctly. Underpinning enviroment, psychology of the animal, feeding, exercise, identification, behavioural attributes, insurance, veterinary care and basic first aid, socialisation.\r\n\r\nThis should be continually enforced and those without a certificate showing that they have undergone this study will then be able to obtain a licence. Spot checks can be carried out by any animal professional and If no licence is held the owner must either comply with this to obtain a licence or risk losing thier animal and be given a fine.",
