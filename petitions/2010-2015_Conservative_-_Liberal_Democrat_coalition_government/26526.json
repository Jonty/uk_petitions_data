        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the UK should enact a Veterans Act in much the same way that the USA has one. As government increasingly places the lives and wellbeing of our armed services personnel at risk around the globe, those who have been prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice need respect and rights enshrined in legislation such that they are not adversely discriminated against or receive a lesser opportunity than the wider population. Such legislation would ensure the long-term effects of seeing conflict at close hand do not become an impediment to playing a full part in society at the end of the military contract.",
