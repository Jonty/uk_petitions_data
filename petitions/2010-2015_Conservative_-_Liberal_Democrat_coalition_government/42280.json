        "additional_details": "I want the Government to intervene to stop MK council being allowed to sell a plot of land to Sainsburies for trading purposes. The land is next to Denbigh Secondary School and has been used as a leisure facility - swimming complex -  for the local community, for the last 15 years. Please evoke the sprit of 2012 to halt this process - changing land use from sport and leisure to trading surely is illegal. The supermarket recently purchased Netto's on the same site and developed a Sainsburies Local. School children need a sporting/swimming complex not more food shops. We have 7 major supermarkets with a 10 mile radius already.",
