        "additional_details": "Increasing the retirement age to 67 years across the board is fundamentally unfair, it does not take into account peoples personal circumstances, their health, working environments,fitness,tax and NI contributions etc. Making people work an extra 2 years will only put more strain on the NHS and deprive the young of much needed jobs. As you are aware we are told people are living longer, this may be true for some but what quality of life will you have when you are being told to work until you drop.I hope you will join me in signing this petition so we can have proper debate and hopefully come up with a better and fairer solution than we have now .
