They need to ask this to the people who suffers from varicose veins and how relevant the term used \"cosmetic\" to the condition. It is painful, stressful and uncomfortable to live with. I dont know who's idea was not to fund through NHS and consider it cosmetic, but I can tell you that, that person does not suffer with varicose veins. So somebody needs to make them aware, how this is a disease, but not a \"cosmetic\" condition.",
