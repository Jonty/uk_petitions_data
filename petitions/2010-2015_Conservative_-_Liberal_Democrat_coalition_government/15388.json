        "additional_details": "The TV licence fee should be abolished because the BBC no longer reflects the views or interests of the nation.  It no longer seems able to provide valuable programming & instead just chases after ratings along with other commercial stations.  They have also entered into an anti-competitive agreement with pay TV company BSkyB which has made it impossible for any free to air TV company to compete to win the Formula 1 broadcast rights therefore denying the vast majority of the viewing public access to another popular sport.  If they want to behave like a commercial station they shouldn\u2019t be able to do it with public money, the licence fee should be abolished & we should be able to pay for the stations we want.",
