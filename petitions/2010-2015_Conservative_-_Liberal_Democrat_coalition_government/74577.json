These deals should be linked to global fuel prices, with agreed margin, with upper and lower price bands, to allow semi-flexibility and competition, whilst enabling customers to choose between variable or semi-variable rates (with safeguards).\r\n\r\nFuel poverty has been linked to excess winter deaths and pressure on the NHS. This Legislation would help to lower the cost of energy and increase disposable income. ",
