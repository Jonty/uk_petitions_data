In total there are 11 million of us, United we become quite a force! Once, this PETITION when presented to David Cameron who pledged any petition with over 100,000 signatures will be discussed formally within the house.\r\nThe simple question is why is it PENSIONERS in this country are forced in winter months to choose between EAT & HEAT, particularly those who rely on oil for their Central Heating, which is a captive market for the oil suppliers, and further why is it not Regulated like other Energy Companies? Whilst  PENSIONERS ard denied the Right to Live with Dignity in Old Age?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gopetition.com/petitions/voice-of-the-pensioners.html\r\n",
