        "additional_details": "It's time for the government to take our children's safety seriously outside primary schools. Please sign this petition calling for the government to introduce volunteer traffic enforcement officers - with the same powers as those that are employed by councils. After training, they would be at every school, every day, morning and afternoon and issue penalties to those that park illegally and put the safety of our children at risk. A large proportion of parents in cars are able bodied adults who simply refuse to walk more than 10 metres to drop their child off at school. Every day I witness illegal parking on bends and double yellow lines, ridiculous speed of vehicles, driving along pavements and across grass areas near flats and 'stand offs' where neither car will move. I have had abuse because I REFUSE to drive along the pavement where children are walking AND it is illegal!  Please help avoid a tragedy waiting to happen. Thank you. ",
