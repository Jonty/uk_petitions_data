        "additional_details": "The issue of war is important because i feel it is wrong to have wars, people are putting their life on hold and at risk just for their country. You dont think it gets much worse until you hear that children are involved and most of the casulties involved are either Children or Women. In the 21st century, over 1.5 million children have been killed,and 4million are now disabled, this isn't how their lifes should be, Right? War child quotes \"children are amongst the first casulties of any armed conflict, the most vunerable & innocent of victims, 10million children have also been traumatised\"\r\n\r\nPlease support my petition if you think my peition is right.",
