        "additional_details": "Banks were blamed for the recession but estate agents were worse. When we have disposable income they encourage us to increase selling prices & in times of shortage, the only option for buyers is to pay. Banks colluded to provide maximum mortgage; beyond affordable!\r\nThe incentive to pay more must be removed.  Estate agents should work for a fixed fee restricted to a sensible amount for the work involved.\r\nThis should be set by government so that encouraging a seller to \u2018put on another few thousand\u2019 would only benefit the seller.\r\nBecause they work on a percentage, it is in their interest to increase beyond reason.\r\nAlternatively, or also, relate the loan to the main earner\u2019s salary like it used to be at 2.5 times.\r\nMaybe if house prices followed inflation more people could afford them. What chance do young people have now?  Don\u2019t let estate agents ruin the country again.\r\n",
