        "additional_details": "Every day we hear of cases where for example someone is not allowed to light a candle at a graveside as it is too dangerous, people are not allowed to try and save someone drowning as they don't have the correct training, people not allowed to clear snow from the front of their house etc. Only yesterday a frail old man I know asked someone to change a lightbulb for them and was told they couldn't because they were not allowed to stand on a chair. Health & safey regulations and the suing for damages culture is ruining what was once a helpful society. Make changes so we can help people without always having the correct training, equipment etc. and without fear of legal action.",
