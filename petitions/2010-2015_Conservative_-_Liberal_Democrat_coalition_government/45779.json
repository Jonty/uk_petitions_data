However i wish to change jobs so as now all jobs are online im registered with lots of local some government sites. There are thousands of jobs to apply for, but first of all to apply you hsve to sign i n with password which is never recognised so you try and change it but no this doesnt work but if eventually you do manage to get to apply the application form arrives in a heap and wont allow your application. If on the rare occassion you do get to apply well thats that nothing. For goodness sake lets get back to old fashioned job applications and newspaper or job paper advertisements. ",
