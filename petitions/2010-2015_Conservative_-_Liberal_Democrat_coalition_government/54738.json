        "additional_details": "I propose that the current slow and antiquated rail link between Norwich and London Liverpool Street be upgraded to a higher speed and newer cleaner rolling stock. Having 20 year old trains and a fully electrified route is senseless. This route should be high speed and take no longer than 1 hour not 2 hours to travel 120 miles! This is the slowest city to city route in the UK and should be upgraded.",
