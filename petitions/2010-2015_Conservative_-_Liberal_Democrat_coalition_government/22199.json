        "additional_details": "Plans to scrap Low Value Consignment Relief for goods coming in from the Channel Islands is shortsighted and reckless. It will result in either on the one hand job losses and massive costs for companies to move operations back to the mainland or consumers being forced to pay not only the VAT, but Royal Mail charges of something like \u00a38 a time. The result either way till be severe harm to the economy. Either abandon this idea now, or start saving up for when the companies involved challenge this crazy and very likely unlawful idea.",
