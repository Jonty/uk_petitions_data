No-one really knows the reason for this.\r\n\r\nIs it because there is no candidate/party they wish to support?\r\n\r\nOr is it because they are simply disinterested in politics?\r\n\r\nIf all ballot papers included at the bottom \"No Suitable Candidate\" or \"None of the Above\" then people could exercise their right to vote without actually having to support a candidate. The benefit of this would be to:\r\n\r\n1) potentially increase the turn out at elections\r\n\r\n2) provide an indication of how many people don't feel the political parties available represent them\r\n\r\nThe political establishment can then decide how to respond.",
