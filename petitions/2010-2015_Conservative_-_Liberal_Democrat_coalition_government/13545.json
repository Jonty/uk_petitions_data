        "additional_details": "The Petitioners argue that this will reduce the duplication of topics whereby separate ePetitions represent only those \u201cfor\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d a new policy. This change could also encourage more people to express their policy preferences: it would thus serve the interests of both voters and politicians by utilising the flexibility of the Internet in order to actually enhance the democratic process (rather than merely gauging support for only one side of public opinion ... in reality it is the quantitative gap between those \u2018for\u2019 and \u2018against\u2019 which should be of greater interest to government).\r\nIn sum, the Petitioners urge the government to be more innovative in their facilitation of eDemocracy  - by actually harnessing  the inherent flexibility of the Internet in a more creative manner, and, in this particular instance, to reduce the democratic deficit (e.g. the one-sidedness) generic to traditional Petitions by designing an online facility that does more than simply offer an \u2018e\u2019 version.",
