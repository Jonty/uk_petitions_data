        "additional_details": "I, as a citizen of the United Kingdom, do not understand the complexities of the European Union. If you go ahead with a referendum on whether the UK should stay as a member of the EU, something that the majority of British citizens do not understand, I ask that you please hold a referendum on whether we should listen to scientists who are not contracted by large conglomerates as to the use of materials gained from the strip mining and fracking businesses, the palm oil and timber trades, and that we keep to the carbon emissions goals that were set out in the Kyoto protocol. This is something that I understand and believe should happen. Together we can make this a better world.",
