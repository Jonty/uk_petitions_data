Yet I along with many of my friends and people that I meet in my day to day living smoke HERB.\r\nWe are constantly troubled and harased by indavisual  calling thier selfes the LAW. I am putting this together so as to get them out of our hair per say as HERB has many a benafits, both smoked as well eaten, so free excess, even abilty to hold it on our person will make for better living, MORE PEACABLE.                              Thanking You\r\n                                                    RSimons",
