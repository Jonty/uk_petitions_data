        "additional_details": "I wish to place for consideration the banning of the use of ANPR cameras in public car parks. These cameras take details of every vehicle which uses the car park in the off-chance that perhaps one car in a thousand will have overstayed an agreed parking time.\r\nThe use of this technology is an abuse of our right to privacy. The collection of the details of all visitors to a car park is a breach of civil liberties.\r\nWe already have intervention by the ICO to ban disproprtionate use of CCTV footage by councils, and consideration is presently in hand to ban CCTV spy cars to catch parking infringments.\r\nThe use of ANPR is exactly the same situation and is also the same sort of breach of privacy and should be stopped forthwith.",
