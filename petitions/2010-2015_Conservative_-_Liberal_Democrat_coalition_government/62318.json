        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Cabinet and the FCO to take all efforts necessary to over turn this in the EU Council. A continued lack of action by the UK Government regarding Spanish abuses of British Gibraltarian's Rights is no longer acceptable. Spain's strong-arming to force the exclusion from the Single Skies directive compounds the Waters Incursions and the Border Crossing issues. We demand the UK Government now take more pro-active action.",
