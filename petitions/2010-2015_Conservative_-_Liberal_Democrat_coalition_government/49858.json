In the democratic age that decision should be the peoples, and not those who can be influenced by others who may have vested interests in oil, money, power and control.\r\n\r\nSince the dawn of civilization it is governments who have decided when to go to war which is the single most important decision that a nation can make.\r\n\r\nWe choose our governments however we have no real choice in the wars that our governments choose to fight.\r\n",
