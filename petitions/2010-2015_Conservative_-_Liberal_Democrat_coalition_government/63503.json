This must be introduced before the next general election and before MP's salaries are increased. MPs office cost must be standardised and a fixed payment be made for all MPs with a constituency that is more than 90 minutes travelling time from Parliament to cover travelling and second home rental costs. Capital gains on second homes supported by expenses must be subject to taxation equal to at least twice the support given plus interest.",
