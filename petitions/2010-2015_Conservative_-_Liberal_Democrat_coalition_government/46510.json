The parlous bus services in the country have no interest for our dishonourables because none of them uses the buses.  Our appalling failed rail network has no interest for our dishonourables because none fo them uses the trains.  Our increasing gas and electricity costs have no interest for our dishonourables because WE pay their bills through their expenses accounts.  THIS MUST STOP.  NO MP SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO CHARGE LIVING COSTS - WHICH WE CANNOT ALSO CHARGE TO OUR TAXES - TO THE TAXPAYER FUNDED MP EXPENSES SCHEME.",
