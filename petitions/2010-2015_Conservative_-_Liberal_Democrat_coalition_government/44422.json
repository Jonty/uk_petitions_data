        "additional_details": "We urge the government to rethink its policies on population growth in the UK, by seriously considering its impact on wildlife.\r\nReasons:\r\n-The UK is an Island.\r\n-We have an overly large human population of 62million which is growing.\r\n- Scientific surveys are showing that species, such as: Bumble bees, Corncrakes, Bats, Crickets, Ground Beetles, Wildcats, Dormice, Starlings, Sparrows, Woodpeckers, Warblers, Hedgehogs, are threatened by, and going extinct due to habitat loss through human construction.\r\n-As our population grows, more houses, roads, schools, shops, airports, golf courses will be built. This will destroy remaining wildlife habitat, like grass lands, ponds, bogs and woods.\r\n-Since 1930, 98% of wildflower meadows, that are bumble bee habitat have been lost to farming, and development.\r\nWe the undersigned urge the government to recognise that wildlife is vital to our future",
