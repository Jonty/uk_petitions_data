Chairman Bob Lord successfully convinced fellow Football League Chairmen that televised matches on a Saturday afternoon would have a negative effect on the attendances of other football league games that were not being televised and as a result reduce their financial income.\r\n\r\nAs a result The FA, Premier League and Football League do not want English matches to be televised live between 2:45pm and 5:15pm on a Saturday within the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nTo cut this short, if this gets 100,000 signatures, then it will be discussed in the House of Commons, which will bring this antiquated ruling one step closer to being scrapped.\r\n\r\nPLEASE TAKE A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME TO SIGN THIS PETITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
