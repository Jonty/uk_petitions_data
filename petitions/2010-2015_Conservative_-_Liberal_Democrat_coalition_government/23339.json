The Police officer only escaped with his life due to the quick actions of a retired passing surgeon. This hit the national press and occurred in December 2010.\r\n\r\nDuring the London Riots in August 2011 there were also two seperate incidents where two seperate police officers were run over by looters attempting to make good their escape. There were arrests for attempted murder in relation to these incidents. They also made the national press.\r\n\r\nToday the 19th November 2011 four police officers were stabbed after responding to a 999 call from a member of the public on Kingsbury Road, Brent. This incident made the national press.\r\n\r\nWhy are all of our front line police officers not equipped with NON LEATHAL Taser as a tool to deal with such violent offenders?",
