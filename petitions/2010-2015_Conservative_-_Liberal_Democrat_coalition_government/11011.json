This would have many benefits:\r\n\r\nEncourages healthier eating (you can't get healthier than fresh fruit and veg). Encourages exercise (gardening is hard work). Lowers emissions (food doesn't need to be transported). Saves money (buy less food, grow your own). Increases GDP (creating a product)",
