Similary, If tens of thousands have voted on a petition a few MPs should not be able to stop the majority because of their position. Lib dems go on about how they believe in democracy but are not being democratic by stopping the will of the majority. If over a hundred thousand people vote on a petition it should get a fair hearing not be blocked by Mr Clegg.",
