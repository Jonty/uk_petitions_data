        "additional_details": "Staff at the New South Glasgow Hospital have a major problem, the issue is there is NO parking available for staff without permit within hospital grounds & there are now NO parking areas in the street surrounding the hospital due to new council restrictions. The staff have NO option to drive to work & are forced to use the poor & limited public transport service to commute to & from work. The NHS requires staff to work 365 days a year & they must travel to work in all weather conditions no matter how treacherous. These factors cause major difficulties when using public transport to get to work. Most shifts start at 0730 or 1930 when public transport is running a decreased service which causes problems for staff trying to start a shift on time. Furthermore, the added stress & time onto an already long, physically & mentally demanding work day & the risk of travelling to/from work alone in the dark causes concerns. Please sign our petition to support your NHS staff. HELP US HELP YOU!\r\n\r\n",
