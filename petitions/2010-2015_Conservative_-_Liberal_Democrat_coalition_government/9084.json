        "additional_details": "The police force are not entirely blameless for the riots in English cities during August 2011. The killing of Mark Duggan was the catalyst that sparked the riots and what followed was ineffective policing in the early stages when the opportunity to prevent the riots spreading was missed. The reasons given for their unwillingness to intervene have referred to the police officer responsible for the death of Ian Tomlinson facing manslaughter charges. This is deliberate misconduct and dereliction of duty. It is not for the officer on the street to decide what they will and will not police and it seems they are effectively holding the public to ransom for immunity from prosecution when they break the law. They need to police our streets the way they are told to police them by the people they work for not make demands by staging strike action during a major disturbance. Serious questions need answering for this mess which they started and then encourage by non-action.",
