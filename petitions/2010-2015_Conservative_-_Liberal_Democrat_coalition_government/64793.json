The intention was to publicise the names of officers who have exhibited unacceptable behaviour. Once listed, the chance of being offered employment is likely to be much reduced.\r\n\r\nHere is one example of a WB whose name may soon be added to the list. He has exhibited behaviour considered unacceptable by his employer yet wholly creditable by others:\r\n\r\n21/11/13 The Times, in its main leader article, said the WB had \"performed an important service\" (para 12, http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article3927339.ece)\r\n\r\n10/04/14 Bernard Jenkin MP: \"we are indebted to [him] for his courage in speaking out, in fulfilment of his duty to the highest standards of public service despite intense pressure to the contrary\"\r\n(http://www.theyworkforyou.com/debate/?id=2014-04-10a.441.3)",
