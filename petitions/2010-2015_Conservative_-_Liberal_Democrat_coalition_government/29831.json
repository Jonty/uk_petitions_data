        "additional_details": "UKBA has recently announced new Visa Fee to be enforced wef 06-04-2012 after parliamentary approval. Visa Fee for Tier 1 (General) category has been raised by 50% which is totally unfair. It has already been increased by 50 % for a Main applicant and at a ridiculous rate of 500 % for each dependent. Unfortunately, the statement of the immigration minister about this increase gives an impression that migrants are not UK tax payers. (Source www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk News 09-02-12)\r\n\r\nIn fact, migrants are equally contributing towards the economy by paying taxes and NI. I believe that such statements create confusions and may put migrants at risk of facing direct or indirect racial abuse from the majority of the public who are not aware of the ins and outs of current immigration system and who think that every migrant is on welfare benefits.\r\n\r\nI therefore through this petition request you to stop these unjustified increases.\r\n",
