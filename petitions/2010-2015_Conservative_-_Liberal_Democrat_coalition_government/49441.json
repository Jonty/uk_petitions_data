        "additional_details": "There are:\r\n* ~1.2 million wheelchair users in the UK (Papworth Trust)\r\n*~2.1 million children aged 0-3 (calculated from birth rates) likely to be in pushchairs\r\n*An unknown number of people who struggle to climb stairs or need a step free route due to heavy baggage\r\nDue to the design of trains, assistance must be booked for people who require it, and it should be clear to people using a step-free route planner that they need to book if needed, but not having a route planner offering a step-free option makes planning journeys harder. Information about each station exists but for more complex journeys it is a slow and demanding process for people to calculate the route they require. It also makes it hard for people needing a step free route to plan the fastest journey. National Rail should take the TfL step-free route planner as a model and create a similar step-free planner for their website to enable people who require these journeys to view routes.",
