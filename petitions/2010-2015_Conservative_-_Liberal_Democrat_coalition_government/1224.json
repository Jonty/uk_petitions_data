NATIONAL SERVICE COULD BE USED TO BREAK THIS CYCLE BY TAKING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND INTRODUCING THEM TO A CULTURE OF STRICT DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING FROM WHICH SELF DISCIPLINE DEVELOPS.I BELIEVE IT BE FOR A MINIMUM OF A YEAR BUT  OPEN ENDED FOR THE UNEMPLOYED IE UNTIL BEHAVIOUR IS SATISFACTORY OR EMPLOYMENT OBTAINED. FOR THE EMPLOYED IT COULD BE SPLIT UP INTO ONE MONTH A YEAR MODULES EG. SIMILAR TO THE TA. IT NEED NOT BE EXPENSIVE AS ONLY EMPLOYERS WOULD NEED COMPENSATING.BENEFIT PAYMENTS WOULD REMAIN THE SAME. COST SAVINGS WOULD BE FROM REDUCING STATE PEPENDENCY. ",
