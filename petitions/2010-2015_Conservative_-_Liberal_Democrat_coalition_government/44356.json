        "additional_details": "We urge the United Kingdom Government to create a single Motorway Police Unit and for them to be deployed in large numbers to monitor and stop dangerous driving on UK Motorways.\r\n\r\nYou only have to be on the motorway for 2 minutes to see people tailgating at 80mph, crossing all 3 lanes straight from the slip road causing a major hazard for all other drivers. Lorry drivers eating their dinner whilst driving and being in no control of the HGV and some going well over 100mph even during raining weather conditions.\r\n\r\nThis problem is causing many people to avoid the motorways altogether, whilst all other roads have a police presence, the motorway seems to have none. As on a recent trip from Manchester to Luton there was not a single police car to be seen on the M6 and then the M1, this has led to consensus that anything goes on the Motorway but this is risking the lives of all other users of the roads.\r\n\r\n",
