        "additional_details": "There is an overwhelming public opinion to reduce or freeze the Foreign Aid budget and use these funds to allow fuel duty to be reduced. This will in turn have two effects, it will encourage countries that receive aid to invest in long term solutions to the problems they face, eventually allowing less aid to be provided. Secondly, the reduction in fuel duty will encourage spending on other goods ultimately leading to economic growth. ",
