        "additional_details": "DRM digital radio for the existing Short, medium, and longwave bands should be introduced to the UK without delay.\r\n\r\nThis should be done at 'reasonable' cost to the providers in terms of licencing fees, to enable a number of new independent national broadcasters.\r\n\r\nThe existing DAB network is far too expensive, and far too 'closed' - DRM being an 'open' system of digital radio broadcasting enabling low cost 'one-off' national broadcasting radio stations with reliable reception in cars.\r\n\r\nPriority for issuing an affordable broadcast licence should go to the basic BBC stations, a national traffic information service, and Radio Caroline (who have sought a 'legal' national broadcasting licence since ending offshore broadcasts in 1991).",
