        "action": "Standardise UK parking & traffic offences & procedures",
        "additional_details": "Parking & traffic offences are currently managed at local council level, resulting in myriad of different policies & procedures, duplicating each other and causing confusion for motorists.\r\n\r\nLondon councils (for example) manage individual traffic & parking enforcement & appeals.\r\n\r\nThis is a waste of tax payers money at local and national government levels. Secondly each authority levies different amounts for each offence. However UK motorway contraventions are issued by the police & carry standard fines &/or driving licence endorsements.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to standardise & create a single independent body for issuing charge notices & managing the appeals processes for:\r\n\r\n1/ Parking & traffic fines. (E.g. box junctions)\r\n2/ Appeals process & bodies.\r\n\r\nThese will provide clear unambiguous rules & policies for motorists, eliminating wasteful duplication of services across the country.",
