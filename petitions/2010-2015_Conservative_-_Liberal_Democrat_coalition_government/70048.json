        "additional_details": "The taxes imposed on the wealthy of this country is ridiculous, we need to find a sustainable or fairer way on taxing certain citizens. Possible solutions would be cutting down possibly on the unnecessary institutions in our budget or working towards a society which is capable of paying what they can. If this is not possible then tax avoidance will just become common and people will become residents of countries which are more lenient toward taxation.",
