        "additional_details": "to stop support staff having forced upon them the change in their long term contracts.  It is unacceptable to expect support staff to not have the same conditions as teaching staff in that the change in contracts would mean they would not get paid during some of the school holidays.  As they have no option but to work within the times and terms of a school year, it is unfair not to be paid during this time but not have the flexibility to take holidays as non-educational council workers can.  Support staff are now more involved in the planning and teaching of pupils and their jobs have become more complex over the years, for no recompense.  Most support staff in this situation have given many years of loyal support to their schools and often worked beyond their contracted hours.  They should be rewarded for this and not penalised. ",
