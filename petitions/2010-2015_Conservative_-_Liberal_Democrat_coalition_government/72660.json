        "additional_details": "Many Councils in England have an outdated system that does not represent the will of the people.\r\nI would like Election reform before any devolution of powers so all councils in England have to have all councillors/seats on the council come up for election at the same time so the peoples vote is represented by who is in power after the election. Too often when people want real change it takes several elections before the balance of power can be tipped from one group/party in a council and that is not democracy.\r\n",
