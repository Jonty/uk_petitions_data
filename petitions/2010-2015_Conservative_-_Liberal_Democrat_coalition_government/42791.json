        "additional_details": "When the government introduces a legal requirement for people to use specific services, they should also set up complimentary legal controls on those services.\r\nAt the current time we have the situation where the charges for gas fitting services can be in the region of \u00a31000 per day.  How long will it be, before the charges become \u00a3 2000, or maybe \u00a33000 per day?\r\n Such charges are supported and enforced by the government through their legislation that forces people to have to use these services no matter what the cost.\r\n It is totally unfair that people, who could be on a wage of \u00a36.19 per hour, should be forced by the government, to pay \u00a3100 or \u00a3200 maybe \u00a3300 per hour. This is on the border line of extortion by the gas industry.\r\nThe government should establish reasonable charges for specific tasks (such as changing a water pump) that a competent gas engineer should be able to achieve in a reasonable time and cost.\r\n",
