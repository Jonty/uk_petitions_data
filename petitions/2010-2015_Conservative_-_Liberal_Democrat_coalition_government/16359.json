        "additional_details": "The Council Tax Benefit scheme, which provides financial support to millions of people who cannot afford to pay their full Council Tax, is being replaced by a 'localised support' scheme.  Public consultation is out now. The current scheme is a national one with nationally applied rules and is an important element in providing a basic safety net. The new one has a number of odious features: the total amount paid will be reduced by 10% but as pensioners will not lose out it is those of working age that will bear the brunt. Each council can set its own criteria removing the universality of the current scheme. It will place intolerable burdens on councils who will get the blame for this centrally imposed reduction. The DCLG should go back to the drawing board.
