        "additional_details": "I want the TV licence abolished. This is an unfair and unjust way of stealing public money. We should not be held to ransom by the government whom dictate that we pay for a service that we may not want or need. We have plenty of alternatives and should be allowed our freedom of choice. Our choice is not to pay anything towards a service involuntary.  As consumers we pay for independent TV and I believe that if the BBC wishes to continue then it should claim revenue as others do and not by force. ",
