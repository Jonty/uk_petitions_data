        "additional_details": "In a recent survey, 4 in 5 girls aged 17 admitted to being unhappy with their bodies. In such cases, low self-esteem often leads to depression and/ or eating disorders, which in turn lead to more serious health issues.\r\n\r\nThe media paints an unrealistic picture of the kind of body that both men and women should be striving towards. Airbrushing is fast becoming one of the main techniques used to enhance a model's appearance (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYhCn0jf46U)  but the damaging effect that this has on the mental health of so many young people is too serious to ignore.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to ban airbrushing in all media aimed at the most vulnerable and most easily influenced generation: the under-18s.\r\n\r\nIt's time for us to realise: it is our imperfections that make us perfect; our diversity that makes us human.\r\n\r\nThis petition is part of the National Citizen Service's I'mperfect campaign (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Imperfect/576726269029950). Thanks for your support!",
