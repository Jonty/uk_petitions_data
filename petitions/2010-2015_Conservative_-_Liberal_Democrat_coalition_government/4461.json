        "additional_details": "The majority of our politicians see their jobs as a gravy train and have no connection at all with the bottom rung of our society. They enter politics not to improve society; but for the money that they can make during and after their political careers. I propose that all politicians be paid the same as the lowest rung of our society and that they forgo all outside financial interests and assets. That no politician be permitted to sit on the boards of private or public companies during or after their political careers and that any job taken after a politician\u2019s political career should have a financial cap. That specific housing be built for all politicians in London and that each constituency have a set property assigned to a politician. These properties should be built in the poorest areas of each constituency.  This would attract only those politicians who are interested in changing society for the better and it would prevent the obvious corruption of politicians by business.     ",
