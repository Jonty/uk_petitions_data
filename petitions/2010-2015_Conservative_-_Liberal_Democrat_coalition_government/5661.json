The Khmer Rouge gathered the vast majority of the educated people in Cambodia and murdered them. Today, Cambodia is lacking in a real educational system and families who are stricken by poverty (90% of the population) are forced to work hard in bad circumstances rather than to attend school.\r\n\r\nThis petition is aimed at our government donating a school in every province in Cambodia. Our government will build a school, furnish it, set a school curriculum, train the teachers and the school will be free to all Khmer nationals. The government will also set up a volunteer programme for English nationals from various trades to travel to Cambodia and help with the process such as; building, teaching, painting etc.\r\n\r\nThis is a chance for our country to do something selfless and giving, and for our country to take part in something that no country has ever done before.
