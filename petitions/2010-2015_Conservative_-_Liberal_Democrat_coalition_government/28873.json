The four year re-election cycle has prioritized short-term gain over long-term solutions for results within an election year.\r\nWe believe this prioritization of public perception over actual achievement is detrimental to the country.\r\nWe seek the extension of the period of office to ten years, with increased powers of recall to ensure government accountability. In this way we hope the government can commit to stronger plans for the future. ",
