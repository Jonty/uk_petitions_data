        "additional_details": "This will save money and lives!!\r\n\r\nThe curability of most cancers is much better when the cancer is caught in early stages. Unfortunately, misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis of cancer are very common. Many deaths could be prevented if the rate of misdiagnosis was not so high.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 10 to 20 percent of all cases of cancer are misdiagnosed. One study found that about 28 percent of the mistakes made out of 583 cases were life threatening or life altering. It is estimated that at least 40,000 cancer patients die each year as a result of misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis. Many cases of misdiagnosis go unreported, so the statistics surrounding cancer misdiagnosis are rough estimates based on the number of cases that are reported.\r\n\r\nWe need something like the Airlines, Aviation Safety team encompassing the theory, investigation, and categorisation of failures, and the prevention of such failures through regulation, education, and training.",
