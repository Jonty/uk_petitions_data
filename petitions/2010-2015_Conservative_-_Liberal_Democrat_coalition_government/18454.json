Some just breed ponies for profit.\r\n\r\nWe should outlaw all 'hobby farms' now before we have a huge famine looming on the horizon.\r\n\r\nLet us get our agricultural industry in the best possible shape for this over populated island and every piece of land put under the plough and not given to property developers and 'hobby farms' buyers.\r\n\r\nVote for a law against 'hobby farms' and developers owning agricultural land.\r\n",
