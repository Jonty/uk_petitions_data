        "additional_details": "A 5% tax to be added to purchases using a debit or credit card, whether online or in person in shops. This will encourage payment by cash in shops, in the long run keeping shops open, more people in employment and making the economy stronger. Also, this will allow people to control their finances more easily by making their spending very visible. This should also help people move away from using credit cards and help with only buying things they can actually afford (austerity I know but it is necessary). This tax is to be taken off at the time of each purchase and needs to be shown on the receipt as well as a sub-total on bank statements.",
