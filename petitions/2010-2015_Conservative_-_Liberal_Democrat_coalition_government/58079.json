Granted, medicine can help people, however psychological studies have shown that medication is mainly short term. The longer term, more appropriate option is counselling. There are many different types for all sorts of problems, examples being CBT and psychology, but the waiting list for these is absolutely diabolical. On average, 7 months is the time that an adult could wait up to to even get a consultation, and then there is more time on top of that to fit in appointments around jobs, school, children etc. People do not (quite rightly) want to wait this amount of time, and\r\nI am calling for faster responses for those who really need it.
