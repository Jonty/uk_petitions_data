        "additional_details": "London has the highest rate of TB in Western Europe. Brent and Newham had the highest rates in London.\r\n\r\nThe People with TB are good people, they may not have much money, some are homeless, but they are still good people who do not deserve to have TB.\r\n\r\nOther countries and cities have invested in TB city wide projects, to reduce TB through screening and vaccinations.\r\n\r\nLondon hasn't and therefore has the highest rate of TB.\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend Mandy had TB and died in 2010. In two years time Great Britain will have more people with TB than America if nothing is done.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so the London TB Plan can be implemented.",
