        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, ask the leader of the house of commons, to ask government to ask the British people to stop using foods and products that contain palm oil.  Palm oil is grown where tropical rainforests once stood.  This would help to stop the palm oil industry growing palm oil and would help the tropical rainforests grow back in Borneo and the Amazon, and would give our kids a decent planet to inherit.  This would help to slow global warming and the 6th mass extinction.\r\nFoods containing palm oil include, sliced bread, digestive buscuits, saltanas, chocolate, chocolate eclares etc. F Hooton",
