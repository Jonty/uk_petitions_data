        "additional_details": "I think the british people should vote to make a new bill that states that political parties are not allowed to win an election by fraudent purposes. By that, I mean they shouldn't be legally allowed to lie and say they're going to do this and that in order to win the election and then do the opposite after the election. Politicians lie in order to win an election and in my opinion, that's winning the election by fraud and deception. If regular british people won a competition in a fraudulent way then they would be given a prison sentence, yet politicians are allowed to fraudulently win an election. Politicians lieing to win an election is a disgrace and an insult to this great country. and also an insult to the monarchy.",
