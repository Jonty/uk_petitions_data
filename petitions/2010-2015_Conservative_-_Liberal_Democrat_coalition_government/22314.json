This is not \"metal bashing\" but to develope thes industries and new start up companies and safe guard the existing ones;\r\n the government should give tax breaks in these sectors. It is no good investing in an industry such as steel when you have to compete against chinese wages  but can compete against china when you have products which cannot be copied.",
