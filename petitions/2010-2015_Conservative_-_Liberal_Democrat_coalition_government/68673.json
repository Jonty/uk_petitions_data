        "additional_details": "The Burka in the UK is becoming a problem. Not only for people who don't wear, but also for the women who are forced to. Do you feel safe around women in Burka's not knowing their identity? Personally, i do not. I have heard about countless events where people have sneaked or escaped from the Police because they are disguised in Burkas. Is this really what we want in our country? Women being forced to wear Burkas displays clear sexism and it needs to be stopped. Why do we have to take Balaclavas off yet Muslim women can keep Burkas on? Sign the petition and #BanTheBurkah",
