        "additional_details": "I see so many children cycling to school without a cycle helmet. I am also aware of the severe damage even a simple, low speed collision with a cyclist can have on a young persons head if that head was to make sudden impact with the road.  Although it should be parents sending their children to school with helmets on, by the schools providing cycle racks, they are equally responsible for the safety of the children cycling to school, and therefore could enforce such a rule.",
