        "additional_details": "On 19th July 1972, Staff Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba lost his life during the Battle of Mirbat, when 9 SAS soldiers defended the town of Mirbat from a force of 250 highly trained Adoo communist Guerrillas. He single handedly defended a 25lb artillery gun position, firing the gun on his own (this usually takes 4-6 men to operate) for over an hour, while wounded, after being shot in the jaw. Later on during the battle, while continuing to defend the position, he was shot in the neck, and killed. His actions kept the Adoo pinned down and prevented them from taking the position, the precious gun, and the town of Mirbat itself. He only received a Mention in Dispatches for his outstanding bravery, the lowest possible award he could have been given. He deserved so much more than this. Please sign this petition to ask the government to award him with the Posthumous VC he clearly deserves.",
