        "additional_details": "Dr Stephen Hawking CBE is the face of science. His ideas have set new boundries in the understanding of the universe.\r\n\r\nA recogniseable figure internationally he has inspired a legacy of learning through not only the understanding of physics but also the understanding of the need for others to be inspired to learn and challenge their beliefs.\r\n\r\nSeverely handicapped he is a positive role model for what is achievable. An icon for many to emulate and strive to equal.\r\n\r\nSociety recently draws us to consider minor fleeting no one's to be the pinicle of modern UK morality - having achieved or delivered little or on many occasions; nothing.\r\n\r\nStephen Hawking I feel deserves the final acknowledgement of a Knighthood for his achievements and his role as a positive figure of what can be achieved through disability.",
