        "additional_details": "The Leveson inquiry has suggested that regulation underpinned by statute is necessary to maintain press standards. This is wrong and will demolish a proud, British tradition that is centuries old.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system, those journalists and newspapers that have crossed the line and transgressed the law by hacking phones, for example, are in the process of being dealt with justly, through the courts.\r\n\r\nResponding to Leveson should be a matter of analysing existing laws, criminal and civil, and at most requesting an area on the front page of newspapers for corrections and apologies.\r\n\r\nWe must not allow civil liberties to be gutted by this wave of populism before principle, panic before sound judgement or matters of politics overriding policy.\r\n\r\nProtect and restore our freedoms and civil liberties, we, the undersigned, implore you to stop our democracy from crossing this rubicon.",
