        "additional_details": "A worrying number of deaths (thought to number approximately 300 since 2000) of Black people have occurred whilst in Police custody, or after contact with the Police. Explanations for these deaths, and serious injuries, tend to be unsatisfactory and it is popularly believed that no police officer has been convicted in connection with these deaths or injuries in the past ten years. This background seriously undermines the relationship between the Black Community and the Police. This petition calls for the government to order an Inquiry into this phenomenon; and since several incidents were preceded by journeys in police vehicles this petition calls for cameras to be installed in all police veheicle.",
