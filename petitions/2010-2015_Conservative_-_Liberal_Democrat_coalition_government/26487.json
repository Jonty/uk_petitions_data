Said Referendum to be held asap, say no longer than a month from the date of Grant.\r\n\r\nIf the result(by simple majority) is in favourof the UK, then legislation should be enacted, without delay, which amends all Devolution Acts in 2 ways:\r\n\t1). That the wishes of the British People are paramount and cannot be set aside or changed without further UK wide Referenda which authorises the UK Parliament to act on the outcome of their wishes,\r\n\t2). No Referenda or Vote can be held in the constituent Countries which affects or threatens the continued existence of the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
