        "additional_details": "Steiner education is based on anthroposophy, the occult belief system devised by Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925).\r\nThe central idea of anthroposophy is that the human race is evolving from dark skinned negroes to white skinned aryans.\r\n Steiner claimed to have developed this education method from his personal discussions with the spirit world.\r\n The purpose of Steiner education is to enable children's souls to incarnate successfully. This information is deliberately hidden from prospective parents some of whom never find out about the deep connection to anthroposophy.\r\n How our children are educated is a concern for the whole of society, not just parents.\r\n There are four publicly funded Steiner schools in the UK (Bristol, Exeter, Frome and Hereford) and more applying.\r\nWe ask the Department for Education to stop funding Steiner education.\r\nThis campaign has been launched to raise public awareness.\r\n For more information visit: http://stopsteinerinstroud.com/ ",
