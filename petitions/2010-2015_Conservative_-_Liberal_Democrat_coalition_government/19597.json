        "additional_details": "I have been working for local government for nearly 14 years.  I have always been proud to say who I work for, until now.  I am completely embarrassed by what Cambridgeshire Councillors have done regards pay increases.\r\nAt a time when cost savings are being driven through, when people are losing their livelihood\u2019s and services \u2013 how can Councillors justify giving themselves a 25% pay increase !!!!!\r\nIs this really what the \u2018BIG SOCIETY\u2019 is, the workers and the community take the brunt of the cutbacks while the \u2018BIG WIGS\u2019 sit back and make a profit out of our loss.\r\nThey say it\u2019s to bring new blood into Councils, but with elections another 4 years away \u2013 how they can justify implementing this change now.\r\nThe Chief Executive of the Council \u2018Mark Lloyd\u2019 has even taken a pay cut to show we are all in this together.\r\nPlease can you look into this, hopefully you will see how totally unacceptable this sort of thing is and do something about it.\r\n",
