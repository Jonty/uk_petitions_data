        "additional_details": "The Welsh Government announced a five year vaccination programme of badgers in Wales. Not only is vaccination the more sustainable and humane solution, but vaccination has already been shown to significantly reduce the prevalence and severity of disease in the badger population and could reduce the potential for transmission of TB from badgers to cattle.\r\n\r\nThe cull could see badger populations decline by over 70% and in some areas none may survive.\r\n\r\nCulling cannot be selective, so many healthy badgers will be slaughtered as \u2018collateral damage\u2019.\r\n\r\nDefra\u2019s own calculations indicate only a very modest drop in cattle TB levels averaging just 16% after nine and half years.\r\n\r\nI urge you to rethink the cull and follow in the Wales' footsteps, implementing a vaccination programme with increased levels of testing and improved biosecurity - more effective ways of eradicating bovineTB in cattle for good.",
