        "additional_details": "We, the general public of the United Kingdom, believe that Radical cleric Anjem Choudary should be given back his passport so that he may emigrate to Syria. A leading promotor of the implementation of Sharia Law, he is a danger to the UK's impressionable youth and an adversary to the UK's most fundamental ideas. The return of his passport would have little to no effect on the current situation in Syria and Iraq, and would greatly soothe the damage he has caused in the United Kingdom. ",
