        "additional_details": "The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill is currently undergoing review. This act allows legal gatherings to be reclassified and arrests made if there is a belief anti social behavior may occour. This also grants local authorities, police and even private security firms sweeping powers to bar citizens from assembling lawfully in public spaces This law is vague , open to abuse, and violates rights to protest and freedom of assembly. If passed this would take the United Kingdom into the realm of police state. Without the rights to free assembly there can be no democracy. Please reject this act. ",
