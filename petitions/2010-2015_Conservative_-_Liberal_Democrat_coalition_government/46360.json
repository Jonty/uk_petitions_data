The company then put it back up for sale at the original face value for someone else to buy.  Everyone is a winner.\r\n\r\nAlso why not go a step further and print the buyers name on every ticket so they have to produce ID when they attend the gig?\r\n\r\nWhy should anyone be able to sell a face value ticket of \u00a355 on e-bay for over \u00a3200. it is just greed pure and simple and it is so unfair to genuine fans who want to go to the gigs.\r\n\r\n",
