The form is asking them to sign that they are fit to drive, but nowhere does  the invitation to renew  invite them to  surrender their license if they do not require it or are not fit enough.  A  doctor should  verify that their eyesight, hearing and any other medical requirements are satisfactory to be able to drive a vehicle. Many elderly people possess licenses that are not fit to drive and there are many instances where elderly people have caused accidents.\r\n\r\nAction required - renewal form to be accompanied by a doctors letter stating they still qualify. Also a section on the renewal form where a driver can send back his license.",
