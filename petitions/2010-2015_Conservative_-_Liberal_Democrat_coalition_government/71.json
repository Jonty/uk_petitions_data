        "additional_details": "The BBC and Sky have announced a deal that gives both parties the rights to broadcast Formula 1 races from 2012 to 2018.  Despite the BBC stating that they are 'delighted' to be showing the races, this only covers HALF of the races, meaning that those without a satellite subscription will miss out.  This is quite clearly not in the best interest of the legion of fans without satellite television.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned firmly believe that the government should take action to ensure that ALL races are broadcast on a medium that those without expensive satellite subscription services can enjoy.",
