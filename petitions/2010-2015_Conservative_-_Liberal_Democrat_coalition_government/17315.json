My petition is that the BBC should open a subscription only service and those that want to watch can by paying a fee, and those that don't want to subscribe to BBC, do not have to pay to have a TV, computer, Radio or any other recieving device in their home.\r\n\r\nWe are a country of choices and this should be one of them.
