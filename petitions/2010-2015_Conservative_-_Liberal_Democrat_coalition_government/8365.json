        "additional_details": "We, the people, who have signed this petition, hear by request a change to the current laws regarding RIF's (Realistic Imitation Firearms). Currently, you have to be 18 plus and be able to prove you are a member of an insured skirmished site or re-enactment society. However, if you are not, guns have to be clear or bright coloured on at least 1/3rd of the gun. This makes some parents feel that they are safe. More dangerous air guns however are exempt from this, thus, we suggest, this requirement is removed from the sale of an RIF, but the RIF should be registered to that person and should a crime be committed with it, it would be tracked to that person.",
