Typically switching current account takes around 3 months and a fair amount of work by the customer.\r\n\r\nThis prevents competition between banks and prevents new entries into the market, effectively creating an implicit cartel of badly behaved banks.\r\n\r\nThe government should pass legislation forcing banks to make this process both easy and seamless for customers. Customers should promptly get an exact switch date after which the old account is defunct and the new one has take its place.",
