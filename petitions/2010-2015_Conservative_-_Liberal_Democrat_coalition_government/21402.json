The cuts which the Government are putting on our armed forces are having drastic effects on our defence.\r\n\r\nOur Royal Navy ships are being cut so drastically to a level which our county shores is no longer protected. The decommissioning of our Aircraft Carriers and the Harrier fleet place our country unable to defend ourselves abroad. RAF Eurofighters which are only a few years old are due to be retired by 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Government must reverse their decision on this terrible mistake and fund our forces to do the job we need them to do,",
