        "additional_details": "The Japanese made show Hetalia: Axis Powers is an excellent tool for education. It has taught many who have no interest in history to take an interest though means of entertaining factual personified nations instead of a heap of worksheets that many history teachers deem an acceptable form of education when they have zero educational and most important of all entertainment value. Many leading minds will tell you that you remember the things that make you laugh and that's why such fact laden subject needs a kick from something like this show to make students not just interested in history again but better at it. Think outside the box people it just might work.",
