        "additional_details": "Immigration from the EU and outside the EU should be temporarily closed. The country is having major finiancial issues as it is, and to keep allowing immigrants into the country to then be given benefits is wrong. The money given to the legal and illegal immigrants in this country could easily be used for other more important things.\r\n\r\nAlso, our villages, towns and cities are becoming far too populated. We now see the population of the UK extremely high for such a small amount of land, and it must stop. If the population increases by immigration then we will have health issues, over-crowding in the Cities and possible chaos when the money actually does run out.\r\n\r\nImmigration must be cut or stopped temporarily to allow the economy to recover, to use the budget given to the immigrants in this country for better needs, and to ensure that the safety of the country isn't at risk with the sharp increase in immigrants.",
