However, what the country doesn\u2019t yet appreciate is the true scale of that abuse.\"\r\n\r\nThe media frenzy and concentration on child abuse committed by Muslim men and the prejudicial link to Islam as a faith (direct or inferred) is divisive and not reflective of the depth and breadth of child sex abuse in our society. British citizens of whatever ethnicity or creed/faith regard child sex abuse as totally unacceptable without reservation.\r\n\r\nWe request demographic data for the last 5 years on convicted offenders including ethnicity and creed/faith and distribution of offences across the UK.",
