With the housing crisis in London, the trend of migration south has only continued, and the single train line cannot cope.\r\n\r\nThe Thameslink Programme offers new capacity but the single rail line does not perform for current volumes, particularly at the congested interchange of East Croydon.\r\n\r\nBML2 is a long developed proposal for an alternative line from Brighton via Uckfield, avoiding East Croydon completely.\r\n\r\nFrom BML2.co.uk:\r\n\r\n\"Network Rail is spending millions on re-doubling and electrification; politicians promise HS2 and HS3 \u2013 but the UK\u2019s most congested network in Sussex won\u2019t be expanded.\r\n\r\nEast Croydon deals with more trains than Reading, Manchester, Edinburgh, Paddington, Euston or King\u2019s Cross.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/1BKAiR0\r\nhttp://www.bml2.co.uk",
