        "additional_details": "The govenment needs to make the education system fairer by dropping some final exams and replaceuing them with couse work. For example, make science a more interesting subject by including more ISA's and make pther subjects less basedd on the final exam so that people who show intelegence in a different way have a chance as well. Don't box young people into an old-fassioned way of thinking about intelgence. Move on and show that written exams are not the only thing someone can be good at.",
