        "additional_details": "A petition to call on the Government to require print media to be politically neutral and without endorsement to candidate or political party.\r\n\r\nWe note that this would provide similar regulation to that of the Broadcast Media who must maintain political neutrality.\r\n\r\nWe further note the general public dissapointment in the percieved relationship and influence of media corporations. This dissapointment has come to the fore in recent months. Print Media presently has an established practice of endorsing political parties and editorial within publication substantially reflects this.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the regulated restriction of endorsments and bias will increase impartiality by allowing political comment and news to be printed irrespective of editorial policy to support or endorse a particular party.\r\n\r\nBroadcast Media regulated by Ofcom ensures that broadcast news media is without bias and does not unfairly influence elections or present themselves as free publicity for politicans.",
