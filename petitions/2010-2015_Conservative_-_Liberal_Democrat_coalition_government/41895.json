        "additional_details": "With the current moral and ethical state of the British public, I thought it be a good idea to see how many would be in favour of bringing back conscription similar to that after the Second World War. Seeing despicable crimes in the media inflicted upon the most vulnerable within society such as the old and the weak - it may just be the thing needed to teach young people Morals and Values. I for one wished I had done Military Service when younger as I feel I would have been a more responsible and decent member of society. The shear get up and go attitude of the British Armed Forces with the infusion of healthy lifestyle and embedded Moral Values of it's service personnel are known across the globe - unfortunately British citizens cannot boast the same. I propose a minimum of one years national military service to orientate and give purpose to every young individuals life.",
