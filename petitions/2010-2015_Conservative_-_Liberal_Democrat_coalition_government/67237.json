        "additional_details": "I think toilet attendants should be banned in all public places. You don't need someone hanging around in the gents of a bar trying to solicit money for turning on taps. It's antisocial behaviour and nobody wants it. I'm all in favour of cleaners, but not the people who hang around holding a change bowl. This should be treated as begging and outlawed.",
