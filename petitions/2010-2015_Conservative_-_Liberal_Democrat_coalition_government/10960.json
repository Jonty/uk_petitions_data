The focus of this work would be on improving the local environment, to compensate for the destruction caused.  It would be for a set time period.  If possible people should also be given guidance or training in their area of work, to help them find work after their Community payback is complete.\r\n\r\nAll convicted rioters including those not on benefits & children, should have to attend role play / morality courses to help them develop a sense of empathy towards others.  Failure to attend would incur a fine for themselves or their Guardian(s).  Disruptive behaviour during the course would also incur a fine.      ",
