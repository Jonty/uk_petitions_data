        "additional_details": "We need MP's with experience of real life to represent the majority, who the public can relate to in a more positive way than a career politician.\r\nPoliticians would be more effective if they had a career prior to entering politics rather than completing a degree in and then entering party life immediately with no other experience.\r\nThe other issues are relevancy of experience for the role they undertake, should an MP responsible for education actually have some experience of the education system?\r\nI suggest that all parties are encouraged or regulated to ensure that their elected officials are fit for purpose. By encouraging individuals with real life exposure before they became career politicians, the quality of all parties can only improve as will the publics view/support.\r\nThe nation needs to renew it\u2019s faith in our political system so we need leaders who the general public can relate to and who can demonstrate competence in areas other than politics.",
