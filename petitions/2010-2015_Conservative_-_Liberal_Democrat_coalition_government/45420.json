        "additional_details": "We would like to direct this e-petition directly to Mr Osbourne, Please stop the austerity-led fiscal policies that you have forced on our country.\r\n\r\nThese policies are not working and for the vast majority of us are making things far worse now and, most likely, will set us on a path that will increase the levels of financial inequality in our society for the future.\r\n\r\nThere are growing numbers of economists and global financial experts who are calling out to us to change our policies, please do not ignore them. Austerity led policies have destroyed middle class incomes and created massive inequality in other countries in the past and will do so again in the UK.\r\n\r\nAusterity led policies do not work. ",
