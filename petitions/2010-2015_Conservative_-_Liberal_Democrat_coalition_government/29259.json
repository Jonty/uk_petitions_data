The government seems to think we all want to play football and don't realise that a vast number of us don't.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been much criticism in the media lately of 'boy racers', due to the actions of a few on the roads. People gather in car parks at weekends and are continually criticised by locals for it for simply wanting to meet up with like minded people who are into cars. Why does this happen? Because there are very few places for people to go and have a bit of fun in a car.\r\n\r\nThere are many abandoned airfields, racetracks etc. around the country which could be put to good use rather than lying dormant with grass growing on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to address this problem and support us petrolheads rather than criticising us. We are paying extortionate prices on car insurance, being taxed twice on fuel etc. and very little of this money is going back to support motorists.\r\n",
