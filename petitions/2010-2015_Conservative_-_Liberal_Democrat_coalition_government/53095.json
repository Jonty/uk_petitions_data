        "additional_details": "The decision made by the London Legacy Development Corporation and Mayor of London, Boris Johnson in March 2013 to gift the Olympic stadium to West Ham United FC could see Leyton Orient Football Club fold due to the competition being less than three miles away . West Ham will be given many millions from local and national funding.  For more details please see: https://www.facebook.com/groups/520970711278097/\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition you are confirming you do not agree with West Ham being granted this funding and allowed to move to the Stadium, without just regard for the local services, community and Leyton Orient.  You are also signing to confirm that you want the Government to overturn this decision and protect the communities of Leyton and Upton Park.",
