Roundabouts  Promote Safe and Efficient Traffic Flow, and are an appropriate Solution for Staggered Junctions experiencing high numbers of collisions.\r\n\r\nThe \u00a3170k allocated to upgrade the A47 Broadend Junction could be used toward the cost.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that the LAYOUT of the Broadend Junction is Extremely Poor.  And the present Layout has proved ineffective.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
