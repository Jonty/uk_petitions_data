        "additional_details": "While there is a growing trend among publishers to use sustainable sources in the production of their paper this is still an optional thing. Some parts of the industry do not use either recycled paper or sustainble sources.\r\nThis only adds to enviromental damage not only thorugh deforestation but the damage these papers can do when simply thrown away and end up in landfills. the bleaches and inks used in the making of newspapers leak into the soil and cause damage to both plant and animal life.\r\nBy making it law that only sustainably sourced paper is used will reduce the enviromental damage caused by deforestation. Also, using only recycled paper would not only imapct deforestation but also drastically reduce the amount of paper that is dumped in landfill sights.",
