        "additional_details": "That parliament should debate the creation of a petition to be given to the Prime Minister to ensure that PC Ian Dibell is awarded a posthumous George Cross for his selfless bravery whilst trying to protect the public.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy that unfolded in Clacton is sadly an all too common characteristic of our lives these days. What is not, however, is the courage and bravery of PC Ian Dibell, who exemplifies the type of police officer that we should all look up to and respect.\r\n\r\nI hope and expect PC Dibell to be awarded a posthumous George Cross. His selfless courage shows unique, legendary bravery of a kind that is rarely witnessed nowadays.\r\n\r\n",
