If this isn't discrimintaion, then I don't know what is.\r\nPeople improve their quality of life partaking in various leisure activities and this mans has been ceased for unnecessary reasoning.\r\nI am appalled!\r\nTherefore this petition is to raise awareness of this injustice and to put a stop to it.
