This leads to headline based, narrow minded politics or, even worse, entirely disillusioned people who have no interest in politics at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroducing 'UK Contemporary Politics' from a young age will inform the votes of a future generation. It will empower people from all backgrounds to have a more active role in the politics of their country.",
