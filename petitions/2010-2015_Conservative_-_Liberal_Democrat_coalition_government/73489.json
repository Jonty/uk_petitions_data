        "additional_details": "We want the need for tickets to see London's New Years Eve fireworks and therefore, the need for barriers, to keep non-ticket holders out, removed.\r\nNot everybody can afford the \u00a310 to get a good view to see the fireworks.\r\n\r\nEven though \u00a31 million pounds was raised through ticket sales the cost of running the event was much more. The fireworks cost \u00a31 millon; then there's the cost of the stewards, police, medical care, events company, facilities and barriers that mean the cost is not recouped through ticket sales. So those who pay for it through taxes cannot get a good view.\r\n\r\nSome areas experienced crowd surges from those without tickets that resulted in people being injured.\r\nThe queues to access the ticketed area extended for over a mile leaving people standing in the freezing cold.\r\n\r\nThe emergency services could not access some areas of the event in vehicles.\r\n\r\nBy removing the tickets and therefore, the barriers all these problems and many more will be resolved.\r\n",
