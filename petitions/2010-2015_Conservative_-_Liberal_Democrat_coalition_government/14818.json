        "action": "Affordable advanced driving workshops to improve safety on our roads",
        "additional_details": "A lot of people forget that when they get behind the wheel of a car they are driving a loaded weapon.  More and more cars are being produced and the population is growing, one driving test is no longer enough.\r\n\r\nMore advanced driving workshops are needed at an affordable price.  These workshops are not only needed for the young, but the experienced as well.  Not only for carelessness but also for insecure drivers to boost confidence and make awareness of other people in and around the vehicle.\r\n\r\nLess lane hogging on the motorway, speeding on country roads, jumping red lights, driving down curbs and all round careless driving on our roads that affect and take lives.\r\n\r\nThese workshops can be benefical to bring down insurance premiums.  This should not be compulsary but a choice as long as it is benefical to the Uk motorist.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a difference sign this petition because education is better than prison.",
