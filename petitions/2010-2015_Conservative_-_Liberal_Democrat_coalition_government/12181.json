        "additional_details": "The price of oil over recent months has fallen by over 18 percent.  Yet the price of petrol on the forecourt has risen in real terms by 1.5 percent.  Now, Maths was never my strong point at school, but that doesn't seem to make much sense to me.\r\nWe continue to reaad that oil companies say this is due to a combination a rise in exploration costs and production costs. Yet oil companies continue to make billions each year in profit.  Some of this they claim goes to creating more efficient fuel, but we all know that most goes to shareholders.\r\nWho is with me in seeking for a reduction in forecourt prices by a combination of reduced profits for the oil companies and reduced level of taxation.  Fuel is one of the biggest burdens for households and business.  Cheaper fuel means better value for all our goods and better standard of living.  This is something that the oil companies can absorb given their continued level of high profits.  Please sign if you agree!!",
