        "additional_details": "On July 14th the Government has ordered the London airspace to be closed to all General Aviation traffic for a month. At the same time a Restriction is put in place for 2 months across a wider area.\r\nThis \"Olympics Airspace\" will severely affect and even stop pleasure flying, flight training, aircraft charter, aerial filming and many other GA operations. It is estimated that 20 businesses may close forever and that upto 1000 peoplein the business of GA will be badly affected by loss of earnings. The GA business uses a lot of freelance specialist employees, such as pilots and engineers, flight training instructors and others.\r\nThe Govt position is to create a \"known aviation environment\" for the Olympic period. Yet most of the affected people are highly experienced and known to the authorities.\r\nWe want the Government to allow the GA industry it's basic Right To Work. We want Exemptions.",
