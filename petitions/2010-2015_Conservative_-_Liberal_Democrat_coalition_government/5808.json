Although fees are often subsidised by the providers and can be payed in installments throughout the course, it is still a huge financial burden on very low payed trainees and/or their parents/carers. There are substantial additional costs for travel and extra courses.\r\nThis situation is extremely unfair because full time students do not pay for their education until they are earning over a certain amount.\r\nThe Government should make student loans available\r\nfor part time courses. Fairness for all.",
