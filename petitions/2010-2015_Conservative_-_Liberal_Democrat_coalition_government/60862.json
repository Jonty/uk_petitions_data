        "additional_details": "The closure of butterpark will be a huge mistake. The population of ivybridge has steadily increased since 1977 and by 2026 will see an explosion in the over 65 age groupThe Stowford unit in butterpark was until recent years working hand in hand with the PCT and\r\nmental health teams, the experience the staff learned from these professionals is invaluable and unable to be mirrored in any other care home. Very few staff members have been there less than 10 years and all have benefitted from the immense social services training packages. We need to remember this was all funded from taxpayers money and Your proposal to close will throw away so much expertise and knowledge.",
