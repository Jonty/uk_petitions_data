        "additional_details": "Parliament betrayed the nation in 1985 by bowing the knee to the European Court of Human Rights by abolishing CP in UK state schools. Discipline has nose dived ever since and many thousands of people have left the teaching profession forced out by the thuggish behaviour of their students. In1998 the ban was extended to private schools. Only 15 MPs bothered to vote against this. The debate was held in the middle of the night. Governing bodies must have complete freedom to restore corporal punishment , consulting parents when doing so. There should be clear rules as to the serious offences meriting this punishment - assault, theft, disruptive behaviour, vandalism, & gross verbal abuse, disrespect for authority (for example) ",
