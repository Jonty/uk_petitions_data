The evidence from the US has shown that it causes unecessary injuries and death to members of the public that attend due to uncontrolled crowds all attempting to get hold of products that have been marked down in price. In recent years this has taken place in the UK, and is causing similar incidents of violence and disorder. It is completely avoidable and should not be made possible in this country. ",
