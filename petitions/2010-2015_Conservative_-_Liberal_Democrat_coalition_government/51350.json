One is directly, that they are a menace, and the other is that they enrage car, lorry and bus drivers, making it more dangerous for every cyclist.\r\n\r\nAny cyclist spotted who jumping a red light, rides on the pavement, on the wrong side of the road, wheelies up the road or carries a passenger on their handlebars  should have their bike taken away from them.",
