        "additional_details": "For all countries within the UK to receive equal treatment.  For example, University education should not be free for one country and not another.  If some have to pay, we should all have to pay.  Likewise with prescriptions.\r\n\r\nFunding for schools should not be so disproportionate across the nation.  If we are to be a truly 'united' Kingdom, the Government needs to ensure that one country is not treated less favourably than another.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be brought into the House of Commons for review so please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nMany thanks & best wishes.",
