        "additional_details": "The UK goverment spent \u00a3531m on advertising in the UK in the year to March 2010. A huge amount of this budget would have been used to buy airtime on TV and radio.  All of this media spend could be saved if these messages were transferred to the BBC, in the form of public information films / messages. These were prevalent in the past and could be used again to great effect, saving the UK valuable cash and stopping commercial TV and radio organsations being paid for public service broadcaating issues.",
