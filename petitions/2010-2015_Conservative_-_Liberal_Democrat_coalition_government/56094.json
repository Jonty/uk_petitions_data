        "additional_details": "Why is it that, in many local authorities, every person can vote for whoever they wish in Local Elections, but the political party in power still keeps control of the council?\r\n\r\nExample: Tameside M.B.C. currently has 51 Labour and 6 Conservative Councillors. Only 19 council seats are contested in each election and it means that, even if every single person in Tameside voted for another political party, Labour would still have control of the Borough!\r\n\r\nThere are many other councils like this across the country - Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat - and such elections are undemocratic.\r\n\r\nVoters should be able to change the ruling Political Party in just one election if they so wish - it should not take two, three or more elections to bring about change!\r\n\r\nAll the councillors should stand for re-election at the same time, every time - which would make all councillors and their political parties more accountable for their actions to the electorate!",
