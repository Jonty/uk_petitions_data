        "additional_details": "We call on the government to recognise that intensive chicken sheds (broilers and layers) are not farming, they are industrial activities producing huge amounts of toxic waste. We want planning laws changed to keep them out of the countryside and away from people's homes. We ask the government to bring in measures - financed by the poultry producers - to manage the thousands of tonnes of waste they produce every day and to control the dust and bio-aerosols these units produce.",
