Where is the evidence that this initiative has helped to curb immigration?\r\n2. What criteria were used for selecting the countries for the pilot?\r\n3. How will the money be kept and where?\r\n4. Will the money be returned with interest?  At what rate?\r\n\r\nThis is unjust, a gross exploitation of the peoples of those nations; and a deliberate attempt to limit free trade, movement and access to family life and should be scrapped.",
