        "additional_details": "To consider a mansion tax threshold on homes valued at \u00a32m is particularly unfair on those who have homes in the \u00a32-2.5m bracket.\r\nThe Government has only just introduced an increase in stamp duty to 7% for homes valued at more than \u00a32m. This has already affected the values of homes marginally over 2m.\r\nBy adding another tax with the same threshold will mean those who have homes currently valued in \u00a32-2.5m bracket will find it extremely difficult to sell without discounting to below \u00a32m.\r\nNot only will this create large capital losses for an albeit small number of people affected it will also severely distort the property market in general.\r\nI do not agree with any form of mansion tax but at least consider making the threshold less discriminatory to this band of homeowners.
