        "additional_details": "I propose that:\r\n1) All children are taught about all the major religions of the world along with stances such as agnosticism and atheism.\r\n2) Teachers should endeavour to teach the facts about different religions trying to avoid any personal opinions they may have due to their own beliefs.\r\n3) Time should be divided equally, removing any bias towards the religious standpoint (if any) of the school.\r\n4) Parents should not be allowed to withdraw their children from these classes. This amounts to them trying to deliberately instil ignorance in them. Parents can obviously teach their children more about their own beliefs but will not be allowed to deny their children a grounding knowledge of other beliefs.\r\n5) It should not be compulsory for schools to provide daily acts of collective worship, however schools may conduct them if they wish.\r\n",
