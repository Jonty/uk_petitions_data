        "additional_details": "I would like parliament to discuss the idea of a \"Newcomer\" tax which would apply to EU citizens which come over to the UK in order to work and reside here.\r\nI would like to see these citizens to pay a higher rate of tax for a period of say 2-3 yrs as a form of extra contribution to our society.\r\nThis would allow UK firms to compete on an even keel with EU companies who undercut UK firms in many industries, most notably the construction industry.\r\nThis tax would apply to businesses as well as individual EU members.\r\nThis \"loyalty tax\" would help the UK in terms of finding extra revenue for issues such as housing,welfare,industry, education and law and order which are being stretched as a result of EU members working and residing in the UK.",
