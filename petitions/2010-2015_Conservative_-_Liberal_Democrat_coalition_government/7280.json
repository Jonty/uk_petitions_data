To them it is a game of trying to outwit the Police. We already pay for an establishment that could control the situation, but the vast majority are not even in this Country.\r\nBring them home and let them control the streets. Once under control, give the Police better equipment to control future outbreaks (eg Water Canon, Rubber bullets and tear gas).",
