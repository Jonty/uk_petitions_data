        "additional_details": "The law is failing to adequately protect our pets and ensure that the punishment administered to those responsible for acts of cruelty towards them fits the crime.\r\nUnder the Animal Welfare Act 2006, the term of imprisonment for even the most heinous does not exceed 6 months. Defendants are far too often seen to be \u201cgetting away with murder\".\r\nIn cases where an individual or persons seize animals such as dogs or cats and subject them to horrific suffering; deliberate torture, resulting in death, the crime is in today\u2019s society widely regarded to be on a par with premeditated murder. It has a devastating effect on the family, as well as within the greater community. It is also time to acknowledge there is a connection between those who torture and kill animals, and perpetrators of violent crimes against humans.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the current law amended and the term of imprisonment increased to a maximum of 5 years, bringing it in line with other serious criminal offences.\r\n",
