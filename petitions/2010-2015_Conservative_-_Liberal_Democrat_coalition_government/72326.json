        "additional_details": "It's has been reported in the press that the cost of refurbishing the Houses of Parliament could cost upwards of 3 billion. I worked in the building industry 20 years it's my person view that a project like refurbishing houses of Parliament would be more double the 3 billion quoted ,To repair once you factor in asbestos removal and dry rot. Our MPs should have meeting across the United Kindom rather than spending outrageous sum of money to refurbish the houses of Parliament. 3 billion + should be spent in our NHS than on Westminster. I ask this be debated in the Commons.",
