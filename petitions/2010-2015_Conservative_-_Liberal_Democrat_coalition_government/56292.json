        "additional_details": "I petition the government to stop future Feed in Tariff (FIT) agreements for domestic Solar PV.\r\n\r\nI installed PV's in 2011 and am paid 48p per kWh.  Daily output varies from less than 1 kWh to 23 kWh.  A Solar cycle opposes my usage and fails to reduce my electricity bill.  However, offset against the FIT my electricity is free.   If everyone had PV just imagine: \"everyone gets free electricity\"?  We would still need all our power stations and it would destroy our economy.  I get nuisance calls offering free PV so entrepreneurs can capitalise on the FIT.\r\n\r\nWe cannot store electricity; surpluses evaporate and 2p per kWh power stations are slow to power up and cannot bend around passing clouds and gloom.   Solar PV's 50\u00b0N is an expensive piece of political green delusion.   Saving the planet needs intelligence.   Solar PV should be placed under reliable sun across time zones.   We waste investment that should build DC networks and credible solutions.\r\n\r\n",
