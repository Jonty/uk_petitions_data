The government want to limit the time you can claim Employment and Support Allowance to 12 months. I know that there is no way I can work because I cannot leave my home, How can they expect someone with health issues that haven't improved or cannot leave their home to go out to work?  We have paid our taxes in the past and are now claiming what we paid in, we cannot and should not be forced back to work when we know we cannot!!  The government should look at stopping the benefits for people who can go out to work and also for those who come into the country as immigrants!",
