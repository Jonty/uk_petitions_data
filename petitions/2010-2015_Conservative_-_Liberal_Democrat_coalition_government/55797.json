Any current Union officials will also be exempt from this position.\r\n\r\nThis is to ensure that each part or full public service has a voice that is independent of those currently negotiating any deals.\r\n\r\nThis list will include but not be limited to \\fire service, police force, NHS, Royal Mail.\r\n\r\nThe government will also ensure that there is a detailed meeting once a year between the individuals and a cabinet minister for feedback to confirm that the workers needs are being listened to.
