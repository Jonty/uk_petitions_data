Punditry must be left with Mark, Shearer and Hansen, not the remarkably miserable duo of Southgate and Keane. The EPL is already dominated by adverts from the likes of SKY and ESPN. We must make a stand. We will force ITV into submission by capturing and imprisoning Lorraine Kelly and force her to watch the post match analysis of Gareth Southgate until she can take no more. This will make her aware of the terror that the future holds at the hands of her employers and she will then retire. Without Lorraine Kelly ITV are nothing thus the company will collapse and all rights to the EPL round up will go to the Gary and co. ",
