        "additional_details": "In April 2012 working age benefits will increase by 5.2%. This is compared to wage inflation of half that amount. Unemployment is rising which will exacerbate the cost of this action. Benefits rising faster than wages increases the disincentive to work.\r\nFinally the cost of this will fall on a dwindling number of already stretched taxpayers, who frankly have had enough.\r\nThe proposal is that the government can keep the CPI link, but should cap it at the wage inflation rate in years when wage inflation is lower.
