        "additional_details": "The DFE are planning to sell the building that is currently leased to the ONLY ofcom outstanding nursery in Halton. This will force the closure of the nursery and will result in unnecessary unemployment. The nursery have attempted to purchase the building privately but the DFE have refused. It seems deeply ironic that the department for EDUCATION are forcing the closure of an outstanding educational establishment.\r\nPlease sign this petition in order to request that the DFE reconsider their decision to sell the building or at least negotiate a deal with the nursery so that it can remain open.",
