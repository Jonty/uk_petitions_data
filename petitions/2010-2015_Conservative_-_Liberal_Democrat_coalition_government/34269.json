        "additional_details": "Bob Paisley,was a wonderful man of warmth and integrity,who serviced Liverpool Football Club for 44 consecutive years,and who will be remembered as one of the games true greats.In a time when money rules, we may never see another like him.A fantastic 9 years managing LFC brought fruit with 3 European cups(more than any other UK Mgr-and really stamped British' footballs dominance on the European game),6 league titles,3 consecutive League cups,1 Uefa cup an 1 Super Cup.He also won Manager of the year in 6 of these 9 seasons.When he passed away he was honoured by both LFC,in the form of the Paisley gates,and by his inclusion in the English Football hall of fame. The man who managed in a\"flat cap and slippers\"also fought for his Country as a part of the Desert Rats WW2.I feel very strongly,as I'm sure other people will also do so,that he should be nominated for the above accolade,as frankly he thoroughly deserves to be recognised by this prestigious award.",
