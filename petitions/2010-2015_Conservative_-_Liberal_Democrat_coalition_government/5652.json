        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament to abandon its plans to reduce the number of MPs and instead increase them to 1,000 whilst scrapping their current salaries and paying them the Minimum Wage for the Maximum Working Week.  A change on these lines would actually make a net saving of expenditure whilst at the same time ensuring better representation for the public with constituencies nearly half the size of the current ones. This would especially assist rural areas where constituencies can be huge and remote. It would bring MPs closer to the grass-roots level, keeping them in greater touch with voters and would promote greater minority party and independent candidate competition at General Elections.",
