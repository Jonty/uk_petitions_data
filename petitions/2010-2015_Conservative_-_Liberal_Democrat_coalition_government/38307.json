        "additional_details": "Over the past few years, at any major public event (The Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony) Paul McCartney has always been present to 'entertain' the masses with his singing.  No more.  He used to be a brilliant musician however time has sadly taken its toll and he now sounds like a horse chewing some angry wasps.  Not good.\r\n\r\nThe signatories are in agreement that at the next major public event, whatever it may be, K-Pop sensation PSY should be chosen to perform in place of the venerable Beatle.  PSY has a proven track record of brilliant performances with his latest offering 'Gangnam Style' attracting well over 100 million views on YouTube in just 2 months, reflecting his enormous popularity with the masses,\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to get PSY on board for the next big event this country holds!",
