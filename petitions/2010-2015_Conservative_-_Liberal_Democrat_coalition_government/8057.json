        "additional_details": "The recent riots in London and cities around Great Britain have been sickening to see. These youths have shown a total lack of respect to their communities, and it is about time they were taught the meaning of respect. A compulsary six-month stint in the National Service for all 16-18 year olds would inject a sense of discipline, pride and community spirit and make Britain great once again.\r\n\r\nWe have had an entire generation of citizens grow up with little or no rules or discipline at home, in school or at work and are now living with the consequences, let us not lose another generation.",
