        "additional_details": "I hope after todays mauling of a 14 year old by these awful dogs will make the prime minister make the ownerships and breeding of these dogs illegal.\r\nCan you imagine the pain the poor girl suffered being mauled to death by these awful dogs.\r\nthese dogs are kept and bread by lowlife only such as drug dealers and criminals to make it harder for the police to approach these people. Decent people do not choose one of these dogs over say a labrador as a pet, they are fighting killing machines that serve no purpose. They should be as illegal as me keeping a firearm for my protection.\r\npoor Jade please lets Ban these animals from our country.",
