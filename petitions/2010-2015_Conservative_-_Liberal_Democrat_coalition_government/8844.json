Hidden under this name is work for the community for a symbolic wage \u00a3 1  for an hour at almost conservation benefits.  It will for all young people aged 18-30 who have never worked. Such program guides should be held for 26 weeks. While working minimum 20 hours per week, with public transport ticket repayment. For all participants of the recent riots this is obligatory program. Refusing youth people to joining the program \u2018Work for one pound\u2019 should be received benefits. Only this way can help the youth. August teaches respect for others and would then easily be afraid of work. What they can do and the people most often without any qualifications?  Alternative is any volunteer work for 26 weeks, or taking permanent employment. Otherwise, society cannot help youth.",
