        "action": "Repeal the ban on TAC air guns (Brocock)",
        "additional_details": "\r\nPart 5 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 added airguns that use a self-contained air cartridge system to Sec.5 of the Firearms Act, effectively placing them in the same category legally as machine guns and grenade launchers. Only around 1500 were surrendered and 6000 put on a firearm licence (an option allowed only before the ban) . BASC estimates that around 68000 are still in circulation, the owners of which will face prosecution should they be found in possession or decide to hand them in to the police. Essentially, somewhere near 70000 new serious criminals were created overnight. Another 'feel-good' law that achieved nothing in the way of public safety and only the destruction of people's hobbies and property.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned petition the government to remove airguns that use a 'self-contained air cartridge system' from Sec.5 of the Firearms Act and to treat them as conventional air guns.",
