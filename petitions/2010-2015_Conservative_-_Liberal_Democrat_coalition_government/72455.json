        "additional_details": "Govia Thameslink won the bid to run our trains by vowing to cut costs; it appears they have done this by reducing staff and foregoing essential maintenance work. Every day trains are delayed due to \"staff shortages\", \"broken down trains\" and \"signal failure\". Their delay repay service is unsatisfactory because very often these delays fall just short of the 30 minute milestone currently necessary to reclaim fare; this benchmark seems increasingly inadequate if one considers the number of delayed minutes accumulated throughout the course of one week, or even a single day. Check their twitter account for a catalogue of errors:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/TLRailUK/with_replies\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of this is to draw public attention to the situation, and to provide a platform for commuters to express their frustration with a service (their only route to London) which appears to be getting worse. This company should not be allowed to continue providing such terrible service. ",
