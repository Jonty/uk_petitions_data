        "additional_details": "i think the goverment should cut JSA by at least 20% we have made it to easy for people to do nothing and claim everything. reducing JSA and housing benefit will force people to go out and look for work as the wont be able to survive on their benefits as well as they can now. Also i do not see why as a tax payer from the age of 15 and still currently working at 28 having paid thousands in tax and NI that me and my partner who has just had a baby and is on Mat leave are not entitled to any sort of benefits... we recieve no help with our rent, no free milk fruit veg vouchers, no money off council tax, no \u00a3250 winter allowance for gas and electric and yet someone who has never paid a penny into the system is entitled to everything and can earn more in benefits a year then i can for going to work 40 hrs a week. something with this country and benefits system is fundamentally wrong we reward the wrong people and give to those that do nothing for what they receive ",
