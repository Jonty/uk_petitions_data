        "additional_details": "The government has reduced funding to Liverpool specifically and as a consequence they are shutting down a lifestyles centre. Park Road lifestyles centre is in one of the most deprived areas of Liverpool, where gang culture is very real. Please help keep this leisure centre open and allow young people especially to enjoy great facilities. Elderly people also benefit massively from this centre, allowing them to keep fit and socialise. Many clubs are run for toddlers, including football and gymnastic clubs. It is renowned for it's level of quality in it's gymnastic area. Olympic bronze medalist, Beth Tweddle even trains there! We want the government to keep this centre open. SAVE PARK ROAD LIFESTYLES CENTRE!! ",
