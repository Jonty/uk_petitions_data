This petition attempts to raise awareness and make a comeback of the red phone box, black taxi, traditional pub and the red routeoligarch buses. Many people visit Britain due to it's traditionalism, however if we carry on like this there will be no traditional sights left to see, thus reducing tourism and affecting the economy.\r\n\r\nThe signatures on this petition proclaim that they wish to see a major restoration on this country to revert back to our British iconic symbols, which sadly are being lost and may never return unless something is done immediately.
