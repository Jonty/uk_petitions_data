        "additional_details": "By increasing the price of wines and alcohol related products may well deter some individuals from making a purchase\r\nbut using the duty element as the tool to accomplish this is highly ineffective and has a devastating effect on the UK Wine Industry and associated business sectors, crucial to the future of the UK economy.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of protecting the future of the UK independent wine trade and associated independent businesses, I call on all wholesale, retail, on-trade and off-trade sectors to petition HM Treasury to halt the progress of the alcohol duty escalator.\r\n",
