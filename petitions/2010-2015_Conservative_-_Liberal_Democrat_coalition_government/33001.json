Her ill health was reported to them on March 18th, yet Kirklees Social Services took 24 days to respond.\r\n\r\nThe current system allows Kirklees Social Services 28 days to act. THIS IS NOT FAST ENOUGH!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to decrease the time allowed for action to be taken from 28 days to 21 days, so that this may never happen again.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
