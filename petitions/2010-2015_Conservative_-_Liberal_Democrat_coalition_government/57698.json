        "additional_details": "The Worcester YMCA is a charity which supports and helps young local homeless and vulnerable people. We house eighty-five people in our Foyer, Hostel and Safebases. The reason for writing this status is we are currently impending county council cuts of up to 50% which will make the services we offer here unsustainable. If this huge cut goes ahead it will result in our Worcester YMCA closing completely. This would result in mass staff redundancies, mass amounts of people living on the streets, potential higher risks of crime, potential rise in cost in health services and more unneeded pressure on social housing. We hope that with peoples help from the online petition I will be putting online soon you could help us gain recognition and highlight the importance of the YMCA Worcester. I as an 'Administrative Consultation Volunteer' am pleading for you to help us fight against cuts being imposed, so we can carry on providing a brighter future to homeless and vulnerable people.",
