        "additional_details": "The so-called \"Elitism Protester\", Trenton Oldfield, disrupted the Oxford & Cambridge Boat Race on 7 April 2012, and has been charged with a Public Order offence. He has since been found to represent a group promoting civil disobedience in the UK, particularly with regard to the London Olympics in 2012.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Oldfield is an Australian by birth, should he be found to be guilty of breaking British Law, he should serve his sentence and then be immediately deported to Australia, and forbidden to enter the UK again for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nOther countries, including Australia, do this to former UK citizens, so there is clear precedent.",
