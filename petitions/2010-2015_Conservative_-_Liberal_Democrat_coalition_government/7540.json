The agreement should state that they accept that if they  are found guilty of an offence and given a custodial sentence their permission to remain in the UK is withdrawn immediately and they will be returned to their home nation.\r\n\r\nThis should include asylum seekers, students or any foreign national. Anyone that is guilty of an offence serious enough to warrant a custodial sentence has no desire to integrate in to or to benefit our society. If you wish to come here and add to our society you will be welcomed, if you want to spoil our society you will be removed.\r\n",
