        "additional_details": "The existing immigration rules only allow extension applications to Tier-1 General visa for applicants already in the UK. The application route is closed to people outside the United Kingdom. The tightening of immigration routes is respectable under given economic circumstances but immigrants who were once granted Tier-1 General may be allowed to reapply under previous rules outside the United Kingdom if their leave period expired. Honourable Minister Damian Green had once mentioned Tier-1 General route was subject to abuse and hence it is now closed but genuine applicants should be given the rights to return through this route. A limit could be imposed on this re application route per year if needed.",
