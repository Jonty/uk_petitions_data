        "additional_details": "I believe the government should continue to protect cyclists by enforcing the ASL lines but allow motorcyclists to share the box. There is no need for a box that spans the whole width of the road? It is extremely rare that a box is full and even when busy most sensible cyclists do not use the offside portion of the box as it is dangerous (I know I cycled for 12 years in London). Having spoken to several police officers and fellow riders it is clear that motorcyclists more often than not arrive at a red light ahead of 4 wheeled vehicles    legally and would benefit from the safe space in an ASL box. It is common sense and safety that should determine all road transport planning after all we share the bus lanes?\r\n\r\nSafe journey to all.",
