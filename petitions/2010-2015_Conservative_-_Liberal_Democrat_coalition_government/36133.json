        "action": "Abolish the new immigration maintenance requirement for spouses",
        "additional_details": "On the 9th July 2012 the UK Border Agency introduced a new minimum income threshold of \u00a318,600 for sponsoring the settlement in the UK of a spouse or partner, or fianc\u00e9(e) , with a higher threshold for any children also sponsored; \u00a322,400 for one child and an additional \u00a32,400 for each further child. The new minimum income threshold means that the vast majority of UK Citizens who marry from abroad are unable to sponsor their partner due to the inability of meeting the maintenance requirement. The new requirement reduces the abiliTy of families to exercise the fundamental rights of family life. The current immigration rules and guidance should be revised to assist persons present and settled in the United Kingdom to facilitate the protection and promotion of their right to family life by reducing this high financial limit and reverting back to the old income support levels.
