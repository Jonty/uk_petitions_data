        "additional_details": "Sadly, despite all that has happened, MP's expenses remain beyond a joke. I believe that if an MP's responsibility is to represent their local constituency, their primary residence should unquestionably be in their constituency. It is also unacceptable that tax payers should foot the bill for this to be the case. If a political party wishes an individual to be an MP and requires them to move to constituency to enable this, the cost should be soley borne by either the party or the individual and not the tax payer.\r\n\r\nThe only expenses which should be admissible should be those related to travel. It should not enable MP's to claim for ludicrous expenses related to second properties they own, thus doing nothing but line their own pockets.\r\n\r\nThere is no other job that would enable this and it would be unacceptable even in good economic conditions, let alone in a time of austerity.",
