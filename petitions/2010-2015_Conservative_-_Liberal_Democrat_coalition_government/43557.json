        "additional_details": "Recently, a petition was submitted to the White House in an attempt to secure the deportation of Piers Morgan from the US to the UK, due to his recent comments regarding the second amendment and gun reformation. Now it is with sincere regret that we must inform you: we don't want him back.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that it has taken the population of the US so long to realise the true nature of Piers Morgan, who is well know for being a non-celebrity, talent show judge and lacklustre replacement for the great Larry King. As you can imagine, we were shocked and upset to find out that after only a few years you wanted to return him, like an unwanted Christmas gift without a receipt.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the UK, please sign below to be certain that should Piers attempt to return, Her Majesty's Government will take the necessary steps to ensure he will be stopped by the border agency and told to immediately turn back.\r\n\r\nThankyou.",
