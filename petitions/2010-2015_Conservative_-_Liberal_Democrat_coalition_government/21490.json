        "additional_details": "As the recent letter from Mrs Hudson at St Agnes pointed out, a period of consolidation has started with Gateshead Council in their bid to cut costs.  One cost that is at risk is School Crossing Patrol Officers, with either the reduction or complete withdrawal of the service.  St Agnes has two excellent Patrol Officers who help kids and parents alike throughout the week.  Our kids' safety is paramount and mustn't be put at risk through cost cutting",
