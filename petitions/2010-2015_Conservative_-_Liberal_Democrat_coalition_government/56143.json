        "additional_details": "This petition has been opened to get \"Hoggin' the bridge\" back into Chepstow town. The event has been a part of local culture since 2006 where thousands of bikers take to the severn bridge starting at Aust services and ending in Chepstow town. This attracts a massive amount of people to the town and surrounding areas generating a large amount of donations for the \"Hogs\" supported charity and also revenue for local businesses.\r\nThis year saw the route ending at chepstow racecourse. This has been a down turn for the event. Chepstow racecourse is accessible if driving but for most locals it means a 3 mile walk  to see the bikes sitting in a dusty carpark, no charming setting such as the town itself. The prices for refreshments were astronomical for a charity event and it seems the arrangement has been made for monetary gain and not with the rides best interests at heart.\r\nSo please sign if you would like to have Hoggin' The Bridge back in chepstow town center for 2014.",
