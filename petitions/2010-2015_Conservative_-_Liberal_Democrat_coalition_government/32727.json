        "additional_details": "A number of recent studies have strongly linked the use of neonicotinoid pesticides to the decline in bee and other pollinating insect populations.These pesticides have been banned in France and Italy.\r\nAlthough the Government is looking at the research, it has refused even a precuationary suspension.\r\nThe honey bee population in the UK is under serious threat. An immediate suspension and consideration of a ban is essential - the implications of further decline are serious not only for the bees, but also for humans who rely on them to pollinate our crops.Research should also be undertaken in to the effect on human health of these pesticides",
