Changes to planning rules in National Parks will have a \u201cdevastating\u201d effect on areas of outstanding natural beauty and \u201cdestroy\u201d rural communities.\r\nThe Government is planning to introduce new rules suggested by the planning minister Nick Boles, permission for the conversion of such buildings would be automatically granted without any need for an application.\r\nHowever National Parks, the Campaign for Rural England and the National House Building Federation oppose the plans which will\r\nlead to a huge increase in holiday homes and will \u201cshift the balance\u201d away from farming.",
