        "additional_details": "Too many accidents occur from 50CC bikes and mopeds as they are simply travelling at a dangerous speed.\r\n\r\n28mph, is too slow to be safe on the roads, drivers of cars show very little care for users of them. They make dangerous moves to overtake\r\n\r\nThe extra 15mph you can get through de-restriction allows users to keep up with the flow of traffic. Increasing safety.\r\n\r\nI propose the DfT remove the illegality of de-rectriction of mopeds",
