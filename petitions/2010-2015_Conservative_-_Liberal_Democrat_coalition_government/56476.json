        "additional_details": "Government plans to change the rules on jam production could mean \"the end of the British breakfast as we know it,\" an MP has warned.\r\nMinisters are proposing to allow the maximum sugar content in any product sold as \"jam\" to be reduced from 60% to 50%.\r\nA government spokesman said the change would help businesses to trade more easily with other countries and boost the UK economy.\r\nBut Tessa Munt, Lib Dem MP for Wells, thinks the plans could mean jam ends up no better than \"coloured mud\".\r\n\"If these regulations change, we'll end up with something much more like the French and German product - and worse still the Americans - where they have things a bit like a fruit butter or a fruit spread. I think this is going to be the end of the British breakfast as we know it.\"\r\n\r\nDo not let British jam become Euro-jam, or worse; keep the sugar content at its present level.",
