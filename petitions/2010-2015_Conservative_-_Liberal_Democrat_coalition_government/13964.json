        "additional_details": "This petition is seeking a sensible but radical rethink of our education system in order for our great country to offer FREE University Education. The principle is simple. Advance educuational attainment by two years. In other words, through moderately cutting school/college/university holidays, sensibly increasing the lenght of a typical learning day this petition proposes that our students can achieve O-Level by the age of 14 years. Then A-Level by the age of 16 years and degree level by the age of 18 years. This would remove three years from our current education/learning timetable. In turn the subsequent financial saving would allow the re-introduction of FREE University Education.",
