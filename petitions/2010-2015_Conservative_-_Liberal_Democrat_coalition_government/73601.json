This is a service that is too important for peoples' every day life to be subject to political persuasion.  Start by all-party talks to consider how the NHS should be run, and ring-fence a budget which will not be liable to any future government interference.\r\nDecisions on the allocation of the NHS Budget will be made by an independent body and all future governments will ensure and commit that funding will be available from Treasury.",
