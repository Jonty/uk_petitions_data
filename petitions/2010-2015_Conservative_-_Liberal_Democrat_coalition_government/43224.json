        "additional_details": "MAKE THE GATE SAFE!\r\n\r\nOn September 1 six-year-old Lulu died after running out of an open gate in Haggerston Park and onto busy Whiston Road. She suffered fatal injuries after being hit by a car. Her death came after park users repeated asked the authorities to make the entrance on Whiston Road safe with a simple swing-hinge.\r\n\r\nThey said not adding it was not their responsibility. Council chiefs have steadfastly refused to do anything despite her death and a series of near misses involving toddlers.\r\n\r\nWe fear the authorities will only listen when a child has died.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let that happen. Sign this petition and save a life. A simple swing mechanism will make the gate safe.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned petition Hackney Council to put a simple swing-hinge on the entrance to Haggerston Park. This will guard against small children and dogs running out onto the road while keeping the access point.",
