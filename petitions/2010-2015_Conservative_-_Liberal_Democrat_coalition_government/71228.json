It can no longer provide top quality coverage of sport, movies are shown well after they are available on other channels and their reporting independence is being questioned time and again. The majority of their programs are totally banal, yet we are forced to pay an annual subscription whether we watch it or not. I welcome a non-advert TV channel, but for the future the BBC it has to change.",
