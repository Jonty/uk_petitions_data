        "additional_details": "Between 1885 and 1967, an estimated 50,000 men were found guilty of what was then the crime of homosexuality.\r\n\r\nThe Sexual Offences Act came into force in 1967 and decriminalised homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age.\r\n\r\nThose convicted faced barbaric treatment in the name of a 'cure'. Men were forced to take oestrogen-based tablets, supressing \"unnatural urges\", causing infertility and gynecomastia.\r\n\r\nHaving fought a war against Nazi oppression, where homosexuals would be sent to labour and death camps, the treatment of homosexuals in Britain was no better.\r\n\r\nPeople would be humiliated, publically shamed and forced to undergo savage 'treatment' in order to avoid imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThose people convicted of this 'crime' deserve a pardon and it is the responsibility of the government to oversee this, with the utmost urgency.",
