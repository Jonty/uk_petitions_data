        "additional_details": "As a youth leader who often has to transport small groups of young people, the fact that the new GroupSave offers no discount on child fares will cause a significant increase in our costs.\r\n\r\nWe have found that travelling by train to events has raised awareness of train travel with young people.  It would be a shame if we had to give this up due to increased cost.\r\n\r\nI would therefore like to urge the Department to arrange the following:-\r\n\r\n1. Extend the 34% discount provided by the new GroupSave to include child fares if children are part of a group of 3-9 travellers.\r\n\r\n1a. Consider negotiating this modified GroupSave scheme as a national scheme on all TOCs.\r\n\r\n2. Introduce a better \"large group\" discount scheme, preferably on a national basis.  I'm aware many TOCs do offer this, but it is often a small discount (bettered by the use of Railcards) and often only on Advance tickets (which aren't always available).",
