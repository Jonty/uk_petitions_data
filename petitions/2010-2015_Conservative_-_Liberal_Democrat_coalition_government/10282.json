        "additional_details": "The long-term idea for prison sentences is to reintroduce a sense of respect and discipline to a population of people who have lost their will to follow social structure.\r\n\r\nCommonly now, our youth are brought up under the impression prison does not necessarily mean punishment, with the guarantee of getting out early on the grounds of good behavior and comfortable lifestyles and good education paid for by the people they have stolen from, hurt or rumored. Their victims may never recover, but if these people do not see prison as a punishment then there has been no justice.\r\n\r\nI propose the introduction of more severe prison lifestyles. If a sentence is given for a set amount of time in prison this should always be completed in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIt is the hope that this will make prison something to be feared, and as a consequence, deter potential criminals from going through with their crimes - no matter the severity.
