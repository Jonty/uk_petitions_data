        "additional_details": "I am seventeen years old and current learning to drive, recently I've tried to insure a car that is not worth more than \u00a3600 and it came to around \u00a315,000 annually once I have passed. I myself cannot afford this neither can my parents. I'm sure I'm not the only young driver that has not come across this problem. I have set up this petition to see if something can be done, to lower the insurance to something more affordable, I can understand why young drivers do not bother to insure their cars. These are my suggestions;\r\n\u2022 Once you have passed your test you have to send in your practical pass certificate and then insurers can make a decision then with your minors and faults on the insurance cost.\r\n\u2022 Or use the existing idea of placing this trackers in our cars and start the insurance off at \u00a32,000 and then go up every couple of months or year if you are accelerating harshly or braking harshly.",
