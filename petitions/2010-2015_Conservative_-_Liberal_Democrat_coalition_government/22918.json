        "additional_details": "The enforced sharing of hotel rooms by colleagues should be made unlawful as an employee, who is giving up his or her free time, and spending time away from the family should be able to retire to a place of privacy away from the work environment whilst working away from home. Moreover, the refusal to share a room should not be used as a means of dismissal for employees who feel uncomfortable sharing a room with a person they do not know, or know very little of.\r\nEmployers who cannot afford the expense of a single room for an employee that has to be away from their domicile should rethink the value they place on the employee who is generating the revenue for the company. Terms & Conditions of Employment should have a mandatory clause inserted into them that require the employee to expressly opt-out of the right to have sole occupancy of hotel accommodation whilst on company business.",
