        "additional_details": "We see around 35000 cars stolen and recovered  each year (According to the Office of National Statistics) costing the victims an estimated \u00a35.25m. This is a very large amount for the innocent to have to pay to get their own property back.\r\n\r\nI propose to stop punishing the victim by adding further stress, financial loss by charging them a recovery charge and a daily fee. Instead to charge to people who have either taken the vehicle or using the victim surcharge from motoring offenders to offset some of this cost for the innocent motorist.\r\n\r\nIf either the police or the person caught (if they have prosecuted someone) were to pay these amounts. This would be more of an incentive to reduce car crime and act as a deterrent along side the usual convictions. ",
