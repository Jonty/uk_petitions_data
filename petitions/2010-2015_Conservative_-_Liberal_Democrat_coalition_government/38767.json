        "additional_details": "Most countries have border exit control, so that when people leave the country, it is recorded in the computer system. One advantage this has is to know whether foreigners are staying in the country illegally. Unfortunately, UK does not have border exit control. As a result, our UK Border Agency cannot tell how many illegal immigrants are staying in the country. To make matter worse, illegal immigrants could work in UK for as long as possible and there is no way for UKBA to know about it. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that we do not like the idea of carrying an Identity Card, and it is a very expensive to try to identify these illegal immigrants. If the government is serious about its immigration policy, a computer record should be kept when foreigners or immigrants enter the country and border exit control system can make sure they leave the country before their right to remain in the country is exceeded.",
