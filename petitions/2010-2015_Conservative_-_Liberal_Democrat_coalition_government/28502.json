The purchase price is always set at the level of an initial first time purchase.\r\n\r\nProvided that the former copy is put beyond use we should be able to trade up to the new format at the cost of delivery on this new format.\r\n\r\nCurrent legislation acts as a brake on the adoption and development of new technology, and in the case of books impedes the realisation of the many benefits that the new electronic formats could potentially deliver.  For example content protected centralised electronic lending libraries to ensure future generations ongoing access to the printed legacy since Caxton.  ",
