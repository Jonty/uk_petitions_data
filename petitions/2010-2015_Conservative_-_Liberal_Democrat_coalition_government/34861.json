I feel that this is no different to other card fraud.  It ends in a never ending circle of the bank not being allowed to stop payments, the company pretending they can't find the account details or that they have authority and the consumer is out of pocket month after month - sometimes for years.  The onus should be on the company having to prove the consumer has given express permission for the money to be taken.  ",
