        "additional_details": "Recent news reports have said that the company Atos who does the work capability assesments, the staff of Atos have recieved death threats.I am a disabled vulnerable person awaiting assesment and now fear for my safety if I have to visit one of there centres,if ever Atos do contact me regarding an assesment.I cannot delay the process any longer by asking for a home visit as I have waited 22 weeks already and am desperate for an assesment in order to get the benerfits that I am entitled to.So I would either like all assesments to now be carried out as home visits,or the assesment centres moved to military instalations in order to protect the people who have to visit.",
