        "additional_details": "In view of the recent conviction of a Royal Marine for executing an injured Taliban fighter, is it right for a statue commemorating Field Marshal Haig commander in chief during the First World War to remain in Whitehall? This man was personally responsible for the execution of 332 loyal British soldiers for cowardice. Some were as young as 16 or 17 and were suffering from shell shock. Haig was guilty of mass murder and his statue should be removed and destroyed.",
