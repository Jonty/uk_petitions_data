We call on the government to -\r\n\r\n1.\tMake the NHS more transparent so that information about concerns for patient care is readily available, including how much is spent on disputes involving staff and patients.\r\n2.\tReform NHS grievance, dismissal and appeal procedures to make them fairer and more open.\r\n3.\tCreate a fund for NHS staff when they incur costs as a result of raising valid concerns or being unfairly disciplined.\r\n4.\tDo more to recognize the value of NHS whistleblowers who have raised genuine concerns.\r\n5.\tRequire NHS Trusts to seek independent expert advice on concerns about patient care or staff well-being.\r\n6.\tEnsure that NHS managers, and staff such as doctors and nurses in management roles, are properly trained, regulated and professionally accountable.\r\n7.\tOutlaw gagging clauses in NHS compromise agreements and exit packages.\r\n",
