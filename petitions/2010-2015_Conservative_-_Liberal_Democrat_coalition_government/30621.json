You might like to think about resubmitting your petition so that it calls on the Government to change the law in some specific way, or to provide funds for some specific improvement.  If your concern is local, you may want to approach Bournemouth Borough Council (the e-petitions site is designed for gathering support for issues which are the responsibility of national government)."
