        "additional_details": "The people living on Dale Farm have clearly indicated their desire to settle in the area, so cannot be labelled as travellers and if evicted from the site, the council has a duty to rehome them.\r\nLooking at a satellite image of the area, it is built up all around the Dale Farm site, but the bit in the middle is called green belt land and they are denied the right to build, which others are not.   Clearly this is a case of discrimination for which the local government should be prosecuted.\r\n1. I wish to see this eviction stopped.\r\n2. The residents of Dale Farm should be given the opportunity to pay the difference between what they paid for the land and the going rate for land that can be developed, or be rehoused by the council.\r\n3.  Basildon Council should be taken to court to face charges of racial discrimination.",
