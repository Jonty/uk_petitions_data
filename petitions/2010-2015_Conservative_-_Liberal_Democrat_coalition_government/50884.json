        "additional_details": "There are numerous studies in relation to sleep deprivation and poor academic performance and health. Teens spend a great portion of each day in school; however, they are unable to maximize the learning opportunities afforded by the education system, since sleep deprivation impairs their ability to be alert, pay attention, solve problems, cope with stress and retain information. Young people who do not get enough sleep night after night carry a significant risk of behavioral and emotional problems. Therefore, it makes sense to look at school start times, which set the rhythm of the day for students, parents and teachers",
