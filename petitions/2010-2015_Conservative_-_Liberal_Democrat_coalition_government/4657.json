Recent events, such as officer shootings at home, and the mass shootings in Norway, highlight the need to have properly prepared and equipped officers available to respond.\r\n\r\nArmed officers would not change the face of Policing, a side-arm, although visible, would not be imposing or restrict interaction with the general public.\r\n",
