        "additional_details": "\r\nWe, the undersigned, are seriously concerned about the increasingly undemocratic nature of the EU, and fear that it will worsen without a change of leadership. We oppose the re-election of Herman Van Rompuy in 2012 because of his open opposition to democracy and the catastrophic failure of his policies and leadership.\r\nWe petition Parliament to debate these matters and  we ask Parliament to  vote on the following  motion;\r\n\r\nThis House  requests that   the Heads of the EU re- affirm their commitment to democracy and  to Government  with the consent of the Governed;   accordingly opposes  the re-election of Herman Van Rompuy as European Council President  and expresses the wish to see him replaced by a President  fully committed to maintaining democratic principles whatever the circumstances, with the will and ability to restore harmony and prosperity throughout the whole of Europe.\r\n",
