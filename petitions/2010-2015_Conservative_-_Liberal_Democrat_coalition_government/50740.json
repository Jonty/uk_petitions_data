        "additional_details": "This petition is to bring back the death penalty for crimes seen as 'extreme' (e.g. Murder, rape, etc.). A innocent soldier was brutally murdered on 21/05/13. The terrorists that commited this brutal and pathetic crime are being treated in British NHS hospitals, costing the British people whom they are the ones they are targeting. After they make a full recovery they will be put in a British prison where they will be living a life of luxury and no justice will be done to the family of Lee Rigby and Lee Rigby himself. ",
