        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the UK Government to recined authorisation for Genetically Modified crop trials in the UK and propose legislation on the liability for contamination of non-GM crops by GMO's (Genetically Modified Organisms). UK sovereignty is being threatened by EU directives by allowing GM Crops to enter the UK Food chain from abroad without adequate UK regulatory clearance. We can see this today with imported animal feed containing traces of unauthorised GM crops. We humbly request a comprehensive debate, in parliament, for the regulation of GM crops within the UK beyond the EU-wide mechanism.",
