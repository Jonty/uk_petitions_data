        "additional_details": "Autobahns are roads with no speed limit. A large network could be created partly through new construction and using existing roads. It would cross all regions in the UK.\r\n\r\nWhy? Because of the huge economic benefits. 1. Jobs are created in the construction and maintenance of the network. 2. Freight and passengers can be delivered quicker, increases productivity of the economy. 3. Reduced economic inequalities between regions and bringing the UK closer together.\r\n\r\nOther benefits are that it could increase the freedoms of the individual, reduce traffic congestion, makes people able to commute from longer distances and reduces time-wasting longer journeys.\r\n\r\nGermany has autobahns and it is Europe's strongest Economy. They could be made to ensure pedestrian safety. This project could be a great alternative to HS2 which has created significant opposition. And it would be less damaging to the environment than high-speed rail would be.",
