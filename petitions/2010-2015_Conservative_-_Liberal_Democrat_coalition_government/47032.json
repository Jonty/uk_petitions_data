        "additional_details": "The government need to change the law to make it illegal for any workplace to discriminate against people with piercings, tattoos, body modifications and certain hairstyles e.g mohawk, dreadlocks.\r\n\r\nPeople who sign this position agree that in some cases certain piercings need to be taken out for direct health and safety reasons, e.g. working with food, working in hospitals. However in most cases nothing should have to be taken out, covered up or styled any different other than what the individual wants it to look like.\r\n\r\nBreast implants, liposuction, and botox injections are all body modifications, would people with them be turned away? Very unlikely.\r\n\r\nEven with all the qualifications and skills in the world a person can be turned down because of one facial piercing.\r\n\r\nThis is a culture to a lot of people like any other culture and should not be shut out in terms of the law, this is discrimination in its purest form and it needs to change now.",
