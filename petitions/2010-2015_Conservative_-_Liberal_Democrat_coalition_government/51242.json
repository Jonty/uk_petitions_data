It's time we considered bringing back the Death Penalty for repeat offenders, and automatic chemical castration for 1st time child sexual offenders.\r\n\r\nIt's also time that those in postiotn of responsibility for vulnerable children are held properly accountable with prison terms being applied where negligence of duty can be proven.\r\n\r\nEvery year we hear the government bring out the same old statements, 'lets hold an enquiry and learn from the mistakes', how many more Baby P's, Victoria Climbie or April Jones do we need to hear about before they actually start to do something about this pathetic excuse for a penal system in this country.",
