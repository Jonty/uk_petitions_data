        "additional_details": "Low value compensation claims are often deemed \"not worth defending\" and succeed on occasion with no regard to their merit.  Yet the sum of all the low value claims is high.\r\n\r\nNo one has to use the NHS.  Patients should bear the risk of \u00a310000 or seek insurance cover or use another health provider.\r\n\r\nBy adopting the proposal, it would be cost-effective to defend all claims.  Where NHS negligence led to a substantial impairment of a patient's life, compensation would still be paid.  Small or frivolous claims however would not be allowable, thus saving substantial sums of precious NHS funding.",
