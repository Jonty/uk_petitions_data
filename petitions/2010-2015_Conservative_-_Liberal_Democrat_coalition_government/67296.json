        "additional_details": "European Nations are all facing the same problems that threaten their stability: economic, environmental, overpopulation and sustainability issues in the face of depletion of natural resources.  The European Parliament is not designed to deal with these issues, and neither are the democratic parliaments of individual member states.\r\n\r\nMy petition is for the following reform in the UK, and its suggested implementation in other EU member states.  Where a member state decides to leave the EU, powers should not be returned to the parliament of that member nation.  Instead, powers to override parliament should be conveyed to a traditional monarchy within that member nation on the understanding that the monarchy would act decisively on issues such as the economy, sustainability, overpopulation and the environment.",
