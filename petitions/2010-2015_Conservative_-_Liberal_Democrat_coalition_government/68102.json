        "additional_details": "I believe the UK Government should seriously consider revoking the citizenship of ALL UK Nationals who are travelling abroad for the purposes of serving with foreign Armed Forces, Militaries, and Malitia. The same consideration should also be given where the individual has dual nationality and is spending the majority of thier time resident on UK Shores. Any social, cultural, religious, personal and ancestoral reasons for serving with armed fores other than the UK's own should not be taken into consideration. Please sign if you believe UK Nationals should only be fighting for the UK Armed Forces.",
