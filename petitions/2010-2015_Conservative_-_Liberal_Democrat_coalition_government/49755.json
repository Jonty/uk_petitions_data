        "additional_details": "The noise abatement order you have ordered to Millhouse Animal Sanctuary is unfounded and ridiculous. The sanctuary has not had a complaint in the entirety of their existence and this one complaint should have been dealt with differently. The money to put up a sound proofing fence is not justifiable. The money should be spent caring for the animals and helping their welfare. If the person who complained has a problem with the noise - noise they have lived with for forty years without a problem - then they should sound proof their house. I will not rest until I see justice done and the council stopped. What you are trying to do is despicable. Drop the noise abatement order and spend the money on the animals!",
