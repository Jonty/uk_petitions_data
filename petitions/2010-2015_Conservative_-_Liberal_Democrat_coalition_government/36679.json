        "additional_details": "We the people of The United Kingdom want The BBC (The British Broadcasting Corporation) to fund itself.\r\nWe think that enforcing the payment of TV Licensing, is an out of date practice. And that The BBC should be seeking revenue much like their media rivals do.\r\nThe BBC constantly breaks its' mandate to be fair, balanced and impartial.\r\nThe people of The United Kingdom no longer feel that the The BBC provides value for money. Therefore we wish The BBC find alternative ways to get revenue, other than taking from the pockets of the UK public.\r\n",
