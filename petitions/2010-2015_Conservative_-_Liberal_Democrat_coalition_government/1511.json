        "additional_details": "The Government is allowing the great Education system of our country to be rapidly privatised via the Academies and free schools that are beginning to appear more and more in our towns and cities.\r\nAcademies and free schools have complete control over what happens in their school; what they teach; and how they teach. The Government has absolutely no say in the daily life of an academy and a free school, therefore reducing the power that the Government has over the Education system.\r\nWe need the Government to immediately stop the privatisation of our great Education system, and to do this we need the Government to stop the spread of Academy and free schools, and to look after the Education system themselves instead of giving away the power to anyone who wants it!",
