        "additional_details": "As im sure all parents are aware of the series of books called the \"Biff and chip\" series written by Rodderick Hunt and Alex Brychta.\r\n\r\nThese Books are given to our kids to enhance their reading skills.\r\n\r\nI have noticed in one of thier books titled \"The Queen's Maid\" there is a covertly racist agenda going on. The Book is also reinforcing sterotypes and prejudices portrayed by todays media surrounding the \"Black Community\"\r\n\r\nThe series of books has around 200 diffrent titlles which 98% of U.K school's are currently using to advance children within thier reading.\r\n\r\nI see this as 200 diffent ways to attack our childrens minds. If this one book slipped under the radar how many other books from this collection have.\r\n\r\nAction we want is to have these books removed from the schools curriculum.\r\n",
