        "additional_details": "\r\nIn some areas of the country young and newly qualified drivers are being quoted in excess of \u00a35000/year for car insurance on vehicles in the lowest of insurance groups and cost brackets.\r\n\r\nAt a time when young people are forced to travel great distances to find work, to support themselves; their families; or pay their extortionate university fees, the Government has a liability to do all it can to promote access and support them.\r\n\r\nIn a country where an individual who has never worked a day in their lives and has no intention of ever contributing to society, can be rewarded with a tax free vehicle, those who do contribute to society and try to earn an honest living should not be unnecessarily hindered by mindless regulation and corporate greed.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned believe that a fairer solution is a low, universal insurance tariff for all newly qualified drivers, regardless of age, gender or locality.",
