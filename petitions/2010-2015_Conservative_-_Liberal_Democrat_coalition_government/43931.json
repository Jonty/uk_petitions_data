        "additional_details": "I think that the Government of this Country needs to consider whether it is appropriate to give aid to a country that treats women as Second Class Citizens.  The practices of honour killings, the number of rapes and lack of convictions of rapists, the brutality of some of the rapes as highlighted by the recent rape of the student in Deliha and the continued practice of killing baby girls is appalling.  We should not be giving aid to a country that is in the G20, is a fast growing economy but treats just under half of its population in such an abhorent fashion.  Please vote in your droves to make the politicians consider this.  They are only ever interested in foreign affairs when oil is involved. ",
