        "additional_details": "Squadron Leader Les Munro, aged 95, is the last surviving Dambusters pilot. He is proposing to sell his well-earned war medals on 25th March 2015 to raise money for the Bomber Command memorial 'out of a sense of comradeship'. Currently, the charity, the RAF Benevolent Fund, has the duty to pay for its maintenance and upkeep in perpetuity at a cost of \u00a350,000 a year. The upkeep should be paid for by the Ministry of Defence in recognition of the part played by Les and his comrades in World War 2. It should not be up to an individual to sell his hard earned war medals to fund this maintenance.",
