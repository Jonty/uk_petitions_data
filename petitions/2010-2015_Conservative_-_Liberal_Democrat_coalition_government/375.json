        "additional_details": "The creation of devolution has created a situation whereby the People of England are discriminated against. That being Scotland has a devolved parliament, Wales has an Assembly fast on it's way to becoming a Devolved Parliament. England has no Devolved Parliament. This leads to the wrong idea that English people can't look after themselves or are not good enough to have a Parliament of their own devolved or otherwise. This e-partition calls for an end of discrimination against the English people and the creation of an English, Devolved Parliament.",
