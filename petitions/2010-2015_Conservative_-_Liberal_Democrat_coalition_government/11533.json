        "additional_details": "Over 100 countries, including the UK, signed an international treaty banning the manufacture and use of Cluster Bombs. 98% of all cluster bomb victims are civillians - and a third of that figure is made up by children. However several Uk banks including RBS which is 80% owned by the taxpayer continue to invest in companies which make and sell Cluster munitions. This Petition is calling for this apalling use of Taxpayers money to stop. ",
