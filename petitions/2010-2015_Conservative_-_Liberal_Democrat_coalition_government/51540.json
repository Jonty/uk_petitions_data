        "additional_details": "Musicians Against Miming aims to pass a UK law that live music should be live and not faked. If it is mimed then it should be advertised as such.\r\n\r\nKey points:\r\n- Miming is an insult to professional musicians who spend years perfecting their art.\r\n- More jobs would be created for session musicians, sound engineers and stage crew.\r\n- The emphasis would be more on the music rather than the aesthetics.\r\n- The audience would no longer be deceived.\r\nSome musicians emphasise shows with exhausting dance routines and flawless performances. It is impossible for a singer to extensively dance and sing so they mime and deceive the audience in believing that such a feat is achievable.\r\nBacking tracks are also used to boost the overall sound. Where is the line drawn when extra musicians could be hired instead?\r\nSome TV shows still hire session musicians to mime to a backing track. This can include the lead singer.\r\nHiring quality musicians based on talent rather than aesthetics is more important.",
