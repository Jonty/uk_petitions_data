        "additional_details": "This is a ploy by David Cameron to shift the blame for the destruction of the last vestiges of democracy in this land.  Mr Wharton is being set up as a patsy for our dishonourable electeds who don't have the probity to handle this question properly.  David Cameron is using him to avoid blame.  The people of this land want a referendum now, not in 3 or 4 years time when EVERYTHING we hold important will have been subsumed by the fraudulent EU.  Please withdraw your Private Members Bill, Mr Wharton.",
