        "additional_details": "A recent survey of more than 400 sunbeds and artificial tanning units throughout England has shown that   approximately nine out of ten sunbeds break safety rules.\r\nThis study also highlights that compliance with UV radiation safety regulations among sunbed operators in England is  very poor and difficult to enforce, and that users are being potentially exposed to UV radiation at levels higher than those that are deemed safe. Some countries have already banned the use of Sunbeds and with the recent drastic rise in levels of Skin Cancer the UK should seriously consider following suit",
