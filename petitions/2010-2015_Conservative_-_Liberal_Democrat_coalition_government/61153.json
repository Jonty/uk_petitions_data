Anyone can claim right of access through the DMMO  it's free. you are powerless the applicants can say they have walked over your land for 10 yrs you cannot stop them councils grant more DMMO applications in favour of the applicant.I want the Government to revise this law and stop the DMMO  from being processed once the land has been purchased by the new land owner.If anyone wants to claim a right of access whilst the current land owner has no problem then this should be allowed and should be advertised with a right of way at the point of sale including auction sales, otherwise you are purchasing land/property you knew nothing about and did not agree to.
