We cannot let this happen!\r\nOdsal, once described as the \u201cWembley of the North\u201d is a fantastic arena and since opening in 1934 has hosted a variety of sports ranging from F1 Stock cars to International Rugby. Let us also not forget that this was once the home of the Bradford Dukes Speedway team and is the current home of the famous Bradford Bulls Rugby League team.\r\nSurely now is the time to utilise its full potential and allow cars and bikes to once again use the superb oval circuit which has been laid idle for far too long. This will not only generate income for the stadium and owners but also be a place for the local community and travelling supporters alike to come and enjoy the spectacle of a vast range of sporting events.\r\nWe ask for government backing to ensure that motorsport is not driven away from this historic venue!\r\n",
