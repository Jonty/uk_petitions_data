The effect is to impoverish the quality of Higher Education in many state financed institutions.  ACTION: Her Majesty\u2019s government will introduce such legislation and make available such finances and institutional arrangements as to give all British Citizens immediate online access to all academic journal content published after 2000 for a yearly fee of less than \u00a3100 OR for less than \u00a31 per article.",
