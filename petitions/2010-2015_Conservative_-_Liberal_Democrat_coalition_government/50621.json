This would mean a amendment to the result of the decision that came as a result of the Crime and Disorder Act, the Criminal Justice Bill 1998 and the signing of 6th protocol of the European Convention of Human Rights in Strasbourg on 27th January 1999. The death penalty should not be done in public and should be carried out in a well controlled and private environment. The ruling should be following a case being passed from a Crown Court case to the high Court where experienced and trusted judges could pass, enforce and sentence a guilty person to the death penalty once proven guilty beyond no doubt.",
