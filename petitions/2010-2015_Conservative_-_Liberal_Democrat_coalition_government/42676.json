        "additional_details": "If the recommendations of the Levenson Enquiry are implemented you can say goodbye to investigative journalism. No more reports about corrupt practices in parliament, no more about tax dodgers, no more about child abusers, no more about failures in the NHS and all the rest. Yes the press needs to check their facts and stay within all current legislation but they MUST NOT HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED. Without a free press the UK will descend further into a police state where the government controls every aspect of our lives and we will never get to hear about any corruption.  The public have a right and a need to know when dodgy things are going on. Fight those who want the press silenced and sign this petition.",
