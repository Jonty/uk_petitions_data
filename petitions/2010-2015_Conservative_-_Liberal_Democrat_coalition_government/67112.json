        "additional_details": "We are against the development of plot HA77 for addtional housing in Urpeth/Ouston due to:\r\n\r\n1) loss of the only playing fields/open space in Urpeth Grange. These are heavily used by families, especially children\r\n\r\n2) the impact of 79 households on local services (schools, doctors, dentist) that are already oversubscribed\r\n\r\n3) drainage issues. This area acts as a soakaway and the area is already prone to flooding\r\n\r\n4) 3 story houses are not in keeping with the current 2 story housing\r\n\r\n5) damage caused to the abundant wildlife and the impact on the local natural environment\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to halt the development plans and return this site to its original greenfield status.\r\n",
