        "additional_details": "The personal allowances are far too low and have not kept pace with inflation for many years.  They need to be substantially raised to make it worthwhle working. The budegt is due in April and we want the personal allowances raised at that time. If not this year, then next. The bottom 10% of tax payers raise less than \u00a31 billion pounds of tax anyway. If Government revenues are reduced by this measure, we accept that it may need to make cuts elsewhere. ",
