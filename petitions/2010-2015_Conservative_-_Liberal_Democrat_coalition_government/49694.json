        "additional_details": "The National Front had played fraud in the Malaysian 13th General Election in order to retain its dictatorial rule on the nation.\r\n\r\nThe regime of Malaysian National Front had bribed to allow voters of Bangladeshi origins besides using all underhanded tricks in order to preserve its tyrannical rule.\r\n\r\nOne despicable event was that in the district of Bentong, Dr. Liao Tiong Lai had inevitably lost in the election. But after a mysterious blackout in the voting centre, 8 ballot boxes appeared mystically, covering the whole gap of 3,000 votes. The same non-democratic occurrences are also arising in the whole nation!\r\n\r\nI plead to former Suzerain to support and pledge to our cause. British still have ensure colony democracy Independent obligations.\r\nand now, Malaysia is Independent country but Malaysia not democracy country, so I hope British Intervention, fulfill British obligations.\r\n\r\nGod save the Queen!\r\nGod save Free Malaysia",
