        "additional_details": "The UK is experiencing an unsustainable growth in population which is encouraged and fuelled by the perceived need to create future wealth to pay for pensions and benefits. This can only result in an increasing treadmill effect to the detriment of the environment, the problems in feeding ever increasing numbers, transport congestion, jobs, etc etc. We rely on imported foodstuffs as it is but this could become a problem as more and more exporting countries retain production in order to feed their own increasing populations. We must act now.",
