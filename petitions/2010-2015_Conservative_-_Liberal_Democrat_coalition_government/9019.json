        "additional_details": "ADS in a non lethal weapon. It is less dangerous than gas or rubber bullets or even the water canons but is 100% more effective. ADS works like a microwave, by using a radar to emit a microwave beam. The beam is completely harmless as it can only penetrate the first layer of skin (second layer of skin contain nerve endings). It works by heating up the water molecules in the skin causing the victim to feel a sensation of heating up becoming unbearable to withstand the heat. Once the beam has been removed/disengaged, the victim instantly returns to normal. This weapon can be used to break up and disperse a crowd, allowing officers to move and make arrest and feel secure doing so. The USA uses these weapons in prison to break up gang wars. Here is a short video of it in action, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpjxjLRKqw8",
