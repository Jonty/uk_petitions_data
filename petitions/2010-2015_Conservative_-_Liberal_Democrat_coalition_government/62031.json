        "additional_details": "There is a continued lingering effort to ban Halal and Kosher meat production in the UK, to follow other EU countries. There are talks of alternative methods to kill/disable the animal before slaughter but this renders the procedure void as the blood does not flow out of the animal as required.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is a agreed process to stun the animal before slaughter and I feel this is concession enough.\r\n\r\nIt is our human right to practise our religion without persecution and prejudice. There have been studies for both sides of the argument and no definitive conclusion.\r\n\r\nI propose the government safeguard the rights to produce Halal and Kosher meat in the UK by law.",
