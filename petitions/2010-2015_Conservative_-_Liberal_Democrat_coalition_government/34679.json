        "additional_details": "Britain (now not so great) has however just celebrated a peaceful Great Jubilee. At the same time the politicians are sabre rattling over involvement in Syria no doubt preparing us for joining in the 'fight'. Why, when we are in dire financial straights, it is not our war however sorry we may feel for the Syrians and that assumes we are told the truth, not what they want us to hear.The Arab states  are already armed to the teeth yet will do little so why send our already over stretched troops into a further conflict, send the politicians!\r\nWe had Iraq, Afghanistan, (history and the Russians had no success) Libya, so for once lets not go to war. - I as a 70 year old have been lucky I have never had to fight.\r\nI SAY NO TO MILITARY INVOLVEMENT so let us from all of Britain say lets keep our nose out\r\nPlease vote NO TO GOING TO WAR IN SYRIA",
