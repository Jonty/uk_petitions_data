        "additional_details": "British Citizens living overseas lose the right to vote in UK Elections after 15 years of living in a different country, irrespective of how frequently they return to visit Britain or the ties they retain with British society, culture and politics.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve their voting rights, ex-pats must return to live in the UK, abandoning their home, their friends and their job just to exercise their democratic rights.\r\n\r\nAs British citizens living abroad often do not gain full voting rights in the country they reside without renouncing their British nationality, this unfairly forces ex-pats to choose between where they live, their right to vote and/or their nationality.\r\n\r\nIt is our belief that this runs contrary to the principles of personal and political freedom. And as such we call on the government to end the disenfranchisement of overseas voters and to the preserve full voting rights of all British citizens living overseas irrespective of the time they have spent abroad.",
