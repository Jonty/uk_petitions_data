Once offenders have a criminal record this stops them from gaining employment in areas they would be most good at. In america there is a Fresh Start programme in which a judge makes an order that if an offender stays out of trouble for a period of time there criminal record will be witheld to employers and unless they re-offend this will stay the case.
