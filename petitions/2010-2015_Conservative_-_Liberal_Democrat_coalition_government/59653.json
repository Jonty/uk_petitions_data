        "additional_details": "We want the government to demand Mr.Hodgson stops playing long direct football from the goalkeeper and encourages his players to play out from the back and through the midfield.\r\n\r\nThis 2014 World Cup in Brazil, we want attacking, entertaining football played through thirds of the pitch.  It is what the people demand.  The nation is tired of seeing us struggle to keep possession and sitting behind the ball hanging on for penalties again.  We can't win a tournament that way.\r\n\r\nIt also doesn't force coaching at grassroots in England to improve as there is no requirement for technically superior players. Leadership must be established from the top down.  If FA want coaches to develop technical, creative free thinking players - then back it up this World Cup.\r\n",
