        "additional_details": "The estimated cost for policing football matches in England is approximately \u00a325 million, which comes from the police budget. As the current  deal to show Premier League football matches between 2010 - 2013 is \u00a31.782 billion: I propose that  the Premier League & FA should have to pay for policing at all football matches (including internationals, domestic league & cup as well as for European games). The money saved could then be used by the police in more productive areas such as providing more police officers who would be better resourced.",
