        "additional_details": "We Hereby petition the government to create legislation whereby employers are required by law to list any non-internal vacancies with the Job Centre.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not intended to pressure employers to use the Job Centre (as this would be a commercial decision), but to actually create legislation which obliges them to do so.\r\n\r\nFor unemployed people searching for work, there is a tremendous amount of different websites, and job finding agencies where posts may be listed. Therefore very few positions are actually listed with the Job Centre.\r\n\r\nBy making it compulsory for employers to list any vacancies with the Job Centre, workers have one national website to find work. Thus making the search for employment far more simplified.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest the wide array of job listing websites contribute to the economy, or provide any meaningful number of jobs.\r\n\r\nOne website, every job in the country, and suddenly, the search for employment has become a lot more simple.",
