If you search for two words then it searches both of those words separately so if a petition contains either word it appears.  This makes the most effective way of searching to only type one word and keep changing it to find the best.\r\n\r\nI would like a change to be made so that when you search two words both of those words have to appear in the petition.\r\n\r\nSo if you are lucky enough to actually find this petition and want the search function improving then please sign.",
