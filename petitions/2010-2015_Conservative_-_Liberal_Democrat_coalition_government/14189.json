Firstly to bid the user has to buy tokens and spend around \u00a350 - \u00a3100 on the item to win the bid.  Most users lose a lot of money and leave empty handed, this site should be registered as a gambling site and not an auction.  Madbid earn around 300% of the price the item would have cost to buy, an example is tokens cost on average 10p to bid for iPhone 4 16 GB prices at \u00a3499 its 6 tokens a bid there were 5,142 bids and they giving them \u00a33,702 for an item worth ony \u00a3499.
