        "additional_details": "The UK is currently the safest place on the planet for any person who is convicted of a crime in his home country because we are unable to deport any criminals who get into the country.  With the threats about 'you will be brought to justice' being made by our Prime Minister to Syrians perpetrating crimes against their people, the UK is the obvious choice as a safe haven because they know that once they get in they can never be removed.",
