        "additional_details": "Derby City Council have introduced an experimental road closure of The Strand on Friday and Saturday nights between midnight and 5am.\r\n\r\nThey state that this is to protect pedestrians (i.e. late night drinkers) crossing the junction of The Strand, St. James Street, Wardwick and Victoria Street.\r\n\r\nThis road closure has an effect on businesses on The Strand who need to access their properties during the hours of the road closure, most notably Baked artisan bakery & caf\u00e9 who start work at 3am.  The road closure has also led to loss of business for local taxi operators who can no longer use the route to pick up fairs from the bars and clubs on adjacent streets.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this road closure is completely unwarranted due to existing provision of traffic light controlled pedestrian crossings on the junction.\r\n\r\nWe demand that Derby City Council reverse it's decision to close The Strand.",
