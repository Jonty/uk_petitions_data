        "additional_details": "It is completely unacceptable that EDP Energy have been allowed to put a condition into the contract allowing them to charge DOUBLE the going rate for energy as part of the deal for building the new Hinkley Point Power Station. This is committing the UK to further energy price rises.\r\n This deal still leaves the UK tax payers covering the costs of subsidies, it commits us to excessive price rises, and it only benefits the French and Chinese economies.\r\n The current deal needs to be reversed with immediate effect, and the entire situation reviewed before any further decisions are made as to the building of this power station.
