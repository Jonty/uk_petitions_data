        "additional_details": "Forcing councils, housing associations, library trusts and other public bodies to publicly advertise jobs which they already have a candidate working internally on, or who they wish to promote is unfair. Private industry can recruit whoever they wish and only advertise genuine jobs where there is a chance of any applicant getting it. The proactive of forcing public bodies to advertise wastes vulnerable jobseekers time, interviewers time and gives the impression that there is a job when there is not. Stop this unfair practice. If an organisation want to recruit from within, let them like private industry do. Only advertise genuine work opportunities in public bodies and clean up the reputation of recruitment. ",
