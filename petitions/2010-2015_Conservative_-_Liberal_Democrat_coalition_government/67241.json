        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask the government to change the North Devon Link Road into a dual carriageway road. At present the road is only dual carriageway in small sections. It is the main arterial road into the North of the county and its mainly single carriageway is inadequate for the amount of traffic that uses it. There have been many accidents and deaths attributed to the structure of the road. The road was built over 25 years ago and traffic has increased vastly in this time.",
