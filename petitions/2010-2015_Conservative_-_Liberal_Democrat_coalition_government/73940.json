        "additional_details": "Car Insurance companies should take money from fraudsters who stage fake accidents 'crash for cash'. A 'crash for cash' scam costs every driver \u00a390 in insurance premiums.\r\n\r\nSo many people pay more for their car insurance. I'm a university student and my insurance on 1.2 cars is over \u00a32,500 and \u00a32,800+ on 1.4 cars.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, there was an 18% rise in insurance fraud on false whiplash claims that cost a record \u00a31.3billion.\r\n\r\nFake Accidents Cost Drivers \u00a3400m Every Year:\r\nhttp://www.confused.com/car-insurance/articles/fake-accidents-cost-drivers-400m-a-year\r\n\r\nWe want the government to take action. Arrest the fraudsters and ask them to pay back all the money. Also, bring down insurance premiums for honest drivers.",
