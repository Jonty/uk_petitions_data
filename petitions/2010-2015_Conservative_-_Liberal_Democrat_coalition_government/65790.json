        "additional_details": "School uniform is an important part of childrens everyday school life. Hardworking parents deserve help to be able to afford the best school uniform for their child.\r\n\r\nThe Government should make school uniform more affordable by introducing a salary sacrifice scheme where parents exchange a small part of their monthly salary for school uniform vouchers. This will not only help parents to budget for back to school time, it will make uniform more affordable because salary given up will be tax exempt.\r\n\r\nThe scheme would be available to all employers and employees who wish to opt in, with vouchers redeemable at participating retailers. Any retailer can join the scheme. It will be similar to the existing succesful childcare voucher scheme.",
