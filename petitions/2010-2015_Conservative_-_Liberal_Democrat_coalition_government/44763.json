        "additional_details": "In order to support true democracy, and to better represent the variety of parties and views that the electorate can vote for during the General Election, the TV Debate(s) in the run-up to the election should include the leader of all parties which are fielding candidates in at least 50% of constituencies.\r\n\r\nThe current system wrongly portrays the three 'main' parties as the only parties worth voting for and sidelines the views of traditionally more marginal parties, unfairly punishing them.\r\n\r\nClearly, whilst parties only standing in a minority of seats would be ineligible, this proposal would ensure that at least half of those watching the debates would be able to vote for the minority parties represented. This is a fair cut-off between obscurity and the views of an established party which should be able to have its voice heard.",
