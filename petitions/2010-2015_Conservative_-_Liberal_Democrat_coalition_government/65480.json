It's Saturday midday and I've already had five and I suspect this is the same for everyone.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to stop them repeat calling as it is a machine and there is no way to block them from your phone as they call from withheld numbers with no caller id.\r\n\r\nThey also call mobile hone regularly again with no method of stopping them.\r\n\r\nIt is quite simply a nuisance and now to the point of harassment from some and currently there is no redress for members of the public.\r\n\r\n",
