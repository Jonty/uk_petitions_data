        "additional_details": "We believe in Freedom of Speech, however there are those on the internet who consistently abuse Britain's freedom of speech to deliberately cause serious offence to others, for example by using terms such as \"Homosexual-Pervert\" to describe members of the LGBT community. These people are not interested in highlighting issues or encouraging debate. They wish only to demean and upset, using Freedom of Speech and anonymous pseudonyms as a shield on Social Media Networks, websites and blogs.\r\n\r\nWe ask that Internet Service Providers and Social Media networks that wish to operate in the UK (Eg Blogspot, Twitter) be obligated by law to ban account holders that are shown to consistently post offensive material (Including but not limited to religious attack, homophobic material and racism) where the aim is clearly demonstrated to be a desire to offend, demean and upset as opposed to encourage debate or education on an issue.",
