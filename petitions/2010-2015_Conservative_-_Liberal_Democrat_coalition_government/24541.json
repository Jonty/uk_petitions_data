        "additional_details": "I would like to see an independent body set up to take control of government spending plans. Politicians should decide what they want to spend money on, but then they should have to ask the independent body if the money is available, if the money is there then they can spend it, if not then savings would have to be made before any more money is made available. This would also stop the age old practice of buying votes by spending money when near to an election. Governments should run the country, and business men should control the purse strings.",
