        "additional_details": "I have stayed at Queens Hospital twice in the last 3 years, both times for C-Sections. The first time was horrific, I nearly lost my baby and a bungled epidural has permanently damaged my back, requiring further surgery. The second time I was misstreated by midwives and nurses. I am still traumatised by all of this. I have read over and over in the media of cases worse than myself. Unfortunately one man lost his wife and baby due to a mistake. I believe that more midwives are required, further training is needed and attitudes of the staff on the maternity wards need to change. This petition is for the improvement of the maternity Unit at Queens Hospital, before more deaths happen and more women, babies and families suffer.",
