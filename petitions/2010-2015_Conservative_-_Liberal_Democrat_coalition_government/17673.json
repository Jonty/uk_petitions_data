This is simply none other than a donation box set up in every supermarket, shop, bank and library or via online or phone where people can put any amount of money they have towards the country\u2019s financial struggle. If everyone put in a pound a week there would be over \u00a350,000,000 a week towards the debt. There is no forcing people, there is no taxing, taking or imposing, just simply asking. Any money is going to help and I am sure people are more willing to give if the government are willing to ask.\r\n\r\n(facebook group: British Economy Fund)",
