        "additional_details": "From personal experience and cases that I have read and searched; it is clear that there is not enough regulation for family carers. Many vulnerable adults are susceptible to abuse, and due to lack of regulation, carers with criminal convictions and drug and alcohol addictions are caring for vulnerable adults without adequate regulation, resulting in both physical and mental abuse to vulnerable adults. If you think that the government should implement adequate regulations and legislation to ensure abuse is not happening, please sign this petition. With an ageing population this problem can only get worse. Adequate regulations could be achieved with CRB checks of family carers and regular home visits to ensure that all really is well. Closer work with social services and family carers also needs to be achieved. ",
