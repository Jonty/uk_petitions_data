        "action": "Public ownership of the proposed Sellafield nuclear project",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the government to abandon the short-sighted approach to energy security so clearly evident in previous administrations, and consider public investment in, and public ownership of the proposed nuclear plant at Sellafield. It is abhorrent that a foreign national public body potentially stands to profit enormously from the UK taxpayer, while subsidising their own customers with British revenue. Energy security and abundance is crucial to future British prosperity, and successive governments have shirked the issue for too long. Utilites are necessary to all who reside in the UK, and as such should be owned and managed in the public, not shareholders' interests. ",
