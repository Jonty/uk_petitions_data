        "additional_details": "I am a 17 year old male that has recently passed my driving test with very few minors. As I have passed my driving test I want to be on the road gaining experience as soon as possible. The cheapest insurance quote I have received so far is \u00a35000. Essentially depriving young people the invaluable experience needed. I am shouting out to people who feel young drivers insurance deserves a cap for both male and female and therefore allowing young drivers the freedom they deserve after paying so much to enable them to pass their driving test.
