        "additional_details": "For many years the residents of Gosport have had to put up with an inadequate road network. The current road network was designed when there were less motor vehicles in use. The roads in and out of Gosport are now unable to cope with the increase in traffic. Residents always face lengthy queues getting out of Gosport in the morning and then getting back into Gosport at night. Whilst the new Quay street roundabout system may help it will not go far enough to reduce the problem. This problem is having an impact on Gosport residents and businesses. It is also one the main reasons why new businesses are unwilling to start in the town. Upgrading the roads in and out of Gosport will improve the lives of residents and will help improve the local economy and make Gosport a better place to live.",
