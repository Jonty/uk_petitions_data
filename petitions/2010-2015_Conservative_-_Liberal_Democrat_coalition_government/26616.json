        "additional_details": "MK Partnership was set up by the previous government. It is an unelected quango, and treats the concerns of MK residents with contempt.\r\n\r\nMK has grid roads, which give us a pedestrian casualty rate far below the UK average, cleaner air as cars travel efficiently, and prosperity as working people can get in, out and across the city quickly.\r\n\r\nMK Partnership has, ever since 2004, ensured that where they have authority, no grid roads have been created or extended, and that existing grid roads have been downgraded.\r\n\r\nIf localism means anything, then MK Partnership must be abolished. They work contrary to the wishes of MK residents, ignore local transport policies, and go directly against the Core Strategy, which was published under the previous LibDem council and is now agreed by the Conservative administration.\r\n\r\nAbolish MK Partnership now.",
