        "additional_details": "We pay tax because we are told to do so without consent through the barrel of a gun with threat of imprisonment. Therefore, taxation is a form of aggressive violence. We do not need the third party of government for 'wealth redistribution' between fellow humans. We do not need government to supposedly protect us from 'other bad people' by putting the very bad people into government. The solution to living well is to take back the right to govern ourselves. Taxation is not a price we pay for civilisation because look around the world and notice that the word no longer means what you think. We do not need taxes to pay for roads, fire stations, police stations and schools, because we already have private schools and look how much better they are than government schools. The richest people have their own private security too. The taxes we pay go to fund wars in foreign lands thus making you the sponsor of terrorism abroad. The government must stop taking taxes from people or be abolished.",
