But most of all to help the people who need it the most.\r\n\r\nAllowing a tender process for this service to private companies means that profit will be allowed, meaning any money spent in the services will be given to shareholders, and not reinvested into service.\r\n\r\nI propose that these services should remain under the umbrella of the local government (council) and spending is decided by such.\r\n\r\nChild protection services should be not-for-profit!",
