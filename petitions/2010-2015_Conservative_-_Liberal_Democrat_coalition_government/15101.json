        "additional_details": "The Party Wall Act requires neighbours working within 2 metres of a party wall shared by neighbouring buildings to give adjacent owners prior notice of an intention to undertake those works. There is no sanction in place and the only remedy is private legal action which is costly and uncertain. Many builders know this loop hole & openly fail to comply, often carrying out questionable structural changes which are not picked up. The Government should introduce a penalty for non compliance.",
