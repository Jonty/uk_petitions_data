Therefore a person who takes a life should lose their life.\r\ncapital punishment is the only penalty severe enough to make criminals think twice before committing major crimes.\r\nThe chance of error is very small given a thorough and fair justice system.\r\n\r\nRevelation 13:10 says, \"He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.\"",
