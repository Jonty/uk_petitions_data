        "additional_details": "The Royal Bank of Scotland has shown a culture of greed. it has resulted in the UK taxpayer having to bail them out. There have been too many scandals with this bank. The latest being the manipulation of the Libor rate.\r\n\r\nTheir atrocious behaviour undermines their use of the word 'Royal' and the charter they were awarded. It undermines what 'Royal' means in terms of the highest standards of quality, integrity, honesty and values\r\n\r\nThe Government should pass a law to strip this organisation of the right to use the word Royal to publicly demonstrate the disapproval of the UK taxpayer. This would also ensure that any organisation given a charter to use the word 'Royal' has to always behave with impeccable ethics and behaviour.",
