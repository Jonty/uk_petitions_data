We should have our exams returned to us so we can see where the marks have been given and to see if our grade is justified. It is highly frustrating when a re-sit is needed and you don't know where you went wrong last time!\r\nAlong with the exam results, the exam board should return the papers and I believe the government can pressure them into doing so.",
