It claims that it will it is part of a lean management program to reduce cost and improve inter-department efficiencies.\r\n\r\nThis should not be the case! The buildings should only be used for Government purposes. This is merely one piece in a wider policy to sell off the MOD's historic and priceless assets for short term cost saving measures. HMS Dartmouth, The 'War Office' and such like should be kept intact. This legacy once gone is gone for ever!\r\n\r\nShort term benefit should not be at the expense of long term capability!",
