Electronic surveys that place a legal obligation for the public to return their opinions and concerns to the government would provide the government with an opportunity to connect with the people they serve. This would be ideally carried out annually in much the same way as a census. From this the government can see reactions to their policies and be formally held accountable where they have gone against the wishes of the electorate. An annual survey would mean that the public don't need to wait until the next general election to express their dissatisfaction.  ",
