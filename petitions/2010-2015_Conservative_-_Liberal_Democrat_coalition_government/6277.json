        "additional_details": "it is too much to expect young adults to leave university with a  huge debt. Although the debt is about \u00a345k, the average person is likely to pay back \u00a390k. There is also a hidden bombshell, the number of people who will never pay back the debt. In a time of mounting national debt, encouraging people to run up debt on the off chance they will get a \"better job\" is sheer folly. The way to solve this is to reduce the number of University places by cutting the subjects that won't lead to jobs. Gardening and plumbing etc should not be university subjects, as an example.\r\n\r\n",
