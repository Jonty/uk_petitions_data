        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand an independent public inquiry into the organisation, procedures and practises of the VeteransUK Agency.\r\n\r\nWe are concerned by the waiting times for the review and completion of compensation claims on the War Pension and the Armed forces Compensation System Schemes.\r\n\r\nVeteran and Serving Armed Forces Personnel are waiting for unnecessarily long periods of time, from when claims are submitted to their resolution, to find out about compensation that they are entitled to through injury and illnesses sustained and received through, or made worse by, their military service.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Agency is operating inefficiently and ineffectively, leaving claimants without necessary support for long periods of time, and that an Independent Public Enquiry will show the failings of the organisation and produce positive changes for all.",
