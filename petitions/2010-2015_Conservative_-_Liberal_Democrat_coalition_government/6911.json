        "additional_details": "EMA was a grant upon which thousands of students relied on each week, until, because of government cuts, it was axed in early 2011. The grant was not a great loss to government spending, and it actually provided a huge lifeline to the underprivileged students of this country; even if it was only \u00a310-\u00a330 a week. This fund must be taken seriously by the government, and I ask that Parliament vote to bring back EMA as soon as possible.",
