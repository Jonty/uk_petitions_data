The world needs a new outlook on the global markets - but it should and can start with ourselves refusing to prop up failed capitalist cavalierism. Nationalise them to keep people's money safe if needs must, but do not give them another hand-out which makes them beleive they are invulnerable, and adversely effects 99.9% of the population. ",
