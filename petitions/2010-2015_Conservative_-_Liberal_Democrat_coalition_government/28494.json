        "additional_details": "In many areas pupils are required to use regular service buses to get to school.  This creates a number of issues for both pupils and regular users.\r\nOften pupils are late due to service buses being delayed before the school route. Private bus companies frequently use buses that are too small for combined school and private traffic meaning that pupils are left at stops often in inclement weather.\r\nThe haphazard nature of this provision means that many parents decide to drive pupils to school which is an environmental and congestion issue.\r\n\r\nWe propose that all pupils living outwith one mile of the school are given free transport to address these issues.",
