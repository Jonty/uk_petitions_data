All we are asking for is for funding to build new tracks and to reopen older tracks like at the Valley in Newtownabbey. The Councils have given Skate Parks to Belfast and Carrickfergus but these arent a suitable place for BMX Racing. We need support, Team GB need Gold at Rio 2016. Support the next generation of BMX Racers and they will show the world what GB can do!",
