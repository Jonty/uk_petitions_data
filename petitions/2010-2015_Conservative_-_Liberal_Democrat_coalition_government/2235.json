        "additional_details": "Britain's National infrastructure ensures our health, wealth and security through provision of (water and sewage, flood management, energy, solid waste, ICT, transport etc.\r\n\r\nOur current infrastructure has significant vulnerabilities, is managed in a fragmented way, has increasing capacity limitations (resulting from issues in both supply and demand) and many components nearing the end of their useful life.\r\n\r\nThe signatories believe the current UK National Infrastructure Plan is insufficiently ambitious and lacking in resources.  We need to invest a much larger proportion of our GDP in infrastructure provision, remove the fragmentation and barriers to successful infrastructure management and delivery and make investment in the redevelopment of our infrastructure a national priority to ensure Britain does not lose its competitiveness.",
