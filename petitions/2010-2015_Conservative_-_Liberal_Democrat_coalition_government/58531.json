The BBC will not change until it is forced to be wholly 'representative' of the English indigenous people (not a minority culture portrayed on TV and Radio programming). The new Director General (Lord Tony Hall) cannot (will not) undo the damage already inflicted on the destruction of English values and fairness in faith, law and charity.\u2028\r\n\r\nTHE BBC CHARTER ENDS IN 2015.\r\nThere should be NO TAXATION without REPRESENTATION\r\n\r\nWe can only influence our UK parliament that there is a real need for change. There is clear evidence of shameful bias (and corruption) over a very long period of time. An example is here:\r\nhttp://biasedbbc.org/quotes-of-shame/\r\n\r\nNote: The BBC is a public monopoly enjoying a unique privilege in UK public broadcasting of not being accountable to parliament. ",
