They called for a National Day of prayer to the Creator God and immediately the situation turned round. Let us restore our Nation again to be Great Britain and cry out to The God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob he never changes. He rescued us then let's ask Him to rescue us again? This may be Britain's last chance. Sign we me as Churchill did so can we?Lord God help us in our time of dire need.",
