Within two weeks I find that I have to take it back in again to have something else done that has mysteriously gone wrong with my car.  The repair bills are astronomical and my jaw drops.  There should be a law that says that if you have to return your car to the garage within six months that the garage has to do the repairs free whether or not it has any connection with what you brought the car in for in the first place.  It's time the Garage gets terrified everytime they see our car arrive in their forecourt. ",
