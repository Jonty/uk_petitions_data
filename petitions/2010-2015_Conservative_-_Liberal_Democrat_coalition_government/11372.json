Such an Act would allow for a simple show of hands by Defendents and Prosecutors alike, perhaps even members of the press etc, thus short-circuiting the waste of Court time in many cases where common-sense has obviously been sidelined, usually to suit vested interests. Such an Act would also significantly reduce legal costs by removing 'silly' cases from the system at the firsrt hearing.",
