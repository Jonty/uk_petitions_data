        "action": "Extend the remit of Waterways Ireland to include the Newry-Portadown canal & the Newry Ship Canal.",
        "additional_details": "Completed in 1741 the Newry/Portadown Canal is the oldest summit level canal in Britain and Ireland and links the Irish Sea with Lough Neagh. Abandoned in the 1960s the line of the navigation is intact and the lock chambers in reasonable condition. Restoration of this important heritage waterway would be relatively inexpensive and provide a massive boost to local tourism and business. Voluntary groups are already working hard to conserve and promote the remaining infrastructure but restoration is beyond their capabilities. Waterways Ireland is responsible for inland waterways island-wide. Adding the Newry \u2013 Portadown canal and the Newry ship canal to their remit now will ensure a co-ordinated and cost effective management structure leading to eventual restoration. To achieve this requires a change to legislation in Belfast, London and Dublin. Signing this petition adds to a growing voice in all 3 jurisdictions to make this happen. ",
