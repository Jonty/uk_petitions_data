        "additional_details": "I believe all recycled, secondhand and antiques goods be 0 rated for VAT. This will promote more people to start buying and selling the goods and encourage recycling.\r\nNew items are often purchased and then thrown away. For example a new piece of furniture is recorded to last the average of 5 to 7 years and then is thrown away.\r\nAntique furniture has been built to last and no trees are being cut down to make antique furniture unlike the modern equivalent and antique furniture was originally mainly constructed by hand in daylight so no power tools or lighting was used.\r\nThere is minimal transport with second hand goods as they are already in the country so not imported from overseas and the money used to buy second hand goods will be spent in this country not sent abroad out of the country. This will produce more growth in our own country whilst helping our environment.\r\n",
