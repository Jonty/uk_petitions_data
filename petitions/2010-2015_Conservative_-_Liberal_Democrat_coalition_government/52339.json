        "additional_details": "With the huge number of killings going on it cannot be denied that your failure to operate prisons as prisons instead of as the luxury hotels they now are has a considerable effect upon the choices that people make.  Lots of us don't eat more than once a day; lots of us cannot afford to heat our homes; lots of us don't have our cleaning done for us; I would love to be able to switch the lights on and NOT think about the bill.  In prison all those stresses are removed AND I get to keep my state pension - with nothing to spend it on.",
