The death of substantial numbers of patients under his care and oversight was a serious failure of multiple management practices, processes and systems.  The impact on patients and families  was of such a scale that an apology is not acceptable. No manager is irreplaceable and every manager must be fully accountable.\r\nHis refusal to resign and continuing government support for his remaining in post is seriously undermining public confidence and trust in the overall management of the NHS.
