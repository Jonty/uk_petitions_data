The current awareness and level of consistency of knowledge is terrible, and children have to wait up to a year to be referred to a specialist, and a lot of healthcare professional and doctors give bad and inconsistent advice. All of which means children suffer a great deal of pain and discomfort, and parents are put under a lot of stress until they are diagnosed.",
