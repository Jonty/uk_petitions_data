        "additional_details": "British civilians contribute to the well-being of international communities by putting themselves into danger in the frontline of international conflicts. Among these is Dr David Nott, who maintains a medical practice in the UK, but spends part of each year (for 20 years) in war-torn countries and has shown the difficulties, improvisation and humility while treating and saving lives of people injured (shot/bombed) recently in the Syrian civil war. The Queen honours people for excellence in domestic duties, but I believe that equal consideration should be given by Government to outstanding British citizens involved long-term and directly in preservation of life elsewhere in the world. Dr Nott's role can be appreciated in a two-part BBC interview about his life-saving in Syria. I am not related to him in any way.\r\nhttps://audioboo.fm/boos/1823489-you-would-be-be-squelching-around-with-blood-on-the-floor\r\nhttps://audioboo.fm/boos/1824604-my-experience-working-in-a-secret-syrian-hospital\r\n",
