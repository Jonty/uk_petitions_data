        "additional_details": "The government to address the issue of not keeping F1 free to view. In efforts to save money the BBC has had to have a compromise with F1, which results in all races not being shown live on the BBC. This will clearly be detrimental to the sport, as watching half the races is a bit pointless as you wont be able to follow what is happening in the championship. Edited highlights are no substitute. With 10m people watching F1 then the BBC has clearly got it's priority mixed up. This should have been a must win and should be backed by the government as such. This petition is to register complaint whether anything can be done with the current proprosal and to register for the next round of negotiations that people want free to view full coverage on the BBC.",
