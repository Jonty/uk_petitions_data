        "additional_details": "There is an urgent need to regulate the provision of estate managing services to residential leasehold properties.  The UK has seen an incredible increase in the number of leasehold flats without the regulatory system in place to ensure that Leaseholders are protected.  The Estate Managing Industry is totally unregulated with the only entity in place being ARMA a Trade Body financed by the Estate Managing Industry therefore hardly impartial.  Parliament must address this area to ensure fairness and transparency",
