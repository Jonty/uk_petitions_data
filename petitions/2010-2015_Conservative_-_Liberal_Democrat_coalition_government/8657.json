        "additional_details": "Both horses riders and road users are frustrated by the lack of off-road riding for horse riders meaning that horses must use the roads. Horses and motorised transport are not a good mix. The UK government and EU give large subsidies to land owners for 'set aside' that could be opened up to horse riders (and other users of the countryside.) The subsidies could be used to maintain the tracks/land for such use.",
