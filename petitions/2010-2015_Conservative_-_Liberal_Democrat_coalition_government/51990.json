        "additional_details": "Kristian Holmes was sent to prison this month for 3 and a half years for being a prolific graffiti vandal, and attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr Holmes may have caused some property damage but he is not a danger to the community. His prison sentence is incredibly harsh for a family man, especially considering he was remanded in custody until he was sentenced. Dangerous sex offenders recently have been receiving light and non custodial sentences, this is a shameful act by the British justice system and needs to be immediately rectified. Lighter sentencing for graph artists and harsher sentences for sex offenders!\r\nFree Kristian Holmes \"Vamp\"",
