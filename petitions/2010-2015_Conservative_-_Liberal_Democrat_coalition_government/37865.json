This comes down to not talking down to people who are going to the Job Centre for help only only get handed rediculas tasks to complease such as \"You should not have qualification on your CV\" sent to see someone who has no or very little training in CV skills who just tells you to rewright your own CV and never get a follow up! Being sent on a \"What employers expect from employees\" course. We were told \"Dont be late\" and \"Dont turn up drunk or on drugs\". This is a wast of time for everyone and tax payers money. Why not try to arrange somthing more helpful than 5 minuets with a person who has a very basic grasp off english or just dose not care about the people they are employed to help. Make sure that the job points in the centra are working. An example of this is 4 out of the 8 in Dagenham were out of order for over a week. ",
