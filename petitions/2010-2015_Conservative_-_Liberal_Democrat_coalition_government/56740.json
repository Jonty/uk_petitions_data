        "additional_details": "There needs to be a desperate review of MP's allowances, particularly those that are for their second homes. There seems to be an increasing trend of well off MP's claiming for allowances such as fuel ranging in the thousands for their second homes! MP's need to start to be aware of the real world and claim allowances that really are necessary. Whilst the public are facing a squeeze on their finances not seen for 100 years, MP's believe its acceptable to claim they are underpaid and receive perks that the majority of the UK population could only dream of. This petition should be a wakeup call for MP's to get real.",
