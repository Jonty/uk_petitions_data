        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like to call upon the Government to introduce legislation that protects employees from investigatory interviews without the benefit of representation or witness on their behalf at these interviews. At present employers have their own witness, which is unfair and can often be seen as bullying and harrassing a single employee who has no witness to speak on their behalf regarding unfair practices which occur during such interviews. With the outcome of Cadder v HMA we believe it is only right that employers allow the same standard of representation for employees that is at the heart of employee rights.",
