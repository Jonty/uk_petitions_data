        "additional_details": "Non Welsh speakers in Wales are discriminated against in employment in the public sector with the Welsh language qualification being used as a \"race\" card.Vast amounts of money are wasted on duplicating all utility bills and all paperwork from Councils etc. A recent survey found that only 25% of people in Wales spoke welsh so why is it that this small percentage holds such sway.If a language is wanted it will survive but forcing children to take it as a compulsary subject robs them of valuable time learning a more relevant subject. All Acts discriminating against the English Language in Wales should be repealed.",
