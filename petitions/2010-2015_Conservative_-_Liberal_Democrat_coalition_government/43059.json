It is common practice in other countries to enforce a withholding tax which requires of the order of 20% to be paid to the state  when such payments are made to overseas companies.  Under international tax treaties such payments can be offset against corporation tax liabilities in the parent country for the recipient company.\r\n\r\nIf the UK is to obtain a fair share of the taxation on profits of multi-nationals we need such with-holding tax regulations.",
