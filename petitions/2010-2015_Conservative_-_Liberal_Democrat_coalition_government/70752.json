The one area you should not be challenging especially in light of the suggested pay rises for MP`s is these departments! I intend to start a campaign here to get fair treatment. Why can`t the Police etc go on strike? I intend to raise this matter with the European court of human rights on their behalf as it is a basic right to withhold your labour.",
