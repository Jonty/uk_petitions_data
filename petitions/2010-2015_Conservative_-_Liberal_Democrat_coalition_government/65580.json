We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nNick Clegg is outgoing leader of the LibDems in this country, he is also in receipt of a pension from the EU for his service previously as an MEP.  Continuing receipt of his EU pension is dependent upon him NEVER talking down the EU and NEVER failing to support the failing EU experiment.  That is a conflict of interest which places him in the position of NEVER honestly being able to represent the interests of any UK electorate which now, quite clearly, want nothing to do with the EU.  Receiving a pension from the EU while being a UK MP is a monumental conflict of interest which could not be contrived and we MUST take steps to ensure it never happens again.",
