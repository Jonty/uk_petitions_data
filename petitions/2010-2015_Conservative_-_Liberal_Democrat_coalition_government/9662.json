        "additional_details": "As prisons are no deterrent and places are limited, rather keep hitting the law abiding working man, introduce higher fines to help the country finances instead.  Then only law breakers will be punished.  Take the fines from source - either wages or benefits.  Set a maximum amount that can be taken each week / month per fine.  So if the max was 5% of benefits & benefits were \u00a3100 then \u00a35 a week would be taken.  If another fine was imposed then \u00a310 a week could be taken.  If the person can't afford to live then they should start to live by the laws in place.",
