Despite the new Acropolis Museum being fit for purpose to rehouse these looted artefacts, the British Museum has insisted they are too fragile to move.  Until, that is, the headless god Ilossis was loaned to the Hermitage Museum.  Instead of representing the cultural values of enlightenment shared by Russai and Britain, they should instead represent the ideals of democracy shared by Greece and Britain.  This marble frienze is not Elgin's.  It belongs to the people of Greece, and must be returned.",
