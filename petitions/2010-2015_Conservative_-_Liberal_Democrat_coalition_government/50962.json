A criminal is more likely to invade a house or mug someone if they know they are unarmed, we live in the era of knives, knuckle dusters, guns, and many other types of weapons held by a thug, it is time to give British citizens their rights back.\r\n\r\nRETHINK the gun bans, I'm not saying follow the USA by letting any imbecile buy a gun, but we should regulate the guns in the UK not outlaw them.
