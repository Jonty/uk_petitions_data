She then packed him into a suitcase and discarded him in the woods like a piece of rubbish. She then went on to claim her son was missing which led to a huge manhunt before her son was found and her story unravelled. She has just been sentenced to a paltry 11 years. Where is the justice? Why are we being so lenient to child killers? We are sending out a message that says its ok to kill children because after a few years you will get your life back. This sickens me! Sign this petition,  lets get this vile woman a longer sentence!",
