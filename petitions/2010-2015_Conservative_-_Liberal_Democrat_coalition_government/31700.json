        "additional_details": "There are many risks for stillbirth/complications in pregnancy which are well known. Obesity, smoking, diabetes, pre-eclampsia are just some of the risks.  Mums with known risks are monitored more closely during pregnancy than so-called 'low-risk' mums.  This is a 'reactive' process leading to the loss of many babies (and possibly Mothers) that were labelled as \u2018low risk\u2019.  Some apparently 'low-risk' mums do in fact have high-risk babies (one in two stillbirths still remains unexplained).  Why does current monitoring of these apparently perfectly healthy babies not identify them as at-risk?  More must be done to improve how 'low risk' Mums/babies are monitored.  This may involve giving them the same level of care that a higher risk Mum (someone that may have had a prior complication/miscarriage/loss of child) would receive.  The current monitoring needs to be improved and made 'proactive'.  Please help by signing this petition.",
