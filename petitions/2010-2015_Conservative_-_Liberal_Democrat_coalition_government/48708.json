        "additional_details": "At the moment children wishing to invest in the stock market have to get their parents to do it for them. I believe this should change. Children should have the right to invest themselves (with parental consent.) At the moment a childs parent has to open an account with a stockbroker for their child and then transfer the stocks when they are 18. Children should be allowed to have their OWN account and just pass everything through their parents. This would give youger children a better understanding of the market. If they lose \u00a350 now it is better than losing \u00a350000 later on in life. Any mistakes they make they will learn from. By having a better  understanding of the market children will also learn how to use their money. I also think that children should also get free advice from their stockbroker. ",
