        "additional_details": "\r\nLate afternoon on the 6th October it became very evident what impact the 6 year freeze on our TV licenses meant to us the viewers & listeners of the BBC.  The shock announcement that well-loved local BBC radio programs would be lost, BBC 2 would be overhauled & some sporting events not covered left listeners stunned in disbelief.\r\n\r\nThe freeze designed to help people struggling to pay the license fee will in reality make them pay the same fee for a reduced quality of service.  This is not fair \u2013 exempt them from any increase & allow those who are willing to pay a modest increase do so to keep the service we want.\r\n\r\nThe BBC has given me a life time of entertainment, I am not ready to bow down & let our BBC be disemboweled in this manner for a couple of extra quid a year.  I urge you to support this petition to get the government to rethink the freeze on the license fee & keep intact 1 corporation still British owned.\r\n",
