        "additional_details": "The Highway Act of 1835 renders the Segway PT illegal in the UK on pavements. They cannot be used where bicycles can (even electric bicycles) because they do not have pedals - and they cannot be used on the road as a motor vehicle because they do not meet any kind of permitted type approval in the UK. The only place they CAN be used is on private property (and only with the land owner's permission).\r\n\r\nI'd like the government to legalise the use of the Segway PT on UK pavements and in bicycle lanes. Doing so would ease traffic congestion in busy town/city centres. Obviously it would be dangerous to have people scooting along at 25mph on the pavement, therefor I suggest that when bring used on pavements the Segway owner limit their device to 12.5mph. The owner should be allowed to use their device at 25mph on the public highway to avoid accidents.\r\n\r\nI believe some Conservative & Lib Dems held a demo on support of legalising the devices: http://bbc.in/bEwlc4\r\n",
