        "additional_details": "Why are we pushing many experienced and very capable nursery staff out of work by introducing a requirement for all children's nursery staff to be NVQ level 3 or above? Many staff have years of experience and a real gift for working with the babies and children, so why exclude them from the employment when there are already checks and balances in place to ensure the nurseries are covering the required \"syllabus\" by way of Ofsted inspections?\r\nRepeal this legislation and let the nursery managers and inspectors employ staff who are suitable, capable and suitably scrutinised.",
