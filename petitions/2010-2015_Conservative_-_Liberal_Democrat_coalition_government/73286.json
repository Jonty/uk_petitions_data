        "additional_details": "From 1st January 2008 \u2013 19th March 2013 there have been a total of 61 males found deceased in the waterways of Greater Manchester. Sadly, many more men have been found since.\r\n\r\nThis needs to stop no matter the cost. One mans life is worth more than the cost it would be to erect the fencing. Imagine if it was a family member of yours next? It just keeps on happening and whatever the reason these men are finding themselves in the water whether it be alcohol related or an act of violence, we need to help prevent it. Gates can be installed for easy access to points of access and maybe even ladders along the way if they can be attached.\r\n\r\nCanals and rivers are dangerous places. Please be careful when drinking near them.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and help us save at least one life.",
