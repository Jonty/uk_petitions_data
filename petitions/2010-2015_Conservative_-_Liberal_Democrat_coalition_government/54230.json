        "additional_details": "my petition is to ask the government to do away with bank holiday Mondays and replace them with bank holiday Fridays.\r\nFriday is a much more vibrant day of the week whereas bank holiday Mondays are dull and lifeless and finish around 4pm as people get ready to batten down the hatches for work the next day.  I'm sure if an employer offered their staff a day off, either Monday or Friday the majority would choose Friday. So, lets have vibrant, life affirming bank holiday Fridays (which could give a boost to Thursday evening and the retail/hospitality trade) rather than dull half hearted bank holiday Mondays that finish at 4pm ",
