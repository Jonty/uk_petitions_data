        "additional_details": "Mr Gove has announced that with immediate effect, the first GCSE grade achieved by a pupil will be the one used in school league tables. This is to reduce what he calls the \u201cdamaging trend\u201d of early entry.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is ludicrous and must be scrapped. Many schools use early entry to great effect in motivating pupils and raising achievement and DO NOT 'cap' students at a C grade, quite the opposite.\r\n\r\nIt is a disgrace to make this change now, when the cohort is in its last few months of education. The Government must stop tinkering and making piecemeal changes to examination policy without considering the whole picture.\r\n\r\nSchools should be allowed the freedom and autonomy to make educational decisions in the best interests of their pupils and not forced in to 'playing' the league tables.\r\n\r\nPlease help to persuade Mr Gove to abandon this misguided proposal.\r\n",
