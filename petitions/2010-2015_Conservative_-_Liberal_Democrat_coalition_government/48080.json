        "additional_details": "It is said that immigration is not a bad thing per se, but what it does not deal with is the fundamental resources to deal with an increased populace.  This means that education, health, housing and in the benefit system cannot cope with the additional heads.  Education Needs more teachers to cope.  There is pressure to provide more midwives.  There is pressure on the general housing stock.  Migrants take work which is invariably low paid employment which means they are entitled to the benefits' system.\r\n\r\nThis has to mean that the borders are closed, even if it is for just two years, in order that some form of stability can be achieved.\r\n\r\nThis means a change to our treaties.\r\n\r\nThe government must show a radical stance to deal with this situation, and I urge everyone to sign this petition to get the government to make serious attempts to stop continued expenditure.",
