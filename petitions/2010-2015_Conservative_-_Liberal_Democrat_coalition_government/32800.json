In Kosovo Gypsies are located to dangerous and poisonous lead mines, in Hungary they are being killed, Italy is burning Gypsy families, and even Britain plays a role in its newspaper and tabloid bid to whip up hate and racism.\r\nAn EU-ROMA policy would FORCE the EU member states not to socially and politically exclude Roma Gypsies on the sufferance of heavy sanctions.\r\n\r\n.",
