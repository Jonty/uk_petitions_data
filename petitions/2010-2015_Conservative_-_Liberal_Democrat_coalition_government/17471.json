        "additional_details": "A stem cell organ transplant will effectively give the patient a new organ without immune rejection problems. Stem cell technology is more natural, safer and can be more cost effective in the long run than using artificial or foreign materials. Stem cell technology is potentially a technology that can be applied to various fields of medical science, ranging from organ transplants, pharmaceuticals, to cosmetic surgery. Transplants using organs/tissues (like heart, liver, limbs, brain tissues, even teeth) developed from the patients\u2019 own stem cells will not give rise to immune reject problems or adverse side effects & reactions.  Apart from being highly beneficial to patients, stem cell organ transplants are likely to be more cost effective than non-stem cell organ transplants, bearing in mind the current shortage of organs for transplants and rejection problems.",
