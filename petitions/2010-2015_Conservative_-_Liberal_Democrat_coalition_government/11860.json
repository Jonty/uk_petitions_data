There are obvious things that can be done now, very easily, to start to reclaim our lost young people \u2013jobs, jobs, jobs, reading, writing and arithmetic, discipline at home and in schools, parental rights to discipline their children, respect for elders, welfare reform,  sports grounds and youth clubs, scouts and guides, army. Air Force and sea cadets, competitive and team sports, role models, evening and weekend classes, school holiday clubs & camps, volunteering and community projects, a strong police force we can respect again, zero tolerance for knife, gun and drug crime, stiff penalties. These are obvious things the government must do right now to help parents and teachers bring direction, hope, aspiration, fun, confidence, and pride to our youth. It\u2019s just a shame that it looks like a list of the things successive British governments have destroyed over the last 30 years.",
