Had enough ?? Want to reclaim your landline back , want pushy sales pitches to stop on your mobile .\r\n\r\nPeople all over the country now won't answer there phones and I believe this has to end !. I put forward anyone offering there services or sales pitch should not be allowed to ring your phone unless you have contacted them first expressing an interest in there services . I believe the government should bring this harrassment to an end as the TPS does not stop the practise of random number dialers . ",
