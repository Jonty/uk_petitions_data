        "additional_details": "Three years ago, Dolce & Gabbana published an advert as part of their marketing campaign. It featured a woman fully clothed in a tight dress and spiked heels, lying on her back, hips raised, as a bare chested man holds her down and four other men look on. This is unacceptable and gives the coming generation the view that sexual violence is fine. We, the undersigned, want the UK government to issue a ban on any company portraying sexual violence in order to market its products. ",
