        "action": "change the length of service to put an unfair dismissal case against an employer from 2yrs employed to 1 year",
        "additional_details": "Currently by law you have to be working for a company for at least two years before you have a case against unfair dismissal. I found out the hard way when I was unfairly made redundant when my job was not even redundant (they were in the process of training someone else on my job as I was in the redundancy period) I was also discriminated against for my length of service. As I hadnt worked for the company for 2 yrs (I was a temp for 1yr and an employee for 1yr 10 months) I was therefore not entitled to be treated like a human being and I just had to accept an absolutely unfair outrageous dismissal. The law was changed in 2012 from 1yr to 2yrs employment. I think this is an outrage. Get rights back for the working person and protect yourself against unfair dismissal. Sign this petition, you never know when you might need protecting!",
