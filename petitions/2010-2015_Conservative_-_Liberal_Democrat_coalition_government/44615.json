        "additional_details": "All hand dryers other than the Dyson Airblade are unfit for purpose and result in inadequate levels of hand dryness. Leaving hands moist means that door handles and bannisters become breeding grounds for bacteria. Moist hands can also increase instances of chafed hands amongst individuals who regularly place their hands in the pockets of their jeans. We propose a government subsidy for all premises that opt to install the Dyson Airblade (or devices that are capable of achieving an equivalent standard of dryness) in their restrooms.",
