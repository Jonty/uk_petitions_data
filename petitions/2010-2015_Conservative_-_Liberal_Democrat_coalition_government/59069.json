In today's world, segregation based on national origin should be an item that is non-congruent with our modern ways of life and a violation of human rights. I herein propose that the UK suspends the British Nationality Act  1981. It promotes the notion that a subjects birth in the UK is less that of another, based on their paternal and/or maternal origins. Allow children born in the UK to bear its name and defend and be proud of the country they were born in.\r\n\r\n     We know that standards in human rights have significantly declined in the west in recent years, but the UK is remarkably cavalier with any idea of human rights. As world leaders of democracy, we hope this would not fall on deaf ears. ",
