        "additional_details": "Having been a student for two years I have experienced that student loans are not big enough if both your parents are earning. And I'm not meaning earning a lot, I'm meaning fairly low paid jobs.\r\n\r\nThis means that students with parents who are unemployed get more at University, even in bursary's meaning many struggle while their parents try to scrap some money together to help. I am asking for an even loan system where everyone receives a loan the same as the next rather than a means system that doesn't seem to work.\r\n\r\nI am also asking for a rent cap of 50% of the loan as it seems that at some University's 75% of the loan is being used as rent leaving students with pennies to live on.\r\n\r\nTherefore I ask for the Government to get rid of the means testing and to give everyone the same amount and for a rent cap.
