        "additional_details": "Since the 1980's, the Govenment of the United Kingdom has continued to sell off the housing set out in the social housing bill set in the 1950's. as a direct result of this action, the housing stock owned by the council authorities in the land has been reduced greatly.\r\nDue to the shortfall in housing, the local councils have been forced to either pass tennents to Housing Associations, or Private landlords. All at the cost to the councils, and to the exchechquer. This only serves to enrich the lives of those that already have wealth. but forces many people to rely on the tax payer, the councils, and force up council tax. Any moneys paid by local councils for private landlords has to be made up from a source, and locally it is in the council tax as the councils main source of income. Stop the selling of council lands, and by that, the peoples lands, to private developers. only use this land for council tennents",
