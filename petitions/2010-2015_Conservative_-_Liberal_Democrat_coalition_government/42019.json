        "additional_details": "Short Term and Payday loans are becoming all too common on our TV screens. They are targeted at the people in society who really cant afford them and most likely to default. They are also shown at prime time and as such are giving the impression to our children and those watching that they are from credible, responsible  and approved companies. They are NOT and should be banned from our TV screens immediately as a first resort.\r\nPlease join us in taking this to our Politicians to try and obtain an Outright ban on all TV advertising.",
