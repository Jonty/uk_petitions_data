Surely we deserve to at least know there are two sides to a story?",

            "details": "Responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the organisations which regulate broadcasting - the Office of Communications (OFCOM), the BBC Trust and the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority (S4C). They are independent of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe BBC's governing instruments, the Royal Charter and Agreement, place broad obligations on the Corporation in respect of its television and radio services, objectives, programme content and standards. Within this framework detailed decisions on programme content and scheduling are matters for the BBC, reflecting its editorial independence. It is a long-standing principle that the Government does not interfere in programme matters, either on arrangements for scheduling or on content. It is important to maintain the principle of freedom of expression which political interference could undermine.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes it is important that the Corporation is aware of the concerns of viewers and listeners, and in the first instance concerns may be raised with BBC Information (email via the website, http://www.bbc.co.uk, telephone 03700 100 222, or write to BBC Information, PO Box 1922, Glasgow G2 3WT), or by writing directly to the programme area concerned.\r\n\r\nIf unsatisfied with the response, there is an option to complain to the Editorial Complaints Unit (ECU). The unit examines complaints independently. Its address is Editorial Complaints Unit, BBC, Media Centre, Media Village, 201 Wood Lane, London W12 7TQ."
