        "additional_details": "Whenever a property is sold, an entry of the price paid is logged to HM Land Registry and is available for public view. A benefit of this is that it enables potential buyers to research the true value of a property regardless of the asking price set by the vendor.\r\n\r\nSimilar entries should be logged into a registry of the actual prices paid for rented properties. Asking prices for rent are increasing exponentially and prospective tenants have no way of researching previous prices paid. Action on this will help to regulate the rental market and give more power to tenants.",
