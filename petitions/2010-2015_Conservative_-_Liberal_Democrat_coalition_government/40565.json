They are undemocratic and unjust and the current economic crisis which began in the US with the extension of loans to people who could not pay them off is a direct result of them.\r\n\r\nWhile this system pertains no one is immune and the IMF and World Bank embody it as well\r\n\r\nHM govt like most around the world is enormously in debt and the US has the biggest debt the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nHM govt has a sovereign duty to free itself and the people it tries to govern from this failed, corrupt and outworn system and to hand the people back their rights and free them of enpoliticianment to the banks and financiers who wrongfully control them.",
