        "additional_details": "Have you been woken up in the middle of the night by the booming or whining sound of aircraft overhead?\r\n\r\nHave you lost sleep after being woken up by aircraft noise at night?\r\n\r\nHas night-time aircraft noise ruined the rest of your day?  Has it made you tired or unproductive at work?  Has it made you feel ill all day, or maybe even longer?\r\n\r\nIf your answer is yes to any of the above, and you want to change your life by being able to sleep at night, then sign this petition, for the following motion to be debated by MPs:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Government should introduce a complete ban on all commercial (passenger and freight) aircraft over-flying residential areas between 1.00am and 6.00am.\u201d\r\n\r\nEveryone has a right to a good night\u2019s sleep.  If you value your forty winks, then please tell forty people about this petition!\r\n\r\nEvery signature demonstrates the real impact of night-flights on people\u2019s lives, including health, lost productivity and damage to the environment.",
