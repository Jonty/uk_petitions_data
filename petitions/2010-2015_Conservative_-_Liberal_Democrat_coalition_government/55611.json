The new site they want us to move to is completely unappropriate, it is open to the public & has safe-guarding issues, is on a busy route for heavy building trucks, is badly lit, has no storage for our equipment, is too small for our activities & even the children will have to be accompanied to outside public toilets!\r\nPlease help by signing to show your support for us to stay in our hut & stop Barking Riverside Limited from 'killing off' a british past-time for our children, which installs great morals & keeps kids off the streets of our deprived borough!",
