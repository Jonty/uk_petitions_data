This approach to the person complained about also being the investigator of that complaint and decision maker on action taken was found wanting with the Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission was created.\r\nI propose that all complaints about low or dangerous flying by the RAF no longer be investigated in house but by an independent commission who will balance the needs of the RAF against the problems of and dangers to people living under RAF flying areas",
