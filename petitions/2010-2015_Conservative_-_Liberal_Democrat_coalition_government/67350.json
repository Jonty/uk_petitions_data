        "additional_details": "Neonicotinoid pesticides are having a devastating impact upon our environmental infrastructure to the detriment of ecological processes, biodiversity and public health. Research shows the numerous pathways by which neonicotinoid pesticides significantly pollute and poison water courses as well as a tremendous diversity of wildlife. Most recently, neonicotinoid pesticides was shown to be the most significant factor explaining the massive decline in farmland bird populations and likely explains the demise of many other mammals and insects too (especially pollinators). The natural predators of pests are being destroyed by shortsighted, ignorant policies and a belief in profit at all cost. It is the economics of the madhouse. We are calling for an IMMEDIATE and PERMANENT ban on neonicotinoid pesticides. We are also extremely concerned the UK government opposed an EU ban on three neonicotinoid pesticides and made attempts to temporarily suspend it.",
