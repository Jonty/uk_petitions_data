        "additional_details": "With effect from 21st October, The local council, West Oxfordshire District Council will be implementing changes to one of two of the long stay carparks in Witney.\r\nThe Woolgate carpark hosts several parking zones for shoppers and public alike, all for different times. At the far end is zone F which allows you to stay for 9 hours. This is very important for the full time workers in Witney, as there aren't many long stay places at all.\r\nThe carpark hosts 145 places, and the council think that they can change them to 3 hours, and to use the other long stay multistory carpark, which hosts 144 longstay places.\r\nHow can they think that all of us will fit there??\r\nSTOP THEM FROM CHANGING THE HOURS!\r\nThe council are doing it to make more money on parking tickets!!@",
