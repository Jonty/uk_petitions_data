He says the UK film industry needs to concentrate on making \"commercially successful pictures\" but did nothing to help the UKFC survive.\r\n\r\nHe blithers on and on about money, money, money.... and does nothing for actual cultural development. He is a pleb in a suit. I want the house to tell him so.",
