It is therefore hypocritical that we maintain monuments, memorials and statues recognizing British soldiers who have committed atrocities in recent wars.\r\n\r\nAs a prominent example there is a statue of Sir Douglas Haig displayed in Whitehall despite Lord Haig bearing command responsibility for the use of chemical weapons against German soldiers in the Great War. General Haig also oversaw the widespread execution of British soldiers who were classed as deserters.\r\n\r\nI propose that all former soldiers, whether officers or enlisted men (in rejection of the Eichman defence) who were complicit in war crimes, crimes against humanity or who were members of firing squads who shot British soldiers have any statues to them demolished and have their names struck off all memorials to the fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
