It should be amended, not abolished.\r\nI therefore propose the following:\r\n\u2022\tThe title of the Act be amended to The Human Rights and Responsibility Act\r\n\u2022\tExtra clause 1 : \u201cIt is the responsibility of each UK citizen and each visitor to the UK to afford the above rights to each UK citizen and each visitor to the UK\u201d\r\n\u2022\tExtra clause 2: \u201cIf any person fails to comply with \u2018extra clause 1\u2019 than that person loses the protection of this Act to an appropriate and proportionate extent\u201d, and\r\n\u2022\tExtra clause 3: \u201cIf any non-UK citizen breaches extra clause 1 grievously or persistently, nothing in this Act supports that person\u2019s right to stay in the UK\u201d\r\n",
