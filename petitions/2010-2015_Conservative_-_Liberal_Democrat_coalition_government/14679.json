        "additional_details": "We counter petition the many petitions created which are in favor of bringing back capital punishment. We believe the idea is unrealistic and ultimately unjust.\r\n\r\nOne of many arguments is the fact that execution of an innocent, wrongly convicted, person is a very real and horrible possibility. Although the mistake can never be rectified completely, spending time in jail is preferable to spending forever dead.\r\n\r\nMany people understandably want criminal eligible for the death sentence to suffer retribution. However, which is more punishing? A moment of pain to die or the rest of one's life (a personal eternity) in a jail cell with no chance of parole?\r\n\r\nWe, the signers, are welcoming of a debate into such a controversial issue, but would like to be clear that we are strongly opposed to capital punishment.",
