        "additional_details": "It's apparent that the unit price of petrol can vary quite widely between different branches of the same supermarket, often within the same city. As far as I know, this is unique to petrol.  Instore products seem to be priced nationally, so what is different about petrol?\r\nIf the price is being set by reference to other outlets in the same locality then it is anti-competitive. It makes no sense to drive to the other side of town to find cheaper petrol. Localised price fixing can be eliminated by forcing supermarkets to set their prices nationally, thereby allowing for more competition and benefiting the consumer.",
