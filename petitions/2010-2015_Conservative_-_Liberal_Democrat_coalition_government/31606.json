        "additional_details": "We call upon the British Government to recognise all genocides that were perpetrated in Iraq between the years of 1968 and 2003 against varying ethnic, religious and national groups. We ask for the British government to encourage the EU and UN to document and respond to these genocides in accordance with international humanitarian law.\r\n\r\nThe Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights estimates that over 1 million people went missing during the thirty-five year period leading up to 2003. The vast majority of these victims lie unidentified in mass graves, with their fate and whereabouts completely unknown to their families, whose suffering in itself is defined as torture by international humanitarian law.\r\n\r\nRecognising the Iraqi genocides will enable Britain, a country known for its democracy, to send out a strong message of support for the Iraqi people, paving the way for a post-conflict reconciliation process with justice and peace at its heart.\r\n",
