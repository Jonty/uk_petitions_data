        "additional_details": "Since 1862 the Land Registry has recorded the ownership of land and property in England and Wales and produces data on house prices and transactions that are used by the government to make policy decisions.\r\n\r\nThe Government is taking the first steps which will lead to a sell-off or part privatisation of the Land Registry.\r\n\r\nThe Land Registry is a highly respected and trusted institution.  It is profitable.  Yet the coalition Government believes it would be better value for money if it were privatised.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to reconsider these ill-founded plans and preserve the Land Registry in it's current form.\r\n",
