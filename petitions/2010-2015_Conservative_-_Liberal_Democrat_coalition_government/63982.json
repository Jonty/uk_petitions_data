        "additional_details": "Digital downloads are easy, quick and fun, right?\r\nWrong. They remove the fun out of actually working for the music, aswell as providing people with an easy way to pirate music and put them on to CDs. Music is of cultural importance and it impacts the way that people act and the way that they think. iTunes and YouTube downloaders have broken this impact and made music worthless and forgotten.\r\nCDs also enable piracy. People can pop them into a computer and rip them onto other CDs and sell them for discount price. Screw copyright cause the police don't care about piracy right? I've never seen anyone arrested for illegal distribution or obtainment of music.\r\nThe moral of this petition is, is that the Government need to make a serious decision on the future of music. Remove piracy, remove CDs and bring back the meaning of music!!",
