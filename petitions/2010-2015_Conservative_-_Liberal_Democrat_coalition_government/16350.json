        "additional_details": "I propose the creation of secure Housing Accommodation units/homes on blighted estates whereby the perpetrators are housed until deemed able to return to there home.  The monies saved from prison, eviction and/or homeless costs would be used to train residents of the estate in the skills needed in the areas of management, the caring for and if necessary the education those housed in the units/houses.  In the cases where properties may be empty, those properties would be use for neighbourhood housing and home maintenance projects which would then be returned in good order to the those placed in the unit/homes when released back into community again.  So as not to alienate those housed in the units/homes their motivation to be part of the community again would be getting them involved in ground maintenance and general gardening/growing food projects as part of there sentencing plan.\r\n",
