        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament at the earliest opportunity to legislate to subject the public office of Prime Minister to direct election.  It makes the same logical sense for the head of the executive arm of national government to be directly elected as it does the head of the regional government in Greater London or the executive leader of a local authority and other countries enjoy directly elected executive political leaders such as in France and the USA.  This would allow a true separation of powers and the opportunity for talented individuals outside of party politics to stand for the benefit of the country.",
