        "additional_details": "Ruth Ellis was the last woman to be hung in England, she was 28. It was 60 years ago this July.\r\n\r\n We believe that although the law of the land was technically correct in 1955, the effects of 'Battered Woman Syndrome' were unknown at the time and the other acts of brutality against Ellis were withheld from the jury - Ruth murdered a man, but was a victim of domestic violence. In view of these facts, we believe the decision should be re-addressed. It should be considered a crime passionnel. We believe Ruth Ellis should be given a posthumous pardon on this basis.\r\n\r\nAnother woman was reprieved the week before Ruth Ellis was hung.\r\n\r\nDavid Blakely treated Ruth Ellis appallingly using continual physical and emotional violence to an already traumatised woman.\r\n\r\nThe jury did not know Ruth had suffered a miscarriage not long before the shooting due to a blow from Blakely.\r\n\r\n",
