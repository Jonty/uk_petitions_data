        "additional_details": "We request that the government asks Worcestershire County Council's Joint Commissioning Unit to revise its proposal to close Ludlow Road. Ludlow Road is a small respite centre set up by the health authority to provide short breaks for families with severely physically disabled children with complex medical problems. The unit is used by 23 children across Worcestershire. The families of these children have confidence in the competant and dedicated staff that run the unit which enables them to entrust their children to the care of the unit and enjoy brief respite from the emotional and physical demands of constant caring. For these families Ludlow road is a lifeline.",
