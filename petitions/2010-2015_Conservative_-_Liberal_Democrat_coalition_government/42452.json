        "additional_details": "The A12 is a major route taking traffic from London to Harwich and Felixstowe.  These are two of the busiest ports in the UK.\r\nThe current 2 lane 'A road' is unable to deal with the amount of domestic and commercial traffic.  Parts of it have been dubbed the most dangerous road in the UK due to the high number of serious accidents and deaths. In Kent, the M2 and M20 do a similar job with ease.\r\nThis petition seeks significant improvements to the A12 and it's transformation into the M12 motorway which was planned many years ago.",
