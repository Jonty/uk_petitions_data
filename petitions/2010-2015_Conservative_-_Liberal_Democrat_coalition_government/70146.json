Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity, stability and way of life, as much honoured in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, is severely at stake.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK government to:\r\n1. press Beijing to grant Hong Kong a true, unbiased democratic election of the Chief Executive\r\n2. express strong concern to the Beijing authorities of the situation in HK and impose possible sanctions if situation deteriorates\r\n3. make a full review of the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration",
