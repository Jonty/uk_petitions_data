        "additional_details": "Single fathers who want to be actively involved in their child's life are too easily restricted by the whims and wants of the child's mother. Presumption of father's rights to access should be written into the law. In the case that the father poses a risk of harm to the child then their access should be restricted, but not those who are law abiding respectable citizens. It should not be the choice of the mother to determine whether a father gets to see their child/children or not. In addition the process of single fathers gaining access to their children should be made easier and simpler. In addition the current state of single father access to their children is too focused on the emotions of the the parent carer and therefore decisions made for the child are far too often based on emotion and thus are irrational and selfish.\r\n",
