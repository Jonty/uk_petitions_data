        "additional_details": "Dudley Council intends to close a wonderful residential care home for the elderly called \"New Bradley Hall\" in Kingswinford, West Midlands that is a safety net for the weak and vulnerable people in the borough that cannot look after themselves or afford the obscenely high private care home fees.\r\nMost of the residents are well into their 90's and there is even one who is 103. Their doctors have advised the Council that moving them would be gravely detrimental to their health. In short, it will kill them. If you care about what is going to happen to care for the elderly in the future we would urge you to sign our petition and then contact your local MP or Dudley Councillor to make your feelings known. Please help keep New Bradley Hall Care Home open. Thank you.\r\n",
