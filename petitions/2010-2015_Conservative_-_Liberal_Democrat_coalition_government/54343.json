        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned call to outlaw ALL use of the Captive bolt gun for the destruction of the Canine species in the UK. The Captive bolt gun is neither appropriate nor humane for use in destroying dogs. Behind closed doors any unlicensed or untrained person can legally use the Captive bolt gun to destroy a dog. Many experienced vets around the UK agree that the Captive bolt gun should NOT be used on dogs. Cases have been previously highlighted in regards to Greyhounds being mass destroyed by use of the Captive bolt gun, such as the Seaham Slaughter in 2006. No law has been introduced since this mass slaughter in order to prevent this from happening again. We believe the Captive bolt gun is used in preference to intravenous euthanasia solely due to economic reasons and disregards the animals suffering. ",
