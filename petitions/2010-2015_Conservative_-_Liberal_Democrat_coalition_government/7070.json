        "additional_details": "Over the past week we have seen riot's destroying our towns and cities.  People are looting from shops, ruining lively hoods in a tough economic climate.  People are frustrated that all relationships have been lost and nobody has faith in the Police any more.  Thugs and hoodies have no motivation or respect for life or other people.  Knife crime has increased and people are frightened to walk out of their houses.\r\n\r\nYoung people need rules and boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to reduce their overheads so why not bring back National Service and have a back up front line.  Teach young people about responsibilities and guide them to become respectful adults.",
