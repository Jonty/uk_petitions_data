        "action": "Prevent GCHQ Monitoring Email and Web Use",
        "additional_details": "The government plan to introduce a bill that will allow GCHQ to monitor any email or internet usage of any citizen in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis is an infringement of our civil liberties and a crystal clear invasion of privacy. The internet is a free form of media and communication but the Con-Dem government wish to subject us to the same lack of freedom and liberty as China and North Korea. Do the people of Britain really want this?\r\n\r\nThese plans must be abolished immediatly. Our country has been regarded as a safe and liberal place to live. We help the US remove dictatorships that prevent freedom in other countries but soon we won't be able to freely browse the internet.\r\n\r\nRemember that those in power, if this bill passes won't longer need a magistrates order to view private internet usage, they'll be able to view it on demand, in real time. If you value liberty, I strongly suggest you sign this petition",
