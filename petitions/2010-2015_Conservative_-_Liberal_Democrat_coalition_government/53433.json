They are from Poland and so should serve their prison time in Poland. Why should the British taxpayer pay for them for the next 30 years (at least, hopefully they actually get life) Take away their so called basic human rights like they took away Daniels, they took his basic right to be treated like a human so they should have no rights what so ever. Come on everyone don't let them get away with it they need real punishment which they won't get in prison in this country.",
