        "additional_details": "The following signitories would like to request that the UK government reconsider their proposal to require that ISP's impliment an opt-in system, blocking access to online pornography.\r\n\r\nWhile we understand this is in the interests of child safety and wellbeing. Child safety and supervision online are parental, not governmental responsibilities. Free and easy to use tools are already available online to prevent access to pornograpic content without requiring the implimentation of a blocking system, and implimenting blocks on the behalf of parents, only encourages further lazy online parenting, allowing children to fall victim to other online dangers.\r\n\r\nThis system could also easily become a slippery slope to other forms of internet censorship in the future and would be an international embarassment to the UK, as a country that actively preaches the merits of freedom of expression, and has on many occasions denounced China's \"great firewall\".",
