While on this programme jobseekers are unable to attend any training course to improve their skills.\r\n\r\nWork programmes only give people the facilities to apply for jobs they do not give people the skills to do the jobs they apply for\r\n\r\nI propose that before being sent on a work programme the unemployed gets the choice to attend training courses instead which will increase the ammont of jobs they can do.
