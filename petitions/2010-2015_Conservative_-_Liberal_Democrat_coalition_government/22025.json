Either remove the charge for calling this number or provide us with geographical numbers so we don't have to pay this extra stealth tax for calling the police; we are already paying for this service through our taxes. The police website tells us this number (101) is for reporting non-urgent crime. We are expected to pay extra taxes to \"assist\" the police in doing their job?",
