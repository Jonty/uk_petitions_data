GFR is 100 percent in a normal person but only 15 percent at best for a dialysis patient, a rate that has changed little in the past 30 years.\r\n\r\n(source : News alert Eurekalert!!)\r\nRequest Department Health\r\nConfirm they have looked at the feasibility of using ceramic filters as dialyser filters, if not undertake a feasibility study and publish outcome.\r\n",
