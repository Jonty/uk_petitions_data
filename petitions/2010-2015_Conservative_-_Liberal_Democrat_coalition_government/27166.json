        "additional_details": "Sanitary Protection is a women's health issue not a profiteering exercise. It is not fair that women have to go to the extra expense to pay for sanitary protection each month whilst men do not. Condoms are available free of charge at family planning clinics, so should sanitary protection for monthly periods. Women have only recently acquired the vote, yet we still have the inequality of paying for sanitary protection. To improve health, well-being, opportunity and education for women we need to make free sanitary protection for all women a priority. Women should not loose this money every month, we are not animals!  ",
