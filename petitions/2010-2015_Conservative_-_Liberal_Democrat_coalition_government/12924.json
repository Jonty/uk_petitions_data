        "additional_details": "Old and vulnerable people, in particular, often find themselves receiving large numbers of invitations to enter postal prize draws that are superficially convincing but, on closer inspection, clearly fraudulent.  There is no doubt that many people spend significant sums of money on such hopeless competitions and offers. I believe that legislation is needed to outlaw any postal prize draw or similar offer that has not been licensed in the UK.  It would provide powers to prosecute the operators of such draws and offers, and confiscate their assets.  Extradition powers would also be required as some operators are based overseas. Please consider supporting this petition: it could be your mum or dad who is drawn in next.    ",
