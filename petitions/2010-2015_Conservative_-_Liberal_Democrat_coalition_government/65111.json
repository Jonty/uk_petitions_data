        "additional_details": "This e-petition is to oppose the ban on khat that has been approved by the House of Lords on 12 May 2014.\r\n\r\nKhat consumption induces mild excitement similar to the effects of a strong coffee. The use of Khat brings people and communities together keeping culture and traditions alive, banning Khat would surely cause more harm than good.\r\n\r\nThe Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs reported that Khat should not be banned because there was \"insufficient evidence\" it caused health problems and that Khat is less potent than many other commonly used stimulants.\r\n\r\nBanning Khat would have a negative impact branding innocent, hard working people as criminals for a natural product no stronger than an energy drink.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this e-petition if you agree the decision to ban Khat should be reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
