        "additional_details": "It is deeply unfair for young people, especially pre-university students, to be assessed only by a couple of examinations. It is deplorable that one examination can weigh on the whole of the student's future and on the outcome of many years of education. I propose for students' examination to be based on in depth teacher assessments which would include progress reports, homework's and mock test's results. This would ensure that the student would be tested from the whole of the material and not only from a part of it, and also it would cut on the teaching to the test which purpose is to cram as much information into the student's head as possible and not to educate him and aid in personal development. Instead of wasting money on testing which punishes creative students whose answers don\u2019t fit the mark scheme the money could be used on invigilators who would check the fairness of the marks given to the student by his teachers.",
