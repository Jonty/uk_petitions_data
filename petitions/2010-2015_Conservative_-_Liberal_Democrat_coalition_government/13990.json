        "additional_details": "Whilst the actions of rioters are abhorrent, the Government should punish individuals based on the individual crimes rather than the exemplar fashion that takes into account the environment at the time. This is especially relevant given that these events occurred subsequent to massive crimes in the financial sector for which no-one has been charged, let alone jailed, and parliament, where most MPs stole much more and were allowed to simply apologise in most cases",
