        "additional_details": "Although many people have heard of the Commonwealth, there is very little talk about it both in the media and among the population. Although the UN and the EU get a lot of attention, the Commonwealth does not. So I feel that, since the UK helped to set up the organisation and that our monarch is Head of the Commonwealth, we should boost the popularity of the organisation and make it more important in world politics. We can do this by becoming more involved in it, and by encouraging it to take a more active role in international affairs and crises. For example, Britain could make the Commonwealth take a visible (to the media) stand against human rights abuses in members and non-members.",
