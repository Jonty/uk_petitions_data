        "additional_details": "In these times when global organisations and countries can lay oil pipelines across continents and under oceans. This petition is proposing an end to all future global famine. In particular this petition is seeking support for a water pipeline for Africa. This pipeline could carry water from water rich areas of the world to those areas prone to famine. It can be done. Just look at dry/arid coastal areas of other countries such as Spain where hundreds of thousands of local citizens and tourists are served with abundant water from the wet areas of Spain.",
