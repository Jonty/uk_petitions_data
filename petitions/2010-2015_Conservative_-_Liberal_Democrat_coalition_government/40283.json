I believe that lenient sentences for such horrific crimes against children does not reflect public opinion. I also believe that the majority of decent, law abiding citizens in the UK would agree that 'life sentences in prison' should be mandatory for anyone who wilfully commits such barbaric acts against a child/children.",
