We demand proof that until his designated murder date and time of 7am this day of 11th July 2012, that he was not already dead at the hands of Belfast City Council. We demand to know why his family were not allowed to see him prior to nor after his murder.

We are the voice of the defenceless, you the Government are supposed to work for us, the people, we therefore demand you listen, and hold to account those involved. ",
