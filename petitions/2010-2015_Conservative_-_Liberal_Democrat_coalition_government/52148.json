        "additional_details": "That the present Government for the British recognise that the present Parliament for the British does not deliver Government for the British in a form with which all the British are content and that it participate in the creation of a Parliament that will.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for the dissatisfaction among all its members with the present Union of the British lies with the Parliament of the Union. The Parliament for the present Union makes neither allowance nor adjustment for the numerical advantage enjoyed in the Union by the English. Nor does it offer any mechanism for articulating the majority view of either the Scots, the Welsh or those of the Irish who continue to attend the Parliament. What this produces is a Parliament that in matters of interest and concern to all the British delivers English judgements whilst in matters only of English concern it delivers judgements that are tainted by the views and opinions of members who do not represent the constituencies of England.\r\n",
