Both parents should work together unless one is unfit to do so. Good parents should not be denied access to their children and should be helped by mediation to work together to ensure the best interests of their children are met.\r\nChildren ought to have one home with both parents, but where that can\u2019t happen there should be two loving homes for them unless one parent is unfit to provide that home.\r\nThis should be the default position; it would be fair for children, would be fair for mothers and would be fair for fathers.\r\nThe arrangements for children should be put in place as quickly as possible.\r\nThis should be the default position for open family courts. The system should accept that fathers and mothers can both love and provide for their children. ",
