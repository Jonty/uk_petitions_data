        "action": "Limit Apps from requesting permission to access unrelated features",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to specifically target the increasing use of 'Apps' to target individuals. As more and more Apps are developed, the less the likelihood that people will dedicate sufficient time to reading the 'small print', especially those who are less computer literate. This could in turn lead to unscrupulous companies taking advantage of the vulnerable. The initial aim is to stop Apps from requesting permission to access and/or control any aspect of an electronic device other than that specifically required to run the App.  In the long term, strict guidelines should be put in place to both limit the access and control of electronic devices and the dissemination of information by third paties.",
