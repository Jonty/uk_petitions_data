        "action": "Maximum wage. To work towards international agreement for the imposition of a maximum and minimum wage in all countries.",
        "additional_details": "Capitalism has given us extraordinary growth over the past 250 years, however its drawbacks are starting to outweigh its benefits. The time has come for an intellectual revolution. The imposition of a maximum and minimum wage in all post-industrial countries will pull our fragmented societies together. This is about the restoration of social justice. Nobody need earn more than 20 times the lowest paid worker. The extraordinary profits getting skimmed off the top of our efforts in the work place need to be folded back into the economy before our super-elite create the conditions for a revolution of a different kind. Our fragmented global society must be pulled back together by an intellectual revolution, a global revolution, and a peaceful revolution. It starts by signing this petition and it continues with the encouragement of international consensus on the issue of a maximum and minimum wage. ",
