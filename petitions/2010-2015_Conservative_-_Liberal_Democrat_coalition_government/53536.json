        "additional_details": "The frequency of deaths on the tube lines has increased and there now seems to be one every week almost. I feel it is time for the government to push London Transport to install barriers on all of the stations in particular in the centre of London where platforms are small and yet the number of people on them has increased. The Jubilee line is a very safe line as it has the barriers. London Transport needs to stop payments to their Directors and use that money on installing the barriers. Suicide deaths on the tube lines causes a lot of chaos not counting the traumatic experience for those there and the driver. This must be done now not in ten years time. For once let us put people before profits and money. ",
