I have had a terrible experience with firstly, \"morrisons\" as a sub contarcter to do repairs and now \"wates\". The majority of these people cant communicate in english which is intimidating when there is a group in our home carrying out work that YOU are not properly informed about, speaking to eachother in a different language and not understanding what you say. Also the work I have had from these are absolutely diabolical beyond belief! I would like others with the same experiences to sign this petition. We are not second class citizens because we live in council homes and , we pay our rent and deserve a quality tradesman to carry out skilled repairs.",
