As such the Argentine claim to the islands is null.\r\n4.That the British settlers, dispossessing no one, are themselves the natives.\r\n5.That, after the referendum, considering the fact that the islands have chosen their current status, the relavent UN authorities should take steps to remove The Islands from the List of Non-self governing territories.\r\n6.That, recognising of the referendum, the UN should view the territorial dispute over, in favour of Britain, but more importantly, the wishes of the islands population\r\n",
