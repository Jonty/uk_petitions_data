For example: How can it be justified that a Local Authority must supply details of all businesses moving into properties in a given period. This will only be exploited for commercial gain. At a time when local autorities must do more with fewer resources, it seem incongruous that they are effectively subsiding private companies by doing pre-sale research. Surely not the spirit of FOI Act\r\n",
