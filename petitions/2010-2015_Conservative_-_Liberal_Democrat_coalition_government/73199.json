        "additional_details": "Why is it a Postcode Lottery, with regard to getting treatment for Lymphoedema, particularly, non-cancer related Lymphoedema? Many people go undiagnosed for years, often being told that they are just overweight and to go on a diet! When they are diagnosed, they are told, that there is nothing that can be done, or are given water tablets such as Furesemide, which do not work on the Lymphatic system. This is despite the fact that there is excellent, evidence based treatment, such as Complex Decongestive Therapy (CDT) and more recently, micro surgery, which does help. There is no cure, but there is treatment, that can alleviate the symptoms, including the severe pain suffered by people with this condition. The cost in ruined lives, of not providing treatment, is unacceptable. This government must make these treatments available across the country and locally, not just to a lucky few and there should be a Lymphoedema Strategy for England, as has already been set up in Wales and Scotland.\r\n",
