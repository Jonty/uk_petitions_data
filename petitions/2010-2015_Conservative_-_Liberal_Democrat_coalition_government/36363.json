        "additional_details": "If Scotland goes independent UK tax payers money should not be used to subsidise wind farm construction in Scotland. This is not against wind turbine construction but the jobs should created in the UK not a foreign country. Welfare bills would come down as people would be off the dole etc in new jobs. Why create new jobs in Scotland why not in Wales or England.  The North, Midlands, Wales, South West have high unemployment why should they not be used as areas of renewable energy excellence.\r\nEnergy Independence would also be needed. Scotland could still sell to us but would not be subsidised by those south of the border.  ",
