        "additional_details": "The currently proposed wind farm is too large/too close to the shore. Some of the turbines may be the same height as The Needles and the impact that this will have on the view in this beautiful, unique area will be significant. Tourism and wildlife will be adversely affected. Nothing like this has been tried before, in an area of such natural beauty and high tourism. The plans should be amended so that the windfarm is further out to sea (as in other European countries), or moved to an area where the impact will not be as great.",
