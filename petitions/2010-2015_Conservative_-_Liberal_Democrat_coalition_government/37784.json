        "additional_details": "The European Commission is proposing to outlaw the use of any modifications and non-original components to historic vehicles by introducing the following legislation;\r\nPeriodic roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers and repealing Directive 2009/40/EC\"\r\nMany elements of this legislation make good sense, however the legislation in its current format would immediately render thousands of historic vehicles illegal because of \u2018common sense enhancements\u2019.\r\nSurely this would jeopardize jobs in this valuable industry and the multi million pound supply chain, and in many cases actually rendering safety enhancements illegal as they were not fitted by vehicles designers, possibly causing fatalities.\r\nThe request is that Parliament consider the implications of banning modifications to historic vehicles, and suggest that the EU policy should be changed to closer reflect the sensible use of modifications in keeping with the vehicles historic design and nature?\r\n\r\n",
