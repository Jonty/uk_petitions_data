All overseas aid should only be paid for essential core services in the target country via UK based charities, and only on a time limited basis not to exceed 3 years.\r\nFunds paid in overseas aid should be deducted from GDP calculations for EU rebate purposes so as to ensure this money is not included as UK Government income\r\n",
