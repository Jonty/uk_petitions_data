        "action": "The government should provide a programme to fund aspiring commercial pilots training in a similar way to that of university tuition fees.",
        "additional_details": "I propose that the government sets up a programme to help aspiring pilots reach their dreams, without the financial barrier blocking their paths. The programme would work very similarly to the funding available for university tuition fees. UK citizens who can show that they cannot afford the costs of training and that they have a genuine interest in aviation would be eligible. Participants would apply to the Flight Training Organisation (FTO) of their choice, go through the selection process and upon successful entry to the course apply to the government for funding. The participants would then pay back the money given to them with a small amount of interest when they find a job that pays over a certain threshold. The amount they pay back per month would increase as their salary increases.\r\n\r\nTo find out about the reasons that this funding is vitally important, please visit: www.pilotfundingpetiton.blogspot.co.uk",
