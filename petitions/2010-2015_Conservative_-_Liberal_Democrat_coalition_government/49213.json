Often they get only get help when they become severely physically ill which is then too late because they have already been ravaged by the illness which also reduces their chances of recovery. Early intervention such as therapy, dietetics and specialist eating disorder treatment could nip AN in the bud, save the individual profound suffering and save the cash-strapped NHS money as there would be fewer hospitalisations (long-term admissions can be several months). AN has the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric diseases, and people with cancer would not be left to be treated at the last stage of their illness.",
