        "additional_details": "Following the recent unrest in the country I would like to put this idea forward.\r\nA new form of national service could be introduced. Anyone who is resident in the UK, whatever nationality would qualify.\r\nAnyone between the ages of 18-25 who are not in full time employment or education and have been on benefits for a period of time automatically qualify for compulsory national service for say two years.\r\nWhile serving they can gain skills and training which could result in a qualification when leaving.\r\nThey can have a choice which armed forces to join.\r\nThis could reduce people on benefits and help the state with more qualified and trained people in the future.\r\nIt would also teach the persons to respect authority, elders and hopefully give a sense of pride to their community and country.\r\nIf any unrest occurred in the future then maybe these people could be used under the guidance of the police to help stop the violence and looting.
