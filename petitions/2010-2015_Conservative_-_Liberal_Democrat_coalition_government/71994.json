It is ridiculous to have Christmas adverts as early as April (I am not joking - there have actually been some Christmas adverts in April). Having early Christmas adverts makes Christmas consumerist and loses the true meaning of Chrsitmas - \"Good will to all men\" not \"high profits to all companies\".",
