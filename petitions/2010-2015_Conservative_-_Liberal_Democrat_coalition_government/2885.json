        "additional_details": "There are a minority of armed units which specifically respond to gun crime and other related incidents, however, the majority of Police who are \"unarmed\", will not be able to defend themselves with a baton and pepper spray when confronted by e.g. an Uzi-wielding maniac or a gang of armed youths. These widely spread (but spread thin) armed units just do not have enough time to respond to every gun related incident and as a result of this, countless lives are being lost because regular Police officers cannot apprehend armed suspects themselves, they have to call in backup which will probably consume at least 10 minutes of precious time (a cruciality). Not only should British Police officers be armed for the protection of themselves and the public but it will enforce a deterrent within the community and will reassure the public that the Police WILL be able to stop all sorts of crime which poses a threat to society because they will have the sufficient equipment to do so.",
