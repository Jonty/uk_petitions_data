        "additional_details": "Section 12 of the Currency and Banknotes Act 1928 states \"Penalty for defacing bank notes. If any person prints or stamps, or by any like means impresses, on any bank note any words, letters or figures, he shall, in respect of each offence, be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding level 1 on the standard scale\"\r\nLevel 1 is currently \u00a3200. This legislation is clearly obsolete and dates back to the time when many banknotes were completed by hand by tellers in banks, much like cheques are today. Therefore a risk existed that someone could try and change the value of the banknote by altering it. However all banknotes are now machine printed and there is no risk that someone, no matter how skilled, could make a \u00a310 note credibly look like a \u00a320 note. Also, it makes bank tellers and shop assistants who write on banknotes (such as writing 100 on a bundle of 100 notes, or using a counterfeit detection pen) technically criminals.",
