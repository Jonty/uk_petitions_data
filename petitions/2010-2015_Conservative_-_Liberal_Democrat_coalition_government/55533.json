        "additional_details": "Local Authorities are highly inefficient, pay their staff more than central government, are unaccountable in terms of staff output Vs local impact, and are unrepresentative of local people, The majority of people do not know that they have such a thing as a 'ward councillor', let alone their name. Clearly some people do good work in the community and are dedicated, but all of this and local representation could be achieved by attaching up to five local councillors per local central government MP and outsource everything else.",
