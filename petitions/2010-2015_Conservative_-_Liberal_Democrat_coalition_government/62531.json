        "additional_details": "In the UK, in order for a petition to reach parliament, the petition must reach 100,000 signatures. This number is too high and means that many key issues are overlooked.\r\n\r\nIt is not proportional to our population compared to the USA where 25,000 signatures are required within 30 days - Their population is 5 times more than our own. It would take an average of 833 citizens a day for a petition in the US to pass, while we need 274 a day, a third of what is required in the USA.\r\n\r\nConsidering we have a population which is a fifth of the USA's, the number needed for a UK petition is clearly not proportional to our population. If we were to match the USA's fairer process, we should ask for 60,809 signatures to be collected within a year.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to make our petition process fairer and proportional to our population, in line with the USA's fairer process. We believe the maximum number of signatures required should be 65,000 over a period of 365 days.",
