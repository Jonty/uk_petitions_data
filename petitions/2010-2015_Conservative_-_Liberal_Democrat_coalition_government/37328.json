        "additional_details": "Too much of OUR money is spent in London, at the expense of the rest of the country,\r\nBillions have been paid into financial institutions in the City, with little or no benefit in return.\r\nAlmost 90% of taxpayers live in the rest of the country and get scant reward for propping up people with poor business acumen. This is borne out by higher than targeted inflation, interest rates, poor savers' rates, poor service and mis-selling by banks, low business confidence, immoral bonuses for poor performance etc.\r\nUK needs are NOT just the needs of London.\r\nBillions have been spent on the Olympics, with the legacy almost solely benefiting Londoners and those in the South East of the country. The rest of the country now needs to be provided with the means to pull the country back from the brink. They have the abilities to perform, but need the wherewithal to succeed.",
