This should be funded by Central Govenment in place of Montetary Easing.\r\n\r\nThe scope of the Project should be changed to seperate Rain Water from Sewerage, such that existing infrastructure and Sewerage Treatment works can cope with demand, as well as protecting fresh water supplies for the future, where harvested Rainwater can support! The existing Scheme is both short sighted and wrongly financed.",
