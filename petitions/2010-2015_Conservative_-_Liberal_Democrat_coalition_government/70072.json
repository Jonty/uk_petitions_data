This means that when they harm or damage properties there is no chance of redress. In my case a neighbour contracted someone who damaged my property. Those people who are vulnerable (elderly and poor) can't take them to court and those who can, can't make them pay a single penny. A CCJ or even bankruptcy is not sufficient to deter these scoundrels.\r\n\r\nIt's easy for them to lie and cheat their way around with no real risk to themselves. Maybe some time in prison would help persuade them otherwise. Time to protect the public against such people and then we wouldn't need programmes like rogue traders any more!",
