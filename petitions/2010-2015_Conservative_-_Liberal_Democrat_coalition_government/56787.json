Companies often charge consumers 10p-75p per minute during this \"waiting time\"!\r\n\r\nJust last week, I spent more than 18 minutes on the 'phone waiting to speak with Opodo twice in 1 day - at 10p per minute this \u201cwaiting time\u201d alone cost me \u00a33.60. Imagine if each adult in the UK paid this charge just once a year, it would mean we pay out \u00a3170mil to companies without even receiving a service. France passed a similar law in 2008 (Chatel Act no. 2008-3). Why does our government still let companies earn revenue from us simply because they won't hire sufficient staff to avoid keeping us waiting unnecessarily (and being charged for it)?\r\n\r\nThis petition demands the law changes so companies won't be allowed to charge consumers for \"waiting time\" regardless of the nature of the call (sales, after-sales, complaints, technical assistance) and across all operators.",
