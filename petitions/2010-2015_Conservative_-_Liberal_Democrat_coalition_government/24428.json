        "additional_details": "The UK has one of the lowest donor rates in Europe. Researchers say that thousands of lives would be saved if we switched to this system which would mean people's organs can be used if they pass away unless they choose to opt-out. Countless people die every year on the waiting list, waiting for an organ which they could have had if someone had bothered to opt-in. The majority of people would gladly give their organs to save the lives of others. Many just don't get round to it or think about it. Do this, and you could save someone's life.",
