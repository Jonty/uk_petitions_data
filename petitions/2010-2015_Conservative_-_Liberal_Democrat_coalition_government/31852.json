        "additional_details": "The current process for Maternity units is to assess all pregnant ladies as to what stage of labour they are at over the phone prior to admission. \u00a0This is apparently because there is much evidence to suggest that the early stages of labour are safest spent in the comfort of your own home. \u00a0Basically they are stopping people from going in until they say so.\r\n\r\nThe government must revisit this process as 'no one' can or should be medically assessed over the phone. \u00a0Each\u00a0mother has a different pain threshold so someone who can handle pain well will not come across as needing urgent medical attention. \u00a0Also an\u00a0unborn distressed baby can go unnoticed - a\u00a0babies heart rate can not be checked over the phone.\u00a0\u00a0Surely the best place to be would be the hospital. \u00a0Any mother near to their due date or overdue should be assessed at the labour ward if they have started labour and NOT over the phone. \u00a0This process needs to be addressed urgently.",
