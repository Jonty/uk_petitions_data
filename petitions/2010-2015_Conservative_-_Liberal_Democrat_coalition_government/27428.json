However, if the UK wants to extradite someone from the US, evidence to the standard of a \"reasonable\" demonstration of guilt will still be required.\r\n\r\nNo other EU countries would accept this US demand, either politically or constitutionally. Yet the UK government not only acquiesced, but did so taking advantage of arcane legislative powers to see the treaty signed and implemented without any parliamentary debate or scrutiny. All I ask is that our government give us the same protections as the US gives it's citizens.",
