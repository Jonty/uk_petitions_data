The ranking which is based on scientific evidence shows cannabis does less physical harm than two LEGAL drugs available today alcohol and tobacco.\r\n\r\nIt is time the government researched a lot more about cannabis and brought in legislation based on a broad range of scientific evidence and not just a select few pieces. The government should look at if the actual criminalization of cannabis benefits the society as a whole or does it just bring in additional cost to the police and encourage organized drug trafficking.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of information and issues on cannabis which have never been addressed inside the house of commons. This alone is a problem.",
