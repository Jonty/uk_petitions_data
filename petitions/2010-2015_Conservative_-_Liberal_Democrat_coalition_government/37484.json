        "additional_details": "Many military wives (and husbands) do not/cannot work due to their commitment to their spouses jobs!  Organisations should leap at the chance to have such dedicated, ambitious and focused employees, even if only for a few years.\r\nWhy isnt more being done for those people behind the scenes of the British Armed Forces who spend their days supporting their spouses, face being alone for months and have to sacrifice their careers? Why is it known that if you are a military spouse, you should never mention this in a job interview?!?!\r\nThe government should make more organisations support this network of people, offer more flexible working terms & promote recruitment equality! They are supporting the front line service men and women who give everything for your country!!! ",
