        "action": "Ban Heavy Goods Vehicles from outside lane of dual carriageways",
        "additional_details": "Heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) are able to use the outside lane of dual carriageways pass others. They occupy the outside lane for long periods This creates high speed bunching of vehicles. Frequently pulling into another driver's safety gap they caus sudden high speed braking. Returning to the slow lane, another commences the same manoeuvre.  The outside lane can often be thus occupied for long distances with HGV drivers not assisting the other as required by the Highway Code. The resulting bunching & tailgating, with safety gaps suddenly taken by HGVs , is highly dangerous and will have been the indirect cause of many high speed accidents even if not officially realised. A dangerous scenario involving many drivers over the course of a day it would be a simple matter to ban HGVs from the outside lane of dual carriageways to preserve life by reducing sudden braking, protecting safety gaps, and considerably reducing high speed bunching.\r\n",
