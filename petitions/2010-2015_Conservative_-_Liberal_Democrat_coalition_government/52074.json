        "additional_details": "That the present Government for the British recognise that the present Parliament for the British does not deliver Government for the British in a form with which all the British are content.\r\n\r\nTo varying degrees there is dissatisfaction among all its members with the present Union of the British and part of the reason for the dissatisfaction lies with the present Parliament for the British. The Parliament makes neither allowance nor adjustment for the numerical advantage enjoyed in the Union by the English. Nor does it offer any mechanism for articulating the majority view of either the Scots, the Welsh or those of the Irish who continue to attend the Parliament. What this produces is a Parliament that in matters of interest and concern to all the British delivers English judgements whilst in matters of English concern it delivers for the English judgements that are tainted by the views and opinions of members who are not English.\r\n",
