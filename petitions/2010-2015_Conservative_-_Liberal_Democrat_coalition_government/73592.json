        "additional_details": "I would like the government to introduce legislation to force companies that manufacture or use plastic items or packaging e.g. supermarkets, to clearly label it all with recycling identifiers, including an identifier for non-recyclable material.  Currently too much packaging is either un-marked or poorly marked meaning it is needlessly sent to landfill as consumers don\u2019t know how to dispose of it correctly. The identifiers should be prominent and easy to read. We should recycle as much as possible to help the environment.",
