        "additional_details": "i'm asking that the department Of health review the current abortion limit,  I furthermore ask that's the terminology is changed from late miscarriage to still birth.\r\nwith modern medicine and advanced technology premature babies are surviving as young as 22 weeks gestation , sadly the legal limit for abortion even with this evidence remains at 24wk gestational cut off.  The limit for viability needs to be changed an furthermore so does the term late miscarriage , babies deserve human rights and the right to be given a certificate of life if stillborn and not classed as miscarriage.\r\nMany babies born now at 24weeks gestation even at 23weeks gestation are surviving so please review the current laws and terminology used , as modern medicine continues to advance so does the chance of survival before 24weeks gestation....\r\n",
