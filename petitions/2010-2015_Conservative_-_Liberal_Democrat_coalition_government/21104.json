        "additional_details": "Make it the law in England for only people aged 21 (or even 25) or over to be able to buy fireworks. Too many people get hurt every year from fireworks not being taken seriously and sold to children (or people aged 18 or over) who think its fun for them to use as weapons. This is a very serious issue, and it needs to be seriously overlooked and sorted out for the sake of people's lives. Could even go a step further and restrict only supermarkets/large businesses to sell fireworks as alot of businesses sell them to people under the age of 18.",
