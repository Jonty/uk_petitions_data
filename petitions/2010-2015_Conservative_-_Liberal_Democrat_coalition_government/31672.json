There is no such thing in law as as a 'public holiday'. Holidays are either bank holidays or holidays that are taken by custom and practice such as Christmas day and Good Friday. Bank holidays do not confer automatic leave entitlement - that is a matter between employers and employees and individual employment contracts.  It would be for the Northern Ireland Assembly to legislate for how St Patrick's day is observed and if they wished businesses and schools etc to  remain open or closed."
