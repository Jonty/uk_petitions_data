        "additional_details": "Virgin have completely transformed the west coast, providing a service distinctly based upon high levels of customer service, which is reflected in high passenger focus score. The 'flawed' bidding process needs to change to ensure the right bidder is successful it's important for the government not just to consider the top bid. Virgin Trains submitted a fair bid which they would be able to deliver without reducing staffing levels, adding to the already increase unemployment levels.\r\n\r\nThe DfT haven't learned their lesson from two failed franchises over on the East Coast! Which Virgin had bidded for these both times.\r\n\r\nThe DfT need to seriously rethink this decision to act within the best interests of the British public, traveling passengers and most importantly the tax payer, who will ultimately be paying for this disaster in a few years down the line.
