We, the citizens of India living in the UK, as well as British citizens of Indian origin, would like to request the British parliament or the Prime Minister to make a statement to express their support for the peaceful, non-violent protest by the citizens of India against the rampant corruption in India. As a second step, the UK government should look into ways and means to encourage or force UK companies to disclose if they have ever bribed and Indian government office or politicians or individuals and name those individuals. Such British companies could be offered immunity from British law, if required, to encourage disclosures. - We, the People.",
