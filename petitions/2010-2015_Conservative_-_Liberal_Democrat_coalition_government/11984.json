        "additional_details": "Layla Ibrahim is a young mother who was imprisoned for 13 months after the evidence detailing her experience of a violent rape was systematically discredited through the legal system. This petition seeks justice on behalf of Layla.\r\n\r\nLayla persistently sought to bring her attackers to justice, but was accused of wasting Police time due to perceived inconsistencies in her evidence. Both the experience of rape and the lack of support from the legal system detrimentally affected her mental health. Subsequently, her state of mind was used as evidence against her.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for Layla Ibrahim's case to be considered with view to overturning her conviction. Motions should be then made to provide criminal injuries compensation in order to help aid her recovery. The government should intervene on a case that has profound implications upon both men and women's confidence in the handling of cases relating to sexual violence.\r\n",
