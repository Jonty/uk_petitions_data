        "additional_details": "It has been announced that MP's are to be given a pay rise of 11% after the 2015 general election.\r\n\r\nThis is a disgrace when nurses, teachers, police officers and most ordinary workers employed by the government have been told that they cannot have a pay rise.\r\n\r\nThe independent body that looks after MP's pay is IPSA. They will tell you that they are curbing the MP'S expenses so in the light of that they should get a pay rise. They believe that MP'S should be paid the same compared to salaries in the private sector.\r\n\r\nI don't think that is a valid reason and you should not either.\r\n\r\nMP's will tell you that IPSA are an independent body and they cannot stop the pay rise. They could if they voted to scrap IPSA.\r\n\r\nIf this petition hits 100,000 then they have to discuss it in parliament.\r\n\r\nLet's force them to talk about it and let's really see if \"we are all in it together\"\r\n\r\nLets make this a key election talking point.\r\nLet's not vote for any MP that chooses to keep the pay rise",
