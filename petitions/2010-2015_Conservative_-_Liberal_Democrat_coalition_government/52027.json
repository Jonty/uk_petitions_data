        "additional_details": "The reputation of the British police is at an all-time low. The Hillsborough, Ian Tomlinson and Jean Charles de Menezes incidents have shown the police to be completely untrustworthy. The Andrew Mitchell incident has heaped more embarrassment upon an already discredited service and the recent Lawrence revelations are simply staggering. The IPCC has been found to be unfit for purpose; the police are completely out of control. Public confidence in the police can only be restored by an immediate and full public enquiry into what has gone so terribly wrong with the British police service.",
