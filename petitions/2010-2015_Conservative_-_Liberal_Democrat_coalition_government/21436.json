        "additional_details": "I do not feel that women should be encouraged to undertake to have an operation (i.e. caeserean section) as opposed to natural birth, without good cause and having had a discussion with medical professionals giving a balanced, unbiased view.  Not only are the risks higher to both mother and baby but the cost would be considerably more to the NHS, which is already showing signs of strains after cuts in funding and drastic alterations to the way antenatal wards are run and the number of midwives and doctors within them.  I urge people to sign this petition to show the government that this should not be an automatic right and will simply have negative results.  ",
