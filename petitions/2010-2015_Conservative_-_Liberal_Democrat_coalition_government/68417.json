The silence of Western governments in the face of this tragedy is chilling.\r\n\r\nWe want to see our political leaders bravely stand up and speak out against these brutal crimes against humanity. We want them to offer hope to those suffering this violence across the Middle East in the forms of speech, aid, and asylum. We want to hear a condemnation of the envisioned caliphate that is driving IS's acts of savagery.  ",
