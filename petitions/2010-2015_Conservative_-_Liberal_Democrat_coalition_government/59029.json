        "additional_details": "After 25 years, the special needs setting, now based at Darenth Valley Hospital, Kent, is closing on 31st March 2014, as Kent County County are no longer willing to fund. This nursery provides an invaluable service to parents of children with severe, complex and sometime life limiting illnesses, as well as to the children themselves who are given 2 hours of one to one interaction and attention, a day, with all activities tailored to their needs and capabilities. The options we have now been left with, are just not suitable for our children. Please help us to save it.",
