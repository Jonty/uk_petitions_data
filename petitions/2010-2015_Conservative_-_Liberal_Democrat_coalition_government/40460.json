We do not feel safer seeing Cops with guns nor tasers.\r\nThere is No Death penalty in this Country and we are not at War ! No one should be allowed to kill unless we are at War. It is not a defence to say that terrorism is an excuse because terrorism is the failure of Government Policy and Laws..\r\n",
