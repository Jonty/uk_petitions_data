        "additional_details": "  We request that the government either ban or set a high limit to the amount of compulsory homework schools can set pupils during holidays of one week or longer. This should apply to both private and state schools and to all primary and secondary schools and sixth forms and colleges teaching A levels also.\r\n  The reason schools are forced to give pupils holidays is to give them a well deserved break, however some schools have found a loop hole in the system. they give their students holidays but set enough homework that the students end up working as much as any normal school week.\r\n  We request the government plug this loop hole and stop schools from setting too much homework.",
