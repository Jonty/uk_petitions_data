        "additional_details": "I suffer from a medical condition called primary idiopathic hypersomnia with excessive daytime sleepiness, which is similar to narcolepsy. Patients with hypersomnia often experience prolonged night sleep and have difficulty waking from long sleep, feeling disoriented upon doing so. This condition is known as sleep drunkenness. Other symptoms may include anxiety, increased irritation, decreased energy, restlessness, slow thinking, slow speech, loss of appetite, hallucinations, and memory difficulty. Some patients lose the ability to function in family, social, occupational or other settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow there\u2019s a treatment available. The issue is it costs the NHS \u00a3697/month to prescribe. A significantly cheaper generic version is available, but I cannot buy it because it is a Class C drug without prescription. This petition calls for the relaxation of restrictions on GHB so that hypersomnia patients can obtain this vital medication (which is found naturally in the brain and some foods).",
