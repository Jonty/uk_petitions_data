        "additional_details": "There are very few options to improve insulation for internal walls in older homes. Those that are available involve either a loss of internal space (new plasterboard & moving electric sockets etc) or relying on claims by manufacturers of  various wallcoverings that a saving will be made.\r\n\r\nThe Gov can encourage (preferably) UK firms to invest/test & manufacture alternative (and  independently tested & verified) wallcoverings to reduce heating costs & Co2. This can be acheived by diverting some of the guaranteed funding for solar which we are paying for & which the generated income is not often being paid to individual householders, but investors looking to profit from the scheme.\r\n\r\nThis should not cost more, it just helps more UK citizens - i.e. those in north of UK, tenants, those with roofs which are not south/south west facing, those who cannot afford to pay for solar panels.\r\n\r\n ",
