And roll this menu out as a compulsary component of all private catering provider contracts for hospital catering.\r\n\r\nThis would mean every hospital would have the same menu and hopefully the same quality or better, on top of the menu the private provider will be allowed to have a second menu of a simular standard created by their own chef's Therefore giving choose and value for money as well as satisfaction and possibily without complaints.",
