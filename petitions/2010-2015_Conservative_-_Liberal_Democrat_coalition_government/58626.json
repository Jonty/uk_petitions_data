        "additional_details": "Alan Turing was pardoned by Her Majesty on the 23rd December 2013, 61 years after being convicted of 'gross indecency'. This pardon is entirely the wrong way to honour one of the greatest Britons of the 20th Century.\r\n\r\nCreated during the Blitz by King George, the George Cross was originally put in place to honour acts of courage by civilians during WW2. There seems no other man more befitting of this honour than Turing - the man who made one of the single biggest contributions to the allied war effort and is credited by many historians as cutting short WW2 by as much as 2 years.\r\n\r\nThe saviour of thousands of lives and the father of computing; Alan Turing has been treated unfairly by the British Government both in life and in death. One can't help wonder what the world would be like without Turing, nor what contributions he could have made if not for that tortuous conviction made 61 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is time HM Government rights this wrong.\r\n\r\nAward a George Cross to Alan Turing.",
