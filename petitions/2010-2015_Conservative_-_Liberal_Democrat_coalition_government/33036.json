This is due to benefits being cut and freezes in pay rises and trying to meet the constant rises in fuel, food and clothing to keep their household from going under. Their children are suffering with constantly having head lice being caught from other children.\r\n\r\nThe government need to either provide money off for these treatments or provide them free on the NHS OR bring back the nurses that inspected a childs hair and sent them home.  Either way, something really needs to be done.",
