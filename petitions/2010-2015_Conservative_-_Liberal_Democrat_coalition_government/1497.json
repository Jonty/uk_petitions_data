        "additional_details": "I feel the government/local government are taking us all for idiots and believe it is now time for us to stand up against them. We are experiencing cuts left, right and centre with no increase in pay but plenty in expenses. We are in a recession, the businesses need money and the government are making it hard for people to get to the shops. Travelling at weekends are usually off due to railway repairs, it seems then ridiculous to charge for parking.\r\nDavid Cameron talks about \u2018The Big Society\u2019...but again in his society the only ones giving are us,whilst the government continues to take. We can only give so much...unfortunately I feel this country has given too much and now it is time to start getting something back!\r\n\r\nWe want you to stop this new policy of charging for parking fees evenings and weekends in london.\r\n\r\n",
