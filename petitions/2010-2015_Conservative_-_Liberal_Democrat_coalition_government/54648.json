        "additional_details": "In 2013, The Royal British Legion released a statement which points out that up to 3,000 of London\u2019s homeless population are ex-service personnel. (http://goo.gl/gvVyGr)\r\n\r\nThese men and women have fought for their country in the most highly stressful environments.  They have lived in the institution that is the armed forces for the majority of their lives.  Many are injured both physically and mentally \u2013 \u201cMore soldiers and veterans took their own lives last year than were killed by the Taliban\u201d (http://goo.gl/LQW50w).\r\n\r\nTheir experience and qualifications are not recognised in the civilian world.  They are seen as a financial risk by lenders.\r\n\r\nPlease help the many ex service personnel who find themselves facing the enormous stress of homelessness at the end of their career by signing this petition to ensure Armed Forces Veterans are given priority banding when applying for housing.\r\n",
