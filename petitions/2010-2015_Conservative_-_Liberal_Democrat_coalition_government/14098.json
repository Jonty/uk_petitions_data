The vouchers should be redeemable only against necessities (food, clothing, utility bills etc) and should not be redeemable against any alcohol or tobacco products.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of benefit payments is to allow an individual to purchase the necessities, NOT for them to spend the money on alcohol and tobacco.  These are luxury items which the tax payer should not be expected to fund.\r\n\r\nI believe the government should make a fundamental change to the system and ensure these items are not available through the use of benefit money.",
