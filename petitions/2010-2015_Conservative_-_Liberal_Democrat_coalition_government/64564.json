        "action": "Minimum Wage and The Benefits System",
        "additional_details": "The current \"benefit\" is a miserly sum which is barely liveable. For those who depend on it solely for their income, the sanctions which can be imposed can be life-destroying. Similarly, the base minimum wage for work is a meagre amount and can barely keep one out of debt. The only logical option, if benefits are to be increased, is for the minimum wage to be increased also, to keep in line with other European countries.\r\n\r\nThe current model of the Benefits System is outdated and unable to cope with the number of people seeking help. Too many times ordinary people are penalised by a harsh and draconian system which lets the fraudsters it's trying to prevent get away free.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for:\r\n\r\n1) An increase to the minimum amount received from benefits;\r\n2) An increase in minimum wages to keep in line with European countries; and\r\n3) An overhaul of the current model for the Benefits System, to allow it to be more relevant and up-to-date.",
