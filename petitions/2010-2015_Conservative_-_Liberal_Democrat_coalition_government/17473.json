        "additional_details": "A law that allows the use of lethal force on burglars is a law that condones the swift and tough administration of capital punishment (without trial) on alleged burglars.  Such a law can be open to abuse to murder someone by staging a deceased victim as a \u2018burglar\u2019, as well as being dangerous even to the householder, as burglars may also decide to use lethal force to defend themselves. It is not heroic to kill a burglar when a lesser force would suffice to defend the property. In any case, a duty of care is owed by a person who injured another person.  The provocation of being burgled should not necessarily be considered strong enough not to charge a householder of killing an alleged burglar.",
