        "additional_details": "It is time to ban the niqab on the streets of Britain, it is both anti social and also a security risk.  Face to face communications is so important in society and we shouldn't allow people to hide behind a mask in our society.  If somebody walked into a bank or public with a motorbike helmet, they would be asked to remove it or leave the building.  It is certainly dangerous to other road users, if somebody attempts to drive with one on.  There is a point where tolerance of others, becomes ludicrous, dangerous and creates a less than inclusive society.",
