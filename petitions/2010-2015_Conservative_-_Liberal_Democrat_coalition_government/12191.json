        "additional_details": "We demand that the tax burden on the banking sector and income tax contributions from the most wealthy are increased. The money generated should then be used to fund youth services in the most deprived areas of our country and to facilitate job creation for young people. Only by redistributing our countries wealth in this way can we improve social mobility and shrink the gap between rich and poor.",
