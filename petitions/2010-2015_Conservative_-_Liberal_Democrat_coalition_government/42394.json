Thanks to the tireless work of the medical team at White Heart Lane, Muamba survived, but this is still relatively uncommon. Data from London Ambulance service [1] shows that less 1 in 4 people suffering an out of hospital cardiac arrest in London surviving to discharge from hospital. Studies on out of hospital cardiac arrest and recent studies have shown that in London and Sweden an increase in bystander CPR has been linked with increases survival rates.\r\n\r\nSchool studies have shown a significant rise in pupils' confidence in performing CPR once taught and that there is good retention of skills.\r\n\r\nLet us show the government that we want our children equipped with the skills to save lives.",
