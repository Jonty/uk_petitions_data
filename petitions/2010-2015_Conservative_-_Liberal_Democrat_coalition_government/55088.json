        "additional_details": "Since the removal of sub post offices in the local communities, it has become hard and difficult for the elderly, sick and disable people to travel to other post offices; and to stand in large queues at the post offices. The small post offices on the council estates should not have been removed without the consideration of the drastic change it would have bring and caused to those who are vunerable. I want the government to re-instate back all sub post offices on the council run estates/communities as they are required, and it was such a good place for the community to know each other and to keep an eye on our elders. Sub post offices was one of the best things you could have as a government to keep an eye on the community that you serve.",
