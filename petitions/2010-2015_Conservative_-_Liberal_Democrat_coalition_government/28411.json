        "additional_details": "Far to many films now have inappropriate contents. Often containing scences that are far to violent of sexualized for the age. This has been made worse with the introduction of certificates like 12A, which means very young children can be taken to watch films that are unsuitable. The images in these films can be very distressing, and damaging for children. For example a 12A which contained vast amounts of sexual content, including a girl working in a brothel and another nearly being raped, a girl having a spike driven into her eye and vast amounts of violence. The BBFC refuse to accept that some films are not suitable for the age they have rated them at. The Government need to review these certification rules, and the BBFC change their rating system",
