        "additional_details": "In signing & presenting this petition we urge the government & Dept. of Transport to implement compulsory motorcycle & cyclist-specific safety & awareness training & testing for all motorists obtaining or renewing their licence. The training should include common scenarios for accidents where motorcyclists & cyclists are most vulnerable - including motorists changing lanes or direction without properly signalling or checking for other road users, allowing safe passing distances, appreciation of the impact of weather conditions on motorbikes & cycles vs. cars, & other factors which, with training & enforced penalties for non-compliance, would significantly reduce the danger to motorcyclists & cyclists from motorists.",
