The current 18-20 National Minimum Wage (\u00a34.98) is unfair, as it discriminates, on grounds of age against younger people, who in many cases are performing the same duties in their workplace, as those aged over 21. The goverment needs to stop this age discrimination and acknowledge that equal pay is required for equal work, regardless of age!",
