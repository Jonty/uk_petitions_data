I want to empower parents to demand their children's right to a proper education and to ask schools what to do about dyslexia.. \"Every child has the right to an education yet NUT research found less than 9% of teachers feel confident they can teach dyslexic children. A staggering 20% of children leave school unable to read and write - many of these will be dyslexic.\r\nOnly when Government ensure that our teachers are equipped with the skills to teach dyslexic children will we have an education system that gives every child the skills to succeed.\r\nKatherine Gleeson\r\n",
