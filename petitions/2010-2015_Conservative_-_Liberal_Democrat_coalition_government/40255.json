        "additional_details": "Currently film streaming websites (primarily, but not limited to Netflix & Lovefilm) only use Microsoft's DRM piracy protection, which means they can only be viewed using Microsoft or Apple computers or proprietary devices (eg Smart TVs). This excludes Linux computers or home-made media centres not made with MS Windows.\r\n\r\nThe specification of Microsoft DRM is usually a requirement of the film industry.\r\n\r\nThis is anti-competitive and an abuse of market position.\r\n\r\nEither they should be required to use a platform neutral DRM solution or they should specify a standard of DRM the website should meet rather than a specific DRM solution.",
