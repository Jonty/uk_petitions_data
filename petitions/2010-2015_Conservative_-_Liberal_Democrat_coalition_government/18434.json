        "additional_details": "The recent Autumnal heatwave has brought on excruciatingly sweltering temperatures to many public buildings in Britain. The school I attend, Alumwell Business and Enterprise College, in Walsall, West Midlands is a perfect example. It being a 1970's building, has limited heating and cooling methods in place. The thing is, if the pipes freeze in Winter and the building reaches a minimum legal temperature, the school cannot open to students and staff. But, in times of intense heat during Summer and Autumn for that matter, students and staff are still obliged to attend. I believe cold weather conditions are less of a safety matter to warm ones, as one may wear a coat or other form of insulated clothing. In the heat, you can't do much about it; you can't strip off in a classroom. Thus, I believe a law should be implemented that details a maximum workplace and educational institution temperature. Guidelines should also be set, schools look at installing Air Conditioning systems.",
