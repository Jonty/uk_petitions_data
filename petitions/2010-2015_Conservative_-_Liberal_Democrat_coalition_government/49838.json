        "additional_details": "As these vehicles without any doubt cause more damage to our roads and surrounding verges than car classification vehicles, should they not have their Road Tax substantially increased? The governement are seeking ways to find funding for more esential services such as The NHS, Police, Education, etc. These totaly unneccessary monsters are by far under taxed in relation to the damage they cause, the amount of fuel they burn ( makers fuel consumption figures are NOT rated for urban use ) the damage they can and do cause  even low speed collisions (due to their gross weight and bump zone area )  is massive especially on the human body. The governement should seriously consider a Road Tax sliding scale of at least \u00a31200, for the smaller classes and up to at least \u00a33,500 per annnum for the largest BMW, Range Rover, Volvo, and Ford type gas gusslers, they shouls also be banned by weght classificattion form minor roads especially near schools and high density public areas.",
