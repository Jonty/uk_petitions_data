        "additional_details": "I am calling on the government to ban Audible Car Alarms as they are highly prone to false alarms causing great distress to neighbours and the general community.\r\n\r\nThey are also not a deterrent to known car thieves as these will steal out of a car whether it has an alarm or not. Indeed some will purposefully set them off because people walk away from a car alarm due to the high noise and false alarms that they endure.\r\n\r\nIt should also become a breach of the piece for repeated false alarms from a vehicle unless there is an electrical problem with the vehicle.",
