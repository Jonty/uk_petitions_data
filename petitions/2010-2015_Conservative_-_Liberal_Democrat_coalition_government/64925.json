        "additional_details": "since the NHS was founded 1946 it's always had a basic principle free for all. the tax payer pays national insurance. and if you need health care you get treatment on the NHS.But the NHS has the greatest test in years to come with funding issues and government restructuring.But it's greatest threat will come if legislation comes in that sees the general public pay a charge \u00a310-20 pound to see a general practitioner.In my view this would lead us down the path to a private health service. this would also mean the poorest priced out of seeing a doctor.If this legislation was ever passed and with how prescription charges go up ever year you would have to pay 50 pound to see a doctor in 2036. sign this petition save our NHS before it's too late.Aneurin Bevan would turn in grave.",
