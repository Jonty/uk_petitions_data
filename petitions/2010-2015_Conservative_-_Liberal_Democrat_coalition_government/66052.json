        "additional_details": "David Cameron has promised the voters of the United Kingdom that his government would ban the use of animals in circuses. The months have trailed on, and we still have no movement to impose a law which would ban animals from performing in circuses. A great opportunity was missed with the proposed ban not being included in the Queen's speech.\r\n\r\nWhy we should have an outright ban on animals performing in circuses:\r\nCircus animals are treated cruelly, they are often electrically shocked, tied up to a post when not performing, they are also left in tiny cages when not used, and they are whipped beaten, and made to jump through fire, amongst other things..\r\n\r\nWe ask you not to sit on this proposed legislation any longer, and implement a law which would ban animals from circuses, effective immediately.",
