        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to introduce a simple, transparent taxation system that means everyone can easily see exactly how much tax they pay and that is fair for all. Specifically, we call on the Government to:\r\n\r\n1. Abolish employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 national insurance, ask employers to pay workers their full salary, and tax that amount with one simple income tax.\r\n\r\n2. Show taxes on goods separately on price labels.\r\n\r\n3. Quantify and show the impact of all hidden indirect taxes on purchase costs.\r\n",
