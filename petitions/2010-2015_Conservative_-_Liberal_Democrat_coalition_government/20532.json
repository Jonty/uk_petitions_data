        "additional_details": "Many groups such as EDL and Islam4UK wish to protest. There is no problem in them voicing their opinion, however there are many costs involved during these protests. One EDL protest in Leicester cost the local council \u00a3850,000 which had to be paid from the tax payers pockets. This system is not fair on the taxpayers. The government should introduce a law which obliges protesting groups to incur all costs involved during their protests.",
