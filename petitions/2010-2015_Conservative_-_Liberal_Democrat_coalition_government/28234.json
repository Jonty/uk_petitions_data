        "additional_details": "Imagine losing control over your bowels, because you have a sudden urgency to go to the toilet and you are unable to get parked, or park close enough to the shops. Along with being in pain and not being able to walk far to a toilet, this urgency can cause humiliating accidents. These are the challenges people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease face every day.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Collitis, there are other chronic illnesses such as COPD, IBS, bladder problems, and Multiple sclerosis, that also affect ones ability to walk to places including to toilets. A blue badge would aid people with these conditions to have a better quality of life and help them to do activities that other people take for granted.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe suggest a review of the current and future protocol for issuing blue badges and greater consideration for people with other chronic disabilities as well as the obvious 'mobility limited' disabilities.",
