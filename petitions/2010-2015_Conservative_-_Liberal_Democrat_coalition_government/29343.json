Aged 12, Oliver passed away in March 2011 of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome (SADS), he was a keen sportsman who was fit and active.\r\n\r\nEach week it is estimated that 12 young people die of Sudden Adult Death Syndrome.\r\n\r\nMark & Joanne King, Oliver's parents, set up a Foundation in his memory. The Foundation is working to raise funds for defibrillators in all Schools & Sports Centres in Liverpool and beyond.\r\n\r\nFind out more information about The Foundation here: www.theoliverkingfoundation.co.uk/.\r\n\r\nIf we screen active young people aged between 12-35, we may be able to detect SADS before it is too late.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on the Government to ensure that all public buildings have adequate amount of defibrillators on site, by 2017. We also call on the Government to meet with The Oliver King Foundation to discuss what work can be done.\r\n",
