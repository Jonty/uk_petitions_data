        "additional_details": "We need to see a change in school education with new subjects that reflect the change in the UK and world today. I propose that we have a personal development, coaching & life skills programme that will help children determine their goals in life, boost confidence, improve relationships with others and understand their thought processes, limiting beliefs and values.\r\n\r\nSubjects should also be taught such as finance/ economics and business so there is an understanding of how credit works (credit cards and mortgages for example).  There could also be education on savings and investments.\r\n\r\nThis will create financial security for the individual and help boost our economy in the future.",
