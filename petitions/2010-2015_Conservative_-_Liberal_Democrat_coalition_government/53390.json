        "additional_details": "A substantial decrease in the alcohol duty for real ales and drinks with a lower alcohol content (say 4.5% or less) would help to entice people back in to Britains pubs.  By increasing tax on top shelf spirits younger drinkers would be detered from drinking stronger drinks, which would help to reduce alcohol fueled anti-social behaviour.",
