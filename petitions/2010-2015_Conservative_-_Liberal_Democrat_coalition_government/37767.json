That once our numbers are reduced such that the planet can sustain, that other major issues we face will become more manageable and in the long term possibly resolvable.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects all on the planet. If we do not intelligently & compassionately manage our numbers, strife, war, disease, climate change and starvation can only ensue as we all make demands on diminishing resources.",
