        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, object to the use of taxpayers money to fund or part fund the funeral of the late Baroness Thatcher, and demand that this spending is formally debated in parliament before her funeral. In the week that the coalition government austerity measures are taking full force it is a gross insult to taxpayers and the general population to suddenly spend 10 million pounds on a ceremonial funeral. It is also contrary to the political ideology created by Baroness Thatcher. We believe it to be a more fitting tribute to her, and consistent with her political ideology for the funeral to be wholly privately paid for by her family, the Conservative party, private donors and/or companies who directly benefitted from her ideology whilst in office. (Scott Morgan: acknowledgement for the original e-petition in 2012)",
