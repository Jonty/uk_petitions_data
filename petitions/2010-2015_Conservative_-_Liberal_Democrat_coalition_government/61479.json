        "additional_details": "In some counties PCSOs are given the power to issue Penalty Notices for Disorder with respect of possession of cannabis and cannabis resin and the power to seize drugs, therefore it'd be logical for them to have the power to search for drugs should they have reasonable grounds to suspect a person is in possession of them. This power would make PCSOs more efficient in dealing with low level crime and also a more valuable resource in policing.\r\n\r\nPCSOs can also carry out Police National Computer checks on persons, the information held on here can say whether a person is wanted or missing, a wanted or missing person can be dangerous and PCSOs currently cannot detain them within their powers, as many forces now implement a solo patrol strategy it would make sense to give PCSOs the power to detain wanted persons and assist their police constable colleagues.",
