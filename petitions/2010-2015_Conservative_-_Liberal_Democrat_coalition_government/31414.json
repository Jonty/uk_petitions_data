        "additional_details": "Children and young people are being increasingly exposed to airbrushed images in the media and in adverts. These images give a false representation of beauty and thinness. Altering photos to make them look better, means children are subjected to completely unattainable images.\r\n\r\nYoungsters under 16 are the most vulnerable to body image and body identity security, with children as young as 10 associating being happy with being attractive.\r\n\r\nBy banning airbrushed images that target the under 16s, it would let the UK become the leading nation in giving the next generation positive and healthy messages through the media.\r\n\r\nCompulsory lessons on body image would also help improve how young people see themselves and make them aware of airbrushing in the media.",
