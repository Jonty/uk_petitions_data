        "additional_details": "Mr Manzoor Qadar has been incarcerated in the USA for 14 years and in line with the eligibility criteria meets the requirements for a transfer back to the UK. He has applied for a transfer on 4 occasions without success and can only apply after a 2 year period has elapsed. He has six children and wife, parents, nieces and nephews who haven't seen him for over 14 years and miss him dearly. The UK needs to work closer with the US to ensure prisoners are given basic rights as too their families so they can have some form of contact.",
