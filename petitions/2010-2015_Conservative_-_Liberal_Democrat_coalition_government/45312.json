        "additional_details": "Human Rights :- North Korea has several Political Prisoner Camps. When a family member has committed a crime, five generations are forced to be kept in inhumane conditions for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nThere have been reports from escapee prison guards of the government testing chemical and biological weapons on prisoners in special labs. Guards and officials would look inside of the glass chamber and see mums and dads giving mouth to mouth resuscitation as they desperately try to keep they children from dying from the suffocation gas.\r\n\r\nGlobal Terror :- North Korea are a developing terror to the world. Right now, they have enough plutonium to create six to eight nuclear bombs. The worry is that soon they will be able to export this to other anti-american countries and groups such as Al Qaeda with the power to kill thousands at a time.",
