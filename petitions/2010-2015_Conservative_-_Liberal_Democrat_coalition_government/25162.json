Since the many are sitting on vast profits from the booming housing market isn\u2019t it fair that some of this wealth is directed at reducing the impact we're putting on future generations?\r\n\r\nRemember the young played no part in getting us where we are today.  Unless we take positive action they will be saddled with debt for decades.\r\n\r\nSimple answer \u2013 extend capital gains tax to all profits made on the sale of property.  This would bring in significant sums of money which if ring fenced could go towards:-\r\n\r\n\u2022  the education of the young \u2013 reducing University fees\r\n\u2022  building affordable housing\r\n\u2022  paying off long term government debt\r\n\r\nNot only will this benefit the next generations but will also stop escalating house prices which is making the most modest home unaffordable to the vast majority.",
