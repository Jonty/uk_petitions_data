        "additional_details": "Effective Infrastructure is essential to all towns and cities. Manchester is the London of the north and for too long has had to deal with a substandard service. The tram network is the lifeline of outlying towns and suburbs. People use the tram in order to reduce their carbon\r\n\r\nThe trams are delayed almost daily and/or lines suspended. People are being put off from using the Metrolink because of the shocking service. Twitter accounts have been created to mock how awful the service is. It has gone on for too long now and action must be taken.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably delays are bound to occur at some point and people appreciate that but these are happening every single day, and have been for several months. Money is being pumped into this network by paying customers and they get nothing in return !\r\n\r\nWe would like the Department for Transport to address these issues with a new operator ? Or change in the management of the existing company. Something needs to be done.",
