        "additional_details": "Anna Soubry position is tainted by what she has written to MPs and members of the pubic about the Tom Neathway bullying case. She cast doubt over Cpl Neathway\u2019s story by telling MPs the stories were \u2018inaccurate\u2019 and \u2018misleading without establishing facts. Her impartiality and suitability to lead the Army\u2019s anti-bullying drive can not be trusted. Members of the public have no confidence in Mrs Soubrys post of leading the Army\u2019s anti-bullying policy and this e- petition calls for her removal!\r\n",
