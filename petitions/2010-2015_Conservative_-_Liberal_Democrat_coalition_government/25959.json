        "additional_details": "Do you not think it's wrong how a company can give you disciplinary action for being genuinely ill. By ill I mean genuine nasty infections/illnesses i.e a kidney infection, chest infection or flu. It is essential to rest when ill and because of forceful workplaces we are having to go into work because of fear from reprisals! If you could prove you were ill by a doctors note or phone call I think you should be exempt from these actions. As we all know there are people out there who take the mick but for the vast majority of us we really are genuinely ill. This is for all the people in the UK who want a friendlier more lenient workplace. ",
