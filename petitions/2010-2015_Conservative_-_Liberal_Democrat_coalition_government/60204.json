I have no confidence whatsoever in their ability to manage the budget effectively.  This is in addition to the fact that the quality of programmes over recent years has declined significantly.  I want to have the choice of what I watch and equally have the choice about what I pay for.   SCRAP THE COMPULSORY FEE AND DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO PAY FOR REGARDLESS OF WHAT I CHOOSE TO WATCH.",
