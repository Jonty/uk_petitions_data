        "additional_details": "In the current climate it is very hard for micro businesses (0-9 employees) to grow and employ staff. There 4.6 million micro businesses in the UK.\r\nMy suggestion is to offer 50% of the unemployment benefits paid to be paid to a micro business who employs someone who has been out of work for at least 6 months. If 10% of the micro businesses took this up we would get 460,000 people off the benefits and reduce their cost by half. The amount paid to the micro business would be on a sliding scale starting at 50% and reducing to 25% after 9 months and finish after 18 months. This would only be paid whilst the person who was on the benefits is employed within that company and would stop if that employee was to leave. This would also help growth within the UK business arena with no extra funds being required as this is a saving not a cost.",
