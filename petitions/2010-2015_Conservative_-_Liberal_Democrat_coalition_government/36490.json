There has to be a meeting of all sides in the scientific community, to determine a definite cause for each tax raised on the say of a few. The people of the UK are seeing so called green taxes rising quickly once they are put in place, these taxes stunt growth and, penalise law abiding people that work hard and might want to travel abroad on holiday.
