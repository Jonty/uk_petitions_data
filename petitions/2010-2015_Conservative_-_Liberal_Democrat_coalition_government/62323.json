        "additional_details": "Over the last decade, international governments have been remarkably slow and in some cases wilfully blind to recognise (in any coherent way) the variable sinister capabilities emanating from cyberspace. Consequently, nations continue to experience significant difficulty when dealing with the many nuances of cyber policy. This is due, chiefly, to a lack of understanding on how to define the various strands of sinister cyber activity. Without an agreed consensus on cyber terminology, governments are unable to respond effectively to the numerous threats posed by the fifth domain. Therefore, it is essential that the UK government engages in transnational collaborative discussion to devise an explicit set of cyber terms and characterisations. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of coherent and robust cyber policy and assist the implementation of a legal framework.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
