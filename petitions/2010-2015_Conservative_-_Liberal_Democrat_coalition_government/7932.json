At the school leaving age everyone, whether male or female, should be conscripted for a minimum of 18 months National Service. The only way to avoid conscripton should be if enrolled in further education in an area in which the country is in need, for example medical professions like nurses & doctors or teaching. If someone enrolls but fails to complete the course they should be subject to conscription for two years.\r\nHopefully this might bring back the mostly forgotten values of respect & disipline in the youth of today.",
