        "additional_details": "I believe that many youth of today have lost their way and do not understand the values of this country. After the rioting in London I believe any unemployed person (male or female) from the age of 16 years should complete at least a 2 year stint in national service. I believe that if they are at school until 18 years old and are unable to find a job within 6 months then again two years national service to be completed. This will continue until the age of 21 years old. Hopefully by this point they may have ethics of work and realise that working for their money is the way forward. We have babysitted our country for too long and it is about time some discipline and values gets given to these youngsters who have unfortunately not had the lead needed to make them into understanding and concerning members of public.",
