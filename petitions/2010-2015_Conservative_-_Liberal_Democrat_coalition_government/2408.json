Many people require DLA to assist in daily independent living and to aid in being able to travel to things like hospital appointments, doctors, shops, work etc. To replace this benefit with PIP would be catastrophic to anyone currently receiving this benefit. People on disability have already proven there illnesses by having to undertake medicals by ATOS and have the backing of specialists throughout britain. With vitually a 0% fraud rate, any changes to DLA would only be being made to save money.",
