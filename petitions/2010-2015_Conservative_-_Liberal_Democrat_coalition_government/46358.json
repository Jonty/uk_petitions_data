Providers can still decide if they wish to provide their area with a home birth service or give access to a stand alone birth centre.\r\n\r\nSafe, high quality maternity care from a midwife that you know and trust should not be a 'post code lottery' here in the UK, please sign our petition if you want to exercise your right to CHOICE. Thank you.",
