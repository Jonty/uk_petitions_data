        "additional_details": "This government has ring-fenced overseas aid at a time when other departments face huge cuts and many people here are struggling to make ends meet. DFID's mission to \"reduce poverty\" is too idealistic. DFID should fund UK engineering, agricultural and mining companies to improve infrastructure, food production and create jobs in the recipient countries. The UK should get mineral rights in return for aid. Aid should never be \"money taken from poor people in rich countries and given to rich people in poor countries.\" ",
