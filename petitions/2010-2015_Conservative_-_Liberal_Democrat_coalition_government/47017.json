Once in office they tend to lose touch with 'reality', forget their 'policies', and serve 'big business' and 'image makers'.\r\nThey take more and more and provide less and less.\r\nThey blatantly support, tax evaders, and tax the poor.\r\nThey seem to be incapable of providing for future generations, or making decisions that will benefit the citizens of the UK. Preferring knee jerk reactions, manipulated by the media, rather than 'common sense policies'.\r\nThey refuse to support independent businesses, in any real sense, aside from rhetoric, creating the decimation of High Streets, in favour of corporate homogenisation, STILL. They must be stopped from talking and start implementing, real solutions to real problems, not cow tow to what clearly does not benefit society as a whole.",
