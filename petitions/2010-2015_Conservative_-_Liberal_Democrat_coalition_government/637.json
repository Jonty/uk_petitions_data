        "additional_details": "It has been negotiated between BBC,  Formula One Management and Sky that BBC will now only show half of the Formula 1 seasons races live and extended highlights for the rest for seasons 2012 - 2018. Sky will show all races live during the same period.\r\n\r\nIt means live Formula 1 coverage will not be on free-to-air television in the UK between 2012 and 2018.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to get this contract renegotiated so free-to-air channels like ITV, Channel4 and Channel5 have the opportunity to see if they could share the live coverage with BBC so all races are shown live without UK viewers having to pay a subscription fee to SKY for the privilege.",
