        "additional_details": "I believe we need to monitor job/employment agencies more closely, bring back the license, as job seekers we climb up staircases, call into offices and give a lot of information, personal data, we get calls and emails and many scams, we would feel a lot safer if the industry was monitored more closely not by REC but by government body, we monitor water, gas, telecom and TV and Radio industries, Ofwat, Ofgem, Ofcom and so on, but we allow anyone to open up and agency, we need to feel safe, we need the government to take control of job searching and make sure rouge agencies are stopped, honest agencies thrive and work by a set of rules to improve the industry.  make it a more professional service that has to abide by a code of conduct and has clear details complaints process and has to advertise jobs in a certain manner by a government rule / code. Bring back order into the jobs market and regulate job agencies.",
