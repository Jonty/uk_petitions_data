        "additional_details": "God Save the Queen has become stale and God does't even exist so clearly there needs to be a change. DJ Otzi's Hey Baby won multiple Grammys including Record Of The Year, it is even the most played song in my iTunes library. Given the outstanding praise this song has been given and the thought-provoking lyrics present, I think it's clear that this song must be the country's new National Anthem.",
