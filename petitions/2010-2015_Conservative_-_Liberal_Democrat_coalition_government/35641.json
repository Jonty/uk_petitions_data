        "additional_details": "We are campaigning for the implementation of a Presumption of Death Act in England and Wales for Missing People.\r\n\r\nThe families of missing people are powerless under current legislation to take control of their missing loved ones affairs. We want the government to introduce a bill similar to the draft published by Baroness Kramer so that families can take control of their missing loved ones financial matters.\r\n\r\nFamilies of missing people should be able to be made either a temporary guardian of a missing person's financial affairs or to act permanently in their place if there are significant grounds for that person to be presumed dead.\r\n\r\nThis legislation already exists in Scotland (since 1977) and Northern Ireland (since 2009) and we believe it should be introduced in England and Wales so that families here no longer have the additional concern of their missing loved ones finances spiralling out of control.\r\n\r\nHelp us push through this piece of legislation.",
