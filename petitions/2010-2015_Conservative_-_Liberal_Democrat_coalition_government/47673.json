They no longer care about the ordinary people, who pay their salaries, who they are supposed to represent, and for whose benefit they are meant to run the country. Living in the Westminster Fantasy Land, these MPs are oblivious to the effects their actions have on ordinary people.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring MPs back into the real world and to remind them that they are paid to represent their constituents ...\r\n\r\nI call on the government to enact legislation which will allow the voters in any constituency to dismiss their MP and call a by-election. This action to be triggered by a petition containing a number of signatures equivalent to at least 50% of the number of votes cast in the constituency in the last General Election.",
