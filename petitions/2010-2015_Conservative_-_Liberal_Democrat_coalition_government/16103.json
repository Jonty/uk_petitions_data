Since the move to RAF Brize Norton the repatriation route has been determined to exit via a back gate and through the country lanes avoiding any towns and villages who may want to continue the marking of respect for these service men and women who have given their lives for our safety and freedom.\r\n\r\nThis partition is to bring the undersigned members of the public feelings to the house of commons and have the route changed to allow the British public to continue to show our support for these and all continuing servicemen and women defending this great country.",
