        "additional_details": "This bridge is part of an ancient highway which should be preserved as part of Tameside's heritage. It was built in 1846 to enable the traffic to continue over the newly built railway line, with the sourcing of local stone, so that the walls of the bridge would blend into the existing walls of this lovely lane.\r\nWork is due to start in March-April 2015, where Network Rail need to electrify the railway line and have to redesign the bridge to, not only accommodate the electric lines beneath it, but comply with current regulations for the load bearing of the replacement bridge.\r\nWe don't want to stop progress, but cannot understand how the appearance of the final bridge cannot be as sympathetic to the area as the developers saw fit in 1846.\r\n",
