The two main barriers of Cost and Time-Efficiency are now an irrelevance as the apparatus is already in place, so it is time to give serious attention to how best to leverage it for the principles of Participatory Democracy to most fully serve us all.\r\n\r\nI would like to request Parliament devote resources and time to researching and discussing the ideas, as outlined at TheClickRevolution.co.uk to upgrade our system.\r\n\r\nWe need the power to Veto unpopular decisions, as a minimum, to address this need.",
