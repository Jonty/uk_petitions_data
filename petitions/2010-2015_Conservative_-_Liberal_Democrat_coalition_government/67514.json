        "additional_details": "Recent revelations have confirmed that by allowing the leader of the party with most seats in the House of Commons to be, by default, the Prime Minister of the country exacerbates and nurtures the deeply based corruptedness which is the direct result of our deeply criminal patronage based party political system where elected dishonourables are bought into compliance with any party political policy they object to.  Only by making the Prime Minister somebody who is directly elected by the people of this land, are those people EVER to achieve the level of democratic government to which they are entitled.  It must be made illegal for the Prime Minister to be a paid up member of ANY poltical party during his/her tenure in office.",
