Where is the end of the line?. All the red tape and steps taken by the parents, whilst, the victim continues to deal daily with the emotional and physical abuse.\r\n\r\nI speak for thousands of parents in the UK, we need to re examine the policies surrounding bullying as a country\r\n\r\nif the perpetrators knew of a punishment, it would deter.\r\n\r\nPlease help us to make a difference and protect our children to gain an education in a safer environment.\r\n\r\nBullying needs to have a zero tolerance, nothing more, nothing less.",
