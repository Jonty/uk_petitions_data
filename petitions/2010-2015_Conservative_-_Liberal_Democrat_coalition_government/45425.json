        "additional_details": "As more & more hospitals are closing, the remaining operating hospitals are struggling to cope with the amount of patients against staffing levels & lack of beds. My Grandad sadly passed away on the 25/01/13. He was admitted to hospital with a simple urine infection & due to poor staffing, lack of medical attention & care he died. How many other sick people are going to die as there are not enough doctors & nurses or even BEDS to cope! If this has affected you in ANY way or you feel this is an issue that could well affect you PLEASE sign this petition to have the overall NHS staffing numbers looked at. Thank you.",
