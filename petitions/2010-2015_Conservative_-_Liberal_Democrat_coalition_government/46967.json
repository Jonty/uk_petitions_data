With institutions such as the University of York and University of Exeter banning these pages, whilst the University of Strathclyde or Aston University simply ban usage of their brands, a large scale initiative must be coordinated to quash this menance. Featuring worrying posts that highlight the problems Britain encounters with the rising \u201clad\u201d culture, mistaking sexism, racism and outright bullying for \u201cbanter\u201d, the widely available pages target both individuals and groups. Pages are now being created for secondary schools and the like. This must be put to a stop, before it get's out of hand.",
