        "action": "Stop further installation of windmills",
        "additional_details": "Any further installation of power generating windmills should be halted. Windmills only generate electricty when the wind is blowing at a specific level. When the wind does not blow there is no power, - backup power has to be supplied from another source , usually a gas,coal or nuclear power station. Once there is backup power available, there is no reason to have windmills. Backup power stations have to be kept available to supply power at all times thus they are using energy, and causing pollution unnecessarily.  Windmills create noise that can cause health problems, despoil the countryside, and cost a huge amount of money to install and run. The concrete used to support the windmill will probably have generated more carbon dioxide during the manufacture of the cement than will be saved by the electricity generated by the windmill.\r\nThe installation of windmills must be stopped.",
