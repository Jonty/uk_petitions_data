        "additional_details": "While the rights and protections provided for in the Equality Act 2010 are extensive and powerful, ensuring that they are observed can be difficult. As a student, or a customer of a provider of goods and services, for example, there is no straightforward way of ensuring that the provider observes the Equality Act, or of challenging them on it. In general, once internal complaints are exhausted, there seems to be little recourse in the general case other than taking them to court. This is difficult, and potentially expensive.\r\n\r\nWe call for the introduction of a civil enforcement body, with investigatory powers and a mandate to bring or support cases related to breaches of the Equality Act 2010.",
