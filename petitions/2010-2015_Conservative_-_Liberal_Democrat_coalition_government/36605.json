        "additional_details": "seems that when we  are old and want to down size to a smaler house we still have to pay  a government tax that hides under the old rules we know as stamp duty. I think that once we reach 60 we have paid enough tax to have a small concession that when we sell up to move close to our children and help them along the way abit perhaps  we could quilify as  not having to pay this tax. It needs rules but. I canot aford \u00a310,000 so i can  move closer to my children ed  a pensioner in wales\r\n In aus and france they have it ok why not here to help the \u00a3 140 a week we have for working all our lives",
