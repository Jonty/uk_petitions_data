        "additional_details": "For years, estate agents have wanted regulation and industry exams / licensing. The Government ignored the industry, like the failed Home Information Packs they forced on consumers. For years, Stamp duty goes from 1% to 3%, with no 2%? Its time the Government listened, the consumer needs protection. Its only a matter of time before people are badly ripped off, losing tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of pounds, through negligence. Greater protection for consumers is required. If the industry goes online, cutting fees, call centres in India selling property, valuations from people with no experience will lead to misery. An online agent working from his bedroom, giving advice without knowledge, simply guessing how much peoples houses are worth is a very scary and dangerous reality. We need to protect the consumer.",
