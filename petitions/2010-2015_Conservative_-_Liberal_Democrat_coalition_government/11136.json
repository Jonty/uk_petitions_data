        "additional_details": "As the title suggest, a Curfew Law should be brought in prohibiting under 18 year olds being in public places after 10pm at night.  This is common in many European countries and would work towards reducing Gang problems where members usually join Gangs at a very young age.  It would also reduce groups congregating on the street corners, in parks, outside shops causing a nuisance, damaging property and scaring the elderly.  Children caught on the streets after 10pm should be taken home to their parents and fines imposed on their parents.",
