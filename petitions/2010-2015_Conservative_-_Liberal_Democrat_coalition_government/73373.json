        "additional_details": "The government needs to lower the age to 2 years old from 3 years old with regards to disabled children & their family/carer qualifying for Motability Allowance.\r\n\r\nThe children who qualify for DLA need to travel in wheelchair access vehicles. Some are attached to life support machinery & positioning is vital for them to remain safe & comfortable. For a child with these positional needs a car seat will be unsafe especially those with a bone/muscle disorder. A child of this disability is very difficult to maneuver from the age of 2 years old.\r\n\r\nWAV will give these families a better quality of life and keep their child safe on journeys whilst addressing the limitations of the lifting the parent/carer can physically do. These families need the financial assistance from the government from the age of 2 years old.\r\n\r\n",
