Leaky Gut (which lets bacteria and food particles into the bloodstream, affecting many body parts, from feet to brain) goes un-diagnosed, and crippling complications go un-treated.\r\n\r\nAs dying Candida bacteria cause Herxheimers Reaction (flooding the body with toxins, causing pain and other side-effects), un-supported patients don't know if / when they\u2019re recovering ~ removing yeasts and sugars, and / or gluten, from the diet may reveal other allergies / intolerances.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Health Dept to make sure doctors / clinicians check: how badly such patients are affected; which other conditions may be complicating matters; which course of treatment suits their needs ~ patients should not be left to heal themselves from Leaky Gut without professional guidance / assistance.\r\n",
