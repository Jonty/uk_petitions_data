        "additional_details": "I have noticed that a lot of traffic jams are being caused by poorly phased traffic lights, 20mph speed limits and some traffic calming measures.\r\n\r\nWhilst sitting in many of these traffic jams, it occurred to me that it must cost the country millions of pounds in lost time.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that an agency be set up with the sole purpose of improving traffic flow.  Their role would include making traffic lights far more efficient as well as removing anything that creates blockages in roads (e.g. parked cars on narrow sections of busy roads).  In addition, I would like to suggest that 30mph speed limits be re-introduced on all roads, except for small side roads.\r\n\r\nIf others would like to see something done to reduce traffic jams, please sign this petition.",
