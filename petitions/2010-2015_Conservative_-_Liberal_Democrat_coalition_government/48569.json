People should not be rewarded for failiure and when the fiull repercussions of the Retail Distribution Review are analysed it is beyond doubt his tenure at the FSA will be even further tarnished.\r\n\r\nIf Mr Sants won't take the honourable decision and hand his undeserved Knighthood back the Governent should make the ultimate example of this 'crash test dummy'.
