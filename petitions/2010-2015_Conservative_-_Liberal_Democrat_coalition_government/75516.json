Young 'adults' depending on their parents to support them through university is ludicrous. A basic example: student loan (\u00a33600)... student accommodation (\u00a35500) straight away, said student is \u00a31900 short without a basic food/living allowance.\r\n\r\nA loan should be a loan. Based on the individuals needs,  rather than parental income.\r\n\r\nThere are many other issues which need altering too; in regards to how the loan is calculated.\r\n\r\nNo consideration for how many other children at home.\r\nFinancial status of home.\r\n",
