This in my view will make the government of the day actually make its case for legislation in order to secure enough votes to get it passed. If they have to make the case, then there is a chance that the government will actually think through its legislation and we will get better governance as a result. The whipping system is thoroughly undemocratic as it relies on bullying tactics by the whips to get our elected representatives to vote in a particular way. If the government cannot win the debate for its legislation and get the necessary votes fairly, then it doesn't deserve to get it passed.  ",
