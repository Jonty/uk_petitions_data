        "additional_details": "I am asking the government and the Justice system to re-reconsider and reviewed their policies and make prison sentences tougher so it sends a clearer message to offenders.\r\n\r\nThe criminals are not worried about re-offending  and it is easier and much better life for some when in prison.\r\n\r\nI think when someone commits a crime, the prison system must make criminal work (paid)as expected from any law abiding public member. From their earnings 30% should be used for paying for their own prison cell / time/ food and and 70% should be sent to their families so they are not left destitute. I strongly believe this process will help government and local government (with benefit system) with reducing cost and expenses as well as motivate prisoners and help them build life skill that they can use when they complete their sentences.\r\n\r\n",
