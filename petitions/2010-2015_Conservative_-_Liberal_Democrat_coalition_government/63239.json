        "additional_details": "After cancelling other Arriva bus services, the number 16 bus route is soon to be discontinued. Passengers use this bus daily to travel to work, school, college, university and to hospital appointments. There is now only 1 bus service traveling through an already deprived area where many residents do not drive. This has created a lot of distress for many passengers, especially in todays society where safety is paramount, young children and elderly people will be forced to take extra journeys on dark mornings and evenings. We would like the number 16 Arriva bus service to continue running or to be taken over by another bus company.",
