        "additional_details": "This discriminatory policy should be removed immediately to allow gay and bisexual men the right to donate blood freely without prejudice.\r\n\r\nBlood-borne viruses are increasing throughout the UK however the NHS could use this opportunity (through blood donation) to identify those individuals infected and provide necessary support.\r\n\r\nBlood-borne viruses are by no means restricted to the gay male community but this policy and practise adopted by the NHS would suggest this, instead of the NHS refusing this service to gay men it should be embraced.\r\n\r\nSuch discrimination should not be allowed but whilst it does gay men remain an untapped resource that could be used to save lives.\r\n\r\nI call on the Government to remove the 12 month deferral ban on gay men donating blood, and subsequently introduce an individual risk assessment for all blood donor patients.\r\n\r\nCompanies that are related to the NHS shouldnt discrimate, as the NHS doesnt discrimate!!!",
