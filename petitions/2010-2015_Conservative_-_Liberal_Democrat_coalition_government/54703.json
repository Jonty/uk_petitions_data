        "additional_details": "The immigrations rules should be changed to allow legal costs of successful appellants against the UKBA to recover their legal costs of all successful appeals.  The rules should allow the recoverability of legal costs and all fees paid.  The recoverability of legal costs and appeals will benefit both the Legal Services Commission in that they will not have to fund appeals through legal aid (where it is scarcely available) and will allow poor appellants the ability to have the much needed legal representation in appeals with merits.  The availability of legal representation (through the potential recoverability of legal costs) will also mean that meritless appeals will be less likely to drain judicial resources.",
