        "action": "Ban Government programms that force people to do free work",
        "additional_details": "Programs like MWA and the work program are modern day slave labour and are under UK law illegal.\r\n\r\nThe Oxford English Dictionary states:\r\nLabour which is coerced and inadequately rewarded, or people that do it:\r\n\r\nIf a person refuses to work for free they are threatened with sanctions of money they need to survive.\r\n\r\n\r\nUK laws states:\r\n\r\nThe Coroners and Justice Act 2009 introduced an offence of holding someone in slavery or servitude, or requiring forced or compulsory labour. The offence came into force on 6 April 2010 and applies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nSo I state, work programs where people are not paid adequately for the work is in fact illegal and should be band.\r\n\r\nForcing people to work for free pushes more people towards homelessness and debt which is not helping people but in fact causing harm. Unemployed people are massively discriminated against and treated unfairly by both the Government and the public.",
