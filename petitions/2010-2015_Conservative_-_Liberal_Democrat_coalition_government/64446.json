        "additional_details": "We need CCTV in all care homes and nursing homes as a matter of law. Not only will it protect the resident, but also the care worker and other staff.\r\n\r\nDid you know thatthe care worker does not have any rights by the police or the law if theyare accused by a resident. The process is long, suspension and may even be barred from working in a care environment for 10 years. Even if there is no proof, no witnesses, and at times it is a set up, done by malicious other staff. This has to stop in a country where we are proud of our Justice System. There isnt one for the care industry, its more like a dictatorship. So please sign the petition for the good of better care home and nursing home, for both protecting the service user and the care worker, vulnerbility goes hand in hand.",
