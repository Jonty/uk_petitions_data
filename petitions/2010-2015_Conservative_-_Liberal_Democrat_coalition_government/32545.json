        "additional_details": "Every year, millions of animals are dissected or vivisected (to cut into a living being) in schools and universities. It is estimated that 170 animal species or more are used for dissection and vivisection. Cats, frogs, fetal pigs, grasshoppers, mink, earthworms, rats, mice, dogs, pigeons, and turtles are just some of the many species used.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the animals used in schools and universities are purchased as dead specimens, many are subjected to painful and lethal procedures while still alive. Animals are also obtained as 'byproducts' of extremely cruel industries. For instance, slaughterhouses provide fetal pigs, and fur farms sell skinned mink, foxes, and rabbits. Most of these animals led deprived lives and standards regarding humane slaughter or death at such facilities are sometimes not enforced.\r\nStudents need to learn to respect living beings and begin to appreciate and understand the role of animals in nature. Please ban dissection in schools.",
