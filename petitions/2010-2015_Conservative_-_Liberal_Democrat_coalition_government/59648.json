This should mean that the company has to offer the client the option for a free debt management plan.  For example, http://www.eveshamdebtadvisors.co.uk/ is a commercial debt management company, but through one of its sister companies, http://www.debt-managementplan.net/ the clients do have access to a totally free debt management service which is fully supported.  By doing this, 100% of the payment by the client is given over to their creditors.  This means the client will get debt free a lot quicker.",
