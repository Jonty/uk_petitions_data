We the electorate want to know how this money is spent, in detail, by the recipient countries, and how it is benefiting the poor and needy before it is protected, increased or even handed over, when cuts in pensions are hinted at to balance our budget.\r\n\r\nWe are frightened for our futures in the current situation.  We are the ones who need help from our hard earned taxes.  We should be protected and prioritised.  We as tax payers can't afford to  pay for other countries', especially when we see the political elite of those countries living in relative luxury.  Is that where our money goes?  We have a right to know if we are going to pay our money out to prop up other countries.",
