        "additional_details": "When a thug puts a cat in a microwave oven and walks free from Court its time the Law must increase animal protection. Stiff punishments are needed to protect animals from such cruelty. I urge all who sees this petition to sign it and force the Government to bring into effect the sort of punishments such cruelty deserves i.e. prison. Only this will make the perpetrators of animal cruelty stop and think before committing such evil acts, at the present time they walk free from Court with nothing to fear.",
