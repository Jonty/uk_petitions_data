        "additional_details": "I wish to end the onset of American style industrialised animal farming where thousands of animals are raised in grassless enclosures,with no shelter while being fattened up for 3 to 6 months on waste vegetables,bakery waste and wheat feed. At present, because the pens are constructed with straw bales and electric fencing, planning permission is not necessarily required. I wish the government to safeguard animals being reared in such a callous manner, merely to drive the price of meat down. These animals should be protected during their short lives, from cruel and inhumane deprivations forced upon them by the use of these extreme methods.  ",
