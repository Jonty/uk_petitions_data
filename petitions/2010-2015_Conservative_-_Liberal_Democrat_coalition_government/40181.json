We also require the Government to show how they arrived at the decision to increase the foreign aid from just over 8 billion to over 11 billion (a 36% increase), and that the majority of the UK population supported their decision. We also require the Government to justify the expenditure on foreign aid in comparison to the current cuts in local and vital services, when a majority of the amounts of monies in cuts could be covered by the foreign aid, or just the increase in 2011 (36% - an extra 3 billion).\r\n\r\n",
