Also there is very little provision for designated areas for overnight parking such as aires on the continent. Contrary to belief motorhomers do help local economies. With this in mind council should be made to provide safe areas, with access to water at least for motorhomes to park up overnight and to raise height barrirers on car parks during the day.\r\n",
