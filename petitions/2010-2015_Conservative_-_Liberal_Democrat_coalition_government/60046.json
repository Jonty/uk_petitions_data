        "additional_details": "Due to the excessive cost to the British Tax Payer of ATOS and the Appeals Tribunals Service, this money should be given to GP's for them to carry out assessments on their patients to see if they are fit for work or not.  At the end of the day, GP's sign sick notes so it would only take a few more moments for the GP to inform the DWP if someone is fit for work or not.  Also, GP's have access to their patients records.  This would mean that claimants would not have to request their medical history from doctor.\r\n\r\nIf this system is brought in, the DWP should not put any pressure on GP's which would harm the GP/patient relationship.",
