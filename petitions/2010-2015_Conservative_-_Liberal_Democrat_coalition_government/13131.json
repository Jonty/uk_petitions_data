A two month car policy cancellation can mean losing the whole year's cover and can result in people not insuring.\r\n\r\nIn the mobile society that we have to live in to move jobs etc. internet providers and mobile telephone companies are also making a fortune out of cancellations at ordinary people's expense.\r\n\r\n A sensible rate should be charged.",
