The Gov argue, that as they now live in non reciprocal countries, they are not entitled despite often being in commonwealth countries, whilst others living in the EU  are given full pension increases. Those EU people in UK  get the free UK perks + their Pensions from 'home' WE paid in to the scheme so should be the ones to receive the benefits! We paid in and THEy get the benefits - it's WRONG!",
