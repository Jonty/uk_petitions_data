Now it is time to look at the truth and face facts. Many war crimes are being committed here.\r\n\r\nWhat do I want you to do:\r\n\r\nCondemn the Israelis Army and its Government\r\nImpose Sanctions on all arms sales and military support for Israel\r\nStop all financial aid for Israel\r\nFreeze all Bank accounts of the Israel Government in this country (like you did for the Lybian government)\r\n\r\nThis will make a start for promoting world peace. Do you have the strength to stand up to them?",
