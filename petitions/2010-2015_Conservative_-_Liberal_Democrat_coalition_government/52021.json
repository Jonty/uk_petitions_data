        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the UK Government to end the discriminatory \u00a33,000 cash bond deposits for UK visas.\r\n\r\nAs of November 2013, people aged 18 and over wishing to come to the UK for a short term visit will be required to deposit a \u00a33,000 cash bond when they apply for a British visa.\r\n\r\nThis shocking move is targeted only at people from the non-white Commonwealth countries of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and Ghana.\r\n\r\nThe \u00a33,000 cash bond disproportionally affects the poorest that are unlikely to meet the requirements. For anyone looking to visit family and friends in Britain, the extortionate fee will deny them the basic right to see their loved ones and it will inhumanely hit Britain\u2019s long established Asian and African communities\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe call on the UK Government to scrap the latest scheme and allow our families to travel to the UK without restriction\r\n\u2022\tWe demand the end of racial discrimination through immigration control",
