        "additional_details": "As a qualified nurse for the last 17 years i propose that nursing is deprofessionalised, nursing is not a profession, and noone can give a professional definition of \"nursing\" no nurse can act individually and cannot even prescribe paracetomol without doing a course, also nursing is not a subject, you could have a nursing degree yet not have the skills to work in any area, e'g medicine, itu, a and e etc etc. It was made a profession so that nurses could be sued in order to take legality away from individual trusts. HCA training is more than enough and drs should take more responsibility. The nmc should also be abolished and individual trusts via crp checks etc should be responsible for staff. Nurses should not have to pay to protect the public. This would be a great way of saving money without affecting \"care\".rose tinted glasses and ill informed people lead to this job being professionalised, it is a basic job with no professional element to it, nor salary.",
