        "additional_details": "In parts of Britain some Muslim communities have set up and operate Sharia courts, this is in conflict with the law of the land and the culture of Britain.  It sends a message to the non Muslim population, of the setting up of Muslim enclaves of a state within a state.  That matters that should be dealt with in the British legal system, are now outside of that and potentially providing entirely different outcomes.  Sharia law and no go areas for non Muslims give the impression that some Muslims coming to Britain want nothing to do with our society, culture or being British.  I/we want Sharia courts stopped.",
