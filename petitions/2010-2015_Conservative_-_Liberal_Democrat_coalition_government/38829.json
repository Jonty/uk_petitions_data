        "additional_details": "The House of Commons is not representative of the electorate. The House of Commons has 650 MPs. Of these 650, there are 504 male MPs, so women are seriously under represented. There are 27 MPs of black and minority ethnic (BME) origin, but there would need to be 55-60 BME MPs to be representative of the BME population.  There are a handful of disabled MPs but there would need to be 65 disabled MPs to be representative of the number of disabled people in the population.\r\n\r\nLetting MPs serve on a job share basis would enable more people from under-represented groups to stand for Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the law be changed to allow MPs to serve on a job share basis.\r\n",
