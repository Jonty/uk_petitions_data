The construction industry is a mess, I have been out of work for a while now. companys are more interested to take on foreign bodys because of cheap labour, have these people got the relevent qualifacations and have they the right to work here ? we neede to pull together and speak up for ourselfs or us as a nation will get walked over. basically a new law should be made by the goverment. \" every company in the uk should be limited to how many foreign workers they can take on. 10% of the total workforce is acceptable, so ten people work in one shop, only \" 1 \" foreign worker shall be aloud to be taken on. we need to start making change for the young & old people of our beautiful country, the whole thing is a mess..",
