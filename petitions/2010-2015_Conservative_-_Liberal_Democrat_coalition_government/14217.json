        "additional_details": "As of April 2006, individuals whose Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits reduced after 52 weeks of hospital in-patient treatment no longer incur this reduction. In effect this means that many long term hospital patients particularly those detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 (as ammended 2007) continue to recieve the maximum amount of welfare benefits to which they are entitled, some of whom acquire a considerable amount of savings at the tax payers expense. Also when discharged from hospital if they have been detained under a treatment section of the afore mentioned Act they then qualify for free aftercare.\r\nBring an end to this unfair and unjust system which see's many older and vulnerable people struggling with the rising cost of living and reduction in their current benefits.",
