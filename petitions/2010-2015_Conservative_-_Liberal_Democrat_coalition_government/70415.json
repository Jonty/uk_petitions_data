Currently some schools offer discounts for multiple children but this does not help if you have boys and girls or children at different schools. A parent should not be put in a position to decide if 1 of their children is excluded from private education, but should be encouraged to give them all the education they can afford. The government should give tax breaks to parents sending multiple children to private schools.",
