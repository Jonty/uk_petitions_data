        "additional_details": "The Eurozone is a political project for the enrichment of eurozone politicians.  The IMF is global and therefore to use its fund to help out eurozone projects is at the very least immoral because the money goes directly into the pockets of politicians, at worse grossly illegal.  THE IMF MUST STOP FUNDING THE EUROZONE and until it does that the UK should withdraw and the people of this country should be given an opportunity to make a choice on that because leaving it to  our polticians is to GUARANTEE that absolutely nothing happens.",
