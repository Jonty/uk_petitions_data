        "additional_details": "I would like parliament to debate the formation of a Government Ombudsman for receiving reports of abuse. Currently there is no such way to report abuse in Cumbria. The Police don't want to know, Doctors are not interested and M.P.s refuse to help. Googling Adult abuse in Cumbria produces a link to a page that is non-existant. The whole problem is that it is impossible for anyone who has never been subjected to serious abuse to appreciate just how serious the psychological affects are. That a victiom is ignored by those he or she tries to report the abuse to has the affect of further abuse on the victim.\r\n\r\nIf the Prime Minister is really so determined that victims of abuse must be listened to as he says then there has to be someone not afraid to listen.",
