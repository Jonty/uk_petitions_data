        "action": "More funding for Independent Sexual Violence Advisors (ISVAs) to support rape victims through the justice system",
        "additional_details": "In February 2013, shocking figures released by the Home Office and Ministry of Justice estimated that 95,000 rapes occur in the UK each year \u2013 yet only 15,670 are reported and just 1,070 rapists are convicted.\r\nIn response, Reveal magazine launched the Report Every Rape campaign, through which numerous women bravely shared their stories, unraveling myths about rape, the reasons they did not report their attack and the cruel effects of this crime.\r\nThose who do report rape may face the harrowing ordeal of going to court. The support of a specially trained Independent Sexual Violence Advisor (ISVA) at this time is crucial. Mum-of-four Frances Andrade did not have an ISVA and tragically this resulted in her taking her own life during her rapist\u2019s trial in January.\r\nCurrently there are around 180 ISVAs and they are greatly overstretched. We are calling upon the Government to increase the funding for more ISVAs to encourage more victims to seek justice.\r\nPlease sign to show your support.",
