        "additional_details": "The F.A. has rules preventing its referees from officiating in matches involving teams that they support. However, Howard Webb has never officially declared an allegiance to Manchester United and is therefore allowed to continue refereeing their games, despite a pattern of questionable decisions.\r\n\r\nMost football fans despair when they see that Mr Webb is the allocated referee for a Manchester United game and fear the worst, due to his perceived bias. This anomaly is an affront to the cherished principles of fairness and justice. Accordingly Mr Webb should be barred from refereeing any future Manchester United games.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you love football and want the game to remain \"beautiful\". ",
