        "additional_details": "The goverment are always introducing new test they think they are looking out for our children but i for one doubt this children with disabilitys such as asperger's syndrome, children with anxiety the impact that these tests make on the family unit is alot.  Then there is the issue of putting presure on primary schools to squeze this not only into the curriculum but also to perform.  Then there is the issue of us parents not being able to surport our primary age children with some of these tests.  I would like the goverment to stop putting the pressure on our primary school children and  let children be children, not to put so much pressure on primary schools to perform and to consolt with your public on the way forward with our primary school children and not just do it as i final thought there is alot of differnt nationalitys in our primary shools and alot of adults in our area that can not read or write!",
