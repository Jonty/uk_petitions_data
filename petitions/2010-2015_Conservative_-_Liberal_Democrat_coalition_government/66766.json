If we are ever to regain our status as a world force in the beautiful game of football the influx of foreign players must be restricted.\r\nThe FA has highlighted this problem recently when talking about the frightening trend of non English players in the Premier League.\r\nThe disaster of England's performance at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil highlights the lack of world class talent available to Roy Hodgson or his successors.\r\nWe must act now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
