Having spoken to various Police officers and A&E nurses, they are all in favour of tackling this menace and feel this would stamp out the problem almost immediatley.\r\n\r\nSecondly the money raised by such fines could be pumped straight back into the NHS and Police forces, which would benefit everyone.\r\n\r\nOn average there are 12,500 incidents of this nature every weekend, this should raise \u00a36,250,000 each weekend.\r\n\r\n",
