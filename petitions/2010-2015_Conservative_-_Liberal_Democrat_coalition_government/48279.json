The definition of 'animal' however does not include cats. Currently only dogs, horses, sheep, cattle, pigs, goats, ass and mules are included.\r\n\r\nTwo days ago my beautiful cat was ran over, and there was no witnesses, she was found by an amazing man and his wife who called the council to report this horrific accident, the councils response was 'leave it there or chuck it in the bin' sorry, but who in there right mind could say such cruel words.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, this needs to change - cats make up half the majority of household pets so why are they not included?\r\n\r\nplease help me change this!\r\n\r\n",
