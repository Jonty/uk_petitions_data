        "additional_details": "Look at the option of Public Schools offering places to children from troubled families. Although Public Schools offer places to children who are accademic , the places I am sugggesting are for children who are not accademic but need help. The use of these schools especially boarding schools would mean that the child would be removed from their enviroment and shown a different way to behave and learn. Public Schools mostly if not all have charitable status so it is time for them to step up and help the community. It would be a better option to putting these children in care or young offenders institution, it would also help the elite in this Country understand the problems of day to day living.",
