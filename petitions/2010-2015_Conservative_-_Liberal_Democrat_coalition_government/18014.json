Over \u00a34billion has been spent so far with the plan to spend up to the remaining \u00a36billion on buy out clauses. Why not continue the project which will cost the same rather than just throwing money out the window. Let the public choose if we should scrap the project as its their \u00a36billion going down the drain. ",
