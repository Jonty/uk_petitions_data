It was donated to the community and was and is being used as a social club, bingo and drop in centre for over 50s in the local area. Now they have decided to refurbish it White city enterprise have taken over and cut down the hours it can be used. They have stated they will start charging in a year. Over 50s have been going here for years to meet for a chat and something to eat, bingo and have there hair done by a local hairdresser. As we all know it can get lonely when you're old so this is vita place for them to enjoy their lives. This needs to be given back to the community!!\r\n",
