        "additional_details": "As a first time mother it has came to my attention that whilst using public transport I have noticed the lack of patience from most bus drivers. There has been numerous occasions I have nearly tripped and fell as I have wheeled my 5 week old baby on to the bus and not had time to be seated. Bus drivers should respect mothers and allow them time to sit down and get the pram or buggy locked so it can't roll when the bus is moving. I dread to hear an incident where a mother has fell on her infant on the bus due to the lack of patience of bus drivers and has injured not only herself but her young child. Please help to make bus drivers more aware of the potential dangers of driving off when mothers with prams and pregnant women aren't seated. ",
