        "additional_details": "In 2010 the government made a harsh decision to raise student tutition fees to a staggering \u00a39000 from \u00a33000 it's not hard to work out that this is a triple increase but why? There is no explanation.\r\nThey was not a decrease in living cost nor was they a rise in wages so why is it right that the students of 2010 and previous will pay \u00a39000 for a three year degree and the students of 2010 onwards pay \u00a318'000 what happened to equal rights or the right to appeal?\r\nThe students of our time are the future lawyers, judges, government speakers why is it right they are charged a disgusting \u00a318000. To put the reality into debt terms after loans for living costs graduates are left with bills near to \u00a350'000 and with the threshold for paying back recently been reduced to a ridiculous \u00a316'000 the figures just do not weigh up.\r\n\r\nUntil now a tutition fee petition has not reached 100'000 signitures. If we can reach this it will be taken to the House of Commons and a stand will be made. ",
