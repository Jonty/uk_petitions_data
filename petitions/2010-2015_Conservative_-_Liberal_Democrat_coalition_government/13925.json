        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, wish for a full review of the parliamentary system of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland with the goal of bringing in legislation to modernise our democracy with a focus on replacing the House of Lords with a fully elected Senate, a head of government directly elected by the people and equality in devolution which includes either an English parliament or regional equivalents. We believe further debates and real reform on this issue would be a benefit to our country and is in the best interests to our nation's democracy.",
