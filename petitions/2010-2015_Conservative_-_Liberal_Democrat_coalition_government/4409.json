        "additional_details": "Wales have recently voted through a law to make sprinklers compulsory in all new dwellings. This petition seeks to ensure that the same law is brought to the rest of the UK. No one has ever died as a result of a fire in a building with a working sprinkler system. They are cost effective and save lives. Despite what the CLG say, builders will never opt to install them unless they are forced to by law.  ",
