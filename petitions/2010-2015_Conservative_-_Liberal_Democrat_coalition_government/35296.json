        "additional_details": "UK Defence spending is $73,746,170,000, third in world ranking. $30,000,000,000 more than France or Germany. In global ranking, the UK is 5th. France has a fully independant ballistic missile program and a controlling interest in a space rocket programme (Ariane), two large carriers, one nuclear. The UK currently has no fleet air arm, no carrier and badly equipped troops. The government should properly and thoroughly audit MOD spending, identify and replace incompetant civil servants and produce Armed Forces of a quality that reflects the level of spending.",
