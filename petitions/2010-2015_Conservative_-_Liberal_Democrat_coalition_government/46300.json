        "additional_details": "please note this is not aimed at genuine people who need it,but the scamers who rip off the tax payer\r\n\r\nThis e-petition is calling for an end of motability as we know it,to often people who do not need it are being awarded cars at the tax payers expense.\r\nWhat people need to under stand is that there is only so much money to go around and every time a scamer is awarded a car thats \u00a320000 out of the pot,which could be being invested into the NHS or the latest treatments for serious medical conditions such as cancer.\r\nthis petition is calling  on the government to scrap motability for all but the most deserving,eg YES for those with a disabled child - NO for those with a bad back or sore leg(scamers) and to also put in place a system of large fines for those found to be frudulantly claiming, and for any money saved to be realocated to the NHS so that people who really need it are given the very latest treatments\r\n\r\nI WANT THE TAX I PAY TO MAKE A DIFFERANCE, NOT TO BE WASTED",
