It gives hope to the offender of having a life one day where they may be guilty of taking someone else's deliberately denying someone the right to live their natural life. To me justice is that if you take a life you have you life taken also or at the very least are seperated from society permanently. The government has a duty to enforce a law to protect society and make society a safer place. To have deterrents in place rather then laws that seem to almost condone behaviour that is obviousley totally inappropriate. Life to mean life would cut down serious crime.",
