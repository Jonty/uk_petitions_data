        "additional_details": "The E-Petition service brought forward by the current administration has caused nothing but bluster in its short existence. Currently among other things, a petition calling for the Death Penalty to be reinstated has been created.\r\n\r\nThis service allows nothing more than mob rule, democracy this is not. A country so easily influenced by common prejudice, without regard for education or debate, inward, xenophobic and paranoid, this will become the UK.\r\n\r\nCall for the removal of this service if you value the integrity and the character of hour time-tested democracy.",
