        "additional_details": "Chris Huhn recently received \u00a317,000 severance pay from the Government for being forced to resign over his investigation into driving offenses.  Before the trial but after his resignation he has admitted publically that he lied to police and he is guilty of the offenses, but he is keeping the \u00a317,000 thank you very much.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that not only is Chris Huhn fraudulently keeping this money but that he needs to return it to the Government immediately and apologise for his actions.\r\n",
