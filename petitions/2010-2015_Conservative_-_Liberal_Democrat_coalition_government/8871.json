        "additional_details": "According to the BBC 'The DVLA does not keep figures on the number of road-legal quads, but the main UK suppliers say that since 2005 they have gone from selling a few hundred each year to thousands' and with this rise in sales has come a rise in incidents involving these vehicles. Under UK law it is currently not compulsory for quad bike riders to wear crash helmets. The government should create a law which changes this to prevent further deaths and injuries as a result of a lack of safety equiptment worn by quad bike riders.",
