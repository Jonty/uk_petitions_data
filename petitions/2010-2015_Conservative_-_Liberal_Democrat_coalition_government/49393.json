It makes no sense to not have a document outlining our rights.\r\n\r\nWe are one of the few western democracies that doesn't actually have a written constitution. Understanding our rights is paramount to all citizens protecting our autonomy and bridges a gap between government and the public as it makes things more easily accessible.\r\n\r\nThis would not apply to the devolved legislatures (Scottish Parliament, The Welsh Assembly and Northern Ireland's Assembly) as they are not legal entities which can be petitioned to via this process.\r\n\r\nHowever beginning by first having a written constitution for England would be of great benefit to the UK.\r\n\r\n",
