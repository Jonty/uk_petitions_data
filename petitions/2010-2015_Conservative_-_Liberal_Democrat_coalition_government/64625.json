As self declared outlaws they can legitimately be rounded up and incarcerated where they are not a danger to the people (perhaps we can get Gitmo' to take them).  It is also an option to put them all in uniform and send them as a vanguard NATO battalion to the 3rd World War Front developing in the Ukraine.",
