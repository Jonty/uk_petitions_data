        "additional_details": "The A17 is an important road which connects the north to the east of England. For almost it's entire length it is single carriageway with limited overtaking opportunities. This makes it incredibly dangerous and there have been many accidents along the road. The road is very busy which makes it worse. There is enough space either side of the road for it to be widened.\r\n\r\nTherefore dualling the road will reduce the number of accidents and making it a dual carriageway would decrease journey times and more people would be persuaded to use the road.\r\n\r\nThis will improve the economy as more people will visit towns along the route like Newark, Sleaford and Kings Lynn as well as seaside towns like Great Yarmouth which are popular tourist destinations.
