        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\n\r\nLast year, a gang of British Pakistani men were jailed in Rochdale for the sexual grooming, pimping and trafficking of vulnerable underage girls.The public was assured that the government would take steps to prevent this happening again, but  requests for a public enquiry into the failures of the Police and Social Services were refused.  Now in Oxford another gang of British Pakistani men have been found guilty of the same offence.\r\nIn order to ameliorate the negative effect of this upon social cohesion, we call upon the Government to hold a Public Enquiry into these crimes  with a view to applying British law more stringently  to protect these children and to bring the perpetrators to justice more speedily.\r\n",
