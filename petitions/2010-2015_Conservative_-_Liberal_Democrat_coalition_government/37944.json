        "additional_details": "Shared ownership advertised as \"affordable housing\" proves in many cases to be extremely expensive and frankly, exorbitant. For a lot of leaseholders, service charges can spiral out of control as there are no limits on how much management companies can charge for maintenance of the communal grounds.\u00a0\r\n\r\nAt present, the only solution would be to \u00a0appeal to a Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. Unfortunately, this could also prove extremely expensive and many leaseholders are unable to afford this cost.\u00a0We want the government to put clear safeguards in place to protect those who sign up for Shared Ownership Schemes.",
