        "additional_details": "In December 2011 the MP for Cannock Chase attended a stag party, for which he was the best man, and for which he purchased for the use of the groom a replica of the uniform in which Nazi SS personnel committed and assisted with the murder of over 5 million Jewish men, women and children.\r\n\r\nAidan Burley has since signalled his intention not to stand as Conservative MP for the Cannock Chase parliamentary district in the 2015 general election. I petition that although he has made no reference to the aforementioned purchasing of a replica uniform it is instrumental in the reasoning behind his decision.\r\n\r\nIf his position is untenable at the 2015 general election, it is untenable now, and the Conservative Member for Cannock Chase should resign as MP forthwith and his constituents should be able to vote for a new MP in a by election at the earliest opportunity.
