        "additional_details": "The government propose spending \u00a3400 million on a new barracks in Scotland.\r\n\r\nKeetwonen is the name of the biggest container city in the world. Living in a converted shipping container was a new concept in the Netherlands when launched, but the city of Amsterdam took the courageous step to contract to go and realise it. It turned out to be a big success among students in Amsterdam and it is now the second most popular student dormitory offered by the student housing corporation\r\n\r\nThese converted containers are publicly advertised at \u00a32500 each housing 4 or 2 with a separate room.\r\n\r\nWith 3,000 units lets, very pessimistically, double it for shipping costs and getting it on site.\r\n\r\nLets add 50% for the related facilities.\r\n\r\n\u00a322.5 million as against \u00a3400 million\r\n\r\nAsk ordinary soldiers if the Keetwonen facilities are as good as, or better than normal barracks. Let Parliament debate whether spending \u00a3400 million or \u00a322.5 million is better.\r\n\r\n",
