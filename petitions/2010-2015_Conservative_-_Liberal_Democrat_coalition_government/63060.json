        "additional_details": "With the proposed construction of the \"Kensal Crossrail Station\" in North Kensington, residents and visitors to the Royal Borough will be subjected to years of disruption for a development that will ultimately be of great detriment to the area.\r\n\r\nResidents should be concerned about the proposed re-development of the area, as it will not only devalue property prices but also create wider problems such as increased volumes of traffic & pollution (which North Kensington is already struggling to deal with) and poses a serious threat to the cultural importance of this vibrant community which stands to be stamped out by the plans.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with the proposed re-development of the area, Kensington & Chelsea will lose one of its few remaining green spaces - the former Eurostar depot site is currently home to a wide variety of wildlife and mature trees that under the proposed plans will disappear.\r\n\r\nPlease take the time to sign this petition so we can save the integrity of our area.",
