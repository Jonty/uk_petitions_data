        "additional_details": "I wish the government to stop the sale of overcounter drugs to under 16 year olds. Under 18 year olds aren't allowed to buy alcohol and cigarettes so why are they allowed to buy paracetamol, ibroprofen etc which can kill and harm them if not taken correctly. Shops are selling these drugs to children as young as 11 who have no idea of what they are taking. Shopkeepers have no idea of what other medications are being taken. please take this e-petition seriously",
