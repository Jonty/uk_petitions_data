        "additional_details": "This is to scrap the 6 weeks holiday schools have during the summer. It serves no purpose, the pupils forget a lot of the skills they have learnt before it and find it harder to adjust when returning, they get bored and some can get depressed. We parents find it hard to fund the school clubs and holiday companies jack their prices up. No one wins. Except the teachers. Lets have more realistic holidays, pupils should get a set amount of days to be taken each year at the parents discretion.  ",
