        "additional_details": "We believe that the British government should use funds from their Foreign Aid budget to help protect wild elephants in Africa.\r\n\r\nElephants are in extreme danger of becoming extinct within a couple of decades. We don\u2019t want to be part of the generation that allows these magnificent animals to disappear forever.\r\n\r\nElephants are being killed by well-funded poachers, including those who use the money to fund terrorism. Poaching leads directly to the suffering of humans.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the use of Foreign Aid money is totally justified, as stopping poaching will benefit animals and humans alike.\r\n\r\nA valid plan to save the elephants exists \u2013 at the cost of around \u00a360 million. The UK shouldn't have to do this alone - but even by diverting just 0.5% of our Foreign Aid money, the UK could save Africa\u2019s elephants by itself!\r\n\r\nWe ask you to commit to using Foriegn Aid money to save elephants, and encourage other countries to do the same \u2013 before it\u2019s too late.\r\n\r\nCare for the Wild",
