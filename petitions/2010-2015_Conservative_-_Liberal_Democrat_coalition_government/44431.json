        "additional_details": "We believe that marijuana, in it's recreational and medicinal functions, should be made legal in the UK and so should the growing and distribution of it.\r\n\r\nThis would give the government a chance to gain tax revenue from it; offer new medication for various ailments (e.g. arthritis); and create a more liberal society, amongst other things.\r\n\r\nMarijuana has been proven to have less damaging effects than alcohol which is readily distributed across the nation, but there is still a stigma and taboo about Marijuana. It is time for the legalisation, the benefits of such far outweigh the negatives. It's time to face the issue.",
