        "additional_details": "UK Police and Courts now spend enormous resources dealing with petty complaints involving disputes between people which originate online on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat to name but a few.  This means they cannot get on with the task of dealing with real crime. This petition seeks to make the majority of threatening and abusive content online which is considered unacceptable to the complainer the responsibility of THE LOCAL AUTHORITY to deal with, with the exception of racist abuse which would still be investigated by Police.  This would undoubtedly free up Police and Court time for more serious matters.",
