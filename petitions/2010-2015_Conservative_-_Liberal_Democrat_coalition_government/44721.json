        "additional_details": "We live in a globally-interconnected, digital society. Information about products and services available in other countries can be easily accessed, generating demand. However, the implementation of region locks prevent consumers from exercising their right to choose to import digital goods and services from abroad, whether in the form of physical media or purely as data.\r\n\r\nPreventing the sales of books across borders would be absurd, yet this happens regularly with digital media. Neither the assumption of consumers' language abilities nor the lack of coordinated international publishing should strip consumers of their right to choose their purchases. Electronic devices designed to run or display certain types of media ought not to intentionally refuse to function, and regulation is needed.",
