Unfortunately the official film of it seems to have been edited by someone with the attention span of a neutrino - there is barely a scene of the musical content that lasts for more than two seconds, with most of them being in the order of less than half a second.\r\n\r\nI propose that the production company should be compelled to remaster this important historical artefact for the education of future generations rather than for the transient fashion of the early 2000s for not concentrating on anything in particular.",
