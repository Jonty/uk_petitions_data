Quite rightly so having served your Queen, your Country, gone to places you cant even spell for the last 22 years. Its generally not much, but its a comfort. Its not enough to live on, but it is a comfort that your country has recognised your 22 year commitment.\r\n\r\nSadly should you find yourself unemployed in civilian life, because of your Army pension, you are NOT entitled to any state benefits. You are instead told to sit back and watch thousands upon thousands of those take up to \u00a326,000 in benefits for doing nothing.\r\n\r\nYou are told that you are better off financially having NOT served your country for 22 years and it is a disgrace the Benefit Offices and Govt can allow this.\r\n\r\nPlease offer your support and sign\r\n\r\n",
