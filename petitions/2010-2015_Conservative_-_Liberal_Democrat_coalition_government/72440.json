        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call upon the government to implement new laws to prevent the maltreatment of animals and insects in television programmes produced to be broadcast in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nSeveral programmes broadcast in the UK have recently received criticism for animal cruelty, including \"Eaten Alive\" on the Discovery Channel, and \"I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\" on ITV, about which wildlife expert Chris Packham recently stated during an open letter about the programme \"I can guarantee that some animals are harmed during production, because they are fragile or easily stressed. Or simply killed, as they are in your bushtucker trials.\"\r\n\r\nNew Legislation should ensure programmes produced to be broadcast in the UK do not cause any unnecessary stress, pain, injury or death for any animals, insects or reptiles used.",
