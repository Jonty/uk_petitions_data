Even when a free delivery option is available a free is still applied\r\n\r\nHowever most still use Royal Mail to delivery packages.\r\n\r\nI would like to government to look into this to make one standard delivery fair for all. If the like of Amazon, Play etc. can provide a service to all of the UK no matter what location surely other companies can do the same.",
