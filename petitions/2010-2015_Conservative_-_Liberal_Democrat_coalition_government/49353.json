        "additional_details": "The government should establish up an energy company that sells gas and electricity to UK public and businesses in competition with established companies. Prices would be established by government policy, and profits would go straight into the treasury. The idea being that the competitive pricing would also drive down the pricing of the established energy companies. Customers would have free choice of where to buy there energy from. This would curtail the greediness of the existing energy companies",
