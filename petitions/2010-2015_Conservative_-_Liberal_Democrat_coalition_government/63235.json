        "additional_details": "Fifty years ago controversial beeching cuts saw the end of one of the lifelines to the South West and left important moorland towns cut off from the rest of the UK. Now with February\u2019s devastating floods rendering the precarious line at Dawlish useless, the focus has once again been put back on the Exeter-Okehampton-Tavistock-Plymouth route.\r\n\r\nSimply put this route is vital to the area and will provide significant benefits to everything from Tourism to big business. Hundreds of jobs will be created and new life will be breathed into the area.\r\n\r\nIt is hard to see why Network Rail are considering ploughing funds into an already problematic line when the route across the north of Dartmoor will follow exiting infrastructure meaning that it's not only best for the area but the most financially viable option.\r\n",
