        "additional_details": "Within Great Britain the most amount of income, comes from England, particularly the South East. Scotland running themselves on the money earned by people in England is wrong and unfair on the people in England who put that money into the economy. In the 2014 referendum Scotland either have to stay tied to England and Westminster and receiving Money from Westminster to make decisions in certain areas (Agriculture and Schools) or they need to completely cut  legislative and especially economic ties with the UK. This is to petition the government to try and ensure that there is no third option on the 2014 petition.",
