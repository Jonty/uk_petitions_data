        "additional_details": "We would like the government to bring forward the legalisation of section 9 of the marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. It sets out the procedure by which couples in a civil partnership can convert their civil partnership into a marriage. Legalisation is currently not expected until the end of 2014 therefore denying thousands civil partnerships to be allowed the same rights as everyone else. We believe the wider public deserves this to be debated and ultimately brought forward into law. The only way currently for civil partnered couples to be married is to dissolve their civil partnerships first before marrying. Couples who embarked on civil partnerships were trailblazers for equality and inclusion. It seems wrong and unjust that they should be made to wait further to experience the joy of marriage. Please consider signing this petition in support of equality.",
