Firstly it hides the original building, secondly it blights the streetscape with commercial messages.\r\n\r\nThis is a loophole in our planning process allowing developers to erect disproportionately invasive advertisement to the detriment of the community and local environment without going through the full planning application process.\r\n\r\nBuilding Wrap advertisement currently requires an \"express consent\" from a Council, but to restrict the invasiveness of these adverts by:\r\n1) Requiring planning application consent, with public consultation.\r\n2) a restriction on the size, max 2m x 3m.\r\n3) a restriction on the illumination, it can't be lit artificially.\r\n4) a restriction on the time, it can't be up for more than 6 months.",
