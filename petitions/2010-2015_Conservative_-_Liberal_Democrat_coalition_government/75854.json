        "additional_details": "Our council are trying to build on the last green belt in Middleton. This green belt is home to horses and natural wildlife. If the land is built on we will have to reduce numbers of horses, some of which have been stabled here for 10+ years. Other local farms that the horses could be relocated to are also having land taken to be built on forcing them to reduce numbers of livery horses and owners too. If other stables are full (which they will be) owners will have no choice but to sell and in worst of circumstances with owners who have multiple horses could be reduced to having their horse euthanised/shot. Please sign and show support to our local farms, businesses, keep crime down and protect our horses land. ",
