        "additional_details": "Hello I'm 15 years old and I feel really strong about stopping Animal testing. There is factories all over the UK where they are testing on innocent animals. They would force open animal's eye's so they can't blink and poor chemicals into them they would feed them chemicals endlessly to see how many die. We have enough products out there already, we dont need to test no more. Animals were not put on earth to be molested of any kind and to be tested on. check out this website it will show you the videos of what people do and how people could help. If I'm young this will mean something to many other young people. I may be a teenager but that doesn't stop me from fighting about what's wrong and what's right. http://www.peta.org.uk/ , 50,000 people has already joined PETA including celebrities. If were going to do something about it, it must be done now. and only you can help do this, thousand's of people will be on your side and I hope everyone agrees. Thankyou for reading if you do!.",
