        "additional_details": "This e-petition has been started by the Salford Stroke Survivors User Group (SSSUG), which is administratively supported by the Salford Branch of the Stroke Association's North West Regional office.\r\n\r\nThe SSSUG would like all stroke survivors, nationally and not just in Salford, to be eligible for free prescriptions as part of their ongoing Life After Stroke support.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n1.   Stroke Survivors are typically prescribed a range of different drugs because of the multiple effects of having a stroke.\r\n\r\nThis 'cocktail' of drugs can be very costly.\r\n\r\n2.   Stroke Survivors, in severe cases, may also be forced to retire from their jobs on medical grounds and therefore have a reduced income.\r\n\r\nThe contact for this e-petition is Steve Protano, Chair of the SSSUG, on 07811 232 061 or (preferably) by e-mail steve.protano@stroke.org.uk",
