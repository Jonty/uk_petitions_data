There should be three tariff bands.\r\n\r\nBand one should be Green....Maximum price to support the renewable energy industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nBand two should be ECO...this would be halfway between the top tier  price and the lower band.\r\n\r\nBand three should be economy and the cheapest rate per unit.\r\n\r\nEverything else I buy I have a choice to pay cheap and economy but my electricity bills are one tariff only....I feel I should have the choice to opt out from these extortionate prices as I strongly disagree with the huge subsidies paid to wind farms.\r\n\r\n",
