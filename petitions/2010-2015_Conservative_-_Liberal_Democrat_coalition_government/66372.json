        "additional_details": "\r\nPlanners in St Austell are currently under negotiations to decide what to do with the Treverbyn tip area.\r\nUnder proposals with three different options for the scheme at West Carclaze \u2013 a joint venture between Cornwall Council, landowner Imerys and developer Eco-Bos \u2013 it has been outlined that the Sky Tip cannot remain in its current form and must change.\r\n\r\nThis to some may seem an ugly reminder of the industrial history of this area. But to many this is a symbol of the heritage of the Cornish china clay industry and the start of the Cornish Alps, which gave this area its unique looks and wealth.\r\nThe Sky Tip should be preserved for future generations to admire. Refuse their plans and let them build there un-needed eco town elsewhere.\r\n\r\n",
