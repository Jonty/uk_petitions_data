        "additional_details": "When individuals are suffering from bowel diseases such as Ulcerative Colitis or Crohns Disease they are entitled to a Medical Exemption certificate due to the high numbers of medication which they are required to take.\r\n\r\nMany of these sufferers are forced to have their bowel removed and to be fitted with a Colostomy/Ileostomy bag which allows the individual to qualify for an exemption card, however should they have the bag reversed and have an Ileo-anal pouch formed, they are no longer entitled to the card despite still having to take much of the medication they took before the surgery.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to encourage the government to amend the guidelines for Medical Exemption Certificates and allow Ileo-Anal Pouch patients to be entitled to free medication. Bowel disease patients should be entitled to free medication to prevent incontinence. This is not a condition someone chooses and it would make an undignified situation slightly more bearable. ",
