        "additional_details": "It is a well-established fact that at least one in three victims of domestic violence (DV) is male, and this figure can be as high as 40%. Yet the public coverage of DV continues to be extremely one-sided.\r\n\r\nSome example of recent DV campaigns include:\r\n1) \"Big hitter\" (man in a suit who goes home and hits his partner)\r\n2) \"What does the child fear the most? [...] Mum's pleas for help?\"\r\n3) \"Are you are perfect boyfriend by day but a control freak at night?\"\r\n\r\nThese campaigns have increased awareness of DV, but also helped to create a prejudice against men on domestic issues.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition calls for the Parliament to introduce legislation so that:\r\n1) all media coverage and advertising campaigns involving DV must be gender-neutral, portraying neither gender unfairly; and\r\n2) governmental funding to DV groups will be discontinued if these funds are used in a way that discriminates against a particular gender.",
