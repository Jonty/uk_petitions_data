With homosexual's partners wishing to have a child of their own and not being able to due to the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985, the notion of equality has been disallowed by our UK government.\r\n\r\nSurrogacy arrangements are not legally enforceable within the United Kingdom. A surrogate mother would maintain the legal right of determination for the child, even if genetically unrelated. (Source: Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nWe call for the government to take this petition into consideration and bring forth the eradication of oppression.  ",
