        "additional_details": "The current DfE approach to defining what is acceptable or preferred in the national curriculum or GCSE syllabuses is open to abuse through political idealism and the personal beliefs of the Secretary of State, who has awarded himself unprecedented power in this regard. This is unacceptably undemocratic and dangerous.\r\nThe Government should legislate to enshrine in law the principle that no single party or person in Government is able to determine curriculum or qualification content. All such decisions should become the role of a cross party committee and open to consultation and debate.",
