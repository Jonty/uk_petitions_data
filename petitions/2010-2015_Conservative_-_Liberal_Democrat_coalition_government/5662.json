People die from cancer, heart and liver disease as a result of these actvities. Also if alcohol was criminalised, then we would see the end of drink driving (and people being killed as a result), a lot of anti-social behaviour in public, and people being a danger to themselves. And children and young people would not take up this habit if they didn't see adults doing so. Making 18 the minumum age is not good enough - these activities should be criminalised altogether.
