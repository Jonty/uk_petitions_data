        "additional_details": "After suffering severe depression in 2012 due to domestic violence, Angela asked for her children to be looked after by the social work for respite while she got herself back to normal. Social work put her under so much pressure she wasn't able to do this as easily as she could've, They made it imposable for her to live up to their standards, changing there minds every time she did what they asked, leading to her having another depressive episode. Its been over a year since she has seen her youngest daughters & only gets to see her oldest daughter for 90 minutes every 6 weeks supervised. Please give her the opportunity to see her children & prove that social work are wrong & she is not the person they say she is & reunite her with her kids.",
