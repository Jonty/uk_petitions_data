        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to stop the harsh training methods of some dog trainers\r\n\r\nSome trainers use extremely excessive methods in training their animals. Eg picking their dog up by the ears, throwing to the ground, then hitting it hard.\r\n\r\nForcing it to move from the stay position to do the same thing again.\r\n\r\nThe methods involved can and does cause untold injuries to any dog, who could in retaliation bite the handler, and then be classed as a dangerous dog through no fault of its own.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to help stop the force full, and barbaric training methods and help implement the more acceptable training of positive reinforcement. This has been proved via scientific studies to show that positive reinforcement helps training.",
