        "additional_details": "With the number of rapes and sexual attacks in the Southside of Glasgow accelerating at a stupendous rate I feel that a reminder campaign to all is needed, to highlight that Rape is not ok.  This seems a ridiculous statement to make but something has gone amiss morally as these crimes are being committed on a seemingly regular basis.  Men, women and children should feel safe to live, work and socialise in the Southside of Glasgow.  In conjunction with the Police/City Council/Scottish Parliament, I request a city wide advertising campaign to re-state the severe punishment that comes with committing these crimes and a helpline for those affected.  If we make a stand then those few who are terrorising the Southside will surely be caught, reprimanded and punished accordingly.  We need to send out a clear message of Zero Tolerance.",
