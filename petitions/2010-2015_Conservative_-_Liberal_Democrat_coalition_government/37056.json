        "additional_details": "The Hanbury exchange is extremely old, and as such only provides ASDL internet, which means that those living in the community are receiving upload and download speeds of less than 1mbps compare that to neighbouring Bromsgrove and Redditch that experience fibre optic broadband at around 40mpbs, that is 40 times faster than a house 3 miles away in Hanbury. Home and business owners pay BT for broadband internet but can we really call these speeds experienced as being broadband? Surely these are dial up speeds? To put it in to context, to download a film in Hanbury takes 9 hours in areas with fibre optic broadband this is vastly reduced to 20- 30 minutes. Please sign this petition to get BT to upgrade the exchange so that all homes and businesses in the area can be provided with what they pay for and in turn encourage rural businesses.",
