        "additional_details": "The coalition government are releasing pressure on the finances of lower paid workers by increasing the threshold in which people start to pay tax to \u00a310,000. There has also been tax cuts for the incredibly rich; by eradicating the 50p tax. The middle class and traditional families are becoming ever more squeezed, so it is only right and proper, that the figure when the 40p tax rate is applied should increase from \u00a341, 451.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to increase the amount a person can earn before the 40p tax rate is applied to their income!",
