        "additional_details": "After the outcome of the Hillsborough enquiry, it is clear that South Yorkshire Police was during the 80's completely unscrutinised, which led to a number of miscarriages of justice including during the Miners strike and at Hillsborough but also every day on the streets of South Yorkshire. Due to the disgust and horror that this organisation will forever be associated with due to the conduct of it's leaders, and members at all levels of the organisation, we wish it to be disbanded and it's name forever removed from the public life of the United Kingdom in disgrace.",
