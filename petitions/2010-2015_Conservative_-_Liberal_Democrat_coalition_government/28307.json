        "additional_details": "After viewing an on-line auction yesterday I was shocked to see the amount of Nazi memorabilia available to buy by the general public and also the value or estimates that such items attracted. Whenever I see an item bearing a swastika I feel deeply shocked and feel such items might also be offensive to those who lost loved ones in World War 2. I also feel profiting from the sale or purchase of such items shows great disrespect to those that fought in the war and encourages a modern day spread of the evil regime. Such items should only be available for viewing at museums to teach people about the mistakes of the past and not be available for people to collect on an individual basis.",
