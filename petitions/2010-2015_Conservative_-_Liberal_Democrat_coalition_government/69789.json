        "additional_details": "During the Scottish independence referendum, the leaders of main United Kingdom political parties pledged further devolved powers for the Scottish Parliament. This petition calls for these to be defined and a timescale to be outlined for their implementation.\r\n\r\nAll four nations of the United Kingdom should be on an equal footing so we call for the creation of a separate English Parliament to deal with English only matters. Consultation among English MPs (& with electorate where possible) as to location and voting system to be implemented. We also call for England, Wales & Northern Ireland to have the same devolved powers as will be awarded to Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament at Westminster to only deal with matters that apply to all UK nations & all elected members to retain equal voting rights so as not to undermine the democratic legitimacy of the UK Parliament.
