George Orwell gave us a warning about this sort of thing. It is totally against the traditions and spirit of democracy to let a politician broadcast his own voice repeatedly over the transport network -  whilst this practice may be commonplace in many dictatorships it has absolutely no place here.  Lets tell our ELECTED representatives in the house of COMMONS that we, as Londoners, will not be treated like sheep or cattle in the brave new world. Ask the house to debate and if necessary pass legislation to ban the Mayor of London from broadcasting his/her own voice at train stations and in other places of public gathering. ",
