        "additional_details": "Planning Permission has been put forward for 4 X 130m High Wind Turbines- that will dwarf the village of Gnosall  near Newport Shropshire This must never be allowed anywhere in the UK. These turbines are bigger than Big Ben, cost a fortune to buy and maintain, to say nothing of the subsidy paid to the landowner. They interfere with military radar,are an eyesore and  environmentally damaging. No plans should ever be allowed for Turbines that reach extreme heights like these . We have many villages around the countryside who are presently suffering the same problems. These inefficient and costly monstrosities  should never be approved. Say NO  to the Planning departments now.  Please sign this petition asap . Thank you   ",
