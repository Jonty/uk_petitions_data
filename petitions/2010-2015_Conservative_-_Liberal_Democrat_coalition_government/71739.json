This would give young people a better opportunity to take part in politics and as it filtered through the system, the first students of the subject would prospectively be more active in politics as adults.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the subject should be tailored to educating the students in modern day politics and the workings of the system, which in turn will hopefully encourage them to get involved. This then will give citizens by voting age some  political knowledge which a majority says lack of deters them from voting.  ",
