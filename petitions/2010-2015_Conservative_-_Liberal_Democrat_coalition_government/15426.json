        "additional_details": "Legislation should be changed to protect members of the public from full frontal nudity when going about their daily business.\r\n\r\nNaturists are currently protected by Sexual Offenses Act 2003 Section 66, and are therefore usually discrete, practicing nudity where others would expect it. Naturists who intentionally display their genitals in public places have been arrested and consequently charged with Indecent Exposure.\r\n\r\nWe believe that events which encourage full frontal nudity in public places should be illegal, and anyone who exposes their genitals in a public highway, shopping centre, within sight of a school, or areas accessible by the general community, should be arrested and charged with Indecent Exposure.\r\n\r\nThis revised legislation would include \"The Naked Bike Ride\" and other events where participants expose genitalia  in spaces used by the general public.",
