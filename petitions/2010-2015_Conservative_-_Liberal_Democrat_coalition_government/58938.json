        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nFor thirty years there has been no celebration at Stonehenge that includes live amplified music and camping facilities. The petitioners feel that an integral part of British culture has thus been lost and that the right to congregate, camp and listen to amplified music should be restored in the Barton Stacey area \u00a0on the 20th,\u00a021st and 22nd of June 2014\u00a0.The government should supply drinking water, camping space, sanitation and protection for all attendees. This would act as an excellent compromise between conservation of the site and its continued use. We urge the Government to reinstitute the annual solstice celebration and allow one of the deepest traditions in British cultural history to flourish",
