        "additional_details": "It has come to light that a couple of the Digital Spy Forums members have been unfairly been banned from the Digital Spy Forums. Their usernames are spotify95 and pinkteddyx64. Long story short, they both post some quite interesting threads and replies to threads, but when a lot of the other forum members criticize their threads and replies to threads in a very negative sort of way, they usually get away with it, with Spotify95 and Pinkteddyx64 being the members to receive the unfair bans.\r\n\r\nNow, I implore the Minister to get involved in this case and put it to the owners of the Digital Spy Forums that these members are harmless in comparison to the vast majority of other Digital Spy forum members.",
