He will NOT now give the U K a vote on the E U in/out.\r\nThe E U is nothing more than a ponzi scam, countries join the E U, pay money in to it, the E U spends that money, then they ask other countries to join, they pay money in to the E U, and now countries are running out of money. There system of \"one size fits all\", is not working, and until the whole world is in this system, it will never work.We cannot afford to keep paying money in to a business that will never thrive, so, Mr Cameron, give the UK a choice NOW.",
