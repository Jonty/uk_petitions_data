        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that Sport England's recent allocation of \u00a36.75million of funding for basketball in England up until 2017 is insufficient and should be greatly increased. By comparison, the sport of netball is set to receive \u00a325.3million. We believe this is grossly unfair to the sport of basketball, not least given Sport England's own participation figures for Oct 2010- Oct 2011, which show that basketball (151,100 active weekly participants) has 20 000 more weekly participants than netball (131 700).",
