When we take into account the job that the Government is asking these brave men and women to peform it is frankly quite sickening the mickey mouse wages that they receive. I would also like to see the introduction of a Military card of some sort that would allow all serving personnel certain benefits such as, free travel and discounts on insurance premiums.",
