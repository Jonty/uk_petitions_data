Therefore, we the below insist that each time they do, they have behind them an advertising board showing the logos and names of their contributors. In the case that a contributor is an individuals as opposed to a corporation, then if that individual is invested in or has links to another organisation, then that brand logo should be used.\r\n\r\nWe think it is only fair to not only show who the contributors are, but also to reward these corporations with the advertising.
