Why is this same simple technology not used by the police, not only as a means of providing evidence in court, but also as a means of assuring that police can and do perform their duties as allowed by law, both to allow them to use their powers to the full and appropriate extent, but also in cases where their use of such powers are brought into question, to provide evidence to support or refute such claims, where appropriate.",
