        "additional_details": "We as the parents, families and friends of the children of Helmshore Primary School object to the removal of the perimeter fence enclosing the school's field. We believe the \"Helmshore Community Action Group\" hasn't acted in the best interests of the pupil's safety and wellbeing by insisting three footpaths be put across the school field therefore opening it back up. We believe that the law needs to be changed so that public right of ways are not allowed on school fields which is private land and belongs to the school and the children within. We are concerned about the safeguarding issues this will cause and want immediate action to halt the removal of the fences until a full and fair review can be held with all parties represented.",
