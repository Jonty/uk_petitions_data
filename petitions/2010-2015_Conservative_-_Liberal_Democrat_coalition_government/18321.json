        "additional_details": "Sex and relationships education in the UK is still not good enough. Schools don\u2019t have the support or tools to help children and young people develop safe, healthy relationships and research shows young people often leave school vulnerable and ill prepared to navigate their way through relationships.\r\n\r\nBeing able to make good decisions about relationships and sex is as important to young people\u2019s future wellbeing as any other subject. Young people deserve honest, useful information about modern sex and relationships.\r\n\r\nThis would include:\r\n\r\n1) Giving young people a chance to speak up about what they need to know and understand.\r\n2) Lessons taught by well trained professionals who are confident about the subject.\r\n3) Focussing as much on relationships, consent, human sexuality and the emotional side of growing up as on the biology of reproduction.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to listen to young people and insist that ALL schools deliver an SRE curriculum fit for the 21st century.",
