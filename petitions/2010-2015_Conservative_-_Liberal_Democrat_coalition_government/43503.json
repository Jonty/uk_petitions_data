I believe, therefore, that it would be a good idea to require all persons in the more sensitive fields of work to disclose whether they are or are not a freemason.\r\n\r\nRequiring all clubs to list their members would help in this as a masonic lodge can be deemed to be a club. Therefore I think the government should require this too.",
