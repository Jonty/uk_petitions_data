        "additional_details": "A previous Tory government gained considerable kudos from selling off council housing, to the great advantage of many ordinary working class families. However the money collected from these sales was wasted and a great opportunity missed in the process. I would like to see the re-establishing of council built/owned properties. Creating an environment that offers affordable property too young families that aren't able to get onto the property ladder or afford private accommodation. At present too many young adults have to stay at home with their parents because they cannot afford to leave home and establish their own homes independently. Bring back council housing. By all means sell the property off to deserving residents and then use the money to build more. You know it makes sense!",
