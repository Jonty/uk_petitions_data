        "additional_details": "I recently tried to book hospital transport but was told that as I did not require oxygen then I no longer qualified for transport as a wheelchair user and should now arrange this myself.\r\nI would never dream of booking hospital transport for routine appointments but when a cardiologists secretary or GP surgery are unable to book transport for you it now appears that individuals we no longer exist where cut backs are concerned and that this situation will only get worse. When you are recovering or have been given news you did not expect the last thing that you require is assistance from members of the public instead of the expertise of trained staff. ACTION REQUIRED Rethink of eligibility of hospital transport for hospital procedures or admission by GP or 999 ambulance.\r\n",
