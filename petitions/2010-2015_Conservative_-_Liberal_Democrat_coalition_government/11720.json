        "additional_details": "The rioters deserve the punishments.\r\nHowever, why double standards?\r\nThe wealthy bankers have caused much more havoc and in return only got more money in the form of QEs.\r\nMy petition asks the government to identify those fraudsters responsible for the financial crisis with a rigour that takes account of the magnitude of financial crisis as compared to the riots (i.e. much more rigour) and dish out much more severe punishments, eg. seize all the wealth of those behind the financial crisis.\r\nIn short, my petition calls for the same tough approach towards the bankers, without this the government has no moral authority to punish the rioters.",
