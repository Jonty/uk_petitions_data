        "additional_details": "The government should lead the way globally on the issue of population control. It should do this by holding debates in Parliament and possibly by establishing committees or funding research with a view to introducing appropriate policies.\r\n\r\nWorld population is set to reach 7 billion imminently. No matter how creative we become we must accept that resources are finite. New technologies (e.g. biofuels) simply shift the demand from one type of resource to another. Additionally we need to acknowledge that population growth has reached a point where it is no longer an economic driver by consumption of products and services. It is now an economic burden since there is not and increasingly will not be enough work to go around. We can see this, both on a global scale and in our own country.\r\n\r\nIt will take tremendous courage to begin the debate. But we cannot continue to stick our heads in the sand.",
