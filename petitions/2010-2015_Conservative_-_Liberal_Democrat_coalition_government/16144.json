He allowed the appeal (he said they should issue the visa).\r\n\r\nIt is now September and Mathana's visa has not been issued. 06/09/2011 Manthana went the the British Post in Bangkok to make enquiries and was told that they had not yet received the determination.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable that it takes two months for papers to travel between the Home Office and the UK Border Agency posts overseas.",
