        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask that the Government take a serious debate into the house of commons regarding the nature of 'God' as an Absolute Reality. This reality, we believe, does not change, which promotes us to believe that 'God' is a Perfect Vacuum. This theoretical nature of God presupposes a Infinite Continuum in which all things exist as manifestations of 'Non-Existence'! We ask that this debate considers the Theological, Metaphysical, Religious, and Scientific aspects to such debates.",
