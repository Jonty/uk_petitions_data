We can slash the budget to a fraction, just by exposing some of the spend. We should be able to choose to stop handing our money to overseas aid against our will and choose to spend it on our NHS instead. Be able to choose to stop housing, clothing and feeding refugees from every country and spend it on our dental care instead. Be able to choose to stop spending our money on benefits to people who have never contributed and spend it on the very people paying into this country. Be able to choose to stop spending our money on lining the politician\u2019s pockets and spend it on our schools and pensioners instead. We should be able to choose to spend our money reforming the next generation with boot camps instead of cleaning up the carnage and destruction they leave behind them.\r\n",
