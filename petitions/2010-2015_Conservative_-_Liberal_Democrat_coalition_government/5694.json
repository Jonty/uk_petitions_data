        "additional_details": "The power to local councils to set Taxi fares under the Local Government (miscellaneous provisions)Act 1976 means that the Taxi trade is discriminated against by UK law as it is the only UK industry that cannot autonimously set its own prices or profit margins.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system councillors who have no experience of running a Taxi business habitually make decisions regarding the level of charges for Taxis based on their own needs to be re-elected so they are keen not to set fares at levels that might generate public complaints rather than allowing market forces through competition with the mini cab trade allow prices to find their own levels.\r\n\r\nThis legislation is out dated.",
