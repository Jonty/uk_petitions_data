        "additional_details": "A Corporation Tax rate reduction to 18% by 2014 should lead to greater investment in our private sector with the potential that more investment can bring for increased employment, sustainability and growth, not to mention consequential improvements in social and education/skills standards. In the long term, the loss of tax income should therefore be offset by greater income tax receipts, more VAT as people spend more, and lower welfare costs as disadvantaged people gain access to jobs and learning.\r\n\r\n",
