The car is a total write off.\r\n\r\nWe were hit by a foreign driver and as such he has got away with dangerous driving. If we had been hit by an English driver they would have been charged so why not a Foreign driver?\r\n\r\nWe were lucky and came out of the accident with only minor, but very painful injuries. Someone else may not be so lucky.\r\n\r\nYet there was no charge, no fine, no points, no ban, nothing!! Why should foreign drivers be above UK law??\r\n\r\n",
