        "additional_details": "Alan Henning was executed in cold blood by the Islamic state. As a UK citizen I am deeply shocked and upset by this. In the Islamic state video's Alan was forced to appear in, he showed so much courage and bravery and I think that it is only right that we honour he's Bravery. He knew what he was facing and he still showed so much courage and bravery and is exactly the kind of person who makes me proud to be British. He was a kind, compassionate man who only wanted to help those in need, he paid the ultimate price in helping others, lets show this man the respect he deserve's. He without a doubt deserves a medal for bravery! ",
