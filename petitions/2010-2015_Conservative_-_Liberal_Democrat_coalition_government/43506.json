        "additional_details": "I want the Government to ensure Consultants/Doctors are taught how to tell a patient they are going to die.  They need compassion and sensitivity, which in my experience, most lack. They are currently desensitized to this as they deal with so many patients, but everyone counts !!!\r\n My own experience with this will haunt me forever  as both my Mum and Dad were told in such a cruel manner, no thought was taken into consideration about their feelings. They were both treated abruptly  and told to go home to die. I was there for the results and was mortified by their manner. ( 4 different consultants).  How many more people will find themselves in this situation. Some people don't cope with this attitude.\r\nThis needs to change !!!",
