        "additional_details": "My mum was diagnosed with 3 types of cancer in February 2013. Until a cyst burst there were no symptoms. There is now a 50% chance that I, her 17 year old daughter, could possibly have cancer now or in the future. Because I am only 17 I am not yet allowed a cancer screening unless I have multiple symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to make it aware that cancer is an issue in today's society and it is present although may not be spotted. I am starting this petition to make the Department of Health aware that not being able to have cancer screenings is an issue and possible signs of cancer does get dismissed by GP's.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to allow cancer to get noticed in the earliest stage possible.",
