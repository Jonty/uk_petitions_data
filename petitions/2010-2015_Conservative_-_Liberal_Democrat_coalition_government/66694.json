            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nProviding parking for staff is a cost to the NHS organisation.  The direct costs of providing parking include equipment such as barriers, payment machines, and signage, lighting, insurance, security, administration and maintenance.  There are also indirect costs, such as depreciation and loss of income from other uses of the land, which are also relevant.\r\n\r\nMoney spent to provide parking could otherwise be used to provide clinical care to patients, and decisions about charging staff for parking need to be carefully considered in this light.  In addition, charging is a way to manage car parking and ensure it is available to patients and visitors as well as staff.\r\n\r\nCar parking policies cannot be set nationally.  NHS organisations make decisions locally about the provision of car parking to patients, visitors and staff to best meet local requirements.  Organisations should consider the needs of patients, visitors and staff when making these decisions.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.
