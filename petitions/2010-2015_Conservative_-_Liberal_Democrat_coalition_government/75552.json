        "additional_details": "Cabazitaxel is a drug that has been given to men with metastatic prostate cancer when other forms of treatment have stopped being effective.  This drug both improves quality of life and extends the life of many men when no other form of treatment is available.  Men with prostate cancer have fewer treatment options than any other cancers and making it unavailable will have devastating effects on many patients.  Please sign the petition to get this very effective drug re-instated.",
