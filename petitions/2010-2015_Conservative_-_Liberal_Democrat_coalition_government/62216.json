        "additional_details": "Many of the general public choose not to vote for a next candidate for the Prime Minister position. This is not because of the \"political indifference\" as it has been labelled but because the general public believe that the candidates that have been proposed are not suitable to run the country. Instead of ruling out the angry people who \"ruin\" a ballot slip or who are \"politically indifferent\" there should be an option at the bottom of the slip along the lines of \"no suitable candidates\" or \"none of the above\" to truly represent the feelings of the general public rather than ignoring them. It is simply allowing the voice of the people to be heard above the bureaucracy and red tape that stifles the voice of the common man to suit the 1% that run the country, controlling the numbers for their own political agenda",
