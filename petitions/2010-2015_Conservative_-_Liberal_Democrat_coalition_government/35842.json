        "additional_details": "I believe that the UK would be better establishing a national militia of the kind they have in Switzerland. The armed forces should be abolished and replaced by the legal requirement of citizens to recieve military training and weapons as they do in Switzerland. It is also necessary for a moral and peacable nation not to get involved in foreign wars that do not threaten British soil and freedoms. Switzerland has not been in a war for hundreds of years, and they have one of the lowest crime rates and highest quality of life ratings of anywhere in the world, things that are both lacking in the UK",
