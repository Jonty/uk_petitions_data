        "additional_details": "The new bill sets a limit for the amount of carbon dioxide that power stations can produce. This is 450 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt-hour of electricity. Compare it to the 50 grams which the Committee on Climate Change says should be the average produced by power stations in this country by the end of the 2020s, if the government is to meet its 2050 target.\r\nThe government is making it easier to build gas power stations at the expense of the climate. Also coal fired power stations can also be built producing even more CO2 if they promise to build a carbon capture scheme at some point in the future. Note not even at the same time as they build the power station.\r\nThe Goverment must lower the EPS and make building of new stations include carbon capture/storage at time of building the power station.",
