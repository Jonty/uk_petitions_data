        "additional_details": "The current Financial Climate has made the lives of Britons less enjoyable, and so it is suggested here, that the Government should fund a feature length film of 'Itchy & Scratchy', famed from the 'Simpsons' Cartoon. This type of film will provide light relief from the everyday 'humdrum' of the financially frugal lifestyles that exist today. I also believe that the life lessons learned from the story lines within 'Itchy and Scratchy' cartoons could contribute to world peace.",
