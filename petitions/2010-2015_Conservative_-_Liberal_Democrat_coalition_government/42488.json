        "additional_details": "The Countryside and Wildlife Act 1981 legislation has to be changed because when an Order Making Authority makes changes to the Definitive Map to create a new public footpath, why should it go right across some poor person\u2019s front garden as that is what\u2019s happened to me. The law must be changed to allow the land owner the \u201cRight\u201d to say where he or she would like it to go, so that it will have the LEAST affect on the land owner and their right to live a Private Life. It is not only common sense but it would reduce theft, vandalism and unsocial behavior that is caused by having a public footpath right across someone\u2019s front garden.\r\nPlease support my plight as I am one of the people who have to put up with people wandering through my front garden at all hours.\r\nPlease give my suggestion your support and thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n",
