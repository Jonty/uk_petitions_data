        "additional_details": "I believe that the Government should establish a 1,000 member jury consisting of randomly selected British citizens. This jury wouldmake decisions upon the futures of the instituational workings of financial regulation, the mass media, the relationships between the branches of government and the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of sortition, which is the most democratic political process possible. It eliminates vested interests and is immune to the actions of lobbyists which rely upon personal connections to those in power. Only a jury constructed along these lines is capable of deciding upon an equitable series of chacks and balances to prevent the abuse of wealth and power. The large number is necessary because with sortition the chance of representativeness increases with size.",
