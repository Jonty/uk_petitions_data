        "additional_details": "This stunning peice of natural beauty has lost it's charm & is endangering natural wildlife in Humberstone Village.\r\nThis communal pond located on Vicarage Lane across from Monks Rest Gardens has lost at least 2 meters of water, endangering the local wildlife who enhabit it,\r\nFor years the Humberstone Community Garden has been home to Frogs, Newts & most importantly, the Gallinula Chloropus, also known as Moorhen's.\r\nFor years these beautiful birds have enhabited our pond & build they're nests under the decking located next to it,\r\nMy fear is that the Moorhen's normally seen during the spring until late autumn are going to be unable to lay their eggs safely the way they have for years if the loss of water continues.\r\nI myself used to spend most of my summers around the pond & as a new parent was hoping to introduce my son to this peaceful area when he gets older to share some of the great memories I once had.\r\nPlease help save the Gallinula chloropus & a part of Humberstone history.",
