        "additional_details": "This is simple.\r\n\r\nTickets go on sale to the public and many people buy them in bulk and go on resale websites and put them on there for more than double the price.\r\nThis then means that genuine fans can't go because they cannot afford to pay such astonishing prices people have put them on there for.\r\n\r\nAt the moment it is illegal to resell football tickets (under section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994) unless the resale is authorised by the organiser of the match.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for the government to put a stop to the reselling of all tickets for a profit and ban websites for doing it too.",
