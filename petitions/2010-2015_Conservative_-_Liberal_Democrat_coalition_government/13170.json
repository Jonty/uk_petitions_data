        "additional_details": "The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 is intended to protect consumers from unfair clauses and disclaimers in contracts. However, the Act does not apply to insurance companies. This means that insurance companies are free to charge as much as they like, but deliver as little as they like, and for any reason they like. This is not in the public interest and I ask the Government to amend  the Act so that insurance companies are no longer exempt from it.",
