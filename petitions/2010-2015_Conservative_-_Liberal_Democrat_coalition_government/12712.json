It would support the drive to create a climate that empowers local people and communities and take power away from the politicians and give it to the people, i.e. the Big Society.\r\n2. It would reduce the direct funding cost to the taxpayer.\r\n3. It would change the public's perception that parking charges and fines are just a cash cow for the councils.",
