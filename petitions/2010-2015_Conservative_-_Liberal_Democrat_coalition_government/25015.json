        "additional_details": "I would like the goverment to reconsider the extension to age 66 yrs in the state pension age. The government should take the action to reinstate the retirement age to 65 yrs. There should be more time to allow people to make plans for the future by giving at least 20 years notice of this change. Many people have made retirment plans in their 30's who are now in there late fifties and have only been given noice just recently that they will have to wait another year for a state pension. This will cost the average person around \u00a34,000. It is not fair when they have sometimes paid extra lump sums in order to make sure that the correct pension is recieved. ",
