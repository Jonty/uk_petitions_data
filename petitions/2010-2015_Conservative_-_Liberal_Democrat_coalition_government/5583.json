        "additional_details": "Prior to 2011, student fees were much lower; new students will find it harder to pay off these fees and this is something we need to act upon. Many of the people in government today had free university, and many well-known public figures and celebrities would bring back free university if they could. In the current economic climate, it is understandable why MPs have raised the student fees; but don't let the mistakes of men today be taken out on the future students of tomorrow. Please sign so a referendum can be discussed in parliament in order to lower student fees or abolish them altogether. ",
