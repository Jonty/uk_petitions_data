        "additional_details": "We live in a country with a great history of comedy and satire, but we hamper the creation of topical satire on television with outdated and over-sensitive laws forbidding the use of footage from parliament or royal events for satire (audio or video is allowed, but not both).\r\n\r\nThis is ludicrous, especially since the footage can be used for satire in other countries. Do we really believe that British institutions like these are so weak they will be damaged by comedy?\r\n\r\nPlease could parliament take the time to reconsider this law and give some of our talented comedians the same freedoms other countries have.",
