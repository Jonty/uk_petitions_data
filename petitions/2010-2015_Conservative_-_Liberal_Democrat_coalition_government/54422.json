Having listened to John Kerry this evening I am embarressed to be British.  David Cameron should not be berated for his actions but be commended; the members of Parliament who voted against should hang their heads in shame!\r\nI want the people of Britain to support their Prime Minister and I want the MPs to reconvene and vote for action against Syria's govenrment.",
