        "additional_details": "This e-petition is about how the price of car insurance has risen in the recent. The price of car insurance isn't only expensive for young, first time drivers but is also expensive for experienced for drivers. The price of car insurance is approximatley rising by 77p every day. That's around \u00a323 per month which is getting more expensive every year or possibly every month. Finally I have recently researched the price of cars for young drivers such as myself and the price for the so called cheapest cars is coming up at around \u00a32500 to \u00a35000. These prices are completely un-affordable for young drivers. ",
