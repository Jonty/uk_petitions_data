        "additional_details": "We are pleased that the 2010 General Election included 3TV Debates and feel that this enriches our Democracy. However to prevent bias it is important that strict rules for participation are applied. Inclusion of anyone and everyone at a debate does not seem a good way forward, nor is it fair to say how many parties should attend. An obvious solution to this, is to track the polls: If a party is polling an average of 10% or more ofthe national vote for atleast a 6month period they should be given a place in the 3 debates. It might also be worth having a 4th debate for those that gain over 5% of the vote (accross the region their party stands - be that the whole UK or a devolved nation for example), This solution neither gives a leg up for small parties, nor over represents larger parties: It is more proportional, reducing the effect of unintended media biases.",
