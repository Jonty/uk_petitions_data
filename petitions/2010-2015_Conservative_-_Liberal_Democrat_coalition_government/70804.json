I want it to be illegal for the government to ban videogames, i want it to be so that the stores and shops can chose if they want to put it on their shelves. I want Manhunt 2 to be unbanned and uncensored, and all the other games to be unbanned and uncensored. Games dont kill people, people do. Sign this petition if you want to give power to the people. Let the people decide for themselves. Do the right thing. Sign this petition for the people of the UK.",
