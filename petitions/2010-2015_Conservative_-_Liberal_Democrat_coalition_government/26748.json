        "additional_details": "Cervical screen is massively important as it can STOP cervical cancer from developing. It is one of the few cancers that is preventable because pre cancerous cell changes can be picked up before they have a chance to develop into cancer. The age that screening starts and finishes varies between the different countries of the UK. Currently in SCOTLAND and WALES, women from the age of 20 are screened. Yet in ENGLAND the screening age starts at 25! According to Cancer Research UK \"The screening programme in England now starts at 25 because cervical cancer is very rare before this age.\" It is believed to be rare but not an IMPOSSIBILITY! The point of this petition is to ask the government to change the starting age from 25 back to 20. ",
