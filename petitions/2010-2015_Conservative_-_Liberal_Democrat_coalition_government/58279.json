        "additional_details": "As many people are aware, the teen suicide rate has risen dramatically over the past few years, the main reason being, as a result of bullying.\r\n\r\nI believe that children in schools should receive a one to one chat with a counselor trained in bullying and its effects.\r\n\r\nAll children should have someone to talk to that they trust, and by building this trust with a competent person they are more willing to share their feelings and feel they have someone to talk to.\r\n\r\nBy meeting with a counselor we have more awareness of why people bully and can discuss this with the bullies themselves which would reduce the number of bullies in schools.\r\n\r\nThis person can work with the children to cut out bullying and help the people who need it, to develop skills to express themselves instead of harming themselves and taking their lives, by helping them realise, there is always someone who will listen.",
