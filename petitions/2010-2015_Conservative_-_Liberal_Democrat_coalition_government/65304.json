Recent cases involving the murders of two young men in separate incidents in Essex in 2012 demonstrate this. Had the deterrent and punishment roles of prison been stronger, and fulfilled, the two victims may still be alive (both culprits were on licence at the time of the attacks). The Justice Ministry must review the sentencing guidelines urgently.",
