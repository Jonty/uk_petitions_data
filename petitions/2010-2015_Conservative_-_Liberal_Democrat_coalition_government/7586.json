Forget the Human Rights nonsense - what about the Human Rights of all those people who had to flee their homes and business as fire raged all around them????  They are left with nothing!\r\n\r\nEnough is enough.  Bring back law and order for the decent hard-working tax-paying people that are the back-bone of this Country. Enough pandering to these lazy, want-it-all now, scumbags.  Read Facebook - listen to what the tax-paying people of Great Britain want. Do whatever it takes, water cannons, rubber bullets, the Army - whatever it takes to bring law, order and civilisation back to the streets of Britain - you the Government OWE IT TO US LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS!",
