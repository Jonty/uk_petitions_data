        "additional_details": "I have just been informed of further losses of futile lives wasted in the current struggle against afghaniststani taliban with the sad loss of of 6  serving officers from the yorkshire and lancashire regiments!  as a citizen i have yet to be convinced of the benefit that is bwing fought for by our and foreign governments by our much loved and maligned, yet brave youths.  Our country has many pressing issues closer to its shores that need redress  and that following the recent devastating loss of life we as a country have the rigt to state enough is enough and bring our boys and girls home from the front line, surely we can gainfully spend the tax payers monies more effectivley. I for one would prefer to start a dialogue with our opposition rather than loose one more drop of british / any countries blood in vain.. or should that be vein ! ",
