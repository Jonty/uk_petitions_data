        "additional_details": "The integrity of football in this country has been destroyed in this country by the disgraceful antics of Sir Alex Ferguson.\r\n\r\nSince being in charge of Manchester United he has continually argued with and harrased referees and the FA.\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous occasions when referees have spent months sometimes years not officiating a Manchester United game after criticism from Sir Alex. When they do eventually get another chance to referee them they are incredibly biased towards Manchester United giving debatable decisions in their favour..\r\n\r\nOther referees who avoid criticism (because of their blatant bias towards Manchester United) continue to referee far more than their share of Manchester games.\r\n\r\nAll this has influenced too many games and ultimately too many trophies over the years.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to see Manchester United to be stripped of all honours since Sir Alex Ferguson became manager of Manchester United.
