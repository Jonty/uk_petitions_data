When they do need to use it they're greeted by staff that have little or no interest in supporting them. Removing National Insurance and making it a legal requirement for all members of the public to have adequate health insurance will allow advances in medical science to increase at unseen rates and make sure that you receive the level of care that you're paying for.",
