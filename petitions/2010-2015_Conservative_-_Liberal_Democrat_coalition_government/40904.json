        "additional_details": "The Cabinet Office recently announced it is undertaking the sell off of a number of State owned buildings.\r\n\r\nAdmiralty Arch is now to become a hotel. This has its merits as it is an unused almost derelict building which is need of refurbishment.\r\n\r\nThe sell of a lease is a good deal not just for the taxpayer but will help make more of the building use.\r\n\r\nBut, we the petitioners call on the Cabinet Office and its Ministers, not to remove the building from society completely.\r\n\r\nIt can still remain used in formal occasions, such as when the Royal Carriage processes under it during important state events, and the main features should not be tampered with. The building should not be knocked about or have important features removed.\r\n\r\nAdmiralty Arch must remain a part of important events and a bastion of Victorian history.  ",
