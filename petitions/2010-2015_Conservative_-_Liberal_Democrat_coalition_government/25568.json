It is time to stop the secrecy of the courts and the gagging of parents. We have a right to keep our children and the right not to live in fear of corrupt social workers. I want the government to take into account the serious concerns that the public have about the corruptness that surrounds these cases and to make the cases that end up in court to become public, which is to not be held behind closed doors. If a criminal can have an open trial then parents and children should have the same equal right. Our human rights are being severely breached and its time this was stopped.",
