        "action": "Abandon the Government's Arbitrary Non-EU Immigration Cap",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the attempts by the Coalition government to restrict non-EU immigration by way of a cap has no evidential basis and that it should be removed. Contrary to the aims of its advocates, the cap harms the UK economy and with it the job prospects of UK citizens by discouraging enterprise and foreign investment.\r\n\r\nGiven that the Coalition government recognises in its agreement that immigration has \"enriched our culture and strengthened our economy\" it should not pander to populist and protectionist measures which allow our labour market to stagnate and our skills-base to insulate itself from modernisation.\r\n\r\nWe consider that the existing points system does not benefit from an arbitrary cap on non-EU immigration. Removing the cap will send out two important messages. Firstly it will show that Britain is open for business. Secondly it will make us a more tolerant and culturally enriched society.",
