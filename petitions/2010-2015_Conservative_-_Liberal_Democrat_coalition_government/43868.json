        "additional_details": "At the last election the Conservatives promised that the threshhold for inheritance tax would rise to \u00a31,000,000 because ordinary homes of hard working families were now caught within this tax. Inheritance tax was not meant for someone whose only assest was a home bought and lived in continously by the same family/person for fifty years and hence increased in value.  This tax is currently very unfair to ordinary working people and the Tories have broken their promise.\r\n\r\nPlease raise the inheritance threshhold NOW.\r\nPoliticians need to keep promises otherwise democracy will be the loser as people will lose faith in the process of voting and for what they are voting.  Politicians must mean what they say not just say popular things at elections in order to gain power.",
