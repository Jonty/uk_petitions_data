        "additional_details": "Please sign the petition to Ban the use and sale of Chinese lanterns in the UK.\r\n\r\nChinese Lanterns are paper decorations, which can float up to a mile into the air when they are lit, are often constructed with metal wire.\r\n\r\nWhy Ban them?\r\n1)If they land still lit they can cause forest fires, house fires and can be especially damaging to farms and live stock, where extremely flammable forage is stored.\r\n2) They will often fail and come down early whilst the lantern is still burning.\r\n3) They are considered extremely dangerous by most of the UK fire services.\r\n4) The RNLI has reported a large increase in the number of call-outs after the lights from lanterns were mistaken for distress flares.\r\n5) Austria and Germany have banned the lanterns but there are no restrictions in force in Britain.\r\n6) The Wire used in the frame of the lanterns can end up in fields grazed by animals or cut for forage. Many cows have been reported to have died as a result of eating the wire. ",
