But all other\r\nBritish expats, including English teachers at schools other than the British Council, lose the\r\nright to vote after 15 years abroad. Apart from expats, the only other British citizens who do\r\nnot enjoy the right to vote are children, individuals who suffer from mental illnesses such\r\nthat they are confined within mental institutions, and criminals whilst imprisoned.\r\n\r\nMost British citizens living abroad still maintain an interest in the way things are run and would like a chance to voice these concerns. I believe we deserve that.",
