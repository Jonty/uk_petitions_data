        "additional_details": "The 2011 Fixed Term Parliament Act set the length of a parliament for a UK Government in Westminster, and for all future UK Governments, at no more and no less than 5 years. The only provisions for a parliament to run to less than 5 years and a General Election called being either that the House of Commons passes a No Confidence Motion in the Government, or the Commons votes for an early General Election by a majority of at least two-thirds of its total membership.\r\n\r\nAn amendment to the Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011 should be passed, as soon as possible, which reduces the parliamentary term to four years and means that the next General Election is held on the first Thursday in May of 2014. Or, if no action cannot, or is not, taken in this parliament, the same legislation should be committed to by all UK political parties and included in their next General Election manifesto in 2015, and then enacted by the next Government.",
