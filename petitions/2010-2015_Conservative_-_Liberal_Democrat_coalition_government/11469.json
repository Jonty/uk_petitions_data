Place them in a strict and tough regime where they will learn respect and discipline, all the things their parents didn\u2019t teach them to become an educated respectful member of society.\r\nMost of our teachers do not have the tools to deal with such children so get them out of main stream education now and allow teachers to do their jobs.\r\n",
