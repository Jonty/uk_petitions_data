They should have to do work in the community cleaning, helping in schools, helping in churches etc. This way people are earning there money and gaining experiance, plus they also get references from this work for any employment they go after. This also shows potential employees that they are looking and wanting to work. It also helps get people into work routines. This will root out the people that actually want to work and the ones who just want free money.",
