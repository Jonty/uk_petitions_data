Countless lives have been lost due to this organization\u2019s terrorist acts- no more. Let's call this 'party' what it really is, this is not a political party but a \u201cterrorist organization\u201d. We cannot let them spread more hate and fear; we cannot let them take countless more innocent lives.\r\nPlease sign this petition to declare BLA (Baluchistan Liberation Army) a terrorist organisation. We need as many people as possible to sign this so we can submit this to the House of Commons, UK.\r\n\r\n",
