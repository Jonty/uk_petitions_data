        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, urge the Goverment to reconsider the the Army cuts announced this week to cut the numbers by 20000 either by mergers or disbanding old, historical Regiments of the line.\r\nAlong with the cuts already made, HMS Ark Royal, the Harrier Fleet etc and now these latest cuts will leave the country in such a weakened state similar to the years leading up to WW2 when this country simply did not have the ability to operate in a long, drawn operation and expected to protect the British Isles. The forces should be bolstered not weakened and use the Euro Bale outs to fund these increases!!!",
