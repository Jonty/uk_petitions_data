Hong Kong has property taxes that prevent foreign investment which means investors target cheap London. Should we not have a similar policy?\r\n\r\nLet this government introduce a 100-200% purchase tax on all, non EU investors in residential property.\r\n\r\nPerhaps then our two daughters, one who works for Shelter and the other who is a Metrpolitan Police Officer could afford to buy somewhere to live.",
