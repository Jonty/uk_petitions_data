        "additional_details": "We should convert ex-Military units - the remoter the better, into hard labour units. The benefit of these sites is they already fulfil many of the requirements for prisons: remoteness; security; away from prying eyes; easily defended; No Mobile Phones; Difficult for (undesirable) visitors to get to; No internet; No TV or Satellite. We recognise that this will also require changes to our Court sentencing policies, particularly around the \u201crights\u201d of offenders to be near their families and not to create further hardship on their families. But the time has come for a reality check. The rights and values of the mass of the UK population, in particular the victims, must outweigh those of the criminal and their families. If we are prepared to send our troops on missions that will keep them thousands of miles from home for many months without seeing their families then criminals can be treated the same.",
