        "additional_details": "The current national anthem 'God Save the Queen' needs to be updated to better reflect Britain today. Firstly, the reference to a god does not make the song inclusive to all citizens, primarily those who identify as having no religion or no belief in a god, and hence is not suitable as a song to represent the people of the country. Secondly, the song is predominantly about one person i.e. the king or queen. The national anthem should represent the whole country and not sing the praises of one person. While the monarchy is a part of British history, it is not all inclusive of it. The new anthem needs to better represent the country and its people as a whole.",
