        "additional_details": "The current solar energy grant system requires considerable capitol outlay, which is beyond the average homeowner. It is, however, proving extremely lucrative for businesses to take advantage of the scheme and offer the homeowner little return. The existing system should be scrapped and replaced with a simple loan that covers the full cost of installation, which repaid by the systems power generation and feed to the national grid over 20~25 years. The homeowner will significantly benefit from this type of loan, as will the environment.",
