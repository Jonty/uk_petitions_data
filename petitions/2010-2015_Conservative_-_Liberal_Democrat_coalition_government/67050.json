        "additional_details": "Cannabis/skunk use is endemic in the streets and parks of London and the minority are disrupting the quality of life for the majority.\r\n\r\nAlmost every time I go to a public park or walk down a London street I have to endure Cannabis smoke within close proximity.\r\n\r\nI believe that the anti-social effects of drug use, criminal, or potentially legal in the future, need to be reviewed and legislated against by implementing the following either way offences to prohibit Cannabis use:\r\n\r\n- in all public parks.\r\n- on public or private premises within the close proximity of a child.\r\n- on private property when it's use is less than 15 metres from the boundary of an adjacent residential property.\r\n- or the promotion of Cannabis within a one mile radius of a school.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not about the decriminalization of controlled drugs, it is about legislating to promote responsibility from those who choose to use controlled drugs legally or illegally.",
