Without the much-needed lifetime studies across the range of pedigree dog breeds the microchip should be strictly voluntary. No accurate predictor of safety exists at the moment. After all pedigree dogs, closely bred for type, may display varying resistance to cancer. That is why they currently use pedigree dogs in genetic studies of cancer.\r\n\r\nThe truth is we don\u2019t have exact figures on microchip safety and we do have reason to doubt that safety and the intents of those selling it to us as fact:\r\n\r\nCancer Links\r\nSpinal cord injuries\r\nMicrochip Implant Migration\r\nDamage to dogs during play\r\nPoor quality training for non-Veterinary Implanters\r\nPossbile MRI incompatibility\r\nLow frequency RFID EMF problems\r\nSoft tissue sarcoma",
