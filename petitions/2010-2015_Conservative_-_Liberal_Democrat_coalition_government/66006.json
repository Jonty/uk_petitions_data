        "additional_details": "Most sensible people  reuse their plastic shopping bags as bin liners.\r\nForcing super markets to charge for bags will cost them in lost business, inconvenience customers and\r\nserve to add yet another cost to the household shopping bill, either by paying for carrier bags or having to buy bin liners to hygienically dispose of kitchen waste .\r\nIt makes absolutely no sense to replace one plastic bag for another.\r\nSmall and medium sized businesses, with 500 employees or fewer, will be exempt from charging.\r\n\r\nThis is the same ill thought out legislation as the ridiculous fish discard policy of throwing away already dead fish in the name of conservation.\r\n\r\nHow long will it be before we see the same call to place a levy on plastic bin liners?\r\nPlease sign this petition to stop this madness.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to reconsider this unfair and unwanted levy on plastic bags for no real environmental gain.\r\n\r\n",
