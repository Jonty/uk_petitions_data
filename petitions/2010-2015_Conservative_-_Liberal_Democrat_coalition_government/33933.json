        "additional_details": "Millions of people in the South-West, South & Mid-Wales, and the West Midlands can only fly beyond Europe via European hubs or via the congested ground & airport infrastructure of the South-East. We call on HMG to facilitate the construction of a new airport in the Severn Valley between Bristol & Worcester, capable of accommodating long-haul passenger & cargo aircraft, and connected to the existing road and rail infrastructure. It would provide direct air links to the rest of the world, boosting travel, trade, tourism and economic development. In addition, it would help to reduce the pressure on airport capacity in the South-East.",
