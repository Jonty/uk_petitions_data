        "additional_details": "I want a policy to be introduced that makes all students obtain a minimum standard before being allowed to leave school/training. This would either be a small number of GCSE's (A-C) or doing an apprenticeship or work program. People can choose to leave school or training without it however then not eligable for benefits until it is complete. This will help solve NEETs, encourage people to work hard in school, give the UK a better qualified work force encouraging businesses to come here, help to change a benefits culture into a work culture and reduce the number of young people with nothing better to do than cause annoyance and commit crime.",
