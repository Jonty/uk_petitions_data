They will have to look after themselves on there respected island. The state will give them a starter pack of a tent and one weeks rations. After that they will have to survive on their own initiative and hunting skills. This will ensure they learn how to survive in a social environment of their own making and it will reduce the cost of looking after the prisoners for the state. It will also be a huge deterrent for future potential offenders.",
