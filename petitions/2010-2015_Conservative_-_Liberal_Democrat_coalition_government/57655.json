Every time they are climbed the bird and insect life is disturbed; it  is an ecco system that we need to nourish and respect.\r\nChildren need to be taught this in school so they understand why they should not damage them breaking branches. Grow conkers instead of just smashing them , plant trees watch them grow take pride in their own surroundings.\r\nThey can learn to climb on climbing walls and be properly supervised.\r\n",
