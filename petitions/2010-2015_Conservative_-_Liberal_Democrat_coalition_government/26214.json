        "additional_details": "This debate would be undertaken with a view to the formation of a government run supplier for all the essential utilities of both residential and business customers, including but not limited to, water, gas and electricity, with the possible future provision of fuel for vehicles and telecommunications.\r\n\r\nThe supply would be made at a fixed percentage above cost set at a limit deemed acceptable by a panel which should be composed of more than 50% by parties without a vested interest in the private energy supply sector. Any profits received can be added to the tax revenue system and allocated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis would serve to bring a more ethical competition pressure to the current utility supply companies but not require the nationalisation of the utility supply companies at the present time.",
