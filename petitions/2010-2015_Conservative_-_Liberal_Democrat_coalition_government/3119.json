        "additional_details": "Although it is generally agreed that the sale of copyrighted materials and intellectual property without the owner\u2019s consent should be outlawed, the right of an individual to share media for no financial gain should be protected in law.\r\n\r\nSociety has already set the precedent that it wants things for free. It will only pay for hard copy's/originals to support artists after the final product has been inspected, and then only if reward is due.\r\n\r\nThe digital economy act\u2019s attempt to prevent the now superfluous publishers from losing money, by educating the masses, is either misguided or perhaps suggests foul play by those that let is pass. May we remind you, you should not be educating the electorate; your role is to make the laws in line with what society feels is acceptable!\r\n\r\nAs such, we demand that parliament immediately repeals all elements of the digital economy act relating to file sharing and replace them with laws to protect individuals sharing media\r\n",
