Although this is rare it happens.\r\nWomen are not even told about the risks of this during pregnancy and labour and i would like to know why?.\r\nMany NHS  hospitals dont even test for it when testing for infections as a, it is rare and b,it costs to much money.\r\nI am appauled that money as per is an issue over saving babies lifes when born or while inside the womb.\r\nI want the government to test for this infection throughout a womens pregnancy and for it to be made aware of to the mother, by the midwife,doctors etc.\r\nIf they had tested me for group b streptoccoccus I would not of had to go through 2 late misscarriages to find out the reason why,and i wouldn't of lost my daughter at 23 weeks 5 days and my twin sons at 17 weeks.\r\nI would love to reach the 100,000 signature mark so it could at least be debated in the house of commons,not pushed aside like its not important because it is.\r\n",
