        "additional_details": "The current speed limit in  these villages is 30mph which is excessive  when considerations are given to the increased likelihood of interactions between vehicles and pedestrians in such areas.\r\n\r\nWe petition for the reduction of the speed limit  to  become a 20mph limit.  This increases the likelihood of survival in the event of an accident between a motor vehicle and those on foot.\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly simple change to implement and would result in fewer unnecessary accidents.",
