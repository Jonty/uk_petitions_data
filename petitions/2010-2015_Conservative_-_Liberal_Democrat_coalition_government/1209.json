Justice is not an abstract objective ideal. It is a subjective feeling, An emotion that only the person who has be wronged can feel.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that judges do not choose punishments. Instead, the judges role is to give a selection of possible punishments to the victim. The victim then chooses the punishment that they think is fair. thus providing real subjective justice.",
