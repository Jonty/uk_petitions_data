        "additional_details": "5yrs ago our baby diagnosed with PHACE syndrome; she had lots of trips to Great Ormond Street in London. Struggling with money for transport and time off work, we were encouraged to claim DLA and Housing and Council Tax Benefit. We notified all parties of our circumstances as and when they changed. 2012 she had open heart surgery we stopped all claims  because her most complicated health need was \u201ccured\u201d. Sevenoaks District council notified us that \"due to a computer error\" our details had not been updated and we were issued with \u00a33000 of extra benefits.\r\nTheir timing clashed with the op, we were consistently and repeatedly given the wrong advice about appeals and missed the 3 months window. They DO NOT HAVE to recover this, it\u2019s discretionary. We have always been proud and honest about our situation they see \"we can pay\". We have food boxes even though I back at work. It\u2019s our last hope, treatment is still going. Please help by signing. It might not do anything, but we HAVE to try.\r\n",
