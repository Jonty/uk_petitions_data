        "additional_details": "There have been consistently low turnouts in recent elections, with roughly two thirds of the electorate not turning out to vote. A small proportion of this will be due to a conscious decision by individuals, but largely it is due to the prevailing sense of apathy towards politics.\r\n\r\nIt is vital that our electoral system is reformed to make it easier for people to vote. The reliance solely on polling stations is archaic and may actively discourage the younger generation from voting. We are now able to manage our money and other personal data safely and securely over the internet and so it must be possible to create or adopt the technology to make e-voting a reality.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of e-voting will hopefully bring about a change to the trend of growing dissatisfaction towards politics and ensure that more people exercise their democratic rights.",
