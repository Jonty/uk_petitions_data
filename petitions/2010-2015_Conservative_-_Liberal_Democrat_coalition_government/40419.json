After reading the pathetic statement from the Serbian FA denying any racism took place last night, in fact they had the cheek to blame it on one of the Engish lads who was put under extreme provocation.  I would like to see this brought up diplomatically and condemend to their highest office. They clearly do not get it !!  If more is not made of this it will keep happening time and time again. ",
