        "action": "Stop the monopoly that water companies have - overhaul our water industry",
        "additional_details": "Our water industry is outdated and out of touch.  Water customers are being disadvantaged.  We want the government to hold a thorough review of the water industry and to introduce radical change that will benefit every water customer and our environment.\r\n\r\nUnlike other sectors, if a water customer is unhappy with their water company they don\u2019t have the choice to take their custom elsewhere. Our water companies hold the monopoly, they have no competitor. Introducing competitors would positively influence standards and improve levels of service. Water companies would have to become concerned about potential loss of business and would need to proactively evaluate the services they offer.\r\n\r\nThis review should extend to the effectiveness of industry agencies (CC Water, Ofwat, PHSO) in place to \u2018protect\u2019 the water customer and should aim to standardise the compensation criteria and compensation levels within this sector.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to bring positive change.\r\n",
