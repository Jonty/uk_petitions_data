The breakdown company, Green Flag, recently did a survey which estimated that motorists are being overcharged well in excess of \u00a31 billion per year.\r\n\r\nMost resented is the \"Not Transferable\" condition applied to tickets. Why not? The time has been paid for!\r\n\r\nOther tricks include:-\r\n\r\nNo change given.\r\nRestrictive coin acceptance.\r\nAwkward charges (eg \u00a31.75 per person)\r\nRounding up to longer times.\r\n\r\nChanges needed:-\r\n\r\nOutlaw the \"Not Transferrable\" condition.\r\nCompulsory Grace of 15 minutes at start of parking to give time to gather fee.\r\nCompulsory 10 minute grace at end of time.\r\nSpecify standard range of coin acceptance.\r\nIf no change offered then match time to actual amount paid.\r\n\r\n ",
