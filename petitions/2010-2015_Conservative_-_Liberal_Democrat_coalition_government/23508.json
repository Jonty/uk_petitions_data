        "additional_details": "Why should women have to claim benefits, look for work right up until their retirement age when men for years have not had to?  Men have been able to claim pension credit from age 60 for years, and can currently claim pension credit from age 61.  Yet women cannot claim pension credit years before their retirement age like men can.  Stop this sex discrimination!  Women in late fifties have been penalised enough. We only got equal pay 35 years ago, paid tax @ 34%+ni when teenagers- only receiving just over half of gross pay, + even when earning \u00a31 for working all day Saturday had to pay an NI stamp. Now penalised again by our pensions being delayed. For a 2.5 yr delay lose out on \u00a320K in pension and associated benefits.If unemployed or ill are harassed and persecuted but men can just claim pension credit even though 4 years off their retirement age. Unfair re pensions too, should still get pension at 60 if have enough NI contributions.",
