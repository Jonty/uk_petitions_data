        "additional_details": "The Performing Rights Society (PRS) do a worthwhile job, but they seem to be putting a lot of effort into pursuing small business people for licences to play music in the workplace. This is yet another unwelcome expense in these troubled times. It is also unfair as it is usually playing a radio which renders you liable, yet the radio stations already pay PRS for the right to broadcast. The rules need to be simplified and made fairer to stop this 'function creep'",
