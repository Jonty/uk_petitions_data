Mr Cameron promises to do all he can to keep the club afloat.\r\nWHY?\r\n\r\nI cannot believe a Conserative MP and PM take this view.\r\n\r\nThey have had 80% of thier tax written off by the courts before and again failed to income tax and VAT on time.\r\n\r\nWe formally ask the treasurary to collect all taxes due from this business in a time of austerity.\r\n",
