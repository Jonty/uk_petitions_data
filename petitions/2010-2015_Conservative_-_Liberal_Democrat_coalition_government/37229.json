        "action": "Unfair Discrimination On The Grounds Of Financial Status",
        "additional_details": "Current discrimination laws do not legislate to protect applicants regarding discrimination on the grounds of financial standing.  A selection of companies carry out credit checks on applicants as part of any conditional offer of employment; companies can and do withdraw offers of employment in instances where credit checks return unfavourable scoring.  Yet an applicant\u2019s financial situation has no bearing on their ability to carry out a role honestly and effectively.\r\nConclusion:  Companies that exercise this form of discrimination are untrusting of employees with low credit scores, essentially discriminating against applicants who are not financially elite.  This is a clear yet unacknowledged form of discrimination which we believe should be challenged.  An individual\u2019s financial position does not affect their capability to work, applicants with low credit scores who have committed no finance/monetary related criminal activity should pose no additional risk to potential employers.\r\n",
