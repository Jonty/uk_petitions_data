        "additional_details": "I live in Edinburgh and get my bucket collected every week if the weather is bad then it could be fortnightly the thing is we are 3 adults who are not greenies but we do feel responsible enough to recycle our cardboard ,plastics ,tins and newspapers and Edinburgh District Council has an excellent collection service. We have noted that our bin is never even half full every week so fortnightly collections would work for us  but here is a suggestion why not let residents elect at the start of the year if they want weekly or fortnightly collections those who choose fortnightly get a rebate on their council tax and be an incentive to get residents in the habit of recycling plus the council could issue a coloured sticker say for next year i.e. a Blue 2012 for weekly and an Orange 2012 ticker for fortnightly so no one can cheat the system.\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nAndy White\r\n",
