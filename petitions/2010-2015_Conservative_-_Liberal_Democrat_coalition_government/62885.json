This is not the case with ex offenders. If these ex offender have not re-offended for 20 years, then it is wrong to keep ciminalising them. In many cases these people have turned their life around, but are unable to feel fully confident in their ability to enhance their career for fear of employers and colleagues finding out about their past.
