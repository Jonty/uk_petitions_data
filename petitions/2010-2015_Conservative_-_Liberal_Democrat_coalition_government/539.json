After the announcement of the F1 coverage going to SKY, I'm appalled I'm backed into a corner of having to pay a fee for a service I just do not use!  I'm not interested in Strictly Come Dancing or any of the other garbage they show so why should I pay it? I don't listen to BBC radio either.  Make it optional....the BBC might wake up then!",
