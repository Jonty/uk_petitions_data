        "additional_details": "What society needs today is a bit of respect re-introducing by means of tried and tested education (detention). The police should be given powers to put someone effectively in the sin-bin (cells) for 24 hours without giving the offender a criminal record or having to fill out any forms beyond name, address and time. Should any hoodie be causing a disturbance, off to the sin-bin. Give abuse to the police, off to the sin-bin.\r\nCriminal records are a tag that society does not need for minor social lessons and the police already have a tough job as it is without more forms to fill out. If anyone can't server the 24 hours immediately (job) then they have to turn up at the weekend for thier sin-bin or face arrest/double detention.\r\nIf it works in keeping discipline in several violent sports then why can't this work for society ?",
