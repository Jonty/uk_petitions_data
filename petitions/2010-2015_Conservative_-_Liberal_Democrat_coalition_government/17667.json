This is simply none other than a donation box set up in every supermarket, shop, bank and library where people can put any amount of money they have towards the country\u2019s debt. If everyone put in a pound a week there would be over \u00a350,000,000 a week towards the debt. There is no forcing people, there is no taxing, taking or imposing, just simply asking. I guarantee this will make more money than any government proposed plan to date and when everyone sees how we can unite for a better cause more and more will join the effort.\r\n\r\n\"if money is all they need why don\u2019t they ask?\u201d\r\n\r\nMarcel Joseph Whyte\r\n(facebook group: British Economy Fund)",
