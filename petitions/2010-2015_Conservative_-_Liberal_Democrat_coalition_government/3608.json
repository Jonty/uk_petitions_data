        "additional_details": "To bring in a US style of bounty hunter with an SIA style licence in to the UK to save thousands of hours of police time & money.\r\n\r\nProperly licenced individuals & companies would have access to certain databases and information about certain individuals that have warrants issues for their arrest.\r\n\r\nThis would make our streets safer, it would generate jobs but mostly it would free up our Police staff to do their jobs properly without the need for endless reems of paperwork.\r\n\r\nA new department could be set-up under the non-goverment departmental section there fore no new civil servant jobs would be created.\r\n\r\nThey could work hand in hand with other agencies in the UK.",
