        "additional_details": "Young People with Learning Disabilities may find securing an intermediate apprenticeship difficult because of the current emphasis on obaining two grade C or above in English and Maths at GCSE level.\r\nInclusion and access to apprenticeships were considered by Peter Little in 2012, with a report publsihed which included numerous pratical recommendations to support these learners.\r\nTo date, providers, including state funded colleges of further education are not required to adopt these recommendations. Please see the link on the national apprenticeship website for details.\r\nThis petition suggests that in an age of equal opportunities that the reocmmendations of the Little Report are made a legal requirement throughout the entire post-16 education system and regular audits are conducted as part of a monitoring framework to demonstrate that these are being put into practice.
