Tradex has regenerated a decaying premises and community, created jobs and provided business opportunities to young entrepreneurs. It has helped to improve community morale and social integration as well as providing a national attraction for visitors from all areas of the U.K.\r\n\r\nPlease show your support for Tradex and request the Council for their cooperation in seeking to reach a favourable outcome for the tenants and the wider affected community.\r\n",
