(Myalgic Encephalomyelitis) and CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), including correspondence with the medical profession (Ref: BN 141/1), held in the National Archives, Kew, UK, as a closed document and not available for public access, after 78 years, until 2072, is made freely available.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that such revelation may yield clues to a better understanding of a physical cause or underlying disease process of a discrete neurological illness, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, unjustifiably bundled within the collective diagnosis CFS or taken to be synonymous with it This might, in turn, lead to effective treatment and hopefully a cure or significant recovery for this dreadfully debilitating illness, which affects millions of people worldwide.\r\n",
