        "additional_details": "The Advanced Stop Line/Zone is a cycle box at the lights to allow cyclists to be visible and to stop them being caught down the side of vehicles wishing to turn (eg lorries). They also aid cyclists in congested traffic by giving them a safe reservour to pull into.\r\n\r\nHowever frequent infringements of this new law by motorists who pull into the box put cyclists safety at risk (some even attempt to race into dangerous overtakes through the junction).\r\n\r\nI propose that cyclists be given an advanced \"go\" signal (perhaps an advance on extended amber for ease of implimentation, or flashing green). This will give cyclists segregation through time to safely clear busy junctions.",
