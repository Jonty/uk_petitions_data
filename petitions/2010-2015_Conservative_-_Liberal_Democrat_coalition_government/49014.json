VoxFemme's campaign is for the introduction of a National Media Literacy Week, spearheaded and supported by government, during which media educators, activists and producers coalesce effort and output to engage young people, children, communities, schools and society in general, in thinking more critically about the content and impact of media and towards being more judicious consumers of media output.\r\nWe would like the UK Government to spearhead and support a National Media Literacy week to educate the general population towards more active engagement with media,  raise awareness of the impact of media on popular culture and promote more critical media consumption.\r\n\r\n",
