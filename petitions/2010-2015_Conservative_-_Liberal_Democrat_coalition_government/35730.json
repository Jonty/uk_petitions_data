Many Egyptians have sadly suffered as a result.\r\n\r\nWe left the land mines there and so it should be our responsibility to help clear them. Every child that loses a limb a those area's is unacceptable. This is a petition to the British Government to allocate funds or personell to help assist the removal of these land mines and help with those who have suffered from them in the way of injuries and such like.",
