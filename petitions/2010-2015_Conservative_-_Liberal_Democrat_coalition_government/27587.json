If an adequate riding standard are met the rider would be granted access to motorcycles up to 250cc and 33bhp.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis method creates a decent stepping stone from a 125cc to a lager capacity machine. Making younger riders more experienced and safer on the roads.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe market for 250cc motorcycles would greatly benefit from this.",
