        "additional_details": "We the sincere middle class of Bangladesh, whom our own government gives deaf ears ask for the international community to come forward and help us take our call for justice and free trial of war criminals of 1971 war of liberation. We want the trials to be held under the international court of justice and we do not want the political parties make mockery of our history and use this issue for political gains any more. We the youth and the next generation want to close this chapter of our history and let the soul of the departed victims and martyrs rest in eternal peace. Please help us go forward as a developing country by sorting out these unclosed chapters and the political direction which keeps coming back hitting our economy and stopping us from taking the next steps as a nation.",
