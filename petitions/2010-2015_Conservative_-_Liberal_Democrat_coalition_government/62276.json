        "additional_details": "Every day we are told about ANOTHER senior judge, senior policeman, NHS administrator, head teacher, politician, etc who has been discovered in the commission of a crime and has been allowed to retire to avoid prosecution for that crime.  In the same way that taxpayer pounds are used to pay the fines and compensation orders laid against taxpayer funded employees, this is something that taxpayers have NEVER been asked to agree to and CANNOT withdraw their income tax payments in protest against their misuse to cover up criminal acts.  In this modern era the taxpayer MUST not be prevented from seeing appropriate legal action BEING taken against employees who commit crime in their name, against the wishes of taxpayers.",
