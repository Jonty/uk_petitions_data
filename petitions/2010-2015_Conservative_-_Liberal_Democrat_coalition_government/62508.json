        "additional_details": "At present UKBA proposes that non-EU students wtih CEFR B1 level English progressing to HEIs will be issued with a single CAS  (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) for Pre-sessional courses but those who have CEFR B2 and above will need two CASs to progress to HEI entrance via a Pre-sessional course. This causes great inconvenience and expense to both the HEIs and the students themselves. The government should ensure that all non- EU students, B1 level and above, embarking on a Pre-sessional course for an HEI in UK, are issued with a single CAS.",
