        "additional_details": "A review to help single parents as at the moment it is flawed leaving parents better off working 16 hrs only. As soon as a single parent works more than these hours they loose all Local housing benifit, have to pay more out in expenses such as fuel and child care which is not covered by working tax. As a single parent who has worked my entire life an average of 40+ hours a week it makes no sense that i am worse off by working more than 16hrs and gives no incentive for parents to work and be a dencent role model for their children instilling a work ethic into them, rather than teaching them that hard working people will pay for them to sit at home being lazy benifit bums.
