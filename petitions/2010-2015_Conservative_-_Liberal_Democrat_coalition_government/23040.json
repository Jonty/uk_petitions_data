We previously had the late eddie George as the first Governor of the 'new' Bank of England, and he was known as 'Steady' Eddie.\r\n\r\nMervyn King does not have the qualities required, and his policies, and actions have failed. Note the number of letters he has had to write in respect of the inflation figures. It seems it is always tomorrow in respect of getting inflation under control.\r\n\r\nIt is with some regret that there must be a change of leadership of the independent Bank of England.",
