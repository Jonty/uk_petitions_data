        "additional_details": "We the people understand that cuts need to be made but we can't cut our Military in times of uncertainty. For example, the Iran situation, and the situation with the Falklands, we need to be able to defeat opposition forces and defend what is rightfully British! These are all major examples of why we need to keep our Military strong! The Government should hold a debate in parliament on the issue.\r\n\r\nWe the people vote that the government should stop cuts on defence and the military. ",
