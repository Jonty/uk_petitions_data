It increase apathy as many, many voters votes just do not matter.\r\n\r\nThe AV referendum last year was ruined by political campaigners who's financial clout ensured that a fair fight was never possible.\r\n\r\nPR, in any form, is more representative that FPTP.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, wish the House to debate the merits of PR with the view of introducing a Bill to change our voting system before the 2015 election\r\n\r\n",
