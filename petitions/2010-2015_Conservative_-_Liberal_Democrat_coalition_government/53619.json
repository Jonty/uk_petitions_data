        "additional_details": "The one size fit all approach of the governments Wage Incentive scheme does not favour small businesses and voluntary groups to create employment. It favours only big businesses with the resources and economic power to do so. Small businesses and voluntary groups should receive the wage incentive upfront to pay wages of jobseekers for the first three months instead of having to wait 8 weeks or more to be paid for taking staff on. This way small businesses and voluntary group know they have three months to grow their business or concept without the worries of where to find money to pay staff wages. Many small employers are prevented from taking on jobseekers because of cash flow problems for the initial three months period.\r\n Flexible and tailored approach on wage incentive is what is needed to get jobseekers into employment.",
