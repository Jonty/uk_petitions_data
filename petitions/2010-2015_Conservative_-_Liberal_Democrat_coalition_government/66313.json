Many buses don't show up with the excuse of traffic or bus breakdowns. We pay for this rubbish service. How long should we have to take it? I think it's time stagecoach were relieved of their service and someone who is able to run it is given the chance. Please sign and let's show that we will not sit in silence anymore.",
