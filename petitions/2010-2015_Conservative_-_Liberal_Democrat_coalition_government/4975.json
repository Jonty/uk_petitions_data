        "additional_details": "I served as a National Serviceman in the RAF from 1960 to 1962. During my period of training I was required to fire rifles and light machine guns (Bren Guns) without hearing protection. As a result I have suffered severe tinnitus ever since. As the law stands no ex service person can claim compensation if the injury occurred prior to 1987. In view of the fact that my life, and almost certainly many others, have been ruined by the mismanagement of public servants  (serving officers), this law must be changed to include any ex service person regardless of date or injury sustained.
