We believe that cannabis should be made available for a wide range of conditions not only MS as a last line of treatment. We are calling on the government to relieve the suffering of British citizens without forcing good people to have to break the law simply to relieve their pain, when all other treatments are ineffective. We do not believe this is fair!",
