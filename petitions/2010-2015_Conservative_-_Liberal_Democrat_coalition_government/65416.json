All grammar schools in the UK are selective secondary schools and require a child to sit and pass an entrance examination.  Some grammar schools have introduced a new criteria of giving considerable and undue advantage to children that live within a priority area to the school.  This is a stealth way of discriminating against children from a less privileged background, whose parents might not be able to afford a property within the priority area of set by the grammar school. If a child has to prepare for an exam, then it is only fair that the child should be assessed fairly against every other child that sat for the exam\r\n\r\nI want the government to declare that that it is unfair for selective grammar schools to discriminate against children because they do not live within a priority area, and the grammar schools should stop this practice with immediate effect.\r\n",
