We believe this savage attack on Health and Social Care provision to be deeply unfair to service users, their families, friends and care home staff. It is an unjustified attack on public provision for people of England and Wales of all ages, and for generations to come.\r\n\r\nLocal Authority homes are statistically better than privately run homes.",
