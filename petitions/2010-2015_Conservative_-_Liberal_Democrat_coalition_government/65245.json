        "additional_details": "According to Professor Chris Elliott's review into the integrity and assurance of food supply networks, we have a right to expect that our food is not only safe but also does not repulse us. In his interim report, he stated, \"Government, and in particular a more robust Food Standards Agency (FSA) has a major role to play....\" He goes onto say, \"The costs of delivering the necessary safeguards may seem a burden but the cost of failure is even greater.\" The cost of meat inspection, by civil servants working in slaughterhouses across the UK is 50p per person per year. Despite this, the government is intent on introducing risk-based analysis, making consumers reliant on the food businesses themselves to safeguard our meat. The Horsemeat scandal alone should raise concerns about this strategy. Consumers and not the industry are the victims of food crime. We call upon the government to stop this dangerous strategy and support the work of independent, state meat inspectors and official vets.",
