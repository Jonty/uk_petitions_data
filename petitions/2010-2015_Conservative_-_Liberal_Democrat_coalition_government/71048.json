The unborn baby can inhale the meconium, this blocks the airways & can cause death.\r\nThe Meconium can also cause deadly infections &/or blood poisoning & in some cases, meningitis  to both mother and infant.\r\nSo, why are women left to labour on their own or are forced to wait for induction methods to kick in, when meconium is evidently present?\r\nThese infants should be brought immediately by emergency c section to avoid the risk of death.
