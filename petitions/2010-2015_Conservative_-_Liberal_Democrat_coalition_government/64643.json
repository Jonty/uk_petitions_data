This is far more severe testing regime than current cattle testing..\r\nThe British Alpaca Society is seeking a more proportionate testing regime to reflect the low risk represented by camelids\r\n\r\nThe use of the ENFERplex antibody test has already been agreed between Defra and the British Alpaca Society for pre-movement tests, routine surveillance and export\r\n\r\n\u2022\tWe want Defra to reconsider the choice of TB tests used on alpacas in a TB breakdown scenario\r\n\u2022\tWe want Defra to include the ENFERplex antibody test and extend its use to any breakdown scenario\r\n\u2022\tWe want Defra to pay market value compensation for these pedigree animals if they are slaughtered\r\n\r\n",
