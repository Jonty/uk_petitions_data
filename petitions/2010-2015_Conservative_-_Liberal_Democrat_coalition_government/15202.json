        "additional_details": "Doctors' salaries have grown by 40% in real terms in the last 10 years and their working conditions have improved dramatically i.e. reduction in hours. There are large numbers of people applying to be doctors evey year. There seems to be no shortage of people able and willing become doctors so why have salaries gone up so much ? The reason is probably the power of the BMA and the failure of the last Labour government to defend itself from Doctors demanding more money.Lots of people are now going into medicine to become rich. Reduce salaries to an average of 45k from the 100k they are now. The advantages would be fairness (doctors have a job for life which has a high reputation - they haven't had to suffer fear of redundancy - how is paying doctors more money improving the NHS - they can just afford to retire earlier), savings and better doctors who are in it for patient care rather than money.",
