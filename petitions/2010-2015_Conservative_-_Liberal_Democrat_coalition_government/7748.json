        "additional_details": "Prison should mean prison.\r\nCriminals these days do not fear being deprived of their freedom as they get so many rights and luxuries in prison. Many of them benefit from being inside and waste our countries benefits and hard working tax payers money.\r\nLets throw out their human rights as they dont consider the rights of their victims when commiting their criminal acts. Make prison cells 5ft by 3ft solo occupant rooms, with just a bed and a toilet. Prisons are too soft, hence why our countries crime rate is soo high. lets not waste our money on those who want to ruin our country for our future generations.",
