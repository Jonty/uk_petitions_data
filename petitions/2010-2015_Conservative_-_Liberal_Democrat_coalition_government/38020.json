        "additional_details": "As the NHS provides 100% of care for free the proposal would be to reform the NHS status and make it a part contribution from patient at a level of 25%. Providing that the Government reduce by 25% the NHS taxation it would be fair that 25% of care was paid by patients themselves to get them more involve in they own care. I would call the proposal the B25 and explain why here:\r\n\r\nFree NHS care for\r\n\u2022\tUnder 25 year old\r\n\u2022\tPensioners with income under \u00a325000 a year\r\n\u2022\tIndividuals earning less than \u00a325000\r\n\u2022\tOn benefit totaling under \u00a325000 per family\r\n\u2022\tGP consultation at \u00a325 with a minimum 10mn visit rather than 2mn (in France it last 15mn for a full check up) and GP consultation would be refunded at 100% with a 25 working days delays. At least this money would generate some interest and finance the needs for jobs, equipments, or finance for the more needy.\r\n25% is the amount paid by the French population which is reinvested in healthcare. The 75% being paid by Social Security.\r\n",
