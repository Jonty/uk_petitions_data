        "additional_details": "MPs do not need 4 & 5 bedroom million pound plus second homes funded by the tax payer for use during the week for only one politician per house . They should give up these homes back to the tax payer and should be housed in a high rise one bedroom flat with proper security except for politicians in important roles like the PM ,secretary of defence and so on . Why do they need these multi million pound houses for only use during the week when a one bedroom flat with proper security will be a lot more cost effective in these hard times . These high rise flats that were built by the Government to house families of 5 and 6 members they should be good enough to house one MP per flat during the week . We could also set up a bus service to ferry politicians back and forward to the flats a certain times to save the tax payer on taxi fees ",
