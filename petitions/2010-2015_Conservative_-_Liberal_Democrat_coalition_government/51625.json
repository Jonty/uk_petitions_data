        "additional_details": "Britains roads are a disgrace considering the amount of tax collected from Britain's road users. This applies to every type of road from the individual streets right up to motorways. More and more, people are having to pay for repairs caused by potholes and similar.\r\n\r\nWe want to be able to claim the costs of those repairs back from whoever is responsible for the general maintenance of that road. The mechanism should be quick and have a fast payment turnaround. There should also be an independent complaints mechanism with enough power to force the authority responsible to pay in a reasonable period of time.",
