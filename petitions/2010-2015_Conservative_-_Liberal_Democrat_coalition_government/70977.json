        "additional_details": "A worrying trend is being slowly discovered in the UK. 2-Way mirrors are being found to have been installed in bars, clubs, changing rooms and more. This is a blatant invasion of personal privacy and undermines what we should expect when we are in the privacy of these places. In 2013, a Glaswegian club was discovered to have 2-Way mirrors in the women\u2019s toilets. What is even more vulgar is that the toilets face on to a private booth that can be booked out to specifically leer into the girls' bathrooms whilst the girls are unaware that they are being watched. We are calling for a nationwide ban on 2-Way mirrors in public places and more severe sanctions for those caught spying on unaware women. We urge you to sign this petition in order to preserve your right to privacy.",
