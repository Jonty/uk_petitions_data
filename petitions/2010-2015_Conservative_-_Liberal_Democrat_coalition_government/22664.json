        "additional_details": "We spend far too much taxpayers' money on wars in far-off countries that don't affect us directly.  The UK is no longer enough of a world superpower to throw its military might around in the same way that the likes of the USA do.\r\n\r\nThis petition recognises the futility of appealing for an instant and dramatic overhaul of the MOD, however justified, but wishes the government to recognise that the welfare of this country's people should always be the priority when deciding what to preserve, and that overseas operations and weapons development are not vital to the above.  A huge amount of  money is pumped into defence each year, but very little of it is seen again by the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe United Nations was created to deal with global conflict; let us recognise that we are but one small part of that effort, and have no obligation to contribute military might greater than that which represents our population and resources as compared to the world as a whole.",
