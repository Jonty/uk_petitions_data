        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to create a national minimum standard of education for all schools.  No-one should leave school without attaining GCSE grade C in both English and Maths. At the moment almost 9% of school leavers leave without any qualifications at all.  It is time to correct this situation. There are other areas of life where minimum standards are legally enforced e.g. car insurance, health and safety, MOTs, National Insurance, food hygiene, etc, so why not education?\r\n\r\n",
