        "additional_details": "The Police will decide their tactics based on political rather than social priorities. Elected Policeman will naturally have a vested interest in the safety of areas where their traditional vote is. For this reason, other areas perhaps may be neglected. Evidence suggests that more affluent areas in general, have higher voter turnout. There would therefore be little incentive for the Police to prioritise areas which experience a greater degree of deprivation. These are the areas likely to have higher crime levels. ",
