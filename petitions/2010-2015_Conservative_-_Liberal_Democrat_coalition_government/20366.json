        "additional_details": "Banks and supermarkets have recently introduced reward credit cards these offer cash back on purchases but the banks and supermarkets are not paying these rewards, the retailers are. They are heavily promoting these cards through TV advertising and offering returns on fuel purchases. Fuel retailers are lucky to make 3p per litre before charges and this extra Burdon leaves them with no other option but to raise prices for all customers. If you agree with me that it is wrong to reward the rich at the expense of the poor then please sign this petion.",
