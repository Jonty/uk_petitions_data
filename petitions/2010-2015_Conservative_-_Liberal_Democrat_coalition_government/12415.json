This is also in addition to the normal taxes that we pay along with the non-smokers.\r\n\r\nFor that kind of money each UK smoker could contribute to the tax pot as normal and have more than enough money for BUPA health care each and every year.\r\nRescind these discriminatory anti smoking laws or give us our money back!\r\n",
