Because in the end, these are the people who know their condition best.\r\n\r\nThe petition is that an intermediate health service for the children with physical and mental disabilities be setup with in the N.H.S. to cater for their specific needs and rights as a human being\r\nAnd not given to bureaucratic expensive managerial waste but incorporated in the existing   Health\r\n Service.\r\n",
