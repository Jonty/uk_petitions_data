        "additional_details": "Earlstoke prison closed last month and all there prisoners sent to other prisoners. Some of the offenders are working in full time jobs but where they have been moved to other prisons they have lost all their rights to do this unless they have entered into discussions with the governor of the prison they have been moved to, however some are too far from their place of employment.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting that we allow these prisoners to return to their home environment under supervision via the probation service, these prisoners are almost rehabilitated and due to finish there prison terms and should be allowed to make the links so that when they leave prison they are integrated with the community and then have a lesser chance of re-offending.\r\n",
