        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, demand a withdrawal of the sale of fireworks to the general public and restrict their use to organised displays only.\r\n\r\nEvery year, domestic and wild animals are caused unnecessary distress through the excessive and unnecessary use of fireworks by the general public.\r\n\r\nWe are not only concerned by the 'accidental' distress caused to animals by the use of fireworks but also the deliberate harm and distress caused to animals by people who think it is funny to throw a lit firework at an animal and watch it explode near to it or worse in its mouth.........yes this does and has happened!\r\n\r\nFireworks can be purchased all year round from licensed premises and ARE used all year round making it impossible for owners to protect their animals effectively as they cannot predict when or where a firework will be fired.\r\n\r\nIn banning fireworks from public sale, you will be saving millions of animals from this suffering.",
