        "action": "Urgent Government action needed to stop Carbon Monoxide deaths and poisoning in the home, rented accomodation, camp sites, holidays, UK & abroad.",
        "additional_details": "Carbon Monoxide (CO) can kill in less than 3 minutes. CO is produced from burning carbonaceous fuels such as gas, oil coal, wood. Even low levels can cause serious health damage.\r\n\r\nCO, the silent killer, is an invisable, odourless gas. It can be detected by simply using an Electronic Flue Gas Analyser. The Gas Distribution Networks (Emergency Services) DO NOT supply their engineers with this equipment.\r\n\r\nThe law says appliances in rented accomodation using Natural Gas must be inspected annually. The Government should debate changing to an annual servicing and the mandatory installation of CO audible alarms\r\n\r\nRecently in 2 seperate incidents 2 young girls were tragically killed by CO fumes in tents from barbecues. CO DANGERS and AWARENESS  should be included within the school curriculum.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION. LIVES COULD BE SAVED BY PERSUADING PARLIAMENT TO CHANGE THE LAW.",
