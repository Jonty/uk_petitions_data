        "additional_details": "Those that have signed this petition respectively ask the Minister of Transport to Re-open the Shrewsbury to Stafford via Wellington (Shropshire) Railway Line. Had the Line been properly evaluated when it was axed in the 1960's it would not have closed. North-East Telford (Donnington) is a expanding area with an increase in population. With the future predictions of growth both Donnington and Newport shall need a Railway station. to enable residents to commute to Stafford, Wellington, Shrewsbury, Telford, and Wolverhampton, not to mention the leisure trips that they would be able to take. It would enable the economy of  Newport to be sustained and to grow. It would also help Wellington which has largly been ignored since Telford Shopping Centre was built",
