        "additional_details": "Recently BT and O2 have raised their charges, including for those who are in a fixed term contract. All service companies should be prevented from doing this unless there is a clear opt in specifically to say that price increases are a possibility.\r\n\r\nThe Government should legislate to ensure:\r\nConsumers are aware of potential price increases before a contract is agreed, by having an opt in box that needs to be ticked.\r\nThat all contracts can only be agreed in some kind of written form.\r\nThat customers who have been victims of such increases within the last 3 years should be able to receive compensation.\r\n\r\nOn the last point, I believe the stealth used by these companies is worse than those used for PPI.
