The numbers are currently in the thousands and are not stopping nor slowing down.  The current President (Jacob Zuma) is known to sing songs of hatred against white people such as \"Shoot/Kill the Boer (farmer)\".  We need to take a stand and let the South African government know that this is wrong and will not be tolerated.  ",
