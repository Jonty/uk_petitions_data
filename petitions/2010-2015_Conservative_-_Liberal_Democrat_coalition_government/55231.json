        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to allow the pupils taking GCSE English in June 2014 to have their English speaking exam results included as part of their final marks as it was explained when they started this course in September 2012.\r\nThe pupils have already taken this exam earlier in the year and been given their results. Only recently, at the beginning of the new school year, have the School sent out an Email to say the Government has abolished this as part of the overall qualification.\r\nWhat message are we sending our pupils?\r\nThey were told a year ago what the course entailed , how many exams were involved and how much as a percentage each exam was worth towards the final mark.\r\nThen the government changed it\r\nSo basically they have studied for and taken part of an exam only to be told its worthless!!!\r\nIf the Government wishes to introduce changes they should implement them at the begining of the GCSE English course.",
