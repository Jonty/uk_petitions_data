        "additional_details": "Many victims be it a man or woman escape domestic violence with there children every year. The victim and children begin to rebuild there lives only to be thrown straight back into the vicious circle once again via the family courts. It is a known fact that many perpetrators use the family court to gain control once again over the victims. If here is sufficient evidence to convict the perpetrator serious thought should be given as to wether they should be reintroduced into the children's lives. Family courts all claim they are doing what is in the best interest of the children however more often than not the human rights of a perpetrator rise above the victims. This is not about stopping one parent seeing there children this is about stoping further abuse!",
