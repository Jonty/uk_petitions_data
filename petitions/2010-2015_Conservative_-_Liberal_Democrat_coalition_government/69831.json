It calls on the government to urgently seek ways to devolve both decision making and tax raising powers to regionally representative bodies giving political responsibility to locally elected representatives.\r\n\r\nThe precise nature may vary, but initially, to avoid additional costs that existing MP's would meet for one or two days as week at regional assemblies to give political oversight and this department be responsible for setting up the administrative oversight for regional headquarters.\r\n\r\nThis would be supported by an English parliament, which DOES NOT meet in Westminster. Instead it rotates around the regional assemblies to ensure that it is not dominated by the London political establishment.\r\n\r\n",
