The suggestion that the Director General of the BBC should receive a whole 12 months\u2019 pay for failing to carry out his leadership role within his first two months is unacceptable to the majority of the public.\r\nThis sets a terrible example to other workers who are much lower paid. If they fail after a short period perhaps they too should demand a full year's pay in lieu.\r\nThe ruse that helping to sort out the mess they have presided over is no justification for a handout from the fee paying public.\r\n",
