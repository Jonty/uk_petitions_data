Further,be aware of \"potential reputational implications\" of involvement in Israeli settlements.(https://goo.gl/qMpT9O)\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to create a new food label/logo with a simple 4 letter acronym; FIOT.\r\nAllowing CLEAR indication of Food produced in Occupied Israeli Territories.\r\n\r\nWe, the British, have protested in out masses against this illegal occupation. Please take a minute to sign the petition.I thank you on behalf of those who are occupied.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s eat consciously TOGETHER!",
