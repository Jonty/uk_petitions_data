It ended over 20 years of conflict in Europe. It involved many nations and heralded over 50 years of peace and stability. The battle was the culmination of a long campaign, fought in Spain and Portugal, by the Duke of Wellington and his allied armies and many people died preventing Napolean taking over Europe. The commemoration of this seminal event should be actively promoted and take place as it is as historically important as the D-Day celebrations in British history.\r\n",
