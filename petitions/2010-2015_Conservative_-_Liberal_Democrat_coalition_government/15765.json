Then once released from their soft sentences some are given new identities, homes and benefits.\r\n\r\nI am starting this petition as human rights of serious criminals should be revoked immediately.  The criminals rights seem to be more important than those of their victims that they disregarded so easily.\r\n\r\nThe Government should enforce harsher sentencing and no benefits for serious criminals without worrying about human rights.",
