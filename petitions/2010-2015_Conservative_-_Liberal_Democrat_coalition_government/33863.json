Sir Anthony Hopkins, Donald Pleasance, Stanley Baker, Sid James all apeared on it as well as a number of writers and directors. I think we should bring back Armchair Theatre and don't think it would cost that much (I assume) and it does not need to be confined to television there could be an Armchair Theatre roadshow though this would contradict the title.",
