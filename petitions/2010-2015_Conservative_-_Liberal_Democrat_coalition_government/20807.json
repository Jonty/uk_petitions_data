        "additional_details": "Council Tax is the most unfair tax ever devised. Whilst everybody in a given community benefits in some way from local services only between 50 and 80 per cent of the community actually pay for them. This cannot be right and fair.  In addition there are several bands which only have relevance to the value of the property on which the tax is levied. It costs just as much to provide bin collections from a mansion as it does from a two up and two down property but the amount paid in council tax between such properties could be very substantial indeed. Neither is the number of persons resident in a property taken into account  I propose that Council Tax be replaced by a Local Sales Tax payable on all goods and services puchased locally and collected by the local authority who would set the % rate according to government guide lines. This of course would be payable by every one so that the more you spend the more Sales Tax would be paid.",
