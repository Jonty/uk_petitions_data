        "additional_details": "The new scrap metal dealers act is going to ban licensed scrap metal merchants from paying customers in cash in the belief that this will cut metal theft. I disagree .\r\nI believe it will create a black market that the will be impossible to police.\r\nCashless trading is not the answer stricter licensing and stiffer penalties for buying and selling stolen scrap metal are.\r\nMany other industries are still allowed to pay in cash, (cash for clothes, cash converters, cash for gold etc.)\r\nso why not allow properly licensed and registered scrap yards to do the same?\r\nBanning cash transactions will have massive implications to the scrap metal recycling industry and will also affect millions of tradesmen around the country.\r\nI WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO URGE THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO BAN CASH PAYMENTS FOR SCRAP METAL.\r\n Please sign up if you feel the same way.",
