This means that many whilst sitting on substantial bank accounts still have the ability to claim from the Tax Payer, from personal experience this is used for Christmas presents and a flush winter.\r\n\r\nThis petition is aimed at gaining public votes on the introduction of 'means testing' to determine individual rights to the allowance.",
