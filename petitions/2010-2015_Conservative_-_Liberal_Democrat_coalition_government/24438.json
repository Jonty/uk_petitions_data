        "additional_details": "Anyone being given permanent resident status permanent resident status in the EU, will also be entitled to permanently reside in UK as well. Therefore conferring permanent resident status in the EU should be standardised with all other EU member states. Being given indefinite leave to remain in UK, the person (together with his/her spouse, children & other relatives, cousins, etc) then officially becomes a permanent resident of UK, with the right of abode (like a British Citizen) in UK indefinitely. Leave to remain in UK indefinitely should be a rare privilege conferred on an immigrant on work permits only after a decade of being a model resident & making significant contribution to British Society, not merely being married to an EU citizen or given asylum as a refugee. Marriage between a non-British EU citizen to a non-EU citizen in UK should last for at least 10 years before the right to remain in UK visa is issued to the non-EU spouse resident in UK.",
