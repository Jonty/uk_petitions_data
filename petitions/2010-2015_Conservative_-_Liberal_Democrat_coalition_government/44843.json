        "additional_details": "I want the Government to take action to allow Scottish Cancer Patients the same rights to drugs like Cetuximab (Erbitux) & Avastin (Bevacizumab) & Vectibix (panitumumab) as patients in England. My daughter is only 31 years old and she should have a right to have one of these drugs made available to her if they could help her as should other Cancer patients in Scotland. Please sign this petition and help make these drugs available in Scotland. Just because they cost a lot of money approximately \u00a33,500 a month what cost can the Government or Scotland put on a patient's life. Please make this available for my daughter and others in Scotland. She has colorectal cancer ",
