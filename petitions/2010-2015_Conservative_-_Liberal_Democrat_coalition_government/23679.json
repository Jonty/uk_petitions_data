        "additional_details": "Given the historically low turnout at elections in Scotland there is every likelihood that a referendum on Independance will not attract a large proportion of eligible voters\r\n\r\nA condition was imposed in 1979 of a 40% of total electorate voting yes in a Referendum on Scottish Devolution. Given that full Independance is a vastly bigger step than Devolution then we the undersigned would like assurances from the current Westminster Government that a majority of registered voters, i.e. 50% + 1, would be required to vote for independance rather than a simple majority. To do otherwise would risk Scotland sleepwalking into a decision.",
