They find it difficult to deal with information and may find it hard to translate hearing into doing, thinking into saying, reading into speaking, or feeling into words. They may also have difficulty applying their thoughts and feelings to new experiences or situations and knowing the differences between similarities and differences. Having an early diagnosis can decrease the risk of a secondary problems that can decrease the quailty of life in the future. These include psychiatric, disrupted school experience and alcohol and drug problems. Having the support that they need to be able to live a full and happy life is something that should be a right of theirs and their life should not be prohibited by their condition. ",
