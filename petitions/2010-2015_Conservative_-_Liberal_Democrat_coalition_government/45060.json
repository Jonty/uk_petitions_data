As representatives of the people, and individuals with the needs of the \"common man\" at heart, surely there is no question that the education system they manage is every bit good enough for anybody, including - nay especially - their own children.\r\n\r\nIt is wondered what 'state' schools might be in, ten years from today, were this introduced tomorrow.\r\n",
