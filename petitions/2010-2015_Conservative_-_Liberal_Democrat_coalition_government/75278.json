        "additional_details": "In 2013 the number of elderly drivers above the age of 70 exceeded 4 million for the very first time.\r\n\r\nThere were 10,974 accidents involving drivers over the age of 70 in 2011.\r\n\r\nElderly divers have:\r\n\u2022A slowdown in response time\r\n\u2022A loss of clarity in vision and hearing\r\n\u2022A loss of muscle strength and flexibility\r\n\u2022A reduction in the ability to focus or concentrate\r\n\r\nThis results in late breaking, delayed turning at junctions which leads towards a particular issue; the failure of use of indicators, making other drivers unaware of their intentions\r\n\r\nI therefore request that the government introduces the E-Plate in order to make other drivers in close proximity aware that the driver in front could pose a potential hazard.\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the amount of incidents involving elderly drivers as the E-Plate will encourage other drivers to be more cautious.\r\n\r\nIt can be issued voluntary; such as by concerned family members.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
