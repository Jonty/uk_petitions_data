        "additional_details": "Bill Cash has been utterly vindicated in his stance on Europe.  For 20 years, he and other Conservative MPs have sacrificed their careers to protect this country from increased integration with European Union financial institutions.\r\n\r\nHis stance in the Conservative Party has altered government policy to the extent that this country is not mired in the disaster that the Single European Currency has become thanks to the institutionalised corruption of some of its members.\r\n\r\nThe cost to him and his like-minded fellow MPs has been to be passed over for preferment for office for years.  He has valued his principles over mere ambition.  In so doing he has saved this country from a financial holocaust.\r\n\r\nAt the very least Mr Cash deserved a knighthood for his principled and uncompromising stance on this most important of issues.\r\n\r\nHe has been proved right after 20 years and deserves to be rewarded for his stand.",
