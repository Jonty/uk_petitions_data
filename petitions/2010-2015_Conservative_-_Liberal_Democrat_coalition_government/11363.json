Digital anonymity is a disguise used to perpetrate serious criminal acts and online bullying.\r\nIf your online and texting behaviour is appropriate you don\u2019t need an alias!\r\n\r\nSign this petition to call for the following:\r\n\r\n1) All devices capable of accessing the internet must be licensed at the point of sale. i.e identity and proof of current address of the purchaser must be supplied to the vendor who passes the data to a government body who verifies the data and licences the device before it can be used online.\r\n\r\n2) All websites permitting anonymity should be blocked in the UK.\r\n\r\n3) Cellular and landline telecommunications of any nature within the UK must carry a digital signature which clearly identifies the real identity of the sender and recipient(s) of the data.",
