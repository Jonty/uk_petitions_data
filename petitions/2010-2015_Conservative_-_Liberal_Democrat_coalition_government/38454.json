        "additional_details": "BAA are conducting so called 'Freedom Trials' approved by the Secretary of State for Transport. This means that flight arrivals to Heathrow are now coming every 30 seconds from 5.30am over the Battersea area causing sleep disruption and noise pollution. Also flights are continuous throughout the day and in the early evening back to every 60 seconds. This is set to continue until March 2013. Residents were not consulted and Wandsworth council seem powerless. I urge the Government to end this trial as soon as possible",
