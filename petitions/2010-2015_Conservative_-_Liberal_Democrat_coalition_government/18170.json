        "additional_details": "We believe that the plans to develop Norwich and the surrounding villages and market towns, as called for in the Joint Core Strategy, are wrong and not necessary.  These plans are calling for 36,000 new homes (including the so called Eco town of 4,000 homes) and a partial ring road (the NDR) that is only there to provide access to these new homes.  We do not want the government to fund any of this activity under the false hope that it will provide a \"kick start\" to the economy as the end result will be a loss of valuable food producing land and the enlargement of Norwich to a similar size settlement as Nottingham.  There are viable cheaper alternatives to stimulate the local economy and provide the necessary homes which the local authorities are ignoring as they press ahead with schemes that are not wanted by the local residents and Parish Councils.
