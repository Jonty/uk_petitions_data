        "additional_details": "There have been many petitions to move the summer break to 4 or 5 weeks which i agree with the reasons stated, but the key benefit of this petition is to increase the October break to two weeks running from mid to late October.\r\n\r\nThis would give primary benefits that the year would be split into 4 quarters holiday wise, where parents can enjoy the options to take decent length holidays much more conveniently. This in turn is likely to reduce prices during the summer break, increase the tourism window for UK and foreign business, as well as making it much easier for parents to look after their children during the breaks. Not forgetting the benefits to children in terms of less burn out, but keeping the year separating length summer break.\r\n\r\n",
