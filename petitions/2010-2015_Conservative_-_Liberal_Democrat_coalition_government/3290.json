        "additional_details": "Keeping a person in prison costs up to \u00a315,000 a year. My proposal is that prisoners must, as in the United States, produce goods during this time, thus benefiting our people/economy (less money spent, more food/clothing/equipment etc. produced for domestic/foreign sale). Also, this would enable courts to send more people to prison, thus dissuading criminals who will want to avoid hard labour. Also, more money could be invested (as a suggestion) into policing from our extra proceeds from the labourers, thus reducing crime rates yet further for people who are more likely to be caught.",
