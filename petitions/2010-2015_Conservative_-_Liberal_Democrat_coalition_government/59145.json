Children can be expensive and the non resident parent should have to pay more than \u00a35 a week!\r\nThe \u00a35 a week we receive pays for one karate lesson that's it. The child also needs food, clothes, swimming lesions, toys the list seams never ending!\r\nYet as his mother refuses to get a job and sits at home or on holidays happily spending saving, inheritance and racking up credit card bills. While we go without to make sure We can provide the best I can for my child.\r\nPlease vote to increase the amount taken by the csa! Thank you. ",
