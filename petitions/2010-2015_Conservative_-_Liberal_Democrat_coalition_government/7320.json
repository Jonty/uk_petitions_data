        "additional_details": "The riots in my opinion have esculated way out of proportion due to rioters/looters clearly not thinking about what is right/wrong, and consequences of their actions to themselves and others. These views have not been helped by violence depicted in media. Rap music 99% of the time speaks about violence and in no way do you hear of the rappers saying that what they rap about is wrong. This leads young adults/teenagers to believe that violence is cool. Games like Gran Theft Auto especially have the same effect. The government needs to have a SERIOUS think about what they let out to the public and the impacts that music and gaming can have to the country's attitudes",
