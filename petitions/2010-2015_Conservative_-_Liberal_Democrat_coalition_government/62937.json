        "additional_details": "The Dockyard in Plymouth has submitted a new application to dump 337,000 tonnes of dredged silt off at Rame Head - right next to the new Marine Conservation Zone. This is an area of outstanding natural beauty. Six million tonnes have already been dumped over the past 30 years, with a very noticeable effect on the bay's water and sea life. This bay is enjoyed by the local community and the many tourists who visit over the summer months including swimmers, divers and surfers. Evidence already shows devastation to sea life and visible pollution to the water and beaches. We must act now to stop the dumping of toxic silt in this beautiful coastal area. A deeper and safer alternative site has been identified much further out to sea in deeper waters which they could use instead of dumping so close to shore, in such a small, beautiful and much loved bay.
