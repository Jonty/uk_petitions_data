        "additional_details": "Many government IT projects aim to provide public services via the internet, or improve existing services through the use of the internet. These projects are bid on by big companies and their budgets sometimes end up in the millions and billions of pounds for no apparent reason. No such project should ever have to reach that kind of spend.\r\nAll proposals of high budget IT projects should pass through a panel of independent professionals from the private sector who are experienced in running large scale internet start-ups. Those professionals know how to deliver projects in that scale at a fraction of the price and therefore can pick up the flaws in the proposals that can hike costs to unacceptable levels.\r\nThis can save billions of pounds which would otherwise be lining the pockets of big corporations without providing any value to the public.\r\nJust Google \"failed government it projects\" to get the picture.",
