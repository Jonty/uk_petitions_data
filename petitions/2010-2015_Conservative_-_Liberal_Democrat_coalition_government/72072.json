        "additional_details": "It was widely reported that the O2 arena in London was using anti terror legislation and hightened response levels to stop people bringing their own snacks and drinks into the O2 arena. Thus allowing blatent profteering on a captive audience.\r\n\r\nIt should be made illegal to hide blatant greed behind legislation designed to to stop terrorism. If this is not done then the terrorist have 'won' by proxy as they have created enough 'concern' such that normal activities can be given sinister overtones.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to blatently profit ... be honest and say, 'we do not allow you to bring in your 60p can of drink because we want to charge you \u00a34.50'. Do not use terror laws to justify your greed.\r\n\r\nThe Government should protect its terror legislation by prosecusting maliscous use of the legislation for the beneift of the country. Nobody should profit from terrorism!",
