        "additional_details": "On the 21st of June 2014, the world wide known Leicester band Kasabian ( who aren't part of this petition as this is written) performed a hugely successful one off gig to 50,000 people, both hometown fans and apparently people who travelled a long way to see them . By all accounts , local businesses did very well with much increased trade, and mainly a huge sense of unity was achieved. Leicester has an O2 academy, and the De Montfort Hall, along with the likes of Firebug Bar, Soundhouse, The Donkey, The Musician etc, which shows the town has a great amount of desire for live music, and it'd be great to be able to compete with neighbouring towns with larger venues, keeping the money spent here, and bringing in visitors",
