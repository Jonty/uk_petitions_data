        "additional_details": "At the moment if you have taken tuition fee loans for one degree you are not eligible for tuition fee loans again. This makes it expensive if you decide to go back to education later in life.\r\n\r\nAt \u00a39k a year it is very difficult for someone wanting a career change to self-fund a full time degree. Retraining as a doctor would require the student paying \u00a345k themselves. Yet there is a definite benefit to society for them to retrain.\r\n\r\nI propose tuition fee loans are available to prospective students for their second degree on a degree by degree basis.",
