Our current system of voting for Parties and/or Politicians that one may like, or have followed since childhood, is out-dated; and moreover we allow the same myopic, egocentric Politicians (regardless of Party) to run our Nation. WE should run the country, with Utilitarian ideals: implemented by the people, ONLY for the GOOD of the people. ",
