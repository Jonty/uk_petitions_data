        "additional_details": "The current speed limit within most residential areas is 30mph which is excessive when considerations are given to the increased likelyhood of interactions between vehicles and pedestrians in such areas.\r\n\r\nReducing the speed limit on such roads to 20mph increases the likelyhood of survival in the event of an accident between a motor vehicle and those on foot.\r\n\r\nIt's a fairly simple change to implement and would result in fewer unnecessary RTA's.\r\n\r\nThe government should look at this proposed policy in a pro-active rather than re-active manner.\r\n",
