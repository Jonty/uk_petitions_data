Britain is NOT broken and NOT in moral decline.  Politicians who keep saying the opposite take away our confidence and make us look bad to the rest of the world. The government should make sure they do not give us a terrible image and should find out why all this has happened, then DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  ",
