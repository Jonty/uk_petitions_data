Present day politicians simply do not have the integrity, probity, basic honesty nor honour for us to be sure that when he or she uses the Royal Prerogative to overrule parliament, he or she is not merely doing it to further his or her own interests on the world stage.  Prime Ministers MUST be constrained to having the Prerogative available to them ONLY when it's use has a DIRECT bearing against a DIRECT threat to the UK.",
