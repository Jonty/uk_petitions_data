        "additional_details": "We, the signatories on this petition, demand an immediate review of legislation in relation to \u201cNeighbours From Hell\u201d. Currently, police, councils and housing authorities claim that they are powerless to act against anti-social behaviour emanating from within the home. It is left to the victims to collect evidence and pursue action, but any subsequent court orders are ineffective; nominal and unenforced. The victims often move (at their own expense if they are privately housed), with the culprits left to terrorise the remaining neighbourhood. Working days are lost, the mental health of victims deteriorates and anti-social bullies infer that they are untouchable. We request the introduction of a system which will prioritise the victims and not the offenders and promote civilized courteous behaviour. ",
