        "additional_details": "Most school or university leavers face the frustration of being unable to get a first job in their chosen field, simply because businesses will not employ them without previous experience. Even so-called \"trainee\" positions often tacitly require experience.\r\n\r\nThe irony is that employers in many industries complain of a skills crisis. It is those same employers who are unwilling to take on new workers and give them a chance to develop relevant skills.\r\n\r\nWe propose that ALL employers (private and public sector) with a workforce of 10 or more be required by law to recruit a certain number of inexperienced staff each year - unless they have no turnover of existing workers and no incentive to expand. 1 trainee to every 10 experienced workers would be supportable.  These mandated junior staff would receive a reduced wage for their first 6 months of employment, and can be replaced if they are not performing satisfactorily after that time.",
