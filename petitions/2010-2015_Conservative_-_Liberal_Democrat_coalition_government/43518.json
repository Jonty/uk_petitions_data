        "additional_details": "At present, commercial wind farms are inefficient and require subsides to even survive. Not only that, they destroy the landscape and the noise produced make life a living hell for those unlucky enough to live near them.\r\n\r\nThese subsides, in reality, amount to state funded destruction of the landscape. Wind turbines are also inefficient, and require backup power stations for when the wind doesn't blow. The only people who benefit from this are some landowners who want to grab as much money as possible from the government.\r\n\r\nSubsides for commercial wind farms should be withdrawn, and the money used to increase subsides for other forms of green energy which do not destroy the landscape for everyone, including, but not limited to, solar power and smaller micro wind turbines which can be fitted to buildings.",
