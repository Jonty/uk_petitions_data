        "action": "Standardise UK Women's Clothes Sizes",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the UK Government to enact legislation requiring all manufacturers, designers, and marketers of women's clothing sold in the UK to begin standardising the sizing of women's clothing. The aim to stay within a certain size range can trigger many women to engage in behavior symptomatic of eating disorders.  Whether we like it or not, women\u2019s self-esteem and body image hinges on the size she wears.  The varying sizes from different brand labels, all claiming to be the same, needs to change.  Women's clothing should be sold in measurements just like men's garments.  Women will be more eager to shop and purchase clothes, if sold by measurements (waist/ hips /bust size). Government of the UK, we urge you to take this small step, creating and enacting legislation standardising the size labels of women's clothing, as one step in the right direction towards happier and healthier women.",
