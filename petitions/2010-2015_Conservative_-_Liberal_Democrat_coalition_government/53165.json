This is due to the UN needs more funds as the make shift camps have become over crowded and their is more humanitarian funding needed for food and shelter and medicines for the 1 million refuges.\r\nI also urge the government to put pressure on other countries around the world through the UN to contribute towards the humanitarian aid which is needed for the Syrian refuges and those who are trapped in Syria. Countries must work collectively to end the Humanitarian issues which are now arousing as the Syrian conflict is in it's second year.\r\n",
