All the companies have various tariffs for the same product.\r\n\r\nThere should be one taffif for each company. Everyone should pay the same rate to their particular utiliy company and there should not be cheaper rates for some and not others.\r\n\r\nThere should be real competition in the market place, if there were then the prices would come down.\r\nGovernment should legislate for this and have the power to recind licences to utility companies and impose heavy fines.  Its time to stop ripping off the UK public!",
