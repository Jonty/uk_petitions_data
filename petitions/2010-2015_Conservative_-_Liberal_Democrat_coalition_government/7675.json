        "additional_details": "In view of the current violence and rioting now taking place and recently with the Student riots, it's time for Continental style riot control measures to be introduced in the UK as a matter of course and not as an absolute last resort as appears to be the case.  By this, I mean the use of Water Cannon, Tear Gas, Rubber bullets, indelible marker sprays, use of Army personnel as appropriate.  The level of violence now being demonstrated is affecting lives, property, peoples jobs and safety. The right to peaceful protest in a democracy is paramount, but these riots are about anarchy and destruction . Lawful people have a right to be protected, by the use of responsible but decisive force where necessary.",
