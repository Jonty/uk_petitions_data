This is excessive and the associated staffing costs are causing Childcare in the UK to be the most expensive in Europe. Prohibitive childcare costs are forcing young Mothers out of work and into a lifetime of dependence on benefits, adding to Britain's crippling welfare burden.  Nurseries. facing excessive staffing costs due to this rule, are forced to cut back on quality in order to keep their fees at a level people can pay.
