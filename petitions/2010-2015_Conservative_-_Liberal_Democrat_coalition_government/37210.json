        "action": "Reevaluate government award of North West rail franchise",
        "additional_details": "FirstGroup has been awarded the franchise of the west coast mainline merely on financial grounds and the company will have to find \u00a3390m of excess profits each year to give back to the Transport Department. The RMT trade union warned that First were considering decreasing the running costs on the line through severe cuts to onboard catering - of about 20% -to achieve their higher premium payments .FirstGroup's shares fell by 9.5% on 15 August, the day the deal was announced.\r\n\r\nThe business model underlying FirstGroup 's bid is problematic and may result in ticket prices increases and decreased customer service shortly after the beginning of the franchise period. Sadly, passengers will be the ones who will have to pay and suffer the consequences of an ill-founded choice if this happens.\r\n\r\nIf you wish that the bid be reevaluated and FirstGroup make their business plan explicit and accountable to the public, sign this petition.\r\n",
