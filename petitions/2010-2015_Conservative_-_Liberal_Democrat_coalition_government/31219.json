        "additional_details": "Recycled paper could be used in the production of instruction manuals, recycled metals in everything from electronic products to jewellry, even old car tyres can be used in creating certain types of plastics.\r\nAlmost everything can be recycled and these recycled items can be used in almost all products people buy and use everyday. Yet only a small number of companies use any kind of recycled or sustainable materials at all. Using recycled materials would reduce the amount of waste in landfills and envionmental damage caused by the production of new materials such as plastic or rubber. Using sustainable materials will reduce the environmental damage caused by deforestation and mining.\r\nUsing at least 25% may not sound like a lot but it is a start and its a goal every company can easily acheive.",
