        "additional_details": "Being allergic to nuts, I find it frustrating that the vast majority of food claims to at least have a possibility of containing nuts. If I didn't eat anything labelled as \"may contain traces of nuts.\" I would eat hardly any processed food. I find it incredible that food companies are allowed a get-out clause that essentially avoids penalties if their food causes someone to have an allergic reaction because something not in the ingredients list is present.\r\n\r\nI also think that if it does contain nuts it would be useful for food companies to be specific on the allergy advice and say which specific types of nuts.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, I would like the Government to consider introducing legislation to make sure that only items intended to be in products are allowed in allergy advice boxes, and to force food companies to be specific about the types of nuts the product contains.",
