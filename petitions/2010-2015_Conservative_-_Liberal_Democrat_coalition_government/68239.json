        "additional_details": "It has become the norm for schools to arrange for certain items of school uniform to be branded with their logo, available only for purchase from a single retailer.\r\nThis raises financial issues for many as these items are priced above uniform that can be purchased from the High Street.  It is also normal practice for these items to be available only via the Internet,  creating further costs with regard to postage.\r\nIt has just cost me \u00a360 for 2 jumpers (which are of poor quality), and 3 polo shirts for my child.  I could have purchased similar items from the high street for approximately \u00a335.\r\nThis means that hard working families, and those on benefits struggle to buy such items, and in some cases leaves them unable to buy other essentials.\r\nI would like all those who disagree with the monopolisation of school uniform by schools to sign this petition, and hopefully bring down the cost of school uniforms.\r\n",
