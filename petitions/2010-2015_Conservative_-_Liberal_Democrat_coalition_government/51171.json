        "additional_details": "Government should reintroduce a previously scrapped target for GP's to see a patient within 48 hours.  Many GP's are working only around 4 hours a day resulting in patients having to wait up to two weeks for an appointment.  The inability to see a GP within a relatively short period of time for non emergency appointments puts pressure on other services like A & E departments as conditions worsen while waiting to see a GP.  If a GP surgery has a waiting time of 10 days then clearly the GP should increase their hours to address this. ",
