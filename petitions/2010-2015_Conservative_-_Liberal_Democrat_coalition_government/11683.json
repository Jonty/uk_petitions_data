        "additional_details": "The govt should stop paying child related benefits ( child benefit/ tax credits/income support etc) for any child after the 3rd. Then we can do something about reducing the over population, stop the benefit class from having a child just to avoid having to get a job. We need to stop families having multiple children and earning more in benefits than hard working people . It would cut the pressure on social services in dealing with neglected children as a result of overcrowded households .  IF YOU WANT MORE THAN 3 KIDS THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO FINANCE THEM YOURSELVES AND NOT RELY ON THE TAXPAYER FOR A LIFETIME OF HANDOUTS.\r\nexisting claimants would be excluded but we can discourage them having anymore because they cant have anymore benefits.",
