        "additional_details": "We, the majority population of Northern Ireland and mainland UK, demand that  the Union Flag, is flown from Belfast city hall, each and every day of the year. We must have parity of esteem and the same rights and freedoms to express our cultural identity, as any other citizens of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nNo other British city or town would be allowed to ban the flag of our country and Belfast's majority population, share that view.\r\n\r\nThe decent hard-working people of Ulster are being dictated to, by among others, bombers, murderers and vicious bigots. We ask that the flag in which our ancestors fought and died for, is restored to its rightful place, on top of Belfast city hall.\r\n\r\nWe do not seek to antagonise other religions or those who do not share our views, we merely seek the reinstatement of the British flag, on top of a British city hall.",
