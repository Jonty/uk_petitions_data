        "additional_details": "Hi, this petion is to make OFCOM (UK) force the telephone providers in the UK to provide the services they advertise.\r\nThis petition was started due to the false selling promises of internet (including mobile interent) providers to actually provide the speeds and serive they have sold their customers.\r\nThis is particularly due to \"throttling\" or \"restricting the upload (and often download) speeds of the customers connections on purpose.\r\nThis IS NOT THE FAULT of the technology in place, but rather an intentional \"reduction\" in service to benefit the companies costs.\r\nThis should be covered under the trading standards act, but however, it is often never regulated or inforced.\r\nThe scapegoat for these companies is \"passing the buck\" or claiming that you, or your phone or computer are the source of the problem when in actual fact, they know that the problem is related to their throttling and speed restrictions.\r\nif it was any other industry it would have amounted to fraud.",
