        "additional_details": "I read the government are thinking of culling grey squirrels from 2015.i think its cruel.they are blaming the squirrels for causing damage to trees which is untrue.the squirrels need to grind down their teeth because they don't stop growing.plus they have been referred to as vermin & pests.untrue again.i read they are one of the clean rodents.this government amongst other people have never fully accepted the greys because they are not native to the UK.they were introduced to this country in the 1800's which is a long time & last of the squirrels bring me joy.i got squirrels popping into my garden everyday.been feeding them for nearly 2 years now.i do suffer with depression etc & having them around makes my life bearable.to have them culled would upset me & affect my mental health.my GP & psychologist both said its healthy to be around animals.i can't afford a domestic pet.the squirrels is all I have.please sign the petition ",
