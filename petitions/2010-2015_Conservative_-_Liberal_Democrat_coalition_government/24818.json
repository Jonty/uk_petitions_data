        "action": "Handheld mobile phone use when driving should carry at least the same penalty as drink driving.",
        "additional_details": "It has been repeatedly shown that use of a handheld mobile phone when driving is as dangerous, or even more dangerous as drink-driving.  Mobile phone use (handheld or otherwise) is a factor in tens of thousands of accidents each year (see RoSPA and other studies) and handheld use while driving is illegal.  It is also epidemic and amounts to \u201cstandard practice\u201d for many drivers in the UK.\r\n\r\nDespite the proven danger of using a phone while driving, the maximum penalty is much lighter than for drink-driving and the practice is commonplace.\r\n\r\nI propose that the penalty for using a handheld mobile phone in any manner should attract the same penalty or greater than for drink-driving.\r\n",
