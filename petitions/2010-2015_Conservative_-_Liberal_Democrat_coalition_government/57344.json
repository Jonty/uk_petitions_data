        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon the govenment to introduce a requirement for all universities to offer a course in financial, statistics and business skills to all undergraduate students not studying a business related degree.\r\n\r\nFar too many graduates are leaving universities totally unprepared for the work place and with an unrealistic idea about the world of work. A course in finance and basic business skills would enable them to be more useful to potential employers regardless of their subject and regardless of their chosen career.\r\n\r\nThe ability to understand basic accounting, statistics and business skills, such as negotiating and presenting, will reduce the numbers of students who graduate to the 'dole queue'. It would also encourage universities to provide a more useful education that is grounded in the needs of all organisations be they large or small, or even private or public.\r\n\r\nToo many graduates say that \"they don't do numbers\" it is time to stop that endemic attitude.",
