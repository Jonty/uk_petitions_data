        "additional_details": "On 2nd October 2014 Sky News correspondent  Martin Brunt stalked out Brenda Leyland outside her house following comments that she made towards the McCanns on twitter.\r\nFollowing this intrusion and threats from Brunt that she was to be investigated by Scotland Yard, she was forced from her home and found dead today 5th October 2014 in a Leicestershire hotel room. It is our belief that the actions of Sky News and Martin Brunt have resulted in the death of Brenda Leyland and that Sky News should be investigated for corporate manslaughter",
