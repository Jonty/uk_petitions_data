Question 1: Which Chairman was Communist ruler of China from 1945-1976?\"\r\n\"Meow!\"\r\n\"Correct. Question 2: What name did the press give to street drug Mephedrone during a moral panic in 2009?\"\r\n\"Meow Meow!\"\r\n\"Correct. Final question. What noise does a cow make?\"\r\n\"Meooooooowwww!\"\r\n\"Ah, you dropped the ball on that one. Tough luck. Guess you're going hungry, huh?\"\r\n\r\nit's just not fair. no cat could possibly answer all three  questions correctly. John must acknowledge his sadistic nature and think of a better third question so that his delightful moggy can get fed.\r\n\r\nthank you for your time.",
