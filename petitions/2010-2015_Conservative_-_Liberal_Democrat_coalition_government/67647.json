        "additional_details": "Introduce legislation to force internet and phone providers (Orange, EE etc) to provide alternative options for switching providers other than by phone. When customers try to leave these companies, they are quite often subject to pressure tactics and abuse. This needs to stop. There is no reason not to offer customers the option to leave their provider via the internet (O2 already do this.) I feel that vulnerable customers are being exploited by having to speak to aggressive sales people on the phone. THIS MUST STOP.",
