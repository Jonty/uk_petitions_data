As this was family court and not Criminal court he was permitted to walk out and continue as he pleased (This is not Justice and another example of how paedophiles are protected in out community I assure everyone reading this that I take no pleasure in this and I apologise for any upset this may cause anyone. I'm sure though that everyone with agree that Paedophiles need to be publicised for exactly what they are. My thoughts also go out to the two little boys who this monster abused (I have it on good authority these boys were taken in to care, adopted, and now have happy lives)\r\n\r\nIf you are found to have abused children in family court or criminal court the punishment needs to be hard and publicised....... The abused children should be given justice and protection not the animals who abuse them",
