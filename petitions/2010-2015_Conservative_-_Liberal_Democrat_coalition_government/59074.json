        "additional_details": "To have traffic calming measures to Dulley Avenue, Wellingborough NN8 2PS. Between the hours of 8-9.30am and 3-4.30pm that dulley avenue is one way to traffic. This is a very narrow road within a residential area and a very busy primary school with preschool attached. During school drop off and pick up times this road becomes very dangerous with cars mounting the pavement to get by each other. Totally blocking the road and generally becoming extremely dangerous to the children, parents and residents using the road. We feel that the above measure would make the road a much safer place for the children to arrive and leave school.",
