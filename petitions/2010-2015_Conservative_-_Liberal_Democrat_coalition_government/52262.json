        "additional_details": "Its time the UK woke up to the fact that there are huge scams going on in the Legal Aid system.\r\nMany foreigners who have never paid a penny in taxes in the UK are getting thousands of pounds worth of free legal aid. This is aided and abetted by bent lawyers many of whom are recent immigrants themselves and keen to milk the public purse.\r\nThere should be NO LEGAL AID WHATSOEVER for non UK nationals for any reason.\r\nThis would allow the UK to deport many undesirable criminals and by pass the dubious Human Rights Laws.",
