        "additional_details": "Contrary to belief, many people on benefits are genuine claimants. The changes to the system mean that the most vulnerable live in a system of fear, intrusion and poverty, made by wealthy people with little understanding of the reality of those on low incomes. We call on a system which is fair, makes one better off for working, and assists claimants into finding the right work, realising that work is not appropriate for all (eg some ill/disabled). We ask that the cuts and caps be repealed. They are already causing poverty and anxiety, and homelessness. Money can be found - but it is prioritized elsewhere. DWP and local authorities shoud have to action claims and clanges more quickly, and not be able to suspend benefits as an alternative to actioning claims in a timely manner.",
