        "additional_details": "Do you believe it is right that you could be fined because you don't read with your child every night? Or because they don't hand their homework in on time? And that your child's Head Teacher may have no choice in fining you?\r\n\r\nThat is what OFSTED and The Education Minister are planning.  Because to them there's no excuse and working class white families are the culprits.\r\n\r\nWe're not saying it's ok to ignore your child's educational needs, what we're saying is that taking a 'fixed penalty notice' approach is definitely NOT the answer. It's just another pocket liner for the Department!\r\n\r\nDid your parents read with you every night? Did you get your homework in on time consistently? AND DID YOU TURN OUT OK? Put a stop to normal parents being punished for not fitting into Sir Michael and Mr Gove's perfect parent mould!\r\n\r\nSAY NO TO 'SO CALLED' BAD PARENT FINES!",
