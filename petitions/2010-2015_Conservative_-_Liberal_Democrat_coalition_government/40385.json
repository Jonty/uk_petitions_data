Born and Bread in Scotland... and that is how i wish to stay......\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you think that the UK should hold a General Election BEFORE the Scottish Referendum on Independance.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that all votes counted would be submitted by electors who are entitled to vote according to UK Law.\r\n\r\nThis is relevant to ALL UK citizens, not just to us in Scotland.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the SNP are voted to remain the leading party in Scotland then the referendum should go ahead.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, If the people of Scotland vote in another party then the referendum should be cancelled.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US - PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION\r\nWE NEED 100,000 VOTES!!!!\r\n\r\n.",
