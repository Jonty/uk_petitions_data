But there is a lack of leadership (or perhaps its just self interest) in changing pension arrangements to Member of Parliament. This government has said we are all in this together but this doesn't appears to be the case. Surely if the country can't afford public sector pensions as they stood then it can't afford not to change the pensions of MP's.",
