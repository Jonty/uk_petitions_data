        "additional_details": "Vandals enjoy breaking things which is why they do it.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that a fitting punishment for such people would be stone-breaking at a quarry, a barracks or a prison.  They could be given a few tons of stone and a hammer and be told that they would not be released until the stone had been made small enough to fit through a sieve with one inch holes.  This would truly be a case of making the punishment fit the crime. As to Health and Safety, gloves and eye protection spectacles are not expensive.",
