NF-1 causes tumors along the nervous system. NF-1 often comes with scoliosis (curvature of the spine), learning difficulties, eye problems, and epilepsy.We demand that the Government sets up a dedicated fund to aid research into a cure for this disease which effects 25000 people in the UK and the sufferer can have a 50% chance of passing it onto their children. By aiding research in to possible treatments/cures generations of sufferers could have a better quality of life and not be reliant on palliative care.",
