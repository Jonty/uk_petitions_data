        "additional_details": "A senior Labour party ministerial speechwriter has said that his party had a quite deliberate policy of encouraging mass immigration \"It didn't just happen: the deliberate policy of ministers .. was to open up the UK to mass migration\" http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do , but \"ministers wouldn't talk about it\". because they didn't want \"their core voters\" to know. This has since been denied, admitted, justified and half denied. I propose that Parliament debate and vote on having a full inquiry into whether this did happen and whether the British people were not told of it. Led by a lawyer with a record of being both apolitical and not coming up with politically convenient conclusions, held in public with proceedings televised & evidence taken under oath from politicians, civil servants and anybody else whose testimony might inform to determine if this happened and if so the extent and those involved.\r\n",
