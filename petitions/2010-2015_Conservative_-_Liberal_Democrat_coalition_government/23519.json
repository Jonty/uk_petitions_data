Many of the public think that this is disgusting and want to act. Not only can they be temporary realised from prison but many prisoners do not serve their full sentence.\r\nWe need to change the law, and we need to change how the justice system works. Us the undersigned want a fair and equal justice system, and for all prisoners to serve the full prison sentence, and for the temporary release licenses to be abolished.\r\n",
