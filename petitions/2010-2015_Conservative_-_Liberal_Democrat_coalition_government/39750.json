        "additional_details": "As a A-level student feel modular examinations are needed. They break down the content of work for students and give them a date to work towards. Changing the current system will not only cause a decrease in students passing but will also reduce students' work ethic. Focusing across a period of two years is difficult, and some students will not be able to do it. Modular exams are necessary for the success of students in our nation. ",
