It should be included in the theory test, and tv adverts should run to educate ith the rider and the driver. To show importance of wearing high visability, and using correct signals to inform drivers of where you are going and what you are doing. To show drivers what can happen to horse and rider if they pass to close too fast, or reve up the engine.
