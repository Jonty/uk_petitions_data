Most notably the holidays lack and correlation with say schools which were recently described as  having holidays which date back to an \"agricultural economy\".\r\n\r\nEqually more accountability should be sought after all these are the people that are making decisions that affect everyone in the country. Why should public sector workers be made more accountable and undermined at every turn and demoralized when ministers of various departments have extended holidays and make ridiculous poorly reasoned comments.",
