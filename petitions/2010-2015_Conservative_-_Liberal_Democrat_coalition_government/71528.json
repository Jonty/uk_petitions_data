Ask yourself why ? From Asians to whites the man has consistently failed to act to protect weak, vulnerable and exploited children. 13,000 reports. We all know what that means in real terms. Those kids have a lifetime of horrors and nightmares to relive for the rest of their lives, mainly alone. Does he care ? If he did the man would fall on his sword, but doesn't. Again ask yourself why ? The Police Crime Commissioner hasn't sacked this incompetent belligerent ideologist. The kids aren't safe whilst that man is in charge !   ",
