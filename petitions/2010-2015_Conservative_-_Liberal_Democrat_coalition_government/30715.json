        "additional_details": "Children with high functioning autism are not always being given equality within the education system.  We believe that this equates to disability discrimination against our children.  Parents are fighting to get statements of SEN for children and being rejected on a regular basis, children are being denied specialist schools due to funding issues.  Importantly many children with high functioning ASD's are not in school regularly as they are unable to manage.  These children are denied local special school education due to having an average or above average IQ and academic level.  This is unfair, our children are often suffering mental health issues due to being the proverbial 'square peg in a round hole' . This is unfair and unnecessary.  We want better and more effective provision for our children wherever they live.",
