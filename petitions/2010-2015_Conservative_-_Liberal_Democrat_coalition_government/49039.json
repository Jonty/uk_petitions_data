        "additional_details": "Taxing alcohol benefits society hugely. It alters the consumption of alcohol, which does have huge negative externalities when consumed irresponsibly, from where it would be without tax to closer to the socially acceptable level.\r\n\r\nThe problem with doing this is that it's unfair on those that DO NOT ABUSE OR ALLOW THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL. Those of us that drink responsibly with friends are heavily penalised, as are other stakeholders.\r\n\r\nPubs and quality alcohol retailers, many of whom are based in the UK and provide skilled and often traditional jobs, are UNFAIRLY AFFECTED because a small group of people abuse alcohol.\r\n\r\nTo impose a two tier tax on alcohol, whereby those who had committed public order offences or caused consistent problems to the NHS would be TAXED MORE THAN THE AVERAGE RESPONSIBLE PERSON.\r\n\r\nThis could easily be done by issuing an ID like card to those who have NOT ABUSED ALCOHOL ENTITLING THEM TO PAY A LOWER RATE OF TA THAN THOSE WHO HADN'T.",
