        "additional_details": "Baroness Warsi has never been elected and had done nothing to deserve the title given to her. She is allowed to sit in the Lords for the primary reason that she is a female muslim. Now that she had resigned due to being un patriotic and more loyal to her religion than country she should be stripped of her title and any privilages given to her. This opinion is shared as I am sure by many people. As a member of the Tory party I express great anger at her appointment and want her stripped of all privilages and titles.",
