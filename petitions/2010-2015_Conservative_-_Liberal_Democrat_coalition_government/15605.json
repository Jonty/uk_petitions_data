        "additional_details": "The popularity of e-petitions stands in stark contrast to the declining membership of political parties.  People think about politics in terms of issues not parties.  They care about particular subjects and have informed opinions about them.  They want to have their say on these issues; they don\u2019t want to choose between manifestos that may not cover these issues at all.  We need to reform Parliament so that it better reflects the way in which people think about politics.  The Government should establish a third chamber (the National Council) in which individuals or groups, with enough public support, could present their experience and advice to Government.  We could hear from the Royal British Legion about the needs of retired soldiers, the National Union of Teachers about schools and the Royal College of Nursing about hospitals.  This would make our legislative process more democratic and informed and would help restore Parliament\u2019s prestige by bringing it closer to the people.",
