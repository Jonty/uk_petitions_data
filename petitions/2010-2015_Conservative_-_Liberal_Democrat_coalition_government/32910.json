        "additional_details": "I think this is a great idea, which would solve the issues, that are faced within unemployment and those that are not happy with the pension age of which we have to retire.\r\nIt is a known fact that people who are rich live longer.  I for one do not want to work to the age of 67.\r\n I want to actually enjoy my retirement along with everyone else.\r\nSo lets give the youth of today their jobs back, so that we can retire at an earlier age.  This is the action i want the government to take. As unemployment for youth , leads to   frustration, lack of hope, depression and  crime. With the older generation dying before they retire.\r\nJoin with me as we petition the government, on this very important issue which affects the young and the older generation",
