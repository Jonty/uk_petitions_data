There is no solid ground as to why the fee need to be increased. Any tier1 who applied with old fee must be at the same fee, there is no change in the tier1 procedure so the expenses incurring to UKBA are same.\r\n\r\nTier1 who are applying for extension or ILR must not be forced to pay more. They already pay tax and contribute to UK system same way as any other responsible citizen does. There is no point why they must pay increased fee.\r\n\r\nSo, the fee must same for any Tier1 extension or ILR or citizenship application for Tier1 who are already in UK.\r\n",
