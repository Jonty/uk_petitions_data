        "additional_details": "Commercial exploitation of our natural resources are far more propotionally responsible for diminishing Seabass numbers. Commercial Seabass fishing in well known and scientifically established nursery areas are excessively more damaging to Seabass stocks than recreational fishing could ever be.\r\nTherefore we would strongly recommend that limits and no-catch areas should be implemented on the commercial fishing fleet before any measures or limitations are placed on recreational fishing of Seabass. If Seabass populations do not significantly rise after these commercial limitations have been scientifically assessed over a reasonable time period... a bag limit of 2 Seabass per day for recreational fishing is proposed by this petition ",
