        "additional_details": "Child maintenance is an essential form of support for many families. It is well documented that the current system of making arrangements in the UK is ineffective, complicated and confusing.\r\n\r\nIt is time not only for an overhaul of the current system but for a national debate to improve the working practices and laws supporting the Child Maintenance Service in the UK for the future.\r\n\r\nWe are asking the government to halt government proposals whilst research is conducted in the form of an open debate seeking contributions from:\r\n\r\ncharities and non profits\r\nresident parents\r\nnon resident parents\r\ngrandparents and guardians\r\ncsa staff/magistrates and baliffs\r\nfamily law legal experts\r\nand most importantly children\r\n\r\nWe believe the results would see a positive shift in child maintenance arrangements and a reduction in costs to the public purse. This wealth of information would form a solid document that can then be used to create a maintenace service that works for everyone.\r\n",
