The site won't have the facilities to accommodate such large numbers, there will be no extra provision for schools, doctors or dentists. Traffic will increase into Welwyn and Hertford along the B1000 and the A414. The flora and fauna that thrive on the grassland at the moment will die out and the historic WWIII Panshanger Aerodrome will cease to exist.",
