A couple who earn \u00a349000 each with a joint income of \u00a388000 are unaffected, on these grounds your family are being unfairly discriminated against.\r\n\r\nAnother example based on European law; a national from another country sitting in the same office as you, earning the same money with the same amount of children would not be expected to pay additional tax against child benefit, therefore there is another case for discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the government are totally belligerent in this matter and are in direct violation of the Human Rights Act.\r\n",
