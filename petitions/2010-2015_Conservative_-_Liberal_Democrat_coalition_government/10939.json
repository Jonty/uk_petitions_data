We believe that such action is undemocratic and an infringement of our civil liberties. We recognise and applaud the role social media has played in helping oppressed peoples across the world in  throwing off the shackles of undemocratic , repressive and unelected regimes.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to give a binding pledge that he will not do this and will not allow the Police to carry out such action.",
