        "additional_details": "The threshold for the higher rate of Housing Stamp Duty has not changed to reflect the massive rise in house prices over recent years. The 3% figure currently starting at \u00a3250,000, should be increased to at least \u00a3350,000. This would allow families to move easier up the ladder thereby freeing up more housing for 1st time buyers and also stimulate the housing economy.",
