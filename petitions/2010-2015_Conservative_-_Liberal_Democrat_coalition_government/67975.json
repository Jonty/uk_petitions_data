        "additional_details": "This petition is in support of British MP David Ward who has been under attack for having the courage to voice the thoughts of the majority of Britains. We support his stance and demand he is kept in office. Removing him for stating an opinion is the opposite of \"freedom of speech\" and if he is removed then we will demand the removal of all politicians who have incited violence by supporting the Israeli regime in its current genocide. David Ward has our support and respect and we demand he retains his position in office. ",
