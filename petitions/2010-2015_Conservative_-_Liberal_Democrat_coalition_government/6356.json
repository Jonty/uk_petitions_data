        "action": "Remove UK speed cameras, restore traffic Police",
        "additional_details": "The Police should return to enforcing road safety laws through active intervention with motorists committing an offence, rather than relying on static speed (\"safety\") cameras. The experience of being stopped by traffic Police and admonished (and charged) for driving offences is a more powerful deterrent than a letter in the post, points and a fine, weeks after the offence. Police are able to use their discretion in cases which are not clear-cut, when cameras do not. Police are able to spot offences (such as tailgating and dangerous driving) which cameras cannot. An end to 'digital Policing' on the roads will restore trust in the Police, yield greater adherence to road safety laws, and be a more just approach to road safety enforcement. ",
