There is real urgency to this - the UK and the EU will miss targets for insulating homes and reducing carbon emissions without swift action to help customers do the right thing\r\n\r\nTherefore, the UK's largest home improvement retailer has launched an online petition for people to show their support and get the VAT reduced on green goods.
