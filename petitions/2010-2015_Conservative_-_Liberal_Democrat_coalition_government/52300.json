        "additional_details": "The British public are calling for a limit on Islam for the following reasons as it's being forced in our faces:\r\n\r\n. Halal meat being sold  and much being sold without being labelled as such.\r\n\r\n. Illegal Shariah law enforcement gangs patrolling certain areas causing fear and unrest due to threats of violence\r\n\r\n. Disrespectful marches against the country's police, soldiers, legal system and culture\r\n\r\n. Underground Jihad meetings and shariah law campaigners\r\n\r\n. Too many Mosques\r\n\r\n. Causing divisions in society due to wearing the burka/ veil, forming their own societies and forming their illegal Muslim courts\r\n\r\n. No respect or interest towards the British way of life, culture and society\r\n\r\n. Home grown terrorists being created due to brainwashing in extreme Islamic beliefs\r\n\r\nUrging the Government to look deep into what Islam is really doing to this country from the above reasons and must look into placing restrictions on the religion to stop more damage to the home culture.",
