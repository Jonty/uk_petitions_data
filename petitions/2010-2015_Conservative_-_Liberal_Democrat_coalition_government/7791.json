        "additional_details": "The deliberate and scandalous behaviour that has been seen on the streets of London which has now spread to other cities is as a result of an inadequate criminal justice system. The youths involved in the looting and rioting correctly understand that there is very little the law can do to stop them. Prisons are full and the individuals are quickly bailed to reoffend.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a state sponsored physical punishment or humiliation, such as \"the birch\" or indeed the reintroduction of \"the stocks\" are the types of short sharp punishments which would serve to be the deterrent which is needed.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to demand of the Government introduce these (or comparable) measures to ensure that our streets are rid of this mob rule and that suitable deterrent is quickly introduced in to law to save the very fabric of the nation.\r\n",
