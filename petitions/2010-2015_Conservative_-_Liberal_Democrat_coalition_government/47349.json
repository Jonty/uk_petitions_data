        "additional_details": "In October 2012, Lexi was born at Hillingdon Hospital and due to complications was left severely brain damaged after birth. Siobhan Rowland feels more could have been done to avoid complications associated with her risk factor. Suffering from Placental abruption, this led to Lexi being starved of oxygen. Siobhan had been sent home from hospital 4 days before. Lexi suffers from daily seizures and is dependent on a tube to receive medicines and nutrients that help keep her alive. Miss Rowland believes that if she was kept in hospital for monitoring after her initial visit, Lexi would now be a happy, healthy 5 month old baby. Siobhan has been advised she move into a new home, which will provide space the family need for Lexi and her equipment. \"Hillingdon council have not been helpful and have put me on a low priority list, meaning on Lexi\u2019s discharge date she will go into foster care until I am given a new home, adding to the stress we already are under\".",
