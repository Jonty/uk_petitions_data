        "additional_details": "David Starkey, historian and BBC presenter, has spoken the truth about culture, immigration and society.  However, there have been many calls for his dismissal, threatening his career and his  income.\r\n\r\nDuring the Reformation Era hundreds of thousands of people gave thier lives so that we may have freedom of association, thought and speech. It is therfore unnacceptable that threats can be made against individuals, merely for voicing an opinion.\r\n\r\nThose who seek to destroy those freedoms are treading upon our hard-won rights, and treading upon the graves of the heroes of the Reformation.  It should be against the law to make threats against those who excercise freedom of speech (as long as hatred or murder is not being urged).\r\n\r\n.",
