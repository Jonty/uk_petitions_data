You are probably thinking what has this got to do with us?\r\n\r\nMore loss of innocent civilian and soldiers lives on both sides!\r\nMore strain on our already weak economy!\r\nMore blood on the name of this once great country!\r\nMore refugees and asylum seekers heading for the UK/US.\r\nMore possibility of entering a third World War.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to have your voice heard then please sign the petition so we can let the government know that the public does not support another illegal War!!",
