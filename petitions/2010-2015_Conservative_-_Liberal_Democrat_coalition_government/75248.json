February I was astonished to see SKYNEWS and the BBC being used as a propaganda platform, to broadcast lies and inflationary allegations from CAGE against the people of Britain and our secrecy services in support of the world\u2019s most brutal, and evil Islamic murderer of innocent people (including aid workers).\r\nI was especially incensed that the uninterrupted airtime was used to blame Britain and the secrecy services for radicalization of the killers, and to speak positively of the killers past humanity.\r\nAs a law abiding citizen, in future I expect BBC and SKYNEWS to be severely prosecuted for giving any air time to the supporters of all murderers and especially Islamic Killers \u2013 this is not why I pay a license fee.
