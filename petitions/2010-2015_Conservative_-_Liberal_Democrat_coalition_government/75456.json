        "additional_details": "DEFRA must change AWA 2006 to ensure animals are regarded as sentient beings rather than property.. France just passed law recently that animals are recognized as sentient beings and not property  we Britain's  need to do what is right by classifying our animals and beloved pets as sentient beings. They are well aware of pain, love, hate,compassion for others as well as many others and not just our pets but for livestock as well.  We consider pets as family and very many of us share our beds with them. What better way to protect our animals from abuse than to recognize them as sentient beings and that anyone who would abuse them would be held accountable by the penal code for justice on their behalf! It's time for Britain to do something about it and bring us out of an older age where our pets are not merely property. You can't abuse a clock or chair but our beloved fur babies feel every punch and kick and basically scream and cry in pain. .Please sign and share\r\n",
