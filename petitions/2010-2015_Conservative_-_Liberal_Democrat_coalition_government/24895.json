However, Orange have announced to their customers (via text message) that they are raising their plan prices by 4.34% in January 2012.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners wish to end this as when entering into a written contract, the details should remain the same for the duration of the contract. It is unfair that the mobile phone companies are allowed to change the details of a contract without consulting the customer who is tied into the contract, yet if a customer wishes to change the details, it will involve paying a sum of money, or will simply be denied.
