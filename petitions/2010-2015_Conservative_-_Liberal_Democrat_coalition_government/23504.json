        "additional_details": "Westminster City Council has announced plans to amend the parking regulations for evening and weekend parking within Westminster from January 9th 2012. The new regulations would mean that free parking in Westminster after 6:30 p.m. during weekdays on both single yellow lines and parking bays would not be allowed until midnight and the same would also apply for all day Sunday. All motorists will be liable to pay the current rate of \u00a34.80 per hour for parking in Pay & Display bays. We believe that these new regulations are being brought in to raise more money for the council and therefore the council is acting in a way to make profit from both existing Westminster residents and non-residents visiting Westminster. The signatories of this e-petition would like the Government and specifically the Communities and Local Government Secretary to stop Westminster Council from going ahead with the proposed changes to the parking regulations which take effect on January 9th 2012.",
