The database should contain a photograph of the individual, the nature of the crime and the sentence imposed for all convictions that have a sentence tariff of more than three months in any institution.\r\nThe recent riots have resulted in members of communities and families reporting crimes based on CCTV and photographic evidence provided by the police. The police are active in providing such evidence to the public an it is proving to be an effective tool in bringing criminals to justice. Communities should know who the criminals are in their areas so that they can be vigilant. An individaul can apply to have their name removed from the database after a time proportionte to their sentence providing no futher crimes have been committed.\r\n",
