After over a decade of prolonged interventionist war that has done nothing more than to shift the balance of power in the region and cost countless of lives and trillions of pounds while the people of Britain are being taxed to the poor house. Our military stretched, finances can't afford it. Intervening will only make this conflict west against Muslim dragging us into yet another sectarian conflict we have no buisness being part of.",
