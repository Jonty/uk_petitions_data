        "additional_details": "The country needs to keep moving in order to generate growth, so I call for the fuel duty to be lowered to encourage this.  Further more, those in the rural parts of the UK are often unable to have much in the way of choice in regard to where they purchase their fuel and as such are held to ransom and often pay higher prices than those in the cities.  Since having a car is often a priority in rural areas, prices should be capped in rural areas to stop the unfair price difference between rural and urban areas.",
