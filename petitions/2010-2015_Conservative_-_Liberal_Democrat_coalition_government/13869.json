        "additional_details": "I propose a total ban on vehicles over 7.5 tons,overtaking   on 2 lane carriageways, due to the speed differential between vehicles being only a few mph, it can take miles for them to pass each other, which leads to congestion,driver frustation, in the vehicles following,and in my view is dangerous due to the\" bunching up\" effect of the queuing vehicles,\r\nIn my area a major motorway has trialled this for approx 3 miles and it works,however it is only over a short distance and at peak periods,\r\nThis needs to be a legal enforcable rule at all times.
