Food technology (teaching of nutrition, side-effects of over and under eating as well as learning healthy home-cooking) should be made compulsory for secondary schools in areas with high obesity or anorexic levels and voluntary in other areas. Advertising which manipulates the looks of a model (i.e. makes them thinner, \u2018airbrushes\u2019 them etc) should be banned in print media and only advertised on T.V. from 9pm \u2013 7am. Government guidelines should state that it is the responsibility of those in a \u2018position of authority\u2019 of a child (teacher, doctor, youth worker etc) to report whether they believe a child is being over or under fed from home. More guidelines may be added however at present there is not enough characters to go into further detail.",
