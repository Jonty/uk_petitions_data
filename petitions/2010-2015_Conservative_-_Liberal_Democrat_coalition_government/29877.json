        "additional_details": "The current EU rules for the use of Tachographs by\r\nprofessional drivers have been designed to create revenue.\r\n\r\nThe Tachograph represents a culture that is despised by the vast majority of drivers and companies, causing stress and financial hardship to both. Powers given to VOSA that include roadside collection of Machiavellian fines are entirely transparent forms of revenue collection. Using tachographs can lead to dangerous 'Beat The Clock' driving and are a significant form of distraction leading to stress induced fatigue and loss of concentration by drivers.\r\n\r\nFines are applied without consideration of any form, or sense of morality.\r\n\r\nDrivers of large vehicles should not have to endure rules that cannot possibly be applied to the congested, chaotic and car biased UK road network.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you care about the survival of UK Freight and Passenger transport industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
