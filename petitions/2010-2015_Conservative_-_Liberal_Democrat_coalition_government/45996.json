        "additional_details": "It is a gross immorality to take money from people who have already paid tax on it to fund the build up of HUGE pensions for local government employees.  There is ALSO the very useful consideration that council tax is intended to pay for services, if councils want to provide pensions for their employees they should fund the arrangements themselves.  COUNCIL TAX MUST NOT BE USED TO FUND EMPOLOYEE PENSIONS IT MUST BE RINGFENCED AND USED TO PAY FOR SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY.",
