        "additional_details": "At present, any DVLA recorded category C (substantially damaged) vehicle can be rebuilt and put back onto the road without any safety testing and it is the responsibility of the owner to ensure that the vehicle is safe to go back on the road.  If the vehicle has a current valid MOT test certificate it is not required to have the vehicle re-tested post repair.  In this case a pre-accident MOT certificate is worthless.  The only official check made at present is a Vehicle Identity Check and many poorly repaired and possibly unsafe vehicles are sold to unsuspecting buyers.\r\nI would like the DfT to void MOT certificates on all category C vehicles and introduce compulsory and thorough safety checking of repairs/vehicle (not MOT testing) of category C rebuilt vehicles at owners cost before they are permitted to go back on the road.\r\n",
