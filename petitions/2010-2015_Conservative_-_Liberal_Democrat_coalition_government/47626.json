        "additional_details": "Animals caught in snares suffer tremendous stress and very often sustain horrendous injuries. In their desperation to escape they can be disembowelled by the wire, wrench bones out of sockets and have even been known to chew off their own limbs. If by some miracle the animal (it is estimated that up to 69% of snare victims are non-target species, including beloved pets) manages to escape they will almost certainly die of infection as pressure necrosis sets in and causes deep wounds. We the undersigned, call on the government to ban the use, production and sale of ALL types of snare in the Uk.",
