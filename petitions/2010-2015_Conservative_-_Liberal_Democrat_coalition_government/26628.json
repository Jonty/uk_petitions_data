        "additional_details": "The petition to change the way benefits are paid, currently long term dole scroungers get their money paid direct into their accounts, this should stop and they should receive food vouchers instead, Their Rent, Rates,Bills are automatically covered by the Benefit System so the additional money they receive should be replaced with vouchers they can spent in Shops, these vouchers should only allow essentials to live and not be used for Booze, Cigerettes or luxury items such as deserts and sweets. If they want these items they then have to find a job so as to afford them. The benefit system is there to assist in bad times; currently people use it as a career.",
