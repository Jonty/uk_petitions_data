Those that are not warranted, not needed, not \u201cfit for purpose\u201d, not used for the intended purpose should be redirected to those in this Country who need immediate aid due to flood damage, cut back in NHS care and education etc. George Osborne  should not be cutting back on services for the residents here in order to fund overseas aid.  Any additional funding he deems justified should come from the redirected funds.",
