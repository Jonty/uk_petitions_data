        "additional_details": "We held a mock election in our school the other week for year 10 and 11 students. The vast majority had no idea what the parties stood for and what the there current manifesto's were. Many of them didn't even know who was in power. By increasing the education about politics and current affairs in school, it will allow young people to have there say. And with the current issue of lowering the voting age, there is no way that can happen with the current knowledge these students have.So I want the government to bring in a level of compulsary politics and current affairs, so the adults of the future have a leg to stand on.",
