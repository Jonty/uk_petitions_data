        "additional_details": "when my mother obtained car insurance recently, her premium has been raised.  she made a claim against a driver who injured her in an accident and was at fault.  when renewing her insurance it appears that ALL INSURANCE COMAPNIES are collaberatng and penalizing not at fault claimants in th same way they would treat at fault claimants.  THIS PRACTISE IS TREATS INNOCENT VICTIMS OF ACCIDENTS THE SAME AS THE PERSON CAUSING THE ACCIDENT, WHEN THEY NEXT APPLY FOR INSURANCE..... SHOCKING AND MUST BE STOPPED.  please sign this adn lets do something about this, as we could all be the innocent victim in an accident any time we take the road, and it would be unfair to be punished when renewing our insurance. ALL THE COMPANIES IN THE U.K. HAVE TAKEN PART AND THIS COLLABERATION MUST BE STOPPED.  to protect the innocent from loosing there good insurance records, and having their premiums raised through no fault of there own... PLEASE SIGN AND STOP THIS COLLABERATIVE INJUSTCE",
