        "additional_details": "I would like to create a single lorry lane for motorways. As someone that travels along two motorways in order to commute to work, lorries often slow the traffic levels down in times of congestion.\r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that lorries are limited to just 56mph, thus much slower than that of the national speed limit. Cars (which are the majority in comparison to lorries) are reduced to a single lane of  motorway, often swerving to avoid the out coming lorry (which coincidentally will not indicate till the last second or check mirrors) and slowing down traffic in the 3rd lane.\r\n\r\nI would like to mention I am not biased. I am just fed up of having my life endangered by the idiocy of others.\r\n\r\nI believe that the creation of said lane would enhance road safety and ease the congestion experienced on motorways the length and breadth of the UK.
