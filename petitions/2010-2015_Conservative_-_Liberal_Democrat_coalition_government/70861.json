This would prevent people who make offers on properties in good faith, (often unaware of the delays and consequences of the current lengthy process) being thrust into limbo with no  timescales or, in extreme circumstances unnecessarily long periods of homelessness, until the correct paperwork is in place.  The delay should be the seller's disadvantage as consideration for their ultimate financial gain, not the buyer's. ",
