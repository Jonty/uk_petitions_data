        "additional_details": "There is a popular campaign for rioters to lose all entitlement for benefits. However, despite it being a good idea, I don't think it will work. I therefore propose that should any person involved in civil disorder who is on benefits, then they & any of there immediate family who are also state dependant should be forced to work for the community in order to earn their benefits. It would pay the minimum wage & would involve weekend work so that they could look for a job during the week. It would be a minimum of 40 hours per week. This would help encourage social responsibility & help elevate the strain on public services.",
