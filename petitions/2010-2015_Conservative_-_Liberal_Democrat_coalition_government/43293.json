        "additional_details": "All Landlords must ensure their tenancy agreements state that tenants ''must take all reasonable steps to prevent any nuisance'' Should tenants fail to comply with their agreement then all landlords have a responsibility to regain possession of their property, under the Housing Act 1988 Section 8 which allows a landlord to seek possession using grounds 2, 8, 10 to 15 or 17 listed in Schedule 2 to the Act. Failure to do so means landlords can be held liable for the nuisance of its tenants.\r\nThose who behave anti-socially within their home and neighbourhood, are abusing the support that they may receive from society through benefits which should lead to the benefits being stopped.\r\nASB should be made a criminal offence. I would like the ASB Act 2003 to be amended and to include noise harassment as it currently does not and only covers statuary noise.\r\nBe a Voice for Victims of Anti-Social Behaviour, Noise Nuisance and Harassment - Sign this petition\u2026\r\nAlso on Twitter and Facebook!",
