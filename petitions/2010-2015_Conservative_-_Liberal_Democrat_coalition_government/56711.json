In 2011 there were 326 reports of domestic politicianry which 54% were mentally abused, 12% were sexually abused and 39% were physaically abused.\r\nWe want the government to also look at their visa policies and make sure that we can track people, who have entered the UK, to ensure that the work they moved over to do is as the job description described.\r\nHelp us stop politicianry in the UK today!\r\n",
