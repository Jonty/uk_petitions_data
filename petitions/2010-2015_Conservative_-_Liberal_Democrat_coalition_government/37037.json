        "additional_details": "The re-appearance of the red button after it has already been cleared from our tv screen has ruined the viewing of many football matches in recent years and its prominence during London 2012 could be viewed as a worse scandal than the empty seats we saw in at least two early events.\r\n\r\nWhy does the blimmin' thing re-appear if we simply touch a button on our remote controls?  We should not have to put up with the emotional scars of backing up on our Sky remotes (other digital TV providers are available) each time it appears.  Initial evidence suggests that an increased rate of broken down relationships across the country has coincided with the introduction of the red button.  This must stop now!\r\n\r\nAll we ask is that once it has been cleared once, the red button only re-appears if the red button, and only the red button, is pressed again.\r\n\r\nP.S. Changing the button to one of the other three colours available is not an acceptable solution",
