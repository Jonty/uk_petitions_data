        "additional_details": "The Government must increase the price of alcoholic drinks to reduce the harm it is causing society.  This has been effective in reducing smoking, quote from the World Bank (2011) about tobacco price increases: 'Children and adolescents are more responsive to changes in the price of consumer goods than adults-that is, if the price goes up, they are more likely to reduce their consumption.'  Alcohol is not a necessity, it can be fun, it can taste great but as a society we are self indulgent, drinking more than we realise or admit to leading to personality and behaviour changes, violence, accidents, hospital admissions, and poor health.  How can alcohol be cheaper than water?  A price rise is the most effective way of reducing alcohol consumption and its impact on society.  Prime minister do not bottle out of this one.  ",
