AHPs could save the NHS millions every year and free up primary care that is currently suffering under extreme workload pressures and stress.\r\n\r\nThe recent strive to promote integrated care makes the issue of AHPs even more important, as AHPs can often fill the important gap between primary and secondary care, as well as delivery a personalised approach to care that will benefit patients, healthcare workers and the NHS.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to hold an open and frank discussion on whether patients should have full access to all AHPs free at the point of use, in the same way that current treatment methods are funded and are easily accessible.\r\n",
