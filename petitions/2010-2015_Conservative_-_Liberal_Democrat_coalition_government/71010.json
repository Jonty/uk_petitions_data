        "additional_details": "I am concerned about the risk of banks and finance companies re-possessing our homes, in particular those who work for themselves are especially vulnerable, as they may not be covered by payment protection insurance. Another vulnerable group at risk of repossession are those who are at risk of loosing their homes as a result of ill health, unemployment or sudden unexpected crisis which occurs resulting in their homes being taken off them. One solution would be for the lenders to permit the mortgage borrower to stay in their homes until either their death, or market conditions are favourable to enable a sale to take place, and the lender to be reimbursed from the sale proceeds. The other alternative solution would be to reimburse the lenders from the capital gain made on the property at the death of the borrower. Please think carefully with regard to my suggestion. Do sign this petition if you agree with it.\r\nAlex Tennant",
