Some refuse any treatment, with others making their criteria's almost impossible to meet. With the cost of private IVF treatment nearly double what it costs the NHS, it is time to allow patients to benefit from this service by combining private and NHS treatments. Having personally offered to pay for the cost of required fertility drugs and donor sperm required, if my NHS trust complete the treatment only to be told that you can't combine private and NHS treatments. The condition which has resulted in me requiring fertility treatment, was diagnosed by the NHS and treatment to help is available on the NHS, but is being refused. TIME FOR CHANGE!",
