Benefits should not be a way of life but a means to get by when things are tough. Not for them to live a life of luxury. Why should hard working individuals pay for people on benefits luxury items when the average working person can't even afford them for themselves?\r\nTo stop this, give benefit claiments food vouchers / energy tokens instead of money.",
