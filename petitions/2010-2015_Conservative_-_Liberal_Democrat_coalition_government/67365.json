        "additional_details": "According to the Fourth Geneva Convention, to which Israel is a signatory, civilians are not legitimate targets in the course of war. This includes direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks against areas in which civilians are present. In addition, public and private property cannot be destroyed unless justified by military necessity. If civilian areas are deemed to be or contain legitimate military targets, and civilians are killed and property destroyed as a result, the strategic gain must be proportionate to the death and destruction caused.Israel has killed an appalling ratio of civilians to combatants of 9:1.\r\nTerrorism -- the act of targeting civilians and their property in order to pressure people and governments into making certain political choices -- is clearly illegal under the Geneva Conventions and immoral according to the mores of the modern civilized world.\r\n",
