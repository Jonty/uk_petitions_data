        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the Government to Act on the issue of Total Communication for deaf people, by implementating a new law. Hundreds of deaf people do not use sign language at all, and are ignored by the BSL lobby. So ANY communication: lipspeakers, notetakers, sign language interpreters or any other communication a deaf person desires, in any kind of setting, should be lawful. It is very bad for our health to be constantly battling for access wherever we go. Companies and Institutions give the excuse that they do not provide this \"kind of thing\". These excuses must end and a law implemented to force companies, great or small to provide support that the deaf person requires. Instances of serious mental health would be reduced,ie Doctor visits and hospital admissions. Better healthy deaf people means a healthier community. At present all deaf people are lumped together as being BSL users, this is NOT the case and the situation must change, for the good of the deaf community.",
