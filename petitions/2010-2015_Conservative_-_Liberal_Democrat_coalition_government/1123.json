Leaving would not be easy, but our economy would benefit hugely from leaving the EU and reverting to trade agreements with EU countries and the rest of the world. We would no longer have to suffer thousands of new laws emitting from Brussels, many of which have no relevance, or are actually damaging to the UK. A national referendum (which was promised - a promise that was broken) should be held asking the specific question: Do you want the UK to remain in the EU - yes or no?",
