        "action": "End Commercial Greyhound Racing in the UK",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to end commercial greyhound racing in the UK in a planned, phased and responsible way. We call for this for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n-\tgreyhound racing is a commercial industry driven by profit and the welfare of the dogs is not its top priority\r\n\r\n-\tas a result, thousands of dogs are abandoned each year when they are no longer of financial benefit to their owners\r\n\r\n-\tdue to the number of dogs abandoned it is not possible to rehome them all, despite the efforts of rescue charities\r\n\r\n- the fate of many is unclear. Some have their ears cut off to remove identifying tattoos. They are then killed and dumped\r\n\r\n- these problems are the direct result of the existence of the industry. It is totally unnecessary and - in a civilised, modern society - unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is unacceptable to treat dogs as disposable commodities bred solely for profit-making purposes, and we call on the government to bring this cycle of abuse to an end.",
