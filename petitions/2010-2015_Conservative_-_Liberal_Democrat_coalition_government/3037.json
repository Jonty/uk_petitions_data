        "additional_details": "In December last year, the Coalition Government raised the maximum tuition fee to \u00a39,000 a year for all students starting university in or after 2012. This ignored the possibility of using a graduate tax, which received support from the students. I think that given the recent problems with the bill, aka the Coalition promised that fees would be no more than \u00a36,000 would be used in \"exceptional\" circumstances and now the majority of universities are being approved for fees of above \u00a36,000, it's time to rethink that bill and to hold a public enquiry into the future funding of universities as to which is actually better - tuition fees or a graduate tax",
