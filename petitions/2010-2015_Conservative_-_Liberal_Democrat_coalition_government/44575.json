        "additional_details": "The National Lottery is going to increase the cost of a Saturday and Wednesday draw ticket to \u00a32 (thats 100% increase) in return for offering larger prizes.\r\nIn times of recession and huge job losses (especially in light of the collapses of Comet, HMV, Blockbuster to name a few) increasing the cost will be detremental to people already struggling with debt and despite massive odds against winning, people will be more likely to play given the larger prizes on offer. This also promotes the idea that gambling can make you rich when instead the country should be promoting work, job creation and entrepreneurship.",
