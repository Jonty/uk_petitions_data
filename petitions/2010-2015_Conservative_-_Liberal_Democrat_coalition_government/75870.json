        "additional_details": "We would like to divert the X17 Matlock-Chesterfield bus route each way,once in a morning and again in an afternoon, from the A632 at the top of Slack Hill, along Wirestone Lane to the B5057 and back to the A632 near the Peak Edge Hotel.\r\nThis occasional route could be called the X17-B & would be only 3 mins (Google Maps) longer than the usual X17 route.\r\nSeveral businesses including Darwin Forest Country Park, Peak Edge Hotel, Highfield Farm Shop, Matlock Farm Park & Stanedge Golf Club would benefit greatly.\r\nBy only diverting just twice a day, would have a minimal effect on the village of Kelsedge and the areas of the A632 where the X17 would continue to run through the rest of its times through the day. We are only asking to share this bus route once in a morning and once in an afternoon.\r\nPlease sign our petition & help a visitor attraction, plus other local businesses become more accessible to the their employees & the visiting public.",
