        "additional_details": "Royal Bank of Scotland bosses want to pay themselves astronomical bonuses from our taxes! But we can stop these fat cats swallowing more cream.\r\n\r\nDespite losing the bank \u00a3750 million in the last six months, RBS executives are spending a fortune lobbying the government and now want to get another \u00a3500m in bonuses! It\u2019s a scandal at a time when cuts are biting all of us AND George Osborne heads up the body that will negotiate the deal.,The Chancellor should be shamed into rejecting RBS\u2019s outrageous claim.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t have long to stop this offensive corporate greed -- RBS executives meet on WEDNESDAY. Let's deliver a deafening 100,000 strong petition to Osborne to force a drastic cap on RBS bonuses and ban the use of our money to lobby the government.",
