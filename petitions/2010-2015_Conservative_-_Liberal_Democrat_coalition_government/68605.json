        "additional_details": "Please help us prevent The Broadwalk caf\u00e9, Whitley Bay being demolished. The council have stated that they want to knock the caf\u00e9 down because they want to replace it with a kiosk to help improve the views and also that they have trouble securing good tenants to make the caf\u00e9 a success. Which are very poor reasons to demolish a lovely usable property/business.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share with as many people as possible to help save this lovely iconic Whitley Bay building.",
