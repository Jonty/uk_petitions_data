The best thing to help these babies survive is breast milk as it is an natural antibiotic for the baby and there are other advantages to. some mothers are not able to breastfeed or express their milk for the babies and have to had alternative feeds for premature babies. I am not saying that there are a bad mother for not being able to or even choosing not to breastfeed babies. i have been looking into milk banks ( breastfeeding mums donate there own milk to help mums that cant do it themselves and save babies life's). There are only 12 in the UK at the minuet which is not enough to my opinion.\r\n\r\n",
