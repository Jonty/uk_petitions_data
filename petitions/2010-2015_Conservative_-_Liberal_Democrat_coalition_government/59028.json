        "additional_details": "I am a 20 year old male, grew up in a normal working class enviroment. I began to go about with the wrong people at a young age and took part in minor offences which include assult, criminal damage and motor offences. This all happend before i was 18 years of age. I am now 20 years old and working towards a career in politics. I need to gain a degree in university which i will apply after my current access to higher education diploma.\r\n\r\nWhen making vital career choices, young men and women are limited and put off achieving goals because of thier ciminal record. Like myself my goal is to become finacially stable with a family.\r\n\r\nI dont think that young men and women should be reminded and limited to what jobs to apply for or what career paths to take because of the minor offences the commited.\r\n\r\nWe all want a bright future.\r\n\r\nPlease sign\r\n\r\nThank you",
