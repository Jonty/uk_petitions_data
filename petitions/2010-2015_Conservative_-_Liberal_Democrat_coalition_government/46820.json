        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to abolish compulsory car insurance.\r\n\r\nThe compulsory element of this kind of insurance only serves to continually inflate the prices that the Insurance companies charge, it does nothing to make the roads more safe, as people who can not afford insurance continue to drive without insurance!\r\n\r\nIt is my belief that the abolition of compulsory car insurance would force the insurance companies to substantially reduce the cost of premiums, thus making them affordable for all.\r\n\r\nThis action would also save substantial sums of money as the Police would not have to invest in special A.N.P.R equipment etc; and vast amounts of Court time would also be freed up!\r\n\r\nIt can not be right that two arms of Government the Executive, and the Judiciary are supporting publicly quoted companies to exploit members of the public!!
