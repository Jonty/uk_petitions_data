We must take action to stop investment benefiting the few and create future housing that benefits everyone.\r\n\r\nWhat the stats say:\r\n\r\nIn five years since April 2007, prices have risen by 18%, while average earnings have gone up by just 10%.\r\n\r\nPlease click to change all our futures for the better.\r\n",
