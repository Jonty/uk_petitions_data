        "additional_details": "St. James' Park is more than a football stadium. It is the history, heritage and culture of  the people from the North-East of England. It's a way of life for many more people from around the world: Australia, America, Thailand and many more countries:  The mere mention of \"St. James' Park\" sends shivers down the spines of everyone; such is the emotion attached to the name  of \"St. James' Park\". Tourists to Newcastle have upon their  list of \" things to see\"  St. James Park, not because its \" a football stadium\" but because of the history, heritage and culture surrounding not only \"S.J.P\" but the city of Newcastle as a whole, If this name change goes ahead, it will wipe out more than a football teams history, but one of the city since 1886!",
