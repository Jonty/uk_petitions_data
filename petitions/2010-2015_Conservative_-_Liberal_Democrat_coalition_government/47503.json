        "additional_details": "The abuse of parking in disabled bays is becoming an ever heightened issue for the disabled community.  The effects it can have on a disabled person can be durastic.  For example, if someone has to walk an extra 200 metres, it could completely ware them out for the rest of the day.  No longer should 'I'll only be 5 minutes' be ok!\r\n\r\nThe solution I propose is simple, by adding either 3 or 6 points to a person's driving lisence for each time that they park illegally without a blue badge.  That way, disabled people such as myself will be able to park where we are legally entitled to, without having to worry about lazy people cutting corners, literally!\r\n\r\nI urge HM Government to consider this petition with great care and consideration.",
