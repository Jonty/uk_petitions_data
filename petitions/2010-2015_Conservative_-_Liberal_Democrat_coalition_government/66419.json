        "additional_details": "To change the law bdothan that an absent parent or any parent who is not main carer should not just be allowed parental responsibility because they are named on a birth certificate. My ex partner has been given everything he has asked for since deciding to want 'contact' after 4 years of being absent. The reason for this, because he split from his other partner and his visitation with his other child has been decreased. I name him on the birth certificate for my child not him so that when my son asked I could give him the information. He is being forced to have contact against his will and is something that should not be tolerated ",
