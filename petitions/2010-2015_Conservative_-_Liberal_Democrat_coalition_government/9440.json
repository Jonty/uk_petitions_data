I Beleive that the police should be like that and should not be scared of reprecussions like PRISON because we are ASKING them to protect us! I believe that the old days should return where they have more of a physical presence on our streets and can have more of an impact on the little tearaways of today.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to release the police to do their job by giving them more power to restrain people and if threatened they should be able to pre-empt any violence by being physically assertive themselve and if too much force is used then a maximum limit to what can happen to that officer should be set out from the offset. and If people are rioting then people lose their rights and the police may use whatever force required to contain and arrest them without fear\r\n",
