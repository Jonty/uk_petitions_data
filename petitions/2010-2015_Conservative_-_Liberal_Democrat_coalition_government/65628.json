        "additional_details": "Roxy, a 5-year old Boxer dog was literally left to die without food and water in a kitchen by Katy Gammon, who had no psychiatric issue in pre-sentencing reports. The act was deliberate with rope tied to the kitchen door to prevent escape and to Roxy herself. The poor, innocent being not only suffered starvation and dehydration for 6 days but also would have endured blindness, pain, and kidney failure before collapsing into a coma. The accused received 18 weeks imprisonment and a life ban from keeping animals. The Chairman of the Bench, Rod Mayall told Gammon: \u201cThis case is so serious that the custody threshold is not enough\u201d. In light of such disgusting cases of deliberate animal cruelty, we ask for a thorough evaluation of current animal welfare legislation and the deterrent effects. Vile individuals like this could have the potential to inflict this torture on anyone and anything. Animals have feelings and feel the same physiological and psychological effects as us human beings.",
