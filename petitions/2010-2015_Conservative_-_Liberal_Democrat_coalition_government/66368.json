        "additional_details": "The NHS calculates mileage costs according to the AA Motoring Costs guide.\r\nThe current reimbursement per mile up to 3500 miles is being cut from 67p to 54p from 01/07/14\r\nThe cost has been calculated on the following per mile calculations; Insurance 10.89p - 4.96p, Depreciation of vehicles 27.11p - 23.97p, Cost of capital at 50.00% 2.11p - 1.96p, Road tax 1.88p - 1.80p, Breakdown cover 0.5 - 0.50p, Service labour costs 4.66p - 2.19p, Fuel 14.56p - 13.87p, Replacement parts 2.88p - 2.39p, Tyres 2.06p - 2.00p\r\nHowever, fuel costs, road tax and insurance (especially under 25's) have become higher unless you buy a new low emission, efficient car. NHS employees such as nurses and midwives are in the midst of a pay freeze, whilst previous removal of regular user allowance is placing those that must utilise their cars to fulfill their roles and support vulnerable members of public, at a financial disadvantage.\r\nNHS and Government should reconsider and maintain the current 67p rate.",
