        "additional_details": "Most cities are littered with in-your-face advertising, huge billboards forcing one's attention. The public has no real choice about where billboards appear or what appears on them.\r\n\r\nThis petition suggest that, in order to restore balance against the powerful onslaught of advertising, at least one iteration of any physically-rotating or digital billboard should be given over to artwork (free of logos, emblems or the obscene), at the expense of the advertisers.\r\n\r\nThis will turn our cities into galleries, give artists a helping hand, and repay the public for giving over their attention to the (unsolicited) pushing of products.",
