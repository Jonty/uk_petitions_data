        "additional_details": "If ever, as a result of a referendum, the death penalty is reintroduced, all those who voted in favour of it should suffer a permanent hike in their income tax of 5%, plus a one off fine equal to 1% of their annual income, every time an executed person is later proven to be innocent. Thus, the advocates of the death penalty will know in advance that if they get their way, they will be hit financially every time a mistake is made. This will focus their minds somewhat concerning their belief in the certainty of guilt. Let them put their money on the table where their mouth is as far as the death penalty is concerned, and make them suffer the effects of their moral complicity every time an innocent is executed.",
