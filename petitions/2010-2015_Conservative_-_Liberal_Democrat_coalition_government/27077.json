        "additional_details": "Mother's can be taken to court and forced to give contact via a contact order in sometimes the most horrible of situations, However, if you take your children's father to court to make him have respectable contact with his children for their benefit, he can refuse and nothing will be done. He will be left to be as irresponsible as he wants to be while mum is potentially struggling to get by and the children have no father figure in their lives, left wondering why he didn't want them. A contact order MUST be adhered to if it is the mother, So it should have to be adhered to in the reverse. If a father refuses to have contact with his children, he should be forced into doing so. These men are all to frequent in running away, and are making a joke out of honest fathers that want to see their children and can't. These men should not be allowed to leave their children high and dry in this manner, something must change within the court system to make a contact order stick!",
