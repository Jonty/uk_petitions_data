Much worse than a mobile phone against the side of your head for 24 hrs per day.\r\nThey are also an intrusion into our private lives to an unprecedented degree. They will transmit information as to what you have turned on and off and when, even down to your toaster.\r\nThis is the most intrusive big brother exercise contemplated so far and must be stopped before it starts.\r\nAll properties must be fitted with these devises by 2020 by government decree - this must be debated again especially in relation to the health issues.
