        "additional_details": "Large companies such as Vodafone, Amazon, Google and recently Starbucks have been known to avoid British tax by declaring profits overseas where the tax rate is much lower. Tax collected by these companies can help reduce the national deficit as well as pay for needed services that are being cut. We ask the government to close these loopholes and ensure that companies as well as individuals who work in Britain pay British tax.",
