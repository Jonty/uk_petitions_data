        "additional_details": "Cyclist increasingly do not use the cycle highways, or cycle lanes.\r\n\r\nCyclist, cycling with their earphones on.\r\n\r\nCyclists do not look over their shoulders when they change direction, and in case of an accident, the law protects them even if they are at fault.\r\n\r\nCyclist, going up the wrong way up one way roads, although it being legal under current Highway codes, it causes many near misses, and accidents I am sure.\r\n\r\nCyclist going faster that 30mph in speed limited areas. This is a danger to all other road users, and more importantly themselves.\r\n\r\nCyclist would go past on the inside of vehicle's turning left, even if that vehicle is indicating to turn left.\r\n\r\nCyclist do not stop at red lights and pedestrian crossings. There are very few that do stop.\r\n\r\nCyclists are abusive and aggressive towards road users.\r\n\r\nThrough doing a theory and practical cycle test, this would educate and stop accidents, and would create safer roads in the UK.",
