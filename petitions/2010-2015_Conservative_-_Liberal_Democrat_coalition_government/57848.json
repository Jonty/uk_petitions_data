        "additional_details": "Genuine fans are losing out to ticket touts who buy up large numbers of tickets to music, cultural and sporting events, then immediately resell them at many times the face value of the ticket.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to introduce measures to regulate touts, and protect genuine fans, as described in the Sale of Tickets (Sporting and Cultural Events) Bill 2011:\r\n\r\n- no-one may resell a ticket for an event for more than than 10% above the face value. This includes all booking fees or other secondary charges\r\n\r\n- if the face value of the ticket is zero, the cost of resale must be limited to reasonable postage costs only\r\n\r\n- no-one may advertise tickets for resale if the primary retailer hasn't released tickets yet\r\n\r\n- no-one may resell tickets that they have not bought from the primary retailer\r\n\r\nThere is a place for legitimate ticket agencies. However genuine fans and customers need to be protected from unscrupulous ticket touts reselling tickets at overinflated prices.",
