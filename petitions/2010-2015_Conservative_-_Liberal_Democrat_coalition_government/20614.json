Over 1000 Saudi and 500 Emirati (UAE) troops crossed into Bahrain to join Bahraini government forces in attacking the unarmed, peaceful protestors. Hundreds of innocent men, women, and children have been wounded or killed by government forces, and the massacre does not seem likely to subsist. Be the reason Bahrain sees change.
