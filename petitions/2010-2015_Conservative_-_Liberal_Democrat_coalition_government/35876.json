        "additional_details": "We ask the Government to amend the marriage laws to take away the archaic residency requirements that mean you have to be residents of the UK to marry here and open up the wedding markets for wedding planners who can then promote the UK as a wedding desitination and increase income to the UK treasury with increased visitors. At the current time to be married in England or Wales you need to be resident for 7 days. Scottish people cannot get married in England either because of these restrictions.",
