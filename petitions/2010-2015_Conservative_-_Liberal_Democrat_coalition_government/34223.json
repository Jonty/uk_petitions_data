Now it seems that some MP's think having a New iPad over an iPad 2 is a must have that we should pay for!? Come on use our money wisely or pay the penalty. If you waste our money you should be held accountable and put on trial, sacked and if necessary put in prison. It's our money and it's this sort of wasteful mindset has got this country in the mess it is in. Pay the price.nwe have too.",
