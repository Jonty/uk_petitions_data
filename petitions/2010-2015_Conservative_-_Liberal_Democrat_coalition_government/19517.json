        "additional_details": "I propose that benefits be suspended for two weeks so that income tax can also be suspended for two weeks. As a way of saying thank you and acknowledge the working person's contribution to society, in time for Christmas 2012.\r\n\r\nThis will allow the hard working tax payer to catch up on a few bills and debts, household repairs, prepare for heating bills in the upcoming winter months etc etc. After all, the hard working tax payers are the ones suffering the most in these hard economic times and the ones who will ultimately get us out of this current economic downtown.\r\n\r\nSo I think the least people on benefits can do is give up two weeks worth of benefits, to help the tax payer.\r\n\r\nThe tax payer spend thousands of pounds each year paying  their hard earned wages to help the 'benefit culture', it's now time to help the tax payer.",
