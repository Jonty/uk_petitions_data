        "additional_details": "Please consider incorporating newborn screening for SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) into the current heel prick test for newborn babies.\r\nSCID is a devastating genetic disorder commonly known as \u201cbubble boy disease\u201d which causes severe abnormalities of the immune system. If left undetected, most babies with SCID will die within the first year of life, due to a severely compromised immune system, which will not allow the infant to fight infection of any kind.\r\nIf detected at birth, the treatment for SCID has a 95% success rate, with either a bone marrow transplant or gene therapy.\r\nThere are currently 9 states in America that have newborn screening for SCID, and it is growing. Please consider this very seriously, as this disease is largely curable if detected at birth. We need this in the UK to saves our babies from dying of SCID.\r\n",
