The social impact on families and communities has been bad, to say the least. In single parent families the parent is usually at work on a Sunday, resulting in further breakdown of the family unit, leading to a different form of 'social-deprivation.' Further leading to the breakdown of communities. Many stores from my own experience compel their staff to work, even those that have requested not to work on a Sunday on Religious Grounds have been compelled to work. In one case they had to use 25 days has Holiday. Some have been forced to work 25/26 December and Easter Sunday. At very least Government should restrict the Large chain-stores and subsideries to close on Sunday for the sake of the smaller Acorns that become the Oak Trees of British Business. ",
