        "additional_details": "A senior Labour party ministerial speechwriter has said that his party had a quite deliberate policy of encouraging mass immigration \"It didn't just happen: the deliberate policy of ministers .... was to open up the UK to mass migration\" http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23760073-dont-listen-to-the-whingers---london-needs-immigrants.do , but \"ministers wouldn't talk about it\". because they didn't want \"their core voters\" to know. This has since been denied, admitted, justified and half denied. Parliament should debate having a full inquiry, led by a lawyer with a record of being both apolitical and not coming up with politically convenient conclusions, with evidence taken under oath from politicians, civil servants and anybody else whose testimony might inform to determine if this happened and if so the extent and those involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
