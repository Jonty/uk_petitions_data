        "additional_details": "The politicians should not benefit from having a subsidised bar or restaurant.  Normal people in this country do not earn even half of a politicians salary yet are not able to benefit from subsidised drinks or food.  The prime minister says that we are all in this together, yet they continue to use taxpayers money to have cheap alcohol and food.  This is an insult to the taxpayer and must be stopped.  If they wish to have their own private bar the should fund this themselves, otherwise it should be open to the public as well. ",
