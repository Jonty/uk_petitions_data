        "additional_details": "The A417 section that connects the Over roundabout to Maisemore village is often closed due to flooding.\r\n\r\nWhen this section of road is closed is causes traffic chaos to all the alternate routes through the rural lanes and villages .The A417 is one of the vital sections connecting the road networks to Gloucester, causing great costs and environmental impacts to local businesses ,Gloucestershire residents and students something needs to be done.\r\n\r\nSuggested that the section of road needs to be raised above any possible flooding levels and to incorporate culverts to allow for natural drainage.\r\nA second alternate suggestion has been a bridge /suspended road, allowing water to continue to flow underneath and not causing a \"water dam\" for the local area.\r\n",
