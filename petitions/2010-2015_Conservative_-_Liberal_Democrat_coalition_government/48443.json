        "additional_details": "Due to the nature of Margaret Thatcher's activity in politics, and the strength of feeling both positive and negative towards her, a publicly funded ceremony during a time of austerity is divisive, wasteful, provocative and tactless.\r\nThose opposed to Thatcherism should reject it because of the tribute that it would pay to her much-criticised policies.\r\nThose in favour of her politics should reject it because it will provide a focus for opposition and protest, and will divide the nation at a time when unity is desperately needed.\r\nThe government should insist that her funeral is paid for entirely by her estate and/or her family, friends and supporters.",
