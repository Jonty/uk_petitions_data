        "additional_details": "For many years now we have had a system where the public purse finances the defence of  alleged criminals.There are benefits to this , but where the person is a career criminal the logic in giving this benefit at a staggering cost to the tax payer for life is not acceptable to the decent law abiding citizen. I petition the government to define in law \" professional criminal\" which would take into account variables like how many findings of guilt ( e.g. 10 max allowed before disbarred ) , within what ever time frame ( e.g. 15 years) , and exempt such a person from receiving same. No longer shall shall decent people finance Britains professional criminals but in the main free access to legal aid is still available . Thankyou.",
