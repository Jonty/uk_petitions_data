Support regeneration of SW London & St. George\u2019s Hospital mental health facilities at Springfield. Accept patient facilities needed. Don\u2019t support magnitude of development, private housing, changes to/loss of Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), loss of the golf course, unique facility in London. Proposal to use MOL from Wandsworth Common for transport cuts  greenspace.  Applicant proposal to construct bus route through MOL (use as recreational space) cuts off part of a park. This isn't in keeping with the Green Belt openness attribute. G1 bus would run 100 times a day through MOL & poses a safety hazard for park users with noise & pollution conflicts with public enjoyment of MOL. Transport plan states < 90 passengers/day use it, a minor increase.  Doesn\u2019t warrant construction of road to run buses on MOL, removing golf course making MOL dangerous to users.",
