        "additional_details": "Its been announced that this years tyne wear derby will have no special metro trains from Sunderland direct to Central Station and normal sunday service will occur. This means that fans who travel by train will face the risk of been attacked at stations just outside of Central but also means fans can get off at whatever station they want.\r\n\r\nThis is also added to the fact Chief Supt Steve Neill of Northumbria Police has announced that Sunderland fans travelling by train would not receive any police escort to the ground. This means that any fan travelling by train (potentially also fans from north of Newcastle who wouldn't be able to travel by the coaches put on by the club) would have to walk the entire journey from Central Station across the city to St James' Park and risk of been attacked.\r\nIt protects the safety of both fans and members of the public and helps keeps troublemakers from both fans apart.",
