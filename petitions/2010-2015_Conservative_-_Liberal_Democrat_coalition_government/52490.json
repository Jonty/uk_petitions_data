        "additional_details": "The schools sports equipment are not to a good standard of which they should be. I know this personally as I ended up breaking my back while doing a sport in school due to bad equipment. So personally I think that the budget for sports equipment should be raised to get better quality equipment. This will in turn reduce the child obisity rate so children will get healthier. In addtion, research had shown that sports has redused stress so children wont be as stress in school. Finally children will find new things to do instead of sitting around at home.  ",
