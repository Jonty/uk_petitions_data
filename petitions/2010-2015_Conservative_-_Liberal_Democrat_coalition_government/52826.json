It is surely morally wrong to allow them to strike, endangering the development of a generation who have no voice. Other work force groups have this arrangement, such as the police, due to the security of the realm. The same principle should be applied to teachers. They can demonstrate their views in an alternative way that does not impact on pupils and parents. ",
