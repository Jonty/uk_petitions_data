        "additional_details": "The Co-operative are currently trying to acquire the Lenham Hardware site just off the square to build a large retail convenience store.\r\n\r\nThis will be detrimental to the village, it will not bring anything new or anything needed that we do not already have. It will put a lot of strain on the current retailers and jeopardise the future of the village life as it is known now.\r\n\r\nPlease help us stop Co-op or any other large retail group using the site and put the site back into the hands of people from the village to help the local economy instead of putting it at risk.\r\n\r\nThe Parish Council already oppose it.\r\n\r\nAll support is greatly needed.",
