        "additional_details": "Wandsworth council has announced it is starting eviction proceedings against a woman whose 18-year-old son has been charged in connection with the riots in Clapham Junction. This will set a precedent for the enforced removal of parents and siblings not personally involved in the riots. Other boroughs are reported to be looking into evictions, with one mother on Hackney's Pembury estate \"terrified she and her younger child would be made homeless as a result of her 17-year-old, who she could not keep under control\" (Stephen Howlett, Peabody Trust CEO, quoted in the Guardian). In practice, the eviction process will simply mean shifting affected families along to neighbouring boroughs. Moreover, it will merely exacerbate the problems of deprivation that are arguably the primary cause of the unrest. We demand the Department of Justice intervenes to stop councils persevering with evictions and seeks another response to the riots based on the improvement of conditions for vulnerable families.",
