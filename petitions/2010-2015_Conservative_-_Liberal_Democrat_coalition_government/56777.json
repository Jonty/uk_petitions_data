        "additional_details": "Simplify the Advance Stop Line law to have the same rules for the Box Junction 174 law:\r\nYou MUST NOT enter the box until your exit road or lane is clear. At signalled roundabouts you MUST NOT enter the box unless you can cross over it completely without stopping.\r\n\r\nWhere cars are allowed to stop in the Green Box ahead of the ASL, filtering cyclists are left with no place to move ahead of cars at a junction when the lights change to red and a car is blocking the Green Box. Vehicles turning left pose a danger to the cyclist in these circumstances.\r\n\r\nSimplifying the law will remove the ambiguity of whether a vehicle stopped before or after the traffic lights changed and allow a safe space for cyclists at all times ahead of the Advance Stop Line.",
