        "additional_details": "In recent years the increased rainfall we have experienced in the UK has caused havoc and devastation in numerous communities. Yet planning permission continues to be granted to allow developers to build on areas which are known to be prone to flood. If this practice is not ended very soon, increasing numbers of home and business owners are going to find their homes and premises at greater risk of flooding. We cannot do anything very quickly about climate change, but we CAN choose not to build on floodland. ",
