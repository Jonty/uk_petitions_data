        "additional_details": "The Paralympic Legacy is to encourage disabled people into sport. The Nationwide trend to refurbish or build sports hall floors with cushion flooring will eventually kill wheelchair sports.\r\n     The law should change making it impossible for cushion floor to be laid on new sports floors, along with a change that will not allow disabled shower rooms/toilets to open directly onto a public thoroughfare, giving disabled users dignity and privacy as abled-bodied people have in their changing facilities.\r\n     As planners have no say in the material of a sports floor - the law should change - suitable surfaces should be part of building regulations.\r\n     Regarding indoor sport - there should be a level playing field - a sports surface for all, not a sports surface good for non-disabled that puts disabled people at a disadvantage.",
