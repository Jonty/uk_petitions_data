We are inundated with unnecessary job seekers in this country, also accomodation, public services etc, are stretched to breaking point. If our government, (who seem to be hell bent on change), are really concerned about unemployment and reducing the dependancy on state benefits, then I think they should act. We don't need more houses, just less people!",
