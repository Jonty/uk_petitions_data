We should use schemes that are community help based as an alternative to exclusion or permanent exclusion with parents facing fines it they don't participate or complete.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple idea that would be easy to implement into our education system. It would stop students from being allowed to sit at home doing nothing when they are excluded.\r\n\r\nIf you want future generations to grow up to be responsible, intelligent mature people we need to take action now.
