        "additional_details": "Modern airport security regulations prevent individuals from taking more than 100ml of water into the departure lounge. Once through security, passengers often find that the available tap water is not suitable for consumption and that airport shops, protected from the ordinary forces of outside competition, charge prices far above normal market rates.\r\n\r\nWe call upon to government to remedy this situation by mandating the provision of free drinking water (e.g. water fountains) and/or competitively priced bottled water in all affected departure lounges.",
