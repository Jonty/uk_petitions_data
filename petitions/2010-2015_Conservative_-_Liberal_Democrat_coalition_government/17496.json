        "additional_details": "Andrew Campbell was diagnosed with Hogkins Lymphoma in 2003 and has relapsed twice. There is currently a groundbreaking new drug licensed in the US specifically for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkins Lymphoma which is proving very successful compared to current treatments available in the UK. Brentuximab Ventolin is in the process of being licensed in the UK but unfortunately, time is not on our side. There are lots of patients currently being treated with this drug in the UK and we MUST gain access to this drug for Andrew as his consultant has said that this could be his only chance of a cure from his disease. I cannot concieve of the fact that there is a drug on the planet that could cure this 29 year old successful, tax paying, much loved young man but that we cannot get our hands on it. Please please please sign the petition and draw enough attention to this matter so as the powers that be take notice . . . And take action!!!!!!",
