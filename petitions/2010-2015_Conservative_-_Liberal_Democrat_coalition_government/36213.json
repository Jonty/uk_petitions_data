        "additional_details": "It is the grossest of immoralities for our politicians to make it a legal obligation to pay over money to the BBC for a licence and then for those same politicians not to apply safeguards to the use of that money to protect the taxpayer.  Recent revelations are that hundreds of BBC workers are being paid illegally 'off the books' which means that huge amounts of taxpayer pounds are being handed over without income tax and national insurance payments being deducted.  As long as this is allowed to happen it cannot be equitable for taxpayers to be obliged to pay this money over against a threat of criminalisation. ",
