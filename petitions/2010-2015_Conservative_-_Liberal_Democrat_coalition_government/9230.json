Give them the bare minimum until such a time that reparations are covered.\r\n\r\nAcknowledge that not all rioters/looters were on benefits to begin with. Punish them through their national insurance contributions, back to 0 years contribution. If they don't appreciate being part of a society, nor should they appreciate the benefits of the society.\r\n\r\nNot a proportion of reparations, all reparations. They helped eachother out to organise and perpetrate the crimes, so allow them to collectively pay for those crimes andthe crimes of their cronies who got off. This will show the solidarity of thugs in a true light. ",
