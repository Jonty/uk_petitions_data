He must apply in the UK, in person, at a passport office.  He cannot make an appointment more than 3 weeks in advance.  We cannot prepare all the forms in advance and send them with him.  We cannot afford to wait for the time it takes to apply by post.  The whole process is obstructive and unnecessarily expensive.  The old process worked just fine, why fix what isn't broke?",
