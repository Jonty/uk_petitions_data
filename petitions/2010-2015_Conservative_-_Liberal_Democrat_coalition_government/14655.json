        "additional_details": "The upcoming ban on incandescent light bulbs is ill thought out and should be rescinded or modified.\r\n\r\nIn many cases low-energy bulbs are not suitable replacements for incandescent bulbs. This may mean that households need to replace light fittings, or even make more substantial changes to their properties to fit low energy lighting. These changes may more than offset any environmental benefit from the low energy lighting.\r\n\r\nAlso, the light from low energy lighting is not as good quality as from incandescent lights, making it less suitable for some people or applications.\r\n\r\nIn cooler countries like the UK, the energy saving is not as significant in any case, as a lot of the 'heat waste' is not actually wasted at all but helps towards the overall heating of the property.",
