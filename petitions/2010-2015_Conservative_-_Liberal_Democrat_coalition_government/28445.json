        "additional_details": "The aim of taking RBS into full government control would be to provide low interest loans, typically just above bank base rate, to new UK-based manufacturing ventures. Such ventures, if successful, would provide employment in the UK and reduce our dependence on imports from the far east. Loans should be directed to ventures irrespective of geographical location, concentrating instead on the viability of the venture in terms of employment and reduction of imports. Successful ventures might well develop into exporters, completing the shift from import to export.",
