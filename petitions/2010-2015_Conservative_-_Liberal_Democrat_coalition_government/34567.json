        "additional_details": "The dept of treasury is trying to impose a tax on skips, this tax was \u00a32.50 a tonne for the skip companies to get rid of the waste, is now increasing to \u00a364 a tonne which is a 2,500% rise. This will cause the following:-\r\n1) Customers not affording to hire a skip as increase to the skip firms having to be passed onto them, hence fly tipping, & dirtier streets causing rats & other vermin to roam them.\r\n2) Skip firms closing down, causing unemployment.\r\n3) Less houses being built, as the soil & rubble needs to be taken somewhere, the building companies will not be able to afford the hire of a skip.\r\n\r\nI would therefore propose that the treasury leaves this tax alone, or increase it to \u00a35\r\n",
