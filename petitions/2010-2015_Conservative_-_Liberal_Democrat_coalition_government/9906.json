The max that any bank or lender can charge should be no more than 10% above the Bank of England base rate.\r\n\r\nInterest rates of over 3000% charged by banks and other lenders are a national disgrace and on a par with loan sharks. That the government allows such rates shows how morally corrupt they are\r\n",
