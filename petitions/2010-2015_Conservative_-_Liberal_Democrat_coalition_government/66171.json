        "additional_details": "I believe that the driving test renewal should be extended to 5 years. This gives young drivers efficient time to focus on the practicality of driving . It allows them to focus on the importance of actual driving and taking the stress away of making sure that they should pass the practical test within the 2 year time frame. By extending it to 5 years allows young drivers to only realise the importance of being a safe driver.",
