        "additional_details": "The Republic of Somaliland has been an oasis of peace and stability in a troubled Horn of Africa Region for the past 20 years. It has established itself as a democratic and peaceful nation where the rule of law is respected. The African Union has refused to support Somaliland and time and again ignored its presence and rightful existence. The UK and the US have shown a great deal of sympathy and called for the African Union to consider Somaliland's case and possible membership to the club. However, the African Union's inaction is a worrying concern and a testimony to its denial of the facts on the ground. The UK and its allies should take action just like they did in Libya after when the African Union neglected its responsibility.  It is, therefore, high time for the UK to show a leadership and bypass the African Union by taking the Somaliland case to the United Nations demanding a full review for the membership and recognition of Somaliland Republic.\r\n",
