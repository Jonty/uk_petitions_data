        "additional_details": "If I employed a young lady at the age of 16 and told her that if she paid NI Contributions and Tax until she was 60 she would get a pension, then  a few years before she reached that age, I decided to change my mind and told her she would have to wait another 6 years for it, she would surely take me to court for FRAUD.  Why then do the Government feel they can do this without any come backs.\r\nI feel cheated and used.  I paid full stamp throughout my working years and motherhood years in order to get this pension.  Who know, I may not be around at the age of 66. It is totally unfair.",
