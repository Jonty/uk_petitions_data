        "additional_details": "Car insurance premiums imposed on young, first-time drivers, are offensively discriminatory.\r\n\r\n1. On average, a young driver, who has taken the same training and tests as any other first-time driver, are offered insurance premiums of around \u00a33500; ranging between 500%-1000% greater than other first-time drivers.\r\n2. Even with additional qualifications such as the PassPlus qualification, which should signal to insurers the drivers' intention to be a dilligent driver, one can still expect premiums >500% the norm.\r\n3. This is explained away by stating that young drivers are \"statistically more likely to make a claim\". The concept of applying a condition based solely on a demographic statistic is the definition of discrimination.\r\n4. Because of these unreasonable premiums, many young drivers choose to drive uninsured.\r\n5. Many other detrimental effects.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose the gov. enact a statutory maximum for first-time drivers.",
