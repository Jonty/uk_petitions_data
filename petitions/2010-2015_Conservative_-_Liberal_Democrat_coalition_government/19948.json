        "additional_details": "I propose that the Death Penalty should be brought back into sentencing for Pre Meditated Murder, Murder of a Police Officer, Murder of a Person carrying out their Duties as an Employee or in any capacity of a Business (In events of Armed Robbery or Robbery) and Murder of a person in their own home or place of business, and Murder of a Child (Anyone under the age of 16 years old). I propose that it should be a jury's decision as to or not to impose the death penalty in such cases of a guilty verdict.\r\n\r\nIn other cases of a Killing where the charge is Murder or indeed where a person has avoided the death penalty for the terms above, Life imprisonment will mean till the end of their natural life, with no consideration for early release.\r\n\r\nThe public and police and hard working people need protecting from these individuals and gangs who think it is acceptable to use extreme force and violence to their own ends.
