At eleven I have been told I can only have an account without a debit card, one that doesn't pay interest, one that is really for my parents, and that 'actually we don't think anyone under 16 can manage money'\r\n\r\nI believe government should help us learn about money by making all banks have accounts for children aged 11+ that:\r\n\r\nHave debit cards - so we can shop online and get the best deals!\r\n\r\nLets us check our balance online  - so we can manage our money properly and not guess!\r\n\r\nHave easy to understand information - so we don't have to go to university to understand!\r\n\r\nPays some interest, and not 0.1% - so we are encouraged to save, because whatever our job and dreams everyone needs to save!\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition so we can learn to manage our money before someone gives us a credit card : )\r\n",
