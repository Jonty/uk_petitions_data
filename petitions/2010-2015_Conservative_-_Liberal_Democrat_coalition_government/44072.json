The last massive increase in road tax seems to have been forgotten along with the massive increase in petrol prices.\r\n\r\nAnd what do we the motorists see for our massive taxes? Some of the worst roads in Europe, pot holes and very poor cheap repairs. Some car makers are developing new testing grounds for UK cars due to such poor roads!\r\n\r\nMotorists want road tax to be invested in roads and not used to solve all the government funding issues.\r\n\r\nIntroducing road tolls is in fact just a stealth increase in road tax for motorists.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron \"I want to give the motorist a fair deal\"?\r\n\r\nIt is simply not acceptable to further increase motoring costs.\r\n\r\nSTOP this now and give us a fair deal!",
