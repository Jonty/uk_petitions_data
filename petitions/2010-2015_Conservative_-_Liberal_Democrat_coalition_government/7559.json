We help build the security, justice and respect that enable people to prosper in a free and tolerant society.\"\r\nDo the people caught in the communities where criminals are rioting and looting believe a word of this?\r\nThe Home Office should give the Police the powers to combat these criminals without trying to do so with one hand tied behind their back.\r\nHow are these brave men & women supposed to get this under control or restore peace if these criminals are given more rights than those honest and decent people whose lives are being affected, disrupted and destroyed by the actions of these criminals.\r\n\r\nAt last glance, David Cameron was claiming to be running the country but from what we have seen, it seems he is letting the criminals rioting and looting on our streets call the shots.\r\n",
