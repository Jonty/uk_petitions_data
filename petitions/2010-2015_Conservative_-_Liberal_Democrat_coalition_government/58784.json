        "additional_details": "MoneySuperMarket calls on the government to force the remaining four of the 'Big Six' energy providers to pass on the recent reductions in 'Green Levies' to ALL customers, not just to those on variable rate tariffs.\r\n\r\nBritish Gas and SSE have already said they will pass on the reductions to ALL customers, including those on fixed rate tariffs. But npower, EON, Scottish Power and EDF Energy have either passed on the reductions only to variable rate customers in the form of reduced price increases, or have yet to announce their plans.\r\n\r\nAt a time when UK households are facing financial pressures due to rising costs, it is important that energy companies treat their customers fairly and ensure they benefit from every saving. Customers also need clearer timescales on the implementation of any changes so they can budget accordingly.\r\n",
