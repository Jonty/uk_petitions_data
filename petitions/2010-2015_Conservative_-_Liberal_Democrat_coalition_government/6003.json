Because America uses that? Any level of crime?)\r\nAllow negative voting, to prevent really unpopular issues wasting the MP debate slots and the need for two opposing e-petitions.\r\nAllow discussion about the details - like for the 3-strikes.\r\n\r\nThe petitions need to be clear - otherwise the MP\u2019s will just reject it and all the petitioners have wasted their time!",
