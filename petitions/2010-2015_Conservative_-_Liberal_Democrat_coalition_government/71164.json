        "additional_details": "Marcus has been admitted into intensive care at Croydon university hospital due to a heart related illness. His current status is critical and the hospital have refused to resuscitate him should his heart stop and now that he has contracted two infections whilst being under their care they are refusing to treat him as they believe he is going to pass away regardless. We want the government to act fast and look into the inhumane, disgraceful and unjust and all in all bad practice by Croydon University Hospital on Marcus. Every life is worth saving by all means and Marcus is being taken away his rights to live by the Hospital.",
