        "additional_details": "The question of establishing an independent Kurdish state has been one of the thornier questions confronting the Middle East since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Following the coalition liberation in 2003, the political dynamics have changed drastically in Iraq, while Iran is currently simmering and Syria is teetering on the brink. We urge the British government to support the Kurdish national ambitions in establishing an independent Kurdish state.",
