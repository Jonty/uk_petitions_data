        "additional_details": "It is time to put an end to the epidemic of gross profiteering from a faceless and immoral online ticket tout industry that is ruining the opportunities for the general public to pay the fair price for what they want to see. On any major sell-out event tickets for resale appear online immediately at rates that exclude many people from having the opportunity to go. This only serves to line the pockets of unscrupulous ticket touts whilst restricting access to events that were originally priced at a fair value for everyone. The entertainment industry can help combat this with more secure ticketing procedures where an ID based system can be introduced. Even if this adds some cost it is far better than the current situation where people are being denied opportunities to see events they desperately want to see.",
