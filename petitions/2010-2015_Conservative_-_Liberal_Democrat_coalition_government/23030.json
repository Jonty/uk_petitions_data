        "additional_details": "We are living in a democracy by rule under consensus, not dictatorship like in the former USSR. A United States of Europe is doomed to failure. EU regulations (like working time directives) dictated by out of touch EU commissioners & EU Parliament imposes (at times hare-brained) obligations for the UK to comply, even if against UK's own self-interests & HMG policies.  Judgments (like about human rights, prisoner voting rights) by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) are precedents in UK, even in our highest court in the land (Supreme Court). EU should also not impose Turkey as a new member.  If Turkey joins the EU, it will become a gateway to Europe from immigrants without travel documentation from the Middle East, Africa, etc. Apart from the loss of national identities, MEPs & staffing of the administration of the European Parliament are expensive & is a \u2018gravy train\u2019, as well as having to subsidise (like agriculture) poorer EU member states.
