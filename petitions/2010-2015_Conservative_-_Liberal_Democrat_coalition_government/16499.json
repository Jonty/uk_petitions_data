The goverment ( who promised much ) will not allow a  popular mandate, as if a referndum were held they would struggle to convince the electorate that continuing membership is a benefit to all but the elected classes. WE !! are great country and are more than capable of looking after ourselves - Europe needs us more than we need them.",
