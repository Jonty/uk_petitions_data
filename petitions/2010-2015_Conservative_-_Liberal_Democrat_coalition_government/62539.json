A wage rise of 100% coupled with a reduction in hours from 9 to 8 hrs per day.Adjusting for inflation and converting to \u00a3 sterling this equates to \u00a38.75 per hour\r\n\r\nThe living wage is \u00a38.80 per hour in London, and \u00a37.65 in the rest of the country.\r\n\r\nIn October the new Minimum Wage is to be \u00a36.50\r\n\r\nEmployers who pay their staff too little are in effect benefiting from taxpayers, who subsidise the low wages of their staff by paying their employees top-up state benefits such as tax credits.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, the combined effect of the recession, high unemployment, stagnating wage levels and high inflation has depressed annual income per head by 13%, according to an analysis by the Office for National Statistics.\r\n\r\n100 years later and the poorest paid are even worse now. It's time to change. Pay the Living Wage",
