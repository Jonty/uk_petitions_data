(http://goo.gl/71IA4)\r\n\r\nEvery state primary and secondary school in England is to receive a new copy of the 1611 King James Bible from Gove.\r\n\r\nThe 'initiative' is a waste of money. Schools already have appropriate religious books of all faiths and Gove is pushing his own personal religious agenda that has little benefit to education, especially in the time of 'freedoms' within the national curriculum.\r\n\r\nThe Government/DfE should, if Gove feels the need to spend \u00a3375,000 (in the times of austerity measures), at least let the school choose the book or resource it receives and not force upon a resource that may be of little use.
