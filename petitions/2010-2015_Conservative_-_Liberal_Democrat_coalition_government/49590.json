        "additional_details": "The RBS group have announced a return to profitability, and immediately began a PR campaign to be returned to private ownership.\r\n\r\nWith the 1st year back in profit being around half of the losses in the prior year, it is not in the interest of the majority owners - British Taxpayers - to sell off their stake in the bank until the full cost of the bank's bailout has been recouped.\r\n\r\nThis petition demands a commitment from the Treasury to retain their stake in RBS until such time as the bailout cost has been recouped, and sale of shares in the bank will be a clear profit for the exchequer.",
