        "additional_details": "Improvement in care towards disabled children within the hospital system.\r\n\r\nHarry Procko was severely let down after being kept waiting for 9 hours at Nottingham QMC for blood tests and an ECG test. His parents made the difficult decision to return home with him for the evening due to his distress at being kept waiting in unfamiliar surroundings for 9 hours. On returning the next day these tests which may have saved a 4 year olds life were again not carried out. Harry died within 48 hours of being discharged from Nottingham QMC without medical aid.\r\n\r\nThe anguish these parents have been through should never be repeated.\r\n\r\nMistakes may be made in the system, but to fail not once but twice to carry out basic tests and levels of care is deplorable. Safeguards for these vunerable children should be put in place.\r\n",
