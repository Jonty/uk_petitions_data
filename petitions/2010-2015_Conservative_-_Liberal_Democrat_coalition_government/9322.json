        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe in a legal requirement in which Members elected to serve in the House of Commons are required to seek to introduce legislation which reflects the promises they made to their constituents.\r\n\r\nThere has been sadly, a great willingness by many MPs to break election promises made to their constituents once elected. Disgracefully this has included MPs elected to this parliament campaigning on promises they had already agreed to break. We believe that there is no place for this behaviour in our parliament, and that it is an assassination of the very essence of democracy.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to introduce legislation making it a legal requirement MPs to seek to introduce legislation reflecting the promises they have made and that any member in breach or supporting legislation which 'breaks' their promises should be removed from parliament immediately \u2013 allowing a by-election to take place.",
