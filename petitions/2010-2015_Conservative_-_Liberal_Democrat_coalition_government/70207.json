The UK has a responsibility to do this as signatory to the Sino-British Joint Declaration and a huge opportunity to marshal wider international support from like minded democracies around the world.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the people of Hong Kong have a right to full democratic representation in the governance of their territory and that under the Basic Law they should be allowed to both nominate candidates and vote for their political leadership.\r\n\r\nWe also urge the UK government to do all it can to ensure the security of Hong Kong demonstrators who have the right to free speech and assembly under the terms of the Basic Law.",
