        "additional_details": "New Brighton nr Mold has a Welsh name but Flintshire County Council will not use it, apparently because it offends the older generation! Well, everyone I have spoken to over the past 12 months would love the Welsh name for New Brighton to be used which is Pentre Cythraul! It's silly to have a village with such an english name in the middle of villages and Towns such as Sychdyn, Alltami, Bryn-y-Baal, Mynydd Isa and Yr Wyddgrug when a Welsh name is there. I would like for the Welsh name to be used and shown on all Signs into New Brighton.",
