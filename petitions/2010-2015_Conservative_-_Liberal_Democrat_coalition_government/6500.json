        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to stop destroying our welfare state. This Government is using the excuse of the current budget defecit to force through a right wing agenda which is aimed at destroying our welfare state. The government is attacking the poorest and most vulnerbale in our society with its cuts to sickness and other out of work benefits. Vulnerable people are being forced into total poverty and being left in a state of fear and despair. It cannot be right for the poorest to bear the full force of savage spending cuts while the better off are having no or only minimal drops in their income. The PM and his other privledged Government cohorts have no real idea of what it is like for the poorest in our society and appear not to really care. This nation should be proud of our welfare state and we call upon the Government to reverse its planned disgracefull cuts to benefits for the disabled, sick, unemployed  and single parents.",
