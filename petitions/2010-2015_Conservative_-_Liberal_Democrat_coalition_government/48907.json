        "additional_details": "In January 2010 Advent Computer Training went into Administration, leaving people who paid for courses or took loans to pay for courses without anything for their money, a suitable replacement course was supposed to have been found within a few weeks of the administration but it took a lot longer than that.\r\nBarclays Partner Finance DID NOT keep their agreement and effectively broke the terms of the contract, yet we are supposed to continue paying?\r\n\r\nI myself, along with many other people were also mis-sold the course under the false impression that just taking the course would help us get work within the IT industry, allowing us to pay for the course while we worked.\r\nI would like people to have the option to cease paying for a course they are no longer receiving and or get the money that they've already paid in, back.\r\nIt's hard enough to find work without being ripped off by such a large company.",
