Any  collusion with the argument that \" Israel has a right to defend itself \" when the  defence is to kill over thirty civillians many of them children, with the prospect of far greater atrocities to come is unnacceptable.\r\n\r\nWe respect Israel's right to peacefully co- exist with the Palestinian people, but the extreme aggression with which the Israeli military prosecutes it's right to defend itself is out of all proportion to the threat it faces.\r\n\r\nGiven Britain's historical role in helping to create the political and geographic state in the Middle East we feel it has a responsibility to play it's part in trying to resolve the current crisis.",
