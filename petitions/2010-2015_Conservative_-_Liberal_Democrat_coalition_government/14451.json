At present anti social behaviour inside a house comes under the jurisdiction of the local council. Who will not have the resources for a 24 hour service. So the ludicrous situation can arise where an all night party is causing a nuisance in a private property. People will just have to suffer the noise till it stops as the police are powerless to deal with the incident.",
