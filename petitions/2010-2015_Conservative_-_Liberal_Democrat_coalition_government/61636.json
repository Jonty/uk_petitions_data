As well as being a health hazard it costs the NHS \u00a35 billion a year on treating lung cancer and 90% of patience's lung cancer is caused by smoking. This money is our taxes. Why should we pay money for someone to be treated for something they have caused themselves?\r\n\r\nIt is within a smokers rights to smoke but I feel that my rights, to not have to breath in any of that second hand smoke is higher, as I want to breath in clean air.\r\n\r\nI propose that smoking should be banned from all public places, inside and out. Smokers would then only smoke in private residential homes. This could also help smokers cut down on their smoking habits.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and make a difference to our future.",
