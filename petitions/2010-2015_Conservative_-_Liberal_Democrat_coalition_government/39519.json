        "additional_details": "As we all know we live in a \"smoke-free\" UK, which is fine and not unreasonable for everyday life.\r\nHowever when faced with a long flight ahead of you, there should be some provision made for smokers again in our UK airports.\r\nI'm not talking a fancy area but a smoking room or small outside space like most other international airports would be fine, just somewhere to have a smoke once air-side.\r\nI was recently waiting to board a flight at Heathrow and was chatting to a young New Zealander who was a transit passenger having just had a ten hour flight and was waiting to board another ten hour flight and found it unbelievable that there was nowhere to smoke at all in the entire airport.\r\nWe are not asking for much, surely is this not against our human rights? If alcohol is readily available and can be drunk at numerous outlets air-side then smoking should be allowed as well.",
