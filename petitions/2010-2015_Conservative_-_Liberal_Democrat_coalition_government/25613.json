        "additional_details": "The City of London weakens the rest of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBritish politicians are so concerned with London to the extent that it distorts the politics and economics of the rest of the UK. London\u2019s financial district does not share the economic burden it helped create. If bankers want to take risks then let them, but when they screw up the British people shouldn\u2019t have to clear up their mess. This only undermines the economic stability of the rest of the UK and besides, when has the City ever helped the UK? Bankers are only out for themselves. Why should the people put up with this? Let us free ourselves from the City and create our own future. Lets kick London out of the UK!\r\n\r\nP.S. If this works we\u2019ll need a new capital. If anyone has an idea of how to pick a new capital without all of us descending into a disagreeable squabble it would be much appreciated.",
