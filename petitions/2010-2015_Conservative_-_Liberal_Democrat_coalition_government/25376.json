        "additional_details": "At Brookwood Military Cemetery stands a memorial for those World War Two Army personnel \"..whom the fortune of war denied a known and honoured grave.\" On the monument is the inscription \"Their Name Liveth For Evermore\".\r\n\r\nThis memorial has the names of at least eighteen convicted and executed murderers (including one double child killer) and the name of one executed spy. They have \"no known or honoured grave\" because they are buried in British prisons and the War Office seemingly forgot or failed to give them a dishonourable discharge the day before execution as was the case with RAF or RN murderers.\r\n\r\nThe continuation of their remembrance in this manner is an insult to those who died honourably and to the families of their victims.\r\n\r\nThe Government are asked to have these names struck out.\r\n\r\n",
