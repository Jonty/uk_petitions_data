From financial problems through to not receiving effective care and support following a loss.  The country is failing these parents at what is an extremely traumatic time.\r\n\r\nBereaved parents should be awarded child benefit for the time their child was alive (and the 8 weeks following the child's death) regardless of when they apply.  Currently bereaved parents must apply for this benefit within 3 months of their child dying.  It is unfair to impose such a short deadline on families.  The parents are entitled to this money and should be paid it.\r\n\r\nThere also needs to be a change in the system, where by, if a first child dies and the parents go on to have a second child, the second child should be awarded child benefit at the 'first child' rate.  If there is no active claim for the first child that has passed away, bereaved families should NOT be penalised.\r\n",
