        "additional_details": "This is a very sick & disturbing group, they target people who have lost children & seem to think it's funny to make sick, disgusting jokes about angel babies. When people who have lost children voice their concerns to this group, they send disgusting messages & pictures to the people, making horrible comments about their children that have passed away. It is unacceptable that Facebook would let the group get away with this for so long, and I (along with many others) find facebooks reason for letting this group remain on their website disgusting. They are giving the whole online community a very bad name & hurting a lot of people with their disgusting 'jokes'.  ",
