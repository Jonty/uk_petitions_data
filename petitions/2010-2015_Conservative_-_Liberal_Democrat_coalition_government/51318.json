Because i act like i am capable than i actually are i get assessed at a level that would not qualify for the service. This meant that I would not be able to get access to the appropriate support as they do not feel i would qualify under the learning disability team and the only way they could determine whether i qualify is by sending out an occupational therapist to assess my daily functioning skills- but only watching cooking and road safety is not enough. They do not seem to take into account when you have moved away from your family and when need access for home help i cannot receive the service i need. This needs changing.",
