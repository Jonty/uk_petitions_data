        "additional_details": "Dear The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP,\r\n\r\nI write to you to tell you that we as a nation need to stop giving terror group ISIS a voice within western media - particularly here within the UK. This is a so called organisation that preach hate and murder, and what the British media are doing is giving ISIS a platform to use this voice. They require a voice to be heard and to recruit more vulnerable and naive followers. TAKE AWAY THEIR VOICE, THEIR VOICE IS THEIR MOST POWERFUL WEAPON and they are using it against us within our own media. I beg of you to cease any information regarding ISIS and any of the atrocities they commit or threaten to commit. Young children and teenagers also have access to most media outlets on the internet, if this frightens adults then it will most certainly frighten the younger generations. ",
