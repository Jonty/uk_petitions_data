        "additional_details": "With so many cars on the roads with no insurance the honest motorist is having to pay extra for those irresponsible people, the police along with vosa should target random areas and impound all those vehicles with no insurance, this should be an ongoing practice and hopefully reduce the number of uninsured vehicles to zero thereby forcing the insurance companies to reduce insurance policies for vehicles.  If it were done with the cooperation and help of other police forces targeting whole counties at once this would prove effective also with a surprise element.",
