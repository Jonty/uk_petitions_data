        "additional_details": "concerns about lack of regulations in respect of bailiff\u2019s behaviours etc.  I appreciate there is a new legislation to curb some behaviours but this does not address what I believe is financial abuse by bailiffs.\r\n\r\nThere are few controls over what bailiffs do and how much they charge, with bailiff powers set out in a complex series of archaic laws.\r\nI believe that charges that allow bailiffs to increase 10 fold an original debt must be thought both unreasonable and extremely disproportionate and it seems to me that any country that allows such a system of abuse of powers should be ashamed.\r\n\r\nI believe there is urgent need for bailiffs to be properly regulated and for local authorities to be responsible for the practice of bailiffs it has appointed to act in its name.\r\n\r\nThe present system leaves many people with no real protection and no recourse and thats why I think there should be an independent complaints body like an ombudsman",
