        "additional_details": "Helmshore, a nice quiet town with a small village located in a very semi rural position, about to be ruined with the building of 74 town houses on a very small site.  To allow this plan to go ahead a number of trees must be removed.  The developer, Taylor Wimpey has already removed many trees this week, some over 50 years old, even though we have asked them to stop, to clarify the TPO situation which is on many of these trees.  The main one that this petition refers to is our Horse Chestnut.  We have pleaded with them & our council but we seem to be getting nowhere fast. This tree has been here longer than any building or person in Helmshore (over 100 years) but will be removed to make way for houses.  There is NO need to remove this tree.  Too many trees have been felled in the last 48 hours on this site, we must save this one - please sign our petition!!! ",
