        "additional_details": "The Highway Code contains just one page on first-aid techniques, but in other European countries such as Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland first-aid training is compulsory before a driving licence is granted.\r\n\r\nThis is not the case in the UK where road accidents kill around 3200 people each year. There is no doubt that many unnecessary road deaths every year could be avoided if those who were first on the scene had basic life saving first aid skills.\r\n\r\nThe time between an accident and the arrival of the emergency services is critical. If drivers can apply basic first-aid skills at the scene, lives may be saved and the severity of injuries reduced\r\n\r\nA report by the Red Cross in 2001 stated, Learner drivers should pass a first-aid test before they can qualify for their licence. Nothing has been done since.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to make it compulsory for all drivers to know life saving First Aid either as a seperate test or an extra chapter in the driving theory test.
