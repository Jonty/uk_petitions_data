        "additional_details": "It really is about time Ken Dodd received a Knighthood. Ken is the last of our long serving, extremely succesful & well loved traditional comics, still out there entertaining audiences all over Britain. Why is he being ignored?  The government must bestow a knighthood on Mr Dodd before it is too late! His services to entertainment must be recognised surely! There is now no excuse for this brilliant man not being officially rewarded by the Queen. It should have happened long before now!  Please include Ken for a knighthood ASAP. It would be the greatest travesty of justice if it never happened. Arise Sir Ken!",
