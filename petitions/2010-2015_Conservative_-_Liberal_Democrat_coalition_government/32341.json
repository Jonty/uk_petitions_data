        "additional_details": "This petition is created as an outlet for the English general public to express their outrage that a man so wrapped up in misdeeds and corruption has been allowed to take up a public office.\r\n\r\nMr Galloway is known to have had financial and personal ties to Saddam Hussein, and illicitly recieved money from the UN Oil for Food program, and continues to maintain ties to the Iranian Government, regularly appearing on Press TV, defending the Iranian governments' reprehensible human rights record and illegal nuclear program. Outside of this, he maintains ties to the Islamic Forum of Europe, a known terrorist group, and has donated many thousands of pounds and vehicles to the Hamas terror group.\r\n\r\nThis man runs counter to our national goals, and should be stripped of his seat in Bradford.
