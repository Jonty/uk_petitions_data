        "additional_details": "This petition calls for recognition that evidence generally falls into two categories -\r\na) evidence that calls for normal human consideration and judgement (\"normal\" evidence);\r\nb) evidence that the judge and jury agree is INDISPUTABLE.  An example of such evidence may be clear video of the accused committing the crime.  This (rare) type of evidence would be called \"indisputable\".\r\nWhere the judge AND jury agree that \"indisputable\" evidence exists, (and therefore the possibility of a miscarriage of justice is zero), stronger sentences could be considered, and for the most heinous of crimes, capital punishment could be considered without fear of miscarriage of justice.\r\n",
