        "additional_details": "In 1998 the death penalty was taken of the statue book. Although capital punishment has not been used in the United Kingdom since 1964 when there was the last hanging, it is a key part of the judiciary system. Currently anyone could commit treason or mass murder and only be sentenced to jail of course this would be for a long time however they would eventually be released and a public hate figure. Help me bring back capital punishment to bring back justice and control.  ",
