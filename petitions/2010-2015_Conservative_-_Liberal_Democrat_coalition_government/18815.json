        "additional_details": "The current NHS wheelchair service means that the cheapest chair possible is provided & if you need a more specialist chair then you have to fund it yourself. Myself along with many others with severe muscle wasting diseases rely on our chairs 24/7 & the chairs offered by the NHS do not meet our needs as the chairs they offer are very basic. Specialised chairs are very expensive & most people cannot afford them AND afford the maintenance & repairs of them. The NHS voucher scheme only covers the cost of a chair which the NHS would provide. I want the government to make more funding available for the NHS Wheelchair services so everybody who needs a more specialised chair can get what they are entitled to.",
