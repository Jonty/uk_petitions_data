In return for the willingness to put their lives on the line serving their country:\r\n\r\nBritish soldiers must always be able to expect fair treatment, to be valued and respected as individuals, and that they (and their families) will be sustained and rewarded by commensurate terms and conditions of service.\r\n\r\nIt is an agreement that should be held in such high regard that it should not need to be formally enshrined in the laws of the land. But if we are to safeguard the respect that our soldiers are owed, then it is a step that needs to be taken.\r\n",
