David Cameron's promises of; \"A new kind of politics.\" & \"We have learned our lesson we are listening.\" were just more spin.\r\nIt is now 'normal' for the public to be lied to almost daily.\r\nIn this new digital age we need to seriously update our tired democracy.\r\n\r\nNEW DEMOCRACY:    When voting at General Elections, each voter is registered with the Direct.Gov e.petitions website.\r\nPetitions started by & signed by registered voters HAVE to be acted on.\r\nPetitions that get 10% of the voting turnout HAVE to be debated within one month.\r\nPetitions that get 33% of voting turnout HAVE to be passed as law. (Unless an opposing petition gains more votes.)\r\nIf a petition calling for a General Election gets 33% of voter turnout - an election must be held within three months.\r\nThis 'new democracy' would increase voter turnout by people who want to have a say and now see that their vote is not wasted.\r\n\r\n ",
