        "additional_details": "The law dictates that couples, where one partner already has a child, are not entitled to free IVF.\r\n\r\nI do not agree that couples, where one partner already has a child, should be penalised and not qualify for free rounds of IVF.\r\n\r\nAs per Department of Health guidelines couples with no children should have 3 rounds of IVF treatment provided for free. I feel this should be the case for all couples who want to have their own family.\r\n\r\nIn today's financial climate it can be very hard to save for expensive IVF treatment. I'm sure many couples would pay for this if it were an option. Many do, but not all can.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to show your support for the countless couples who struggle to conceive, whether one or both already have children.",
