        "action": "More cycling and transport routes need to be added to Bristol",
        "additional_details": "I strongly feel that poor transport is a major issue within the Bristol region as there is a high level of accidents which occur due to traffic related incidents. I think that this issue could be solved if more cycling and walking routes were added. Traffic jams are also caused from the shortage of walking/cycling routes so creating more of these routes would free up space on the roads and keep our community more healthy and active and this is why I think this issue should be resolved.\r\n\r\nIt is advised that you sign this petition if you agree that this issue should looked into in more detail.",
