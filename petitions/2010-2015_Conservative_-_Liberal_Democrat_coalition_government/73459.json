        "action": "Ask Government of India to free Sikh prisoners who have finished their sentences given to them by the Indian Courts.",
        "additional_details": "Sikhs across India continue their peaceful struggle to secure the release of Sikh prisoners who have served their sentences but have not been released by the Indian Government and are being kept indefinitely. A Sikh in Haryana, Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa, a human rights activist, has been on hunger strike at Lakhnaur Gurdwara since 14/11/14, and he will enter the 51st day of his hunger strike on the 04/01/15. He is campaigning for the release of long serving Sikh prisoners who are being detained and deprived of their liberty even though they have served between 18 to 22 years.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned British Sikh Citizen I would appeal to the British Government to urge the Indian Government to release these prisoners as a matter of urgency as Gurbaksh Singh Khalsa has been on hunger strike for 51 days and yet no action has been taken. The continued arbitrary detention of Sikh Prisoners violates every norm of democracy, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International laws.\r\n",
