Its programmme standards continue to decline and much of the news presentation is biased and poorly presented. In addition if programmes require highly paid stars we should be given the option not to watch and therefore pay for them. This will soon show if these stars have a good audience.The licence fee should be abolished or considerably reduced and the viewing public given the option to view and pay for the luxury programmes.",
