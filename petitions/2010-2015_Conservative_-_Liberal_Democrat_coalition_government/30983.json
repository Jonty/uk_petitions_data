        "additional_details": "Put a stop to the mansion tax. Once in place, like other taxes, this tax will spread to those in all houses, not just those over \u00a32 million. Originally, the LibDems wanted it to be for houses over \u00a31 million. The only reason the starting level was raised is because it was so unpopular that they felt it wouldn't be accepted. Once here, it is here to stay and will affect everyone in the end. House prices will sink or stagnate. We do not want wealth taxes to become part of UK life. This tax will affect everyone in the end. Not just the rich. The government should never implement such a tax on the value of a first home. Don't be complacent just because it doesn't affect you - yet.",
