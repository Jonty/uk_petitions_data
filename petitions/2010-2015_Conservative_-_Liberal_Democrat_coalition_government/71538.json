        "additional_details": "A pet cat close to our heart does not have to be legally reported if it has been knocked down. There are so many missing cats and this is because there is not a law set in place for reporting such a tragedy. A pet dog is no different to a pet cat. Both are very much loved animals and cat owners have no rights to any laws. I feel there should be a law set in place where a cat is treated the same as a dog.",
