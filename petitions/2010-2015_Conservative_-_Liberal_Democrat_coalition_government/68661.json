The ISIS and other Islamist terrorist groups are direct and indirect consequence of the Iranian regime's extremely inhuman treatment of its opponents including Sunnite Muslims in Iran and countries such as Iraq and Syria.\r\nWe call upon the government to take immediate action to counter the root-cause of extremist Islamic terrorism, i.e. the Iranian regime by supporting the Iranian democratic opposition forces to bring democracy to Iran and protect human rights of the innocent in the Middle East and our own western interests.\r\n",
