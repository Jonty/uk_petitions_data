        "additional_details": "Sham arranged marriages are on the increase between EU citizen and a non-EU citizen on payment of a large fee to the EU citizen, as a ploy to remain in UK indefinitely. Marriage between a non-British EU citizen to a non-EU citizen in UK should be approved by the immigration department and any such marriage should last for at least 5 years before the right to remain in UK visa is issued to the non-EU spouse resident in UK. Extra resources should be made available the Borders Agency (like extra funds & fast access to the police, Home Secretary, Immigration Officers, MI5, MI6, etc) for covert surveillance of the possibility of sham arranged marriages occurring. Also any potential long term UK residents or citizen should be able to speak English competently for interactions in UK daily life, without need of interpreters.",
