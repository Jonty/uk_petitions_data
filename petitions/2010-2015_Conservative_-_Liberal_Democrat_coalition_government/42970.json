Marriage is the joining of two people into holy matrimony not two people just getting together and going official because of love.\r\n\r\nMarriage is more than just love it is a very holy (even if conducted in a registry office) and spiritual institution joining one man and one woman together.\r\n\r\nExisting civil partnerships for same-sex couples is perfectly applicable and allows for two homosexuals who love each other to be officially together.\r\n\r\nWe call on Her Majesty's Government not to bring forward equal marriage proposals",
