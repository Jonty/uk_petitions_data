        "additional_details": "At least one organisation and one country have made specific threats of violence against the British people.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore essential that all persons in British territories can be clearly identifiable.\r\n\r\nThe wearing of any mode of dress that negates this, except where the mode of dress is essential in terms of activity, must be banned. Therefore, full-face crash helmets are essential whilst riding a motorcycle or driving vehicles under certain conditions. Full-face balaclava helmets may be essential in conditions of extreme cold.\r\n\r\nItems of clothing such as the burqa, niqab and hijab are neither essential nor religious.\r\n\r\nThe ban must be applied to all irrespective of whether they are resident in the UK or visiting. Visitors to the UK should be made aware of the ban at the border and, if they refuse to comply, be refused entry.",
