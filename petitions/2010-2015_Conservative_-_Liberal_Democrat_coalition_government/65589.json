It would be grossly immoral, therefore, to allow him to slide off into any job involving UK policies in the EU.  He simply CANNOT be trusted to act impartially for the benefit of the UK.  He is a committed europhile ( in receipt of a shackling EU pension) who has been soundly rejected by the people.  HE MUST NOT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE AT THE EU, BECAUSE HE DOES NOT.",
