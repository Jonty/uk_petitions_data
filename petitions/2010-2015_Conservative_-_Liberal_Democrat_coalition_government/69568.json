        "additional_details": "Allowing cannabis users to grow their own plants at home will effectively devalue the trade for criminal gangs. Almost all victims involved in the cannabis trade are those who are forced to work, disputes over money owed, \"turf\" wars etc. The victims are never directly affected by the use of cannabis.\r\n\r\nCategory 4, lesser role of the CPS guidelines (growing for personal use) currently ranges from a short community order, to a fine. If this one category were to be legalised, it would certainly cut the number of more serious offences in relation, if not eradicate them all together.\r\n\r\nI'm asking for a licensing system to be considered, where a grower will pay a fee to obtain a licence allowing them to grow their own cannabis at home, for their own use, no exceptions. As with all licences, any rules broken will result in the licence being revoked.\r\n\r\n",
