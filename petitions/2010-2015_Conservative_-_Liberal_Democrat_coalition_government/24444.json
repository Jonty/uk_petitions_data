        "additional_details": "During the BBC2 documentary titled \"Your Money & How The Government Spend It\" on the 23/11/2011 the penny finally dropped for members of the public with regards to who receives the Winter Fuel Payment as members of the public thought that it was means tested so that only low income pensioners received it but when they were informed that millionaire pensioners received the Winter Fuel Payment they couldn't believe it.\r\n\r\nIt costs the taxpayer \u00a32.5 billion every year to pay the Winter Fuel Payment to all pensioners so just imagine that if 40% of well off pensioners no longer received the Winter Fuel Payment we would save \u00a31 billion every year. This money could then be better spent on apprenticeships & care for the elderly etc.\r\n\r\nLet's only pay Winter Fuel Payment to those pensioners in receipt of Pension Credit which reflects pensioners on low incomes and if we feel that we need to alter the Pension Credit threshold to capture more pensioners on low income then lets do so.\r\n",
