We petition the government to create a fund to compensate those who have missed work or had to pay for childcare, those who have had to rearrange travel plans and those who have had life changing operations delayed.\r\n\r\nThe funds should come from the foregone wages of striking workers with any shortfall being deducted from their pay packets over the next 12 months.",
