They are paid by every family in the country including people on minimum pay rates, through the TV licence.\r\n\r\nTo rub salt in the wounds it transpires that hundreds of the BBC's top paid staff are not even paying income tax etc.\r\n\r\nWe hereby petition that BBC presenters and equivelent staff have a salary cap of \u00a3500,000 a year and are only employed as \" employee's \" paying full tax and NI the same as ordinary mortals.\r\n\r\nThis would not cause a mass exodus of staff as the private sector broadcasting companies would quickly follow suit.  It would also allow up and coming talented people to progress. ",
