        "additional_details": "Speed humps are physically dangerous and morally indefensible..\r\nPHYSICALLY DANGEROUS They  cause drivers and passengers back problems and exarcebate chronic illnesses such as as osteoporosis. They also cause vehicle deterioration and exhaust problems which can cause increased pollution and damage to the environment.\r\n\r\nMORALLY INDEFENSIBLE\r\nCitizens should be advised through traffic signs that there are specific speed restrictions or that they are driving too fast and should be penalised through the courts for doing so.\r\n\r\nThey should not be punished physically for so doing. As a nation we encourage people to  behave reasonably .Except in the case of speed humps we do not physically punish them for not doing so..\r\n\r\nThe government should ban them and replace them by more sensible,reasonable and democratic means of encouraging safety-eg electronicwarning signs,radar,advisory speed limits etc.",
