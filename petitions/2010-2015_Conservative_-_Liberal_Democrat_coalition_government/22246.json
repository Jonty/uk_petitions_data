        "additional_details": "Young drivers are now finding it nigh on impossible to get car insurance. With some quotes in the region of some \u00a320,000+, young people can not pay for the insurance so they can build up a no claims bonus to reduce it in the future. I ask that you sign this petition to support my aim of making it illegal under a rectified Age Discrimination Act to charge different prices for people of different ages for car insurance. Insurance companies are BLATANTLY discriminating against young drivers. It's time for this to stop. Sign this petition and play your part in ending this.",
