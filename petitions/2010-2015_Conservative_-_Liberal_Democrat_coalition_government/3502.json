They are too complex & costly to implement and therefore alienate competent and highly skilled individual craftsmen, professional engineers and small businesses.\r\nOngoing costs of maintaining certification are also kept very high by the small group of appointed certifying bodies who continually implement minor regulation and rule changes to generate up date courses and  fees . It also very well known within the industry that the award of Part P Certification only indicates a fee has been paid for passing a short domestic electrical course syllabus . The certification It does NOT indicate skill or competence in the electrical  installation trade which is very confusing to the general public who are paying the high on costs of Part P but receiving little real benefit.\r\n",
