With no NHS support the work NCAT & the alliance has done & which people have benefitted will end.\r\n\r\nBME people will no longer have an equal footing like that of the mainstream charities & comes when analysis evidences the awareness of cancer being generally lower with higher rates of diagnosis & the patient experience being less positive.\r\n\r\nReducing inequalities during austerity will save the NHS money in the long term. The legacy of the positive contribution of many BME people must not be ignored. If support for BME Cancer disappears, so will their Voice.",
