        "additional_details": "As labour finally admit that employment agencies are giving preferences to european workers than british workers. It is time the government changed its policy on the way job centres are used to place british workers back to work.\r\n1. Not to force people into work for no pay (This has happened with a degree graduate working alongside European workers) How can this be justified.\r\n2. Be allowed to compete with agencies to place British workers back to work.\r\n3. Powers to revoke agencies licence who give preference to European workers. Example percentage of workers in actual work.\r\nThe private sector have proved they can not be trusted to help their own (the british worker) agencies are only interested in profit, and are the main body that each year invest in recruitment from european countries.",
