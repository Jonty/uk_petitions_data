        "additional_details": "A new e-petition site needs to be added to the existing one, a site that is much more user friendly to those wishing to write e-petitions, but more importantly for those wishing to sign them. The new site would work down through menus of subject areas, through different levels down to specific areas of public interest. So people who wish to sign petitions can quickly and simply navigate through the system to find what interests them and what inspires their involvement. There needs to be a limited number of e-petitions per specific area of interest, 100's of petitons to trawl through will put people off the process and skew results as only the first few petitions would get looked at and voted on.\r\nOnly those voted for under the existing system could be promoted to the new site when they reach a set number of signatures from the public.\r\n",
