        "additional_details": "I propose a mandatory 6 year warranty on all electronic and electrical items sold for consumer use which are sold for more than \u00a3100. This will reduce the amount of Waste Electrical items which are discarded simply because they have stopped working a few months out of warranty. A good example is televisions. If a \u00a3900 television stops working after 18 months of use, unless the consumer has purchased an extended warranty, the item is usually impossible or too expensive to repair. Manufacturers and retailers should also be targeted on the number of returned items which are actually repaired rather than written off and scrapped. This will create more jobs in the UK for people who will repair the returned products. Prices will not increase dramatically because retailers will still need to be competitive.",
