This is not true democracy, and is left open to all sorts of abuses and trade offs. All Manifestos, the document that allows us to decide who we want to lead this great nation should, by law, once the government is voted in be adhered to. Especially when certain promises contained in the Manifesto, are relevant to our country and our people, and probably won the party the election.  ",
