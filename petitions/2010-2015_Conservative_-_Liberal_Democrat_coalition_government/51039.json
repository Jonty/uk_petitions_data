The publication hides behind it's trusted readership to convey hatred to the public.\r\nMost recently this hideous piece of propaganda;\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2332998/One-country-religions-telling-pictures-The-pews-churches-just-yards-overcrowded-mosque.html\r\n\r\nYes, we can all agree time's are tough, tensions are high between communities, but we certainly do NOT need to be fed misleading articles and have our differences highlighted constantly.\r\n\r\nThe Daily Mail is in direct breach of the act under Section 29B:\r\n(1) A person who uses threatening words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, is guilty of an offence if he intends thereby to stir up religious hatred.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication consistently stirs up racial hatred within our community and there is no place for this in our modern, multicultural society.\r\n\r\nThings have to change.\r\n\r\n",
