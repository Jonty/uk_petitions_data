        "additional_details": "Now that the London 2012 Olympics are over, the public have a much clearer view as to the legacy they want for the Olympic stadium.\r\n\r\nAfter watching Team GB's athletes 'inspire a generation', nothing can be more inspirational than affording everyone the chance to run and compete on the same track that the world's athletes competed on during the Games.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, this petition calls on the Government to enforce the retention of the athletics track at the Olympic stadium, regardless of whoever obtains ownership in the future - and regardless of whatever the future purpose of the stadium becomes.",
