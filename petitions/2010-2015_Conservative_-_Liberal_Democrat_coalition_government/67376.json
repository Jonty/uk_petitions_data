        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to immediately withdraw emergency legislation seeking to maintain surveillance of UK citizens ruled illegal by the European Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nIn April, the European Court of Justice ruled that the EU Data Retention Directive was unlawful. The Government is now seeking to legalise the practices by passing emergency legislation. This is a clear affront to citizens rights - attempting to re-introduce Government surveillance practices already deemed illegal.\r\n\r\nThe last government already eroded many of our civil liberties by introducing electronic surveillance, detention without charge, criminalising protest and indefinite detention without trial. This coalition government is attempting to erode them further.\r\n\r\nWe fundamentally reject this assault on our right to privacy and call on the Government to drop the legislation, and on opposition parties to vote against any attempts to curtail our fundamental rights in this way.",
