        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to scrap tuition fees and make higher education free for students.\r\n\r\nEducation is absolutely vital for people to be able to participate fully in society and as such, access to learning should be as wide as possible, with no person made to feel excluded by prohibitively high costs. Scrapping tuition fees will reduce the debt that graduates must pay back and stop the marketisation of higher education that treats students as consumers.\r\n\r\nThis petition is on behalf of the Young Greens (www.younggreens.org.uk)",
