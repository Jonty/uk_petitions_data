        "additional_details": "Helston and the surrounding area, really does need an overhaul of it's transport links!\r\n\r\nFacts:\r\n1. The minimum amount of time between buses is 1 hour.\r\n2. The buses are timed awkwardly, especially for a connection to a train service.\r\n3. The population of this whole area is over 33,000.\r\n4. This particular topic is frequent in this area and is seen in a truly disappointing light.\r\n5. Truro - Penzance/St Ives buses run every 10 minutes. Refer to number one on this list.\r\n6. A rail link for this area, whilst including more frequent bus services, would be a good mix of better buses and easier connection to trains; especially long journeys.\r\n\r\nOverall, whatever can be done to improve this area's transport links is desperately needed; Helston itself seems to have been forgotten by the rest of the world!",
