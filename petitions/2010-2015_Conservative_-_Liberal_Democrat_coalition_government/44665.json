        "additional_details": "It is beyond all doubt that opinion polls can often shape public opinion rather than reflecting it and close to an election this can be damaging.\r\n\r\nThis is because people 'jump on the band wagon', don't want to go out to vote for a loser and may even vote for a candidate they don't really want because they feel that their chances are better; therefore the votes are not accurate of true public opinion.\r\n\r\nFurther to this the stopping of the publishing would mean that more people will go out and vote because they do not know if their party is safe or not and therefore increasing political participation which is only a good thing.\r\n\r\nOpinion polls have no positive impacts at such a late stage in the election process",
