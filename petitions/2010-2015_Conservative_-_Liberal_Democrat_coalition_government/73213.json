        "additional_details": "There is veritable evidence that her actions are damaging this country's economy and reputation. She has:\r\n\r\n- Robbed British citizens of their citizenship\r\n\r\n- Been willing to extradite British born citizens and British-named citizens to the United States\r\n\r\n- Discouraged skilled professional workers to come to this country.\r\n\r\n- Underestimated the number of migrants actually coming in despite intending to reduce them.\r\n\r\n- Scapegoated EU citizens on benefits\r\n\r\nAnd now:\r\n\r\n- Is willing to deport foreign students to attempt to gain 'net zero migration' due to the relative ease of  tracking down said students, an idea that is not only stupid and harmful to the economy and irrelevant to the low-paid economic brackets who are taking the brunt of the socially negative effects of immigration, as they are more common in the sciences, but also appears to be an outright admission of sheer administrative incompetence.\r\n\r\nAnd possibly many more.\r\n\r\nAnd possibly, we don't want any more.",
