        "additional_details": "Our motorways are creaking under the strain of traffic and billions of pounds is being spent on widening and improving these vital transport links. Even a small hold up can mean long tailbacks. Many areas of slow moving traffic are caused by inconsiderate and unaware drivers sitting for miles in the middle or third lanes of these roads. Unable to overtake the traffic builds up and causes congestion as well as the increased chance of accidents due to large lane changes by other drivers.\r\nMany of these \"middle lane drivers\" are unaware of the law (Highway Code rule 264 in particular) and are driving without due care and attention.\r\nThis petition asks for the department of Transport to run a campaign to increase the awareness of motorway users by using the overhead traffic signs and produce TV and web based information films on this subject.\r\nThis petition also asks that the police target this problem more to highlight it.\r\n",
