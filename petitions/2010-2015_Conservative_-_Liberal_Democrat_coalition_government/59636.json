Our campaign is to persuade the Government to address the current lack of school swimming standards in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Petition\r\n\r\nOur aim is that every school child by the time they leave KS2 will be able to swim a distance of 100m using a range of strokes effectively, and this will be Ofsted regulated and inspected. Children need to have weekly swimming lessons throughout the year in order to build water confidence, instead of one school term a year and this MUST include water safety/awareness in different water based conditions and the ability to perform self rescue techniques. KS2 requirement for a child to swim 25m unaided is met by only 49% of state school pupils. Put starkly, 1.1 million school children cannot swim.",
