        "additional_details": "Dear Leader:\r\n\r\nPlease nominate Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II to the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize.\r\nNominations will begin on September, 2012.\r\n\r\nAs described in Alfred Nobel's will, one part was dedicated to \"the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".\r\n\r\nThat describes Her Majesty's work over the past 60 years. She shaped  the actual Commonwealth of Nations, visited the Vatican, vastly improving religious relations with the Holy See after centuries of division and toured Northern Ireland on  \"a historic  peacemaking milestone that has been a quarter-century in the making\". The latter  symbolised reconciliation and emphasised the strong bond between the two countries.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above, please nominate ASAP.\r\n\r\nThank You, ",
