        "additional_details": "I believe that blood donors should be given by law one extra day off from work for every single donation they undertake as it is a common practice in several other European countries. So far, I have donated five times, and each and every time I was indirectly forced to use my holidays for that occasion. I am convinced that the new practice would attract plenty more people to go and donate, which is something the NHS strives for so badly nowadays.",
