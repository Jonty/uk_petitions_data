        "action": "Amendment to the Child Abandonment Law of 1861",
        "additional_details": "The actual amount of babies abandoned each year in the UK is unknown this is due to the fact there are no policies or procedures set and each council works independantly. It is not unreasonable to state that between 30-60 babies are abandoned each year.\r\nMost European Countries and the USA have introduced an amendment which states if a person surrenders their newborn child up to the age of xx days safely and responsibly they are exempt from prosecution. They can also receive medical help, advice and support.  It also means, most importantly, the baby is alive and safe to either be reunited with the mother or placed into our adoption system.\r\nThis petiton is asking our government to add a similar amendment and to establish safe places for foundling babies to be left. With this amendment proper policies, procedures and support can be issued UK wide in regards to the specific handling of foundling babies, natural parents and foundling adoptive parents. These babies need your support!\r\n",
