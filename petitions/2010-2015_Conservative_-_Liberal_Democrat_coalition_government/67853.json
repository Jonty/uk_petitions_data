        "additional_details": "Following the ECHR ruling upholding the French ban on public face-masking, the UK should follow suit by outlawing all garments, including balaclavas, hoodies, etc that conceals/obscures a person's identity.\r\n\r\nMany Muslims have been misled by bogus propaganda from fundamentalists that the burqa / niqab is integral to Islam. This is untrue. It is a tribal cloth that is pre-Islamic, non-Qur'anic and un-Muslim.  Female public anonymity is an imported Saudi-Afghan fad.\r\n\r\nThe burqa / niqab must be resisted for compelling theological, social, health, security, gender equity and patriarchal reasons so that Britain\u2019s traditional character is preserved. We must oppose this salvo from theological extremists seeking to impose their warped version of Islam.\r\n\r\nAs integrated British Muslims, we ask HMG to initiate a parliamentary debate about this disturbing anti-social trend. If the burka is prohibited in Mecca, why is public anonymity tolerated in Britain on spurious grounds?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
