        "action": "Stop Rupert Murdoch's BBC robbery",
        "additional_details": "The BBC is being forced to hand over tens of millions of pounds every year to line Rupert Murdoch's pockets. Murdoch's cronies in government are determined to save this scheme -- but together we can stop this outrage. These unbelievable regulations cost our public broadcasters up to \u00a3100 million a year. Rather than being paid for their valuable content, they actually have to pay BSkyB to show their programmes even though they add huge value to the satellite platform -- accounting for 41% of all shows watched on BSkyB and vastly increasing customer retention. In the coming days, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt will decide whether to renew this dreadful deal - I urge you to sign this petition to ask him to end the unfair rules that force the BBC to hand over tens of million of pounds every year to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s BSkyB. These fees don't exist in other Western countries.\r\n",
