        "additional_details": "We want the government to widen the investigation in order to produce a new report (post 12th September 2012) that establishes all the facts pertaining to exactly how the disaster unfolded including looking into evidence surrounding the crushing occurring at Gate C of the Leppings Lane Stand, statements from workers at the ground that were either never taken or were deemed irrelevant and much, much more. The objective of this e-petition is to bring acceptance that those rightly blamed in the latest report were not the only ones and that there are others who need to be added to the list. The City Of Liverpool needed the report released today (12th September 2012) and that's totally correct. The City Of Sheffield also needs closure so that it too can move on as well as reconcile with the City Of Liverpool and work together, for good in the memory of the 96 Victims.",
