        "additional_details": "In winter 2011/11 one pensioner died of the cold every 7 minutes.  In the 2011 budget the winter fuel allowance was reduced by up to \u00a3100.  This year pensioner tax allowances have been frozen for some and taken away for others, and a new flat rate pension of \u00a3140 is proposed.  The official poverty rate is \u00a3180 a week and UK pensions are among the lowest in Europe.  Pensioners need more say in government, and the first step should be for the PM to appoint an independent pensioner tsar to represent pensioners at government level.",
