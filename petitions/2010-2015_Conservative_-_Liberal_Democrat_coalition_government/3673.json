        "additional_details": "The government is spending over \u00a37bn on the two new royal navy 'supercarriers' but as of the SDSR only one will come into full service, the other being put into 'extended readiness' (mothballing) then is likely to be sold off to a foreign military. These carriers are incredibly useful military assets which the government is already committed to paying for and only making use of one of them is a short sighted waste. This petition calls on the government to bring both of the planned Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers into full service with the Royal Navy and provide britain with a fantastic military capability which will see service well into this century.",
