        "additional_details": "Sound limiters are a device that is fitted to the power supply in an \"entertainment\" venue which measures the room volume and if it eceeds a set dB rating it cuts the power supply to all connected equipment. These devices are offen set by people who do not know how \"loud\" say 82dB actually isnt and are also offen not calibrated correctly. When cutting power this can cause damage to expensive connected equipment. To stay within the set dB limit requires EQing that reduces the dynamics of the music and very low sound level that is not suitable for \"entertainment\" which in turn means reduction in quality of sound and lack of atmosphere making the venue \"not fit for purpose\".",
