        "additional_details": "This is a petition for persons who have to travel to and from work primarily via train. As the cost of a season ticket is becoming too expensive, a rebate should be given. The purpose of travel is for work purposes and there is too little promotions provided for such an expensive cost. The rebate should be in the form of a payment within one month's salary which should be administered by the employer (similar to the Cycle to Work Scheme). The cost of the season ticket should also be spread via earnings so that less tax is paid. This is affordable and reasonable to the Treasury whilst giving something back to the commuter.",
