We need an outright ban on using these products and not allowed to be sold in shops, classifieds or online in the UK or destined for the UK so the above is all illegal and a law can be passed:\r\n\r\nProng/pinch collars, spray collars, choke chains, shock collars and anything barbaric not to be used on animals in the UK.\r\n\r\nDogs especially are getting the raw deal on this. I hope to reach enough signatures to be heard in parliament to protect our canine and animal friends.\r\n\r\nWE WISH AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON USE, SELLING IN ANY WAY ON THE ABOVE BARBARIC ITEMS.\r\n\r\nThankyou.",
