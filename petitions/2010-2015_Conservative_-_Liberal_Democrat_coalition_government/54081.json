        "additional_details": "I was shocked to learn that some families with more than one disabled person each have a mobility car!\r\n\r\nThe government should limit the number of mobility vehicles in any household to 1.\r\n\r\nNormal, hard working families normally only have 1 vehicle and have to share the use of it. No reason why the disabled should not have to do the same.\r\n\r\nNormally the vehicles are used for shopping and days out, hospital appointments etc I suppose. With a little planning this can all be achieved with one shared vehicle.\r\n\r\nI presume this could save the UK tax payer Billions.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this epetition and copy it to your facebook and twitter.\r\n\r\nPlease also consider joining\r\n\r\nwww.boycottarmy.com",
