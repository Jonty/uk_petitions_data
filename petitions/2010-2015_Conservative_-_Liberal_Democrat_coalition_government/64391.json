This is a grave and should not be desecrated by such visits which are also used as robberies as people claim \"souvenirs\" for display at home or to sell for small fortunes. These goods do not belong to anyone but the people unfortunate enough to have been on board, or to the ship's owners. The wreck should be treated with respect as it is the last resting place of 100s of people.",
