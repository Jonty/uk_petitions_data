WHAT ARE THEY CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS THE ROAD THAT GIVES THEM THE RIGHT TO BE ON THE ROAD. WHY IS IT THAT THEY CAN GO THROUGH RED LIGHTS AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM, BUT FOR MOTORISTS WE WOULD GET STOPPED BY THE POLICE RECEIVE A FINE, POINTS AND EVEN END UP GOING COURT. IT SHOULD BE FAIR FOR MOTORISTS AND CYCLIST'S IF THEY ARE BOTH ON THE ROAD. IT SHOULDN'T MATTER IF IT'S 1 CYCLIST TO 100 MOTOR VEHICLES. THEY ARE STILL USING THE ROAD. THEY NEED A NUMBER PLATE AND NEED TO PAY ROAD TAX !!!",
