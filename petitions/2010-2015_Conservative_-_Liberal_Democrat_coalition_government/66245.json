        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has currently wasted tax payers money and decided to buy 23yr old crowd control water cannon vehicles from our good pals in the EU, Ze Germans.\r\n\r\nThis is before that other wonderful politician, Home Secretary Theresa May, has sanctioned their use on the streets thus possibly wasting around 30k for each vehicle.\r\n\r\nChallenged on LBC radio yesterday, 9th June, by one Nick Ferrari, to stand in front of and take the force of the cannon, he reluctantly agreed to.\r\n\r\nEven with the media support I believe this to be a total lie, which will be swept under the carpet, but with your help I feel we can achieve this. If they are going to be sanctioned and used on our good tax paying citizens they need to be tested for safety first on our London Mayor.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share so that we may achieve this goal.",
