        "additional_details": "During 2011, HMRC recruited over 4000 Fixed Term Appointment Officers to help get HMRC's systems, call handling and post receipts up to date.\r\nNow that that is under control, HMRC has made the decision to end these employments based in the reason that the 'work is no longer there'. But on the contrary, the work is still indeed there and the 4000 employees are very much needed.\r\nIt was also made evident in a recent consultation that 98% of HMRC staff believe the department is severely under staffed.\r\nHelp this matter reach the House of Commons and make the Government and HMRC invest in its staff to help close the tax gap and with the effecient operation of the tax system by keeping those vital people in their jobs.",
