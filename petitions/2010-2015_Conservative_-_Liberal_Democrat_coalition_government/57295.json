        "additional_details": "Prescription prices are currently \u00a37.85 and there have been recommendations to increase this to \u00a310 to raise funds for the NHS. 90% of prescriptions are given free of charge to those exempt.\r\n\r\nWhy not create a two tier charge. Those who would normally get it free can pay \u00a31 an item and those who would normally pay can pay \u00a35 an item.\r\n\r\nCurrently with 100 prescriptions the money raised would only be \u00a378.50, with the \u00a310 prescription charge it would only be \u00a3100, with my suggestion it would be \u00a3140 minus kids. It would be better for the NHS, better for prescription payers and minimal contribution from those exempt.\r\n\r\nMaybe more people would be able to afford their medications and would therefore take them. That may then reduce recurrent hospital admissions saving even more money for the NHS and easing some of the pressures on the hospital bed especially in winter months.\r\n\r\nMake it a fairer system for everyone, let everyone contribute to keeping the NHS going, we all benefit from it!",
