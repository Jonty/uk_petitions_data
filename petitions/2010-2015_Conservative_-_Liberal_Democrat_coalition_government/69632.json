To stop it being ruined by Breathalysers sign this petition.\r\n\r\nAlcohol is a legal way to enjoy your night out and no one should be worried about their blood alcohol level before entering a club. It is not an effective way to tackle binge drinking at the door of a club. It will increase house parties, damage the local economy and cause more instances of public disturbance. We can't allow this. Save your Loughborough experience.\r\n\r\n",
