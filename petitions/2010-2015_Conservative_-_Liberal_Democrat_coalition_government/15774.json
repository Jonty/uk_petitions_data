        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge the government to consider the possible impact of vehicles which are able to drive themselves.\r\n\r\nThe technology already exists, and has moved beyond the development phase and into road tests. At present, legislation is lagging far behind industry.\r\n\r\nThere are clear benefits in terms of road safety and congestion to be achieved by these vehicles, and the government must act soon if the UK is to reap these benefits.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also many unanswered questions regarding the legality of this technology, and which party would be held liable in the event of an accident. These questions must be considered and legislated upon.\r\n\r\nBy implementing forward-looking legislation regarding these vehicles, the UK would put itself at the forefront of technological development, and solve many long standing problems of our transport infrastructure.",
