        "additional_details": "We're totally dismayed that the BBC has voluntarily given up its rights to full coverage of F1 in 2012 and 2013.\r\n\r\nThe BBC's F1 coverage is Bafta award winning and serves a demographic that is poorly served by the licence fee. The compromise of showing half of races portrays how little the people behind this decision understand the sport. A Formula One season evolves - the enjoyment of viewers comes not from single races, but from the whole narrative arc of twenty events.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the full HD service presently offered, Formula One viewers will have to spend in excess of \u00a3600 per year on Sky.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this deal extends an inadequate standard of coverage right up to 2018, locking out other free-to-air broadcasters from covering the whole season.\r\n\r\nGovernment should force the BBC to renegotiate the deal with Sky and ensure that Formula One is added to the so called 'crown jewels' of sports rights - meaning it is always available free-to-air.",
