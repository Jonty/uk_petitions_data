This issue is one of human rights. While Canada is one of the richest countries in the world, hundreds of First Nations communities live in poverty and recent proposed changes will exacerbate that.\r\n\r\nThe British government should acknowledge and support the protest in the interest of human rights and to put pressure on the Canadian government to stop deliberately ignoring the issues.",
