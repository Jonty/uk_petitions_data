        "additional_details": "The popular boy band One Direction fails to reflect the ethnic diversity of Great Britain. With four members of the band having brown hair and one with blonde, this e petition aims to encourage parliament to recruit and appoint a band member with red 'ginger' hair to more accurately portray this Country's ethnic diversity. There is already much national support for such an initiative as highlighted by the successful petition to appoint the ginger one into the Spice Girls during the 1990's.",
