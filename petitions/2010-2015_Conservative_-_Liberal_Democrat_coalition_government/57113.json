        "additional_details": "My sister is among many women who have worked all\r\ntheir lives (in her case 44 years) and were suddenly\r\ntold their pension age was rising from 60 to 65. Had she\r\nhad her daughter as a single mother, the government\r\nwould be happy to have given her a free home and\r\nbenefits for life. Because she chose to get married, work , and pay taxes they have penalised her. Had\r\nshe known further in advance it would not have been\r\nso bad. The government should reinstate the pension\r\nrights for these women, and recover the money by\r\nlimiting women who have always lived on benefits to child support for only the first child, in future.",
