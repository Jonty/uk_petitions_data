        "additional_details": "A law to be introduced for businesses to be bound to pay its hourly pay rated staff time and half (or similar) for working on Bank Holidays. Many industries such as retail and hospitality see bank holiday as a chance to make extra sales with the extra foot-fall on the streets. Staff in these industries rarely get this time off or receive a day in lieu, unlike those in other sectors. This would make it fairer for those who work on a Bank Holiday, and who still only receive their normal pay rate. With 8 bank holidays a year it shouldn't impact businesses that much.",
