This is a miserable and life changing condition that affects every minute of every day.  It is expensive and very time consuming to control.  Subsequent infections are frequent and painful.\r\n\r\nCurrently the operation is only available if paid for privately.  I want the government to make the surgery available on the NHS.  This will prevent disability and save money in the longer term.  ",
