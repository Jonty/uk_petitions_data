        "additional_details": "The current MPs do not represent the British public fairly and do not have a clear understanding of society or their local electorate. In future each MP must have been born inside their constituency and reside within it full time apart from when voting in Westminister. They must not go immediately from university straight into a political career (e.g special advisor after studying PPE).Instead they must have five years of a career before standing at local or national elections. Finally no block voting and political party WHIPS usage as it is not a fair and true democratic representation of their local electorate who voted them in! This will clear a true representation of a modern British society`s thoughts and opinions of all issues and how best to solve them.",
