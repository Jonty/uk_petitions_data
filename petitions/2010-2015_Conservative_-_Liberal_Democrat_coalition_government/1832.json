        "additional_details": "For English MPs to vote on England-only issues. This is to stop the publically viewed unfairness of mainly the Scottish MPs voting malevolently or with party-politics on England only issues to the disadvantage of the English public e.g. Scottish MPs voting for no tuition fees in Scotland but for tuition fees in England which is just double-standards and unfair. This petition is to cover all issues where Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland have a separate choice to England, in essence English MPs to vote for England-only issues.",
