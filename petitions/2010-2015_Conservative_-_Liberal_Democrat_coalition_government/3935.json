        "additional_details": "A study found the only European country with a lower rape-conviction rate than the UK was Ireland. According to the Fawcett Society, the rate of reporting rape in the UK is increasing, but the conviction rate is diminishing. In 2004 the conviction rate for reported rape was 5.3%. In a more recent study, the conviction rate was shown to be worse in 18 out of 43 police areas since 2004. These disturbing statistics indicate that a dramatic overhaul to our current legal system is required NOW, along-side progressive action to radically change cultural beliefs towards rape. I want the government to address this appalling imbalance, this on-going atrocity of justice, with the amount of energy and financial support it morally deserves. ",
