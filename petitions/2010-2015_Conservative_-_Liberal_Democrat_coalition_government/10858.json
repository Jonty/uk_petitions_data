        "additional_details": "Recent events have highlighted the need for people to start respecting the neighbourhoods in which they live in and that of others.  Many of these people, whether young or old are unemployed and obviously have few social skills and are claiming unemployment benefit.  We as a nation make it far to easy for people to sit back and claim for doing nothing.  Anyone claiming unemployment should be made to do community work from the first day of their claim while looking for work, this will give them experience and skills needed for employment in new fields, while helping the communities which pay for their benefits.",
