        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to legalise cannabis and reap all of the economical and political benefits from doing so.\r\n\r\nA desire to classify cannabis in line with legal drugs that have been proven more harmful than cannabis such as alcohol and tobacco. Cannabis should be taken out of the black market and sold by licensed vendors where the government can ensure there are strict quality controls, whilst raking in millions of pounds worth of taxes and getting dealers off the streets. Keeping cannabis illegal only makes it more harmful, and wastes significant amounts of police time and money.\r\n\r\nA petition to also ensure herbal cannabis is available to those who need it medicinally to treat chronic illnesses.",
