As a sufferer myself we can apply for \" Can't Wait\" cards which should give us access to the toilets on the premises to which we are at as we have to go immediately. These cards need to be made obligatory, I am a member of the a Crohns group and it appears that many of us have had accidents on premises which could have been avoided if only we had been given access to the toilets. This is a very embarrassing disease at times and it's just a small ask and would help us Crohnies lives be so much better knowing we will have access to toilets and therefore we could leave our homes more and not be in fear of going out should the inevitable happens.",
