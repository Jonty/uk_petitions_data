        "additional_details": "Premenstrual Dysphoric Dysfunction (PMDD) is a hormonal imbalance that controls a woman's life. It is worse than PMS or PMT. PMDD makes a woman act in ways that she wouldn't if she didn't have PMDD. Serious mood swings. Violent Angry outbursts. Depression. Tiredness. Anxiety, At the moment there are women in prison that wouldn't be in prison if they didn't have this condition. There needs to be more understanding by the courts about this condition and instead of giving women criminal records for committing offenses whilst in PMDD mode give them the help and the medical attention that they need.",
