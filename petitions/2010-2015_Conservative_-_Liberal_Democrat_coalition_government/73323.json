        "additional_details": "I urge the Department for Transport to source funding to dual the remaining sections of single carriageway on the A66 between the A1 soon to be be A1(M) at Scotch Corner and M6 J40 near Penrith. The A66 is a notorious road in terms of collisions and standards. There have been countless fatalities on this stretch of trunk road over the pennines, often resulting in lengthily delays and diversion routes that are simply inadequate. The A66 carries mass amounts of freight traffic from the industrial areas of Teesside and Yorkshire to the Lake District and Scotland. This road handles the same vehicles per day, and types of vehicles i.e.. HGV's and commuters as some of the countries main motorways. I believe that upgrading the whole route to dual carriageway would reduce the number of collisions and have a huge positive impact on the regions economy as the nearest good quality cross Pennine route is the M62",
