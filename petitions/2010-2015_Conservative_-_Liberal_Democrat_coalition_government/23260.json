        "additional_details": "I propose that a law be passed which creates the criminal offence of 'Failure to Collect Taxes'.  This would apply to HMRC if they failed to collect lawfully due taxes from companies and corporations.  This would carry heavy penalties commensurate to theft of the same amount of money, because it is in effect theft from the taxpayers.  E.g. failure to collect \u00a36 billion from a corporation if it was legally due would attract the same penalty as stealing \u00a36 billion.",
