        "additional_details": "Under current UK law it is illegal to carry a folding knife with a lock in public, I believe this is an unhelpful and unnecessary limit on our rights. Locking knives are safer and easier to use than the non-locking ones currently available, we should not be inconveniencing law abiding members of the public in this manner. I would ask the government to make it legal to carry folding knives with a blade lock in public.",
