        "additional_details": "The PM David Cameron has pledged a massive \u00a38.3 billion of British taxpayers money to foreign aid. This is against the wishes of the majority of British citizens and taxpayers. This 'Aid' money seldom reaches its intended  cause, ie Development, but is used instead to support commercial enterprises, political parties, and also terrorist organizations.\r\n\r\nI therefore request that the government allocates \u00a37 billion pound of the foreign aid budget to be used at home under the title, 'Home Aid'. This will help to modernise the infra-structure and generate employment.\r\n\r\nAusterity is crippling the UK, and we cannot afford to waste funds paid in by British taxpayers to disappear overseas.",
