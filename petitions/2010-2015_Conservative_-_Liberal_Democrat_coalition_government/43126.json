It will lead to over-treatment, anxiety and other harms to patients, and diversion of resources. Instead, the priority should be investment to improve access to diagnosis and support for patients and their families who are already seeking help.\r\n\r\nWhile medication can help the symptoms of dementia, \u2018no treatments are currently available to cure or even alter the progressive course of dementia.\u2019 (WHO, 2012).\r\n\r\nA fuller explanation, with references, can be found in our letter to the BMJ at http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e2347/rr/619428",
