        "additional_details": "Currently, items that are not collected regularly by local councils are taken to recycling centres by members of the public. But many of these journeys are simply uneconomic, wasting more petrol and creating more co2 than they save. We should be actively trying to encourage people to avoid using their cars when recycling. To this aim, local councils should be required to offer the free collection of unusual items, not covered by weekly collections. Home-owners could be limited to a certain number of  collections per year, per household.  ",
