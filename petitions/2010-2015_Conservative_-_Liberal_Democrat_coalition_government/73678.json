I have always worked since leaving school and never been a member of any Union.That said this statement is appalling. If the British working public are not allowed to make their views known legally through strike action, bearing in mind many are afraid to already because of fear of losing their jobs,what are they to do. If MP's want more who stops them getting it a panel of ex MP's ? Have you ever wondered why they do not strike, and NO not because they do the job because they care. If they want over inflation rises and bigger pensions let us decide. ",
