At present, only those who make these accusations are protected by the law and allowed to remain anonymous. This is wrong and is an outrageous situation for it can lead to deep distress for anyone who is wrongly and falsely accused, ruining their lives, sometimes forever.  We need URGENT action on this matter. ",
