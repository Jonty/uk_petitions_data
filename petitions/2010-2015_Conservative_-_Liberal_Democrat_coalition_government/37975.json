        "additional_details": "The subject of eating disorders is often ignored and not usually seen as a mental illness. We believe that if children from as young as 12 years old are educated about the symptoms and severity of eating disorders, where to turn when they have a problem and how to feel comfortable in their own skin we will see a decrease in the amount of teenagers developing eating disorders. We want children to be educated on mental health and know they shouldn't blame themselves. We believe and education in eating disorders and mental health will lead to a healthier and happier future.",
