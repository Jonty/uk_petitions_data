        "additional_details": "We the undersigned deplore the decision to devalue the importance of Nurse Florence  Nightingale in the history text books, the school curriculum and examinations and replace her with Mary Seacole.Nurse Nightingale was responsible for many best practices in nursing which are still relevant today whereas Ms Seacole was not even a trained nurse. By all means honour Mary Seacole, but not at the expense of Florence Nightingale. We call upon the Department of Education to restore Florence Nightingale to her rightful role in history.",
