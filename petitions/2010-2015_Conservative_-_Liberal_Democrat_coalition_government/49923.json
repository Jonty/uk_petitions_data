        "additional_details": "George Ravenhill was awarded he Victoria Cross in 1901 for actions above and beyond the call of duty on 15th December, 1899. He was later stripped of this award because he stole scrap metal to sell for money to feed his family.He couldn't afford to paythe fine and as such was stripped of his VC and his pension. He died in poverty at the age of 49 and his children were taken away to be fostered or adopted in America/Canada.\r\nKing George V later decreed in 1920 that any recipient of the VC should never be stripped of the award. And summed it up in these terms \"The King feels so strongly that, no matter the crime committed by anyone on whom the VC has been conferred, the decoration should not be forfeited. Even were a VC to be sentenced to be hanged for murder, he should be allowed to wear his VC on the scaffold.\"\r\nPlease allow us to rectify this wrong and restore the glory and honour he deserves by restoring on him the Highest honour our nation has to bestow, the Victoria Cross.\r\n",
