        "additional_details": "For too long, this country has been failing to protect the public by the courts handing out absurd sentences to offenders (there are so many cases I don't even know where to begin!) and the government burying their heads in the sand and breaking their promises to improve the system. It's time to make a stand against criminals and let them know that crimes of any kind will not be tolerated and that they will face the consequences. This needs to be demonstrated by the courts handing out very tough sentences (e.g. murder - life without any chance of parole and foreign nationals committing crimes being deported). If anyone within the justice system fails to do this, they should be made to resign from their position as they have shown incompetence in their job which is to provide justice.",
