It is in Scotland.\r\nAnyone leaving their house empty, such as going on holiday, could return to find the house occupied by strangers and it takes months and cost through the courts to evict them. To add insult to injury the property can be left in a deplorable state.\r\n\\currently the police cannot get involved as it is a civil matter.\r\nThis issue needs urgent attention.\r\nThink how you would feel being deprived of the use of your property and belongings which you have worked hard over many years to establish.\r\nEvery MP worth their salt should support this petition.
