        "additional_details": "Student unions were originally created to serve the interests of students attending university. In modern times, student unions seem more concerned with politics than the welfare of students, as recent anti-government demonstrations by the NUS have shown. This petition calls for student unions to be scrapped in favour of a new student body with serious committments to students needs and not their political views.",
