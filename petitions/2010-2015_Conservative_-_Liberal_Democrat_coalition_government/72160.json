However, the question that should be asked - Whether overseas students are qualified candidates and are able to survive through the UK education challenges ?\r\n\r\nThis e-petition draws an attention on overseas students problems and how this segment can be of a great potential to further boost the UK economy.\r\n\r\nSince, overseas students are taught in different languages and academic trends before coming to the UK. These elements sets various barriers on them to interpret and cope with the UK education system.\r\n\r\nResearches conducted by Overseas Students Development Centre (OSDC) proved that there is an increase in the number of students failing to complete their academic courses all over the UK. The reason behind this fact is that the majority of overseas students does struggle with universities and colleges assessments and examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
