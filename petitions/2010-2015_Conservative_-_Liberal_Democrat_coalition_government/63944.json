However we call on the British Government, as currently constituted, to allow a binding referendum across the whole UK (including Scotland) on any constitutional settlement arrived at in the aftermath of a positive vote for Scottish Independence. We believe that as there will be new countries created all of their citizens have the right to vote on the arrangements. If it is rejected by the electorate at this stage the constitutional arrangement will revert to the status quo (ie one United Kingdom).",
