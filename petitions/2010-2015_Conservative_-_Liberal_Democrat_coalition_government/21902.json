        "additional_details": "In a country with only 875 registered baseball players (adult and junior), why are sales of baseball bats so disproportionately high unless for criminal activity? It is rare to even be able to purchase the other equipment for a game such as the helmets, padding or even the ball in the same store. It is time these weapons are only permitted for sale through authorised dealers directly to persons registered as players in the UK.",
