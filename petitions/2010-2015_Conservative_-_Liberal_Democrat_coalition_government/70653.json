        "additional_details": "This is a petition to UK government to provide ILR for immigrant workers holding Tier 2 ICT Visas and arrived in the UK before April 2011.\r\n\r\nAnyone holding this visa category would automatically be a skilled worker earning at least \u00a340,000 per year. They not only pay NI and Tax at the higher rate but also contribute well to the UK economy by spending their hard earned money.\r\n\r\nCurrently they are allowed to work in the UK for more than 5 years but they are not eligible for permanent residence after completing 5 years in UK.\r\n\r\nThe UK government is completely justified in applying controls to stop illegal immigration and other legal immigration routes that costs the tax payer or British jobs. The Tier 2 ICT route however, is a contributing route - the country will loose out if it closed its doors on these people.\r\n",
