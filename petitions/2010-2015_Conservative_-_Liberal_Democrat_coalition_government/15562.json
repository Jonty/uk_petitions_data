        "additional_details": "UK DonorLink is a voluntary contact register set up to enable people conceived through donated sperm, and / or eggs, their donors and half-siblings to exchange information and where desired to contact each other. The register is specifically for anyone over the age of 18 who was conceived using donated sperm or eggs, or who donated, in the UK, before the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act came into force in August 1991. The register is available throughout the UK.\r\n\r\nWe are still awaiting a decision from the Minister at the Department of Health - Anne Milton - as to whether she will restore our funding by the end of October 2011. If it is a negative decision the service will close at the end of October 2011.\r\n\r\nPlease sign to show your support!",
