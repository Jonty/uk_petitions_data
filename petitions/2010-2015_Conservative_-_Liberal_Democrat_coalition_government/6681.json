        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to recognise that the English minority still live in England and would like to be able to have the option in legal forms etc to say that we are English, for instance, my passport says I am British, which doesn't really mean a lot to me, as these days anyone from any Country abroad can be British when they come to live in this Country.\r\n\r\nI feel England is losing its identity as a Country and this is very sad indeed.\r\n\r\nIt's about time us English were allowed to be just that, I was born English and I shall die English, it saddens me that I am being forced to be British, this word does not represent me at all, if anything it offends me, I feel we are losing sight of who we are and where we came from, I am English and very proud of this fact.",
