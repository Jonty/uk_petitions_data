        "additional_details": "Petition for women to have the right to serve in a front line capacity.\r\nIn the first world war black soldiers serving was a taboo.\r\nIt was only in the 1990's that gay men became eligible for service.\r\n\r\nNow in 2011 women still face the same discrimination.\r\nDespite the fact that many women are in the front line now serving as medics, and are getting shot at, and getting killed, it is still thought that a woman who is of equal physical ability to a man somehow has less to offer to this country. This petition is not one that asks for special exemptions in physical tests, it merely asks that we be given a chance. We can go through officer training to be an artillery officer at Sandhurst - which is the same training that men receive as as of yet there have been no issues of women not being able to do it.\r\nIn the workplace we have anti-discrimination laws but the armed forces seems untouched by them.\r\n\r\nIt quite simply makes no sense.",
