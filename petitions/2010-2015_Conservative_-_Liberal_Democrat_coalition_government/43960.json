Sometimes, when you a re caught speeding, you are offered a Speed Awareness Course.  Some see this as a way of avoiding points on your license and avoiding hefty insurance premium hikes.  The courses are designed to make us better drivers and highlight the significance of speeding in a vehicle.\r\n\r\nInsurance companies have begun to increase premiums for attending such a course, which is wrong.  Drivers who attend the courses are better drivers, not worse, they shouldn't be punished and the practice should be stopped.",
