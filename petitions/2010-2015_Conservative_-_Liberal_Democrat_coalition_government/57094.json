        "additional_details": "My aim is to get a ban on naming specific dog breeds that have been involved in attacks until actual proof of the animal's breed and DNA have been obtained. The unfortunate outcome of lazy journalism and misleading information causes many problems for dog owners and also dog rescue centres that get overrun with 'problem' breeds after such incidents. There would be no problem reporting the dog attack but refrain from blaming an entire breed until confirmed. Much the same as some people have already experienced is the stigma and hatred once the media have caused damage. ",
