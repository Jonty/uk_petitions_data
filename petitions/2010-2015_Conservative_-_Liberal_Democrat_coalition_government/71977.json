        "additional_details": "The current law states that people who work with children need enhanced disclosure checks done but not if they don't specifically care for children. This means that employees of soft play areas and child areas, where the parents are supervising the children do not need enhanced disclosure checks or any disclosure done at all. I believe this has to change and these parents go to these places to give their kids free rein to run around in the believe that the staff are ok to be dealing with children. At soft play areas you are not always at your child's side. The staff should be throughly checked before employment for any type of criminal record at all. I am sure i wouldn't like to find out and i am sure many parents will feel the same that someone at my local soft play area had a criminal record. Even if you directly don't care for the children, if you are working in a child's vicinity you should be checked. ",
