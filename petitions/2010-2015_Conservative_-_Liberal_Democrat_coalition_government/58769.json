We, the public, should be allowed to comment up all e-petitions and to register a negative vote i.e. that we are opposed to the petition's proposal. Votes against should be subtracted from votes for when considering the proposal.\r\nPermitting commenting would allow us to express an opposing view, or indeed a supporting view, and to give our reason for such a view - this would be in-line with increasing democracy and public consultation as is the governments expressed wont.",
