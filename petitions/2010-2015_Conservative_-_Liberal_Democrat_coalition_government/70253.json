        "additional_details": "The vehicle excise duty (road tax) disc has now been dispensed with, along with transferring tax when a vehicle is sold, Due to the new refund system this means the seller loses any remaining tax for that month, and the buyer has to pay for tax even though they did not own the vehicle, as refunds are only given for full remaining months, and the tax is backdated to the start of the month upon purchase.\r\nThis means every time a used vehicle is sold on privately the DVLA make one full months tax from the buyer and seller combined, yet again punishing the already over stretched motorist.\r\nThis new system does not make it any easier for motorists, but creates more expense at the time of purchase, and could also create problems upon purchase if the Motor Insurance database does not update to show the new keepers is insured when trying to tax the vehicle.\r\nThis is the DVLA profiteering from the motorist again by double taxing the month of sale",
