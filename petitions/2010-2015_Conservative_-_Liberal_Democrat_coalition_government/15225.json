We did not have a referendum on the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty, now renamed Constitution Treaty. Lisbon Treaty gave effect to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, in which Article 2, \u201cRight to life\u201d provides that \u201ceveryone has the right to life\u201d. It is time UK has a referendum to opt out of the abolishment of the death penalty and hence of the EU Charter of Human Rights prior to the Parliament seriously considers legislating to reintroduce death penalty.",
