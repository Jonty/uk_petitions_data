From the Muslim communities around the U.k some men have gone to help with aid and others have gone to freedom fight against Assad regime.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately them men are being said to have been radicalized by jihadists and have become a threat to Britian. Their families are being integrated as though they are terrorists just because they are Muslim and their sons or fathers have gone to the aid of Syrian civilians.\r\nIf people from the army have seen the terrors which they saw in Afghanistan today live a normal life and were not being radicalized by the killings and blood shed they witnessed, why dose the government think that the people who have gone to Syria won't be able to lead normal lives.\r\n\r\nI want the government to act now and help Syria and all British citizens to help them brave people in Syria who are want to come back to Britain without fear of being arrested.",
