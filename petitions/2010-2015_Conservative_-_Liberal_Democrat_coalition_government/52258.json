        "additional_details": "The top rate of tax has been reduced by the Conservatives to 45p, down from 50p. As quoted by Labour, it's a \u201ctax cut for millionaires\u201d. Britain is supposed to \"all be in it together\", but this doesn't seem to be the case if you're earning a lot of money. Please sign this petition, as a 50p income tax rate could make the state around \u00a33 billion (As quoted from the New Statesman), preventing unpopular welfare cuts such as the \"Bedroom Tax\", legal aid cuts and cap on benefits, harming the poorest in our society",
