I call upon the govenment to ban the halal slaughter of animals in the UK. Kosher meat is killed without suffering to the animal so to is \"normal\" meat I eat. I do not want to be told what I can eat namely going to a place to eat to be told its all Halal.\r\n\r\nThis is a horrid way to kill an animal without total respect for an animal that will provide food. I am asking that Halal meat slaughtered in the UK be banned.  ",
