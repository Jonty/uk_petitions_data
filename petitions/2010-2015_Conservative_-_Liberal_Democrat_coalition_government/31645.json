The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham are both reviewing plans for the site which all involve the destruction of the historic 1937 conference centre, meeting place and live music venue.\r\n\r\nBy giving the historic Earl's Court Exhibition Centre(Earl's Court One) listed status, the iconic building would be preserved so that it could continue to function(as it does today) as a successful centre for the arts, trade shows and general entertainment\r\n\r\nThe newer Royal Festival Hall is listed as is the even newer Barbican Centre. Along with these venues and  Royal Albert Hall, Earl's Court has been one of the most important venues in large scale music performance and ought to remain so for future generations.\r\n",
