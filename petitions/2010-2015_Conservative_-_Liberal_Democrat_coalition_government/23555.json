        "additional_details": "The A1 is frequently at a stand still once it is cut down to two lands and snails through Gateshead and Tyne & Wear from the Angel of the North to the Gosforth turn off.\r\n\r\nTeam Valley, Regents Business Centre, Gateshead and Newcastle city centres plus the Metro Centre and Newcastle Airport are all areas that are being affected by this section of out of date and over capacity stretch of A1.  Surely in this time of economic strife widening such a core artery in an area with 11% unemployment needs and deserves a long awaited infactructure upgrade to give local employment, access to brown field undeveloped land, supporting local business and making the region more attractive to all types of businesses.\r\n\r\nArguably widening this part of the A1 should take priority over other upgrades that serve more rural areas as Newcastle and Gateshead are the economic powerhouses of the North East and so should be supported.",
