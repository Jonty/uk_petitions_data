These enjoyments are curtailed through passive smoking.\r\n\r\nWe do NOT request a complete ban on all smoking in public spaces since that would be unfair to smokers and their children under present circumstances.\r\n\r\nHowever, passive smoking is particularly unfair to young children whose health is most vulnerable and who are most strongly influenced by example.\r\n\r\nSadly, some adults still smoke in children's playgrounds.\r\n\r\nWe therefore respectfully request a suitably sign-posted, enforcible smoking ban within all children's playgrounds.",
