This could have a direct impact on the availablity of sufficently qualified people in jobs.\r\n\r\nThe Government should create a National Scholarship scheme for those people with the right educational attainment from low income backgrounds, where they pay a proportion of their fees and/or cost of living on condition they are applying for a course which will suit the interests of filling projected needs within both the private and public sector job markets.\r\n\r\nBy having a set of focus areas each year, the Government could encourage people into fields of work that will act in the benefit of the country, while giving those who are most severely affected by low incomes and it's frequently associated social/educational problems, a chance of a good job and personal enhancement.",
