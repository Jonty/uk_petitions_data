        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that the government must repeal the 'Same Sex Marriage' bill.\r\n\r\nThis is because the SSM bill has a fatal flaw. The bill is increasing the rights of one minority, whilst at the same time restricting the right of the religious community.\r\n\r\nUnder legislation from the European Court of Human Rights, whilst this bill is in force, churches can be taken to court if they refuse to carry out gay marriage, due to it being in contradiction to their beliefs.\r\n\r\nLet us not forget that before the SSM bill, gays were still allowed civil partnerships, which is in essence marriage, but under the eyes of the state rather than under the eyes of god.\r\n\r\nTo sum up we believe that it is wrong of the government to infringe the rights of a very large group of people in order to make virtually no difference to the rights of a small minority.",
