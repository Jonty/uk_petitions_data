Questions are more often than not, misleading, poorly worded or open to misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th June 2012, students sat the F215 exam astonished to find one of the questions was copied from a past paper.\r\n\r\nMany students are left feeling robbed of their time, effort and more importantly, place at university.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Department of Education to review this case and biology papers set by OCR, along with the numerous cases involving OCR Biology exams in past news articles.",
