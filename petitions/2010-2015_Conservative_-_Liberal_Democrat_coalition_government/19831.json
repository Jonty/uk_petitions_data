        "additional_details": "You can't walk down a high street without seeing a movie poster showing the hero with a gun and you can't watch TV without seeing a games advert featuring the gamer using a gun, and yet, try making an advert with alcohol or cigarettes and you'll have a pretty tough ride from the Advertising Standards Authority. Producers put guns in films because they think guns are 'cool', Nintendo and Sony make games with guns because they think guns are 'cool', so guess what? youths see the adverts and think... 'guns are cool'. Let's ban all guns from adverts in the UK now. If it only prevents one person from picking up a gun and killing someone wouldn't that be... cool?",
