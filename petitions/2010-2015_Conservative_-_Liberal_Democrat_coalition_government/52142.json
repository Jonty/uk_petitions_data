        "additional_details": "Everywhere you go these days you see horses chained in fields, often walking in circles, with no fresh grass or water to keep them healthy. Currently the law states it is perfectly legal to do this providing a particular type of chain is used and in a certain way, and that the horse is being tended to. However, there are no procedures in place to ensure these regulations are bring adhered to.\r\nThis is made even worse in our winter months when the rain churns the grass into mud and the snow covers the grass, and I have yet to see a horse with any kind of cover on.\r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition to change the law so that anyone who buys a horse has to undergo rigorous checks to ensure they have adequate shelter for the animal. You would not buy a dog and keep it in the garden in the winter, so why should buying a horse be any different?\r\n\r\nThank you",
