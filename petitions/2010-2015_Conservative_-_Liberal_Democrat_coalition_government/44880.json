        "additional_details": "The current MAXIMUM sentance for this charge is 2 years imprisonment. If the offender pleads guilty he will get this reduced to 18 months. This is a totally unacceptable sentance for taking someones life. Even when the perpetrator has a lengthly string of convictions relating to motoring violations and is decribed by the judge as an ABOSUTE MENACE on the road, this is the  MAXIMUM that can be imposed whatever the circumstances. We what this maximum term increased to a more realistic level of 14 years,in line with the death by dangerous/careless driving guidelines, so the judge can pass a greater sentance if he feels that is warranted due to the offenders past history. NO TERM IS LONG ENOUGH TO REFLECT THE FACT SOMEONE HAS DIED,but at least it will feel like some form of justice has been done. 18 months is not justice.",
