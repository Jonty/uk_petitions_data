        "additional_details": "Following the divorce of a couple with children only the custodial parent is eligible to claim Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits even where the children spend an equal amount of time with both parents. In situations where both parents share the responsibility for caring for their children following a divorce Child Benefit and Tax Credits should be shared on a pro-rata basis. I would like the government to reform the tax and benefit system to allow a more equitable allocation of Child Benefit and Child Tax Credits between both parents.",
