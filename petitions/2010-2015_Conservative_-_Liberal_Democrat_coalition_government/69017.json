Holidaymakers are continuously being 'robbed' in that when you see a holiday offered at a certain price you inevitably find that that particular holiday has gone, or the flights have gone up, or the price does not include baggage and transfers, or the accommodation price quoted was for 4 persons - as opposed to two persons (although this does not get stated at the time). It should be compulsory that the price you see is the price you pay. Also it is wrong to be charged 2% for debit card payments - you do not pay this on the high street when buying goods.   ",
