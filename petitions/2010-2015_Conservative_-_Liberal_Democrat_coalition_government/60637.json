        "additional_details": "Parliament to debate BBC use of the news to trail programmes such as Panorama & Horizon. The practice by the BBc of using the news to advertise upcoming programs such as Panorama & Horizan demonstrates a cynical disregard for  any ethical approach to what is news and what is just media created news. The BBCs disregard for complaints in this area also shows a flagrant disregard for public opinion. Such disregard for an ethical aproach to the news is a first step towards the use of the news for self serving propaganda",
