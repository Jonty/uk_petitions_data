        "additional_details": "The House of Lords currently guarantees seats to Lords Spiritual, representatives from the Church of England, our country has developed much in the past decades into a multi-cultural and multi-religious society.  Why should Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus or anyone else not have similar representation to Christians?\r\n\r\nI propose that these seats are replaced by a similar number of seats assigned in proportion to the religious split of our country, perhaps with the information gathered from censuses.  This would make the House of Lords more representative and fairer in general.",
