        "additional_details": "Scotrail operate a queuing system at SECC train station allowing the first 300 people ONLY onto the platform to keep within Health & Safety regulations.\r\n\r\nIf you are travelling on the Lanark to Dalmuir service and wish to get the last train midweek home to Carluke on the 22:43pm departing SECC, Scotrail  suggestion is to leave whatever event you're attending and gamble on being one of the 300 people allowed on the train.\r\n\r\nWhy should we pay expensive tickets for shows on at the SECC / Hydro ONLY to leave early and always miss the end of the concert or show. this needs to stop. Sign up now to  put pressure on Scotrail  to scrap the ludicrous queuing system and offer pre book ticket buyers an opportunity to travel home safely and not to be stranded on a platform at 11:00pm at night. It might be your son or daughter next time.\r\n\r\nMore importantly do you want to be able to watch and enjoy the FULL event you've paid top prices for!!! sick of leaving early.",
