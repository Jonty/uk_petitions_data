Mainly the ligaments bones and ankles in the foot.  A normal foot has 30 bones and 28 ligaments in the foot.  Surgery takes place on the affected foot or feet from birth, to correct the deformity in the feet.  Often the deformity corrects however it still leaves the person finding walking etc difficult.  Often the person will walk on the side and or heal on foot.  The club foot often deteriorates with age and because of the surgery that has originally taken place this causes other complications such as arthritis or osteoarthritis in the affected feet or foot, and can cause hip and lower back problems due to the way that this condition causes people to walk.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a rare condition it is still not recognised by the dwp and would like to see this changed.",
