        "additional_details": "All over the UK (and especially in London), Councils are using the motorist as a cash cow. This has to stop\r\n\r\nCameras are constantly being erected to fine motorists for stopping in the wrong place and many councils are making Pay and Display happen until 8/10pm in the evening and soon in Westminster on Sundays. Where will this stop and what will be next ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAction :\r\n\r\n-ban the use of CCTV cameras apart from bus lane enforcement / where it is impossible to patrol\r\n\r\n-make the parking rules the same all over the country (an example : Sunday & bank hols free on all single red/yellow lines) without exception.\r\n\r\n-fix a maximum of \u00a3100/car for a parking permit for a UK household to park outside your house (where applicable). Also, a max of \u00a32/hr for parking charges in towns. ",
