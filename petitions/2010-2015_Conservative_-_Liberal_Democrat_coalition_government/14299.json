I have crashed whilst wearing a crash helmet an I believe this save a serious head injury.\r\nI would like the government to make it Law for people 16 years and under to have to wear a helmet when cycling at all times.\r\nThis is law in many other country's and I think people would be safer on the roads if this was installed into young people from an early age.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks Corben Faulkner.\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
