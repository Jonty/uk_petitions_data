        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are of the opinion that since his appointment, Mr Gove has shown a total disregard for Education Research, modern pedagogical theories, current accepted good practise and the voice of Teachers and Headteachers throughout the UK. He has made numerous suggestions which are both backward-thinking and insult the professionals and the academics who have spent years delivering and studying the UK Education system. He has therefore shown his ignorance and incompetency as Minister for this department, and we the undersigned would like to declare a 'no-confidence' vote in him.",
