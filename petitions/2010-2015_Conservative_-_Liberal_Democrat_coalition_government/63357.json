        "additional_details": "There have been 30% cuts so far to funding for services supporting women experiencing domestic abuse. There will be more cuts as local authorities who fund these services are forced to make more savings as a result of more reductions in money from this Government. Currently 2 women a week die at the hands of a partner or former partner. There are fewer refuges for women to flee to and fewer support services for women living with domestic abuse. This Government does not care about the right of women to live their lives free from fear, but we should.",
