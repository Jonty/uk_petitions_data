        "additional_details": "The current petition of withdrawing convicted rioters benefits is a \u2018knee-jerk\u2019 reaction by some members of the UK public, who are understandably angry over the recent riots.  However, by taking away all means of income from these people to \u201cteach them a lesson etc\u201d would be a very bad thing for ALL us UK citizens.  Think about this, so someone who has already got the mentality of robbing a store without guilt, would then have no means to FEED THEMSELVES, would simply go and 1) rob/shoplift, 2) mug people and 3) burglarise your house.\r\n\r\nResult: massive crime increase against the person in the UK.\r\n\r\nIrony: get imprisoned and get fed. get non-custodial and starve and have to rob.\r\n\r\nThere are way more ways to appropriately punish people for their wrong-doings. Please oppose the withdrawal of benefits.",
