At present this procedure has to be approved by an exceptional funding panel. The decision is left entirely to the panel. There appears to be no consistency and fairness as patients from some PCT's have funding approved and patients from others are rejected. This is a life changing and debilitating condition that not only effect the suffers life but that of their whole family.",
