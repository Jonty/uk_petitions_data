There have been too many times when private papers, CD`s,documents etc, etc, have been lost or misplaced and could have fallen into the wrong hands. This would also help stop/control clandestine meetings/affairs and reduce the need for claiming non-existent (dodgy) expenses! They already have 1st class restaurant and washroom facilities so, it wouldn`t cause too much upheaval to provide sleeping accommodation, the armed services, nurses, firemen / women, carers, support workers and many other people have to do this and, it`s about time our MP`s lived in the real world",
