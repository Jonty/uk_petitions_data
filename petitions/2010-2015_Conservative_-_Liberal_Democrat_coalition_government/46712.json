He launched this initiative, to encourage unemployed and disabled people to work for free exclaiming \"we're in this together!\"\r\n\r\nSign this petition, if you think multi-millionaire David Cameron and his cabinet should practice what they preach and lead by example, by taking no payment for doing their job. Lets put a stop to it being one rule for them, and another for us.\r\n\r\nWe need 100,000 signatures to get this debated in the House of Commons. The media will DEFINITELY highlight what was said. It would make very interesting viewing.",
