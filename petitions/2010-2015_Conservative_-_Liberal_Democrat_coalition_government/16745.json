        "additional_details": "Recently there have been several cases of naturalised criminals being sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, for rape, murder (including so-called honour killings) and sexual offences among under age girls.  Such people should have their naturalisation revoked (as happened during WW 2 e.g. Anna Wolkoff) and be automatically deported at the end of their sentence with no right to appeal about their Human Rights.  Any dependants should be automatically deported as soon as the criminal is sentenced.",
