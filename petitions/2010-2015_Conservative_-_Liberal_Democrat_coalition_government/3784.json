We note that the chances of a miscarriage of justice would be statistically reduced to a zero or a negligible level as the evidence for 2 or more murders would have to be of a very indisputable level.  We also note that for a person to have the ability to have the murderous intent to kill two or more people would always have this mindset and ability, and would be a danger to society and the public for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the Government review any applicable treaties and international commitments which may obstruct Parliament to restore any form of capital punishment for the said offence.\r\n\r\nThe findings of the review and the necessary substantive legislation to be presented to House of Commons for debate no later than 12 months after this petition passes the acceptance threshold.
