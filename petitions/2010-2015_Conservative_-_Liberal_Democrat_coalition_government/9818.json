Some have been injured.\r\nAll this at a time when the government are looking to reduce the number of officers and are interfering with our pay and conditions so that we are significantly worse off. How does this seem right?\r\n\r\nUnlike other public services i.e Fire Service, NHS and Prison Service we don't even have the right to strike (officially).\r\nThe behaviour of the Home Secretary shows that she lacks respect for the Police Service, We therefore call for her resignation.",
