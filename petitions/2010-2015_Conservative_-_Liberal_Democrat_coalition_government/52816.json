        "additional_details": "We as parents will be fined \u00a360 everytime we take our child/children out of school for a family holiday during term time.\r\nIt is my strong opinion that until the Government force all tour operators to reduce their holiday prices out of term time we should not be penalised! I work hard for my family holidays and should not be expected to take it when I am told to by the schools or Government. If a child has a good attentance record and the planned holiday is not affecting exams I see no reason why it cannot be taken.\r\nI feel very strongly about this and if you are of the same opinion, please sign and share this e-petition.\r\n",
