Economics students are being misguided by the system and are not learning how to criticise the status quo. I'd like to suggest a discussion on the merits of teaching young people about the monetary system, money production, money creation, and government expenditure, with an aim of having a generation that will know better the dangers of spending money that they do not have.",
