        "additional_details": "Parents and carers should be banned from smoking at the school gates while waiting to collect or drop off children.\r\n  My children are faced with a cloud of smoke to walk through every morning as they arrive at school with smoke practically being blown in their faces.\r\n\r\nIt sets a bad example for young children to see groups of parents standing around smoking, surely this is the one place we expect to be a smoke free environment?\r\n\r\nWhat people choose to show their own children at home is still their choice, but i choose not to smoke in the hope that my children will also choose not to.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you want your childrens school gate to be a truly smoke free zone!",
