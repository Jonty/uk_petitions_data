        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament at the earliest opportunity to legislate to abolish the MP expenses system as it stands to eliminate entirely any cash payments.  Instead, we suggest MPs should be provided with a national bus and train pass for travel or in exceptional circumstances the use of a taxi company on account with Parliament or a Parliament-owned car pool.  Accommodation in the form of small flats could be provided close to the Houses of Parliament and PAs, secretaries and researchers could be provided from a pool of Civil Servants.  Local authorities should be given a legal duty to provide office accommodation for free for MPs to do constituency work.  This would eliminate cash payments entirely, any possibility of fraud, hospitality or using friends and family as paid assistants, and help to bring back public confidence.",
