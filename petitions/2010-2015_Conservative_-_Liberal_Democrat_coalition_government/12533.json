        "additional_details": "EMA really gave disadvantaged teenagers the opportunity to do something about education and helped them to get transport to college etc. The government really need to consider what the impact of taking away the EMA was. A lot of students have lost the opportunity to progress in education. This is the future generation in our country, and if the government is taking away the only opportunity some people have to gain skills for life by using the EMA for transport etc. then they really need to think about what the future generation is going to be like. If they do not want to bring back EMA then they desperately need to consider another option! ",
