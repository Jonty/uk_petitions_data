        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that overseas development aid is important both in helping those throughout the world who are less fortunate than ourselves, starving children, people rendered homeless by natural disasters and the like, and is also an important tool in international relations.\r\n\r\nWe also find it intriguing that the five petitions immediately preceding this one, all with the aim of withdrawing overseas aid, were all created at more or less the same time apparently by different people. We believe that attempts by minority interest groups to distort our democratic process and whip up fake movements should be met and where possible obstructed by other minority interest groups whipping up their own fake movements, in order to show the whole system for the charade it is.\r\n\r\nCheers.",
