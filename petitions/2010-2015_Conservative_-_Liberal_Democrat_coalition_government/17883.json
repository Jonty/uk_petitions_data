Dog owners cannot be trusted to clean up their dogs mess. \u00a31000 fines don't work because nobody caches them. Dogs mess ruins shoes, clothes, balls, fun and possibly health. Children should be protected by law and entitled to play and exercise in these parks without getting soiled with dogs' mess.",
