If you go ahead with a referendum on whether the UK should stay as a member of the EU, something that the majority of British citizens do not understand, I ask that you please hold a referendum on whether senior banking figures that have been implicit in these failings should face prosecution for their failure towards the tax-paying majority of the United Kingdom, who are now paying for their premeditated and extortionate mistakes. This is something that I understand and believe should happen. Together we can make this a better world.",
