        "additional_details": "Changing the school registers from alphabetical to a randomly generated list of pupils. This is due to a possible 'listing' of classmates. Although it's understood as an alphabetical system that has no superior on the list, young children may still subliminally feel inadequate to their peers the further down the list they are and there are many figures that back this up. I feel overall this would be a rewarding experience for children as sometimes they'll be first and sometimes they will be last, however, they will understand they are equal. I also feel in the long run they will maybe promote more motivated children and less who steer off due to disinterest, etc.",
