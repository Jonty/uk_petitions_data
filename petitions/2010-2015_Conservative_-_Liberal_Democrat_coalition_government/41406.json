Is it really acceptable to allow so many cyclists to die on Britain's roads? Action required:1) Safe cycle lanes across the UK. 2) Severe penalties to drivers who use cycle lanes.3) Fine drivers who use bus / bike lanes 3) Consider if vehicle parking; sometimes drivers can't see when parking blocks driver visibility at junctions. 4) Severe penalties to drivers, who hit cyclists, through carelessness. 5) Reduce excessive pavement sizes where possible to create space for cycle lanes. 6) Have designated cycle routes like Quebec's Route Verte.7) Police enforce the law, where cyclists don't use cycle lights or where visibility clothing at night. 8) A Government investigation to plan how to create safe cycling in the UK not think about it.",
