        "additional_details": "Around 3 years ago North Lanarkshire council took the use of school swimming pools away from outside clubs whether they were a business or voluntary. These pools now sit empty after school time and as a result are now becoming run down. If the council allowed these pools to be used for clubs and public use they could be bringing in a substantial profit which can be put into each school sports facilities to update them. There are many other towns in Scotland that do this and as a result have brand new facilities with the money made. I call on the government to change North Lanarkshire's decision and allow the pools to be used so we can reduce the obesity level in Scotland and produce our athletes of the future!",
