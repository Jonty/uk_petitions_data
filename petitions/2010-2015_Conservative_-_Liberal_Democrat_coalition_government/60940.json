        "additional_details": "I was expecting my state pension at the age of 60. The previous government increased that age to 64.It is wrong that the coalition Government has added a further 18months to the age in which women born in 1954 shall be eligible for a state pension. We have worked from the age of 15 when there was no such thing as equal pay for women. I have paid  NI contributions since 1969 and would have received my state pension this year at the age of 60. I am now forced to wait until I am 65 years and 7 months. I shall be losing around \u00a335,000. Why? 33,000 women are unfairly discriminated by this government. As I have paid all NI contributions due, I regard this as a dishonourable and unlawful act by the coalition government. Please pay the pension due to me and the other 32,999 women born between 1953/1954 affected.",
