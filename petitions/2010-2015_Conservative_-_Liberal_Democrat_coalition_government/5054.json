        "additional_details": "There should be a debate in parliament about the immediate withdrawal of UK forces from Afghanistan.  Taxpayers money would be better spent by fighting terrorism at home, and increasing border controls, which are currently pathetic. Terrorists could come from anywhere, not just Afghanistan, and the number of servicemen injured or killed in Afghanistan is unacceptable. To think any outside force could militarily control Afghanistan is to ignore history.",
