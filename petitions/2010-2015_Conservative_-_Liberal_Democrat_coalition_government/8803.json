        "additional_details": "Money is the root of all evil. Money is the reason why we have poverty. The monetary system has failed us. It is now time to try something new instead of 'buying into' this debt-based economy which is slowly turning us into slaves of the corporations and bankers. Money brings out the bad in humans as a whole. Introduce a system which is purely based on resources and we would solve most of the problems of this modern world. Technology has given us the means to automate most tasks and if humans worked on advancement rather than thinking about the 'budget' we have to work around we would be 'richer' as a whole. Sign this petition and perhaps Britain could be the first country to introduce a true resource-based economy where everyone helps each other, and no one person is above any other.",
