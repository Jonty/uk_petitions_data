Alcohol, tobacco and fast food industries. For every taxable \u00a31, an additional 1p is deducted by the treasury and given to cancer research.\r\n\r\nWe also propose that any U.K tax payer that wishes to do so can also have 1p in every taxable \u00a31 deducted and contributed to cancer research.\r\n\r\nSuch a small gesture could make a massive positive impact on all our lives.\r\n\r\n ",
