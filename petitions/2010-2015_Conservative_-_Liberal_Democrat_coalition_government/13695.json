        "additional_details": "I Petition the Government to maintain a committee that is unelected and not accountable to parliament to keep watch over the honours system, and reject any proposals for awards that have not been earned.\r\n\r\nWhilst we stop any of these new awards we must continue to use the current system to reward as many celebrities and politicians as possible who really are the backbone of our democracy. Our Honours system will then remain the envy of the world.\r\n\r\nThere is a trend towards a proliferation of official trinkets for absurd reasons, such as merely signing up to defend the Country, or being forced to observe Atom Bomb tests, or for assisting in the Berlin Airlift, or for those in Bomber Command, even an N.D.M, the list goes on and on.  The UK is under no obligation to follow other commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand or Canada. We must maintain the British ideals of giving the least possible, that way saving literally pennies of public expense.",
