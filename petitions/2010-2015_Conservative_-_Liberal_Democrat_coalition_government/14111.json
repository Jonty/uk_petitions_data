        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask the government to debate the issues surrounding the annoyance of unsolicited SMS's being sent by organisations looking for business. These SMS's are in breach of the electronic communications and privacy regulation if you have not given the sender of such SMS's permission to send them.\r\n\r\nIt is also asking the government to legislate if necessary making it a requirement to give full name(s) and address(es) of all people buying a SIM card on a PAYG basis BEFORE the activation of the SIM card. Not only would this cut down on the number of unsolicited SMS's but would provide for strong penalties against those that continue to breach the law.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to support this petition please sign it.",
