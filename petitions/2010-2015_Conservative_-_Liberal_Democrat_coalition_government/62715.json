People who are overweight have a higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. Excess weight can also make it more difficult for people to find and keep work, and it can affect self-esteem and mental health.\r\n\r\nHealth problems associated with being overweight or obese cost the NHS more than \u00a35 billion every year.\r\n\r\nI want medical schools, or the NHS to encourage doctors to spend time studying nutrition, as well as alternative stress reduction management, moving us away from a society of a pill for every ill, and towards lives of fitness, health, vitality and happiness.\r\n\r\nI urge the NHS to incorporate extensive nutritional advice and alternative stress reduction methods in to all GP training.\r\n\r\nI truly believe that we can half that \u00a35 billion that the NHS incurs from obesity related illness though empowering people.",
