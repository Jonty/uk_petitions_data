        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\nThe fact that Margaret Thatcher is celebrated by many is not sufficient to support her receipt of a State Funeral.\r\n\r\nPlease note.\r\n\r\n1/ The rampant deregulation of the City and finances has inevitably led to our current situation.\r\n\r\n2/ She is a divisive figure most of the country do not accept she is entitled to this honor.\r\n\r\n3/ Churchill what ever you feel about him was seen as a national figure above political divisiveness.\r\n\r\n4/ A state funeral for this person would create a feeling of total political dis engagement for a substantial percentage of the population and send all the wrong signals about politics and power to those least well of in our society.\r\n\r\n5/  we are in a double dip recession a lot of people are struggling  and most see the destruction of the manufacturing industry as a reason and don't feel the person most responsible for this should be honored this way we hope this is debated in the house",
