        "additional_details": "This petition is to request the Government to offer financial support/incentives ie tax relief to stores/shops who stock Made in UK products. Made in UK products cost more to manufacture than foreign imports therefore it is difficult to be financially competitive with our products to enable them to be stocked on the shelves.  We need to invest in our Country and in British Manufacturing but equally we need outlets in which we can sell our products. I also feel that financial support should be offered to UK customers which trade with other UK companies across the general manufacturing base.  Customers want to buy British in the high street we need to ensure that can happen.",
