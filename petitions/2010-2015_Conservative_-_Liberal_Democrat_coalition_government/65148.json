        "additional_details": "The NHS spends vast amounts of money treating head injuries caused by not wearing helmet, this is so preventable, the solution is to wear a helmet as this would significantly reduce the severity of the injury and may even save lives. Basically I want the wearing of helmets to become law.\r\n\r\nWhy isn't it law, surely it is just common sense? Yes it may be itchy or ruin your hair but let's be honest it's better to put up with that than end up with severe brain damage, or worse.",
