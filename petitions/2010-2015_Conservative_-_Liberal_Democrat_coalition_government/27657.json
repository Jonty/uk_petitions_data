        "additional_details": "as of 4/12/2011 a new eu directive came into force effecting 3500kg commercial vehicles used for towing for hire and reward the addition of the trailer is now incorporated in the weight calculation [gross mass] even though you vehicle has a train weight/ you cannot exceed 3500kg without obtaining an operators licence, but also you will need a cpc certificate,these were designed for operators of much larger vehicles and largely unservicable by everyone accept your local hgv garage , a simpler idea would have been to have the vehicle and trailer moted every 6mths ,keep service records and use a tacho ,this directive only applies to vehicles that are used for hire and reward and not for vehicles used for carriage of own goods all this law is doing is penelising people who want to earn a legitimate living so i propose this law needs to be repealed asap and for good british common sense to prevail please sign this petition as ultimately this will effect uk jobs ",
