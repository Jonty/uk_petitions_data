        "additional_details": "The use of mobile speed cameras is increasing generating masses of revenue for local authorities. Current tactics used to target drivers on the roads when going about their daily business is wrong, has a negative impact on lives and contributes only a small percentage to road safety.\r\n\r\nThese days it\u2019s easy to speed in modern cars & the police know it so when traveling to work one day in a safe manor they\u2019ll be waiting for you tucked in on some layby.\r\n\r\nLaw abiding citizens caught by these mobile speed traps feel they\u2019ve been deliberately targeted & criminalised by the organisation set out to protect is in for gain. Millions of drivers fined for speeding over the years have seen nothing in return and whilst this continues what improvements have we seen from all these fines?\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time the police encouraged safer driving campaigns, listen to the public and solve the route cause instead of punishing the majority.\r\n\r\nAre we all wrong?",
