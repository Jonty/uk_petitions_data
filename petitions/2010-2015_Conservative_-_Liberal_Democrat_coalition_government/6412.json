        "additional_details": "We request the DfE to alter current regulations and targets to allow a maximum of 10 days school leave per year with conditions (e.g. not in exam years or at critical parts of the year, work to be caught up with etc., not if an absence threshold has already been exceeded).\r\n\r\nRecent changes have clamped down on term time holidays making family holidays difficult, horrendously busy, expensive and sometimes impossible where parents cannot always get leave during school holidays. Family holidays are a key part of quality family time creating precious memories. How many of us have struggled to organise them whilst watching our children have many days of school trips or fun activities at school? This would change the lives of many families and, if the conditions were carefully set, not adversely affect their education.\r\nParents, teachers, please support this for the nation's children. ",
