        "additional_details": "My proposal is to stop paying child benefit on all children born after 1 January 2013. Based on current birth rates of 791,000 births per year this would save a minimum of \u00a3551 million per year (based on 2nd child rate of \u00a313.40 per week per child currently). And at current rates would save the tax payer \u00a38.8 billion a year by year 16 and every year thereafter, when all current recipients will finish in the system. This will be a cumulative saving of \u00a375 billion over that period.\r\n\r\nThe stopping of the payment of this benefit will not be penalizing anyone, as you only currently receive this payment if you have a child, so it is not in effect taking anything away from anyone as all children who will be effected by the decision are not currently born and therefore their parents are not receiving any benefits for them.",
