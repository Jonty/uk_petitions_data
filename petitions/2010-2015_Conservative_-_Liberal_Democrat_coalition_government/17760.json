For example; a boy in America aged 14, named Jamey Rodemeyer has recently committed suicide after homophobic taunting would not stop. Teenagers in the UK have also reacted in similar ways to sexual orientated bullying. We need to stop this hate crime; to prevent suicide, self-harm, neglect, mental illness and distractions which effect young peoples lives.",
