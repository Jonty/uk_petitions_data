        "additional_details": "For the last 16 years or so the european union has not signed off their accounts blaming everyone but themselves for this reason. As a so called eu citizen i have not been able to get an answer from them as to why. This should be debated in parliament and then put to the eu. The uk is putting at least \u00a348 million a day into this organisation and not knowing what is happening to this contribution because of this failure to sign off the accounts. I propose that the uk stop this payment until these accounts are sorted.",
