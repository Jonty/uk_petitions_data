By agreeing to Opt Out on the statute the petition will redress the anomaly and will give people the right to choose.\r\n\r\nFor those few who like Opt In they can but I believe they would be in a minority\r\n\r\nImagine if you can when Opt Out is adopted then letters addressed to \u201cThe Householder\u201d, nuisance phone calls, all forms from public bodies etc would be outlawed unless the person agrees!\r\n\r\nIf you agree then sign the petition after all it should be the people\u2019s choice not the Government\u2019s\r\n",
