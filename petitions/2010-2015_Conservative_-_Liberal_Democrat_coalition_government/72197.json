        "additional_details": "The Dartford Thurrock River Crossing, The original toll for the tunnel was 12.5p but has risen to \u00a32.50 (2014). In 1999 the government promised the crossing would be F.O.C by 2003 after the build costs were paid for! This was not kept. The reason to retain the toll booths was the requirement to regulate traffic. In 2009 Connect Plus (M25) was given a 30 year contract to control the crossing, The total income for the crossing in 2012 alone was over \u00a372 million. Surely this is an excessive costs to maintain a bridge and tunnel, This should be paid for by the department of transport anyway?  The Toll booths are now to be replaced in favor of a Number Plate Recognition system which shows the regulation of traffic, was an excuse was not really required so the government should therefor keep to it's 1999 promise. Please sign this petition if you agree with the principle the charge should be scraped.",
