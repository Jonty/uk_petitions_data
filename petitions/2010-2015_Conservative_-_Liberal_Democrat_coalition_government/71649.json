My council Rutland council have sent civil enforcement agents in at an extra cost to her of \u00a3230 to her.Now how is she meant to pay the extra when she can't pay the original debt. Loan sharks spring to mind or maybe just barricade the doors. Just think its bad this government allow such cruelty by local authorities to take place on the most venerable. As for my daughter she has four children and does her best shame the same cant be said about our local councils.",
