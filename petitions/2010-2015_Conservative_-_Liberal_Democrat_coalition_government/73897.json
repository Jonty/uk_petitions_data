        "additional_details": "KCC, and the Diocese of Rochester are proposing to close it on 31/8/14 , the community of Stansted and parents , governors , teachers and local villagers wish to keep the school as the heart of the community.\r\n\r\nMentioned on the News;I'm outraged! A 150 year old school is to be shut down due to numbers , which is true, but, where were the warnings? It's like breaking the Mona Lisa after many generations have been influenced within this building as it is truly the heart of the village and part of Stansted's history? Out of the blue so the community do not even get a chance to help.\r\n\r\nBut no , they will probably replace this building with a house , knocked down and ruined. All the money put in to this school is lost , but accept it ; the school's shut.\r\n\r\nCONTACT:\r\nstanstedprimaryschool@gmail.com\r\nText 07756534448\r\n\r\nWe aim to create four petitions , and have three protests concerning the issue to show our loyalty to the school. I'm not going down without a fight, are you?",
