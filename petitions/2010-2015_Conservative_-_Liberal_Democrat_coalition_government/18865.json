It was possible to take vicious highly alert animals and turn them into loving domestic pets.\r\nWe should develop a programme for our veterans rather than drugging them or letting them have run ins with the law. We may lose them as reserve troops who can be called on again, but ultimately this is less costly to society in terms of improved recruitment, less sickness and less crime.\r\nAllow them to come home or you are treating them worse than animals. Thanks.",
