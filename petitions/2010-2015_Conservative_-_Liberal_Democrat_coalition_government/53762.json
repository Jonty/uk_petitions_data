        "additional_details": "Cancer patients receiving treatment privately are currently not entitled to a wig on the NHS.\r\nMany people with private health care receive this as a benefit from their employer and are taxed as a benefit in kind on the cover and also have to pay a percentage of the treatment costs each year. These people are not necessarily in high paid jobs and the cover is one of their few employee perks. By having treatment privately, this saves the NHS thousands of pounds per cancer patient so why should theses people be discriminated against and have to pay for a wig themselves? Please sign this petition to give all cancer patients equal rights to a wig on the NHS. ",
