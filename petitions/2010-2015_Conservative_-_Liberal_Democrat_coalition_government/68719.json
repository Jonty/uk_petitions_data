        "additional_details": "We would like to see domestic violence taken seriously by the legal system from the police On the ground right up to the judges On the bench. Currently two women per week die as a result of DV, thousands of men and women are injured everyday, it's time we began to take this seriously as a society and the way to get that message across is via the punishment fitting the crime. We propose\r\n1) Harsher sentencing for repeat offenders\r\n2) DV training for all those working in the legal system- from the police right up to the judge in order for them to better understand the issues faced by victims & the seriousness of the crime.\r\n3) An age appropriate DV session for both sexes in all secondary schools.\r\n",
