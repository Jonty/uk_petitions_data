The current law does not protect our animals as it does humans. The death or injury of a family pet, due to a dog out of control cannot continue to go without penalty.\r\nAll dogs need to be under full control at all times and penalties for those owners who fail to do so should be lawfully enforced.\r\n*Dogs should be on leads in all places where the public can reasonably expected to be.\r\n*Dogs should be contained within their own property securely, and unable to enter a neighbouring property uninvited.\r\nNot all dogs are happy to socialise and therefore, for the safety of all concerned, ALL dogs should be under their owner's full control.",
