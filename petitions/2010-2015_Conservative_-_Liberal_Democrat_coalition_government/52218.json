        "additional_details": "The present (and previous) Government policy of privatising public services is jeopardising the public interest.\r\n\r\nPrivate companies running vital public services are allowed to profiteer at our expense. The market in privatised public services cannot possibly regulate itself, and the present system of regulation is clearly inadequate.\r\n\r\nWith further privatisation of key public services planned and in progress, this petition calls on the Government to appoint a Royal Commission to consider the potential harm caused by the privatisation of public services, and to put forward recommendations as to how such harm may be mitigated.",
