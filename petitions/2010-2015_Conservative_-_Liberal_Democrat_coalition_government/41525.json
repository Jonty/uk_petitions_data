Newsnight should be saved, as it has decades of great work behind it and a brand that I feel I shall be able to trust again. Along with Channel 4 News, it is the only quality daily news programme left. Heaven help us if all we end up with is the celeb led news of some of the commercial channels!  Save Newsnight. ",
