RESCUE CENTRES ARE OVER-RUN AND MANY HAVE HAD TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS TO NEW STRAYS.\r\n\r\nWE NEED A SET OF STRICT RULES AND REGULATIONS BROUGHT OUT TO ENSURE RESPONSIBLE OWNERSHIP OF CATS AND TO STOP BREEDING FOR PERSONAL GAIN AND GREED, THUS REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ABANDONED AND UNWANTED CATS.\r\n\r\nLOOK INTO MAKING NEUTERING AND MICRO-CHIPPING COMPULSORY AND START A REGISTER OF CATS TO ENABLE RESPONSIBLE OWNERSHIP, ALONG WITH  PET EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS TO TEACH RESPONSIBILITY FROM A YOUNG AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
