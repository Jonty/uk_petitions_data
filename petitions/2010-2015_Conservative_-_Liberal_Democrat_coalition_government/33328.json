I have called the Local Council who have been no help whatso ever. This is a small rural village and each day and throught the night we have HGV speeding through the village and on some occassions removing wing mirrors from Residents cars. this is not accepatable also as there is a school on the enterance to the village where children are being picked up and dropped off. they speed through and have no cinsiderations for local residents.\r\nI want the goverment to look at this and make the viallage at east not HGV'S at all through it and also look instaed of the stupid 20mph un police limit do something constructive about this.\r\nCome on listen to us a get a grip for once if you want to call me feel free on 0771405988",
