It's harrasment and a breach of my human rights because they are not respecting my wishes.\r\nI want to see leafleting regulated and licenced so that householders have a legal right to decide if they want such material posted through their doors and complaints can be followed up by bodies who have powers to fine companies who do not comply.",
