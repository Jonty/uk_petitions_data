The first target figure should be 40m, which is the number the UK could feed by itself, if no more of its greenfield land was lost to development. This would reduce food miles. Taxation of parents should increase by a standard 5% of their wages, if they have more than one child. Once we have reached the 40m target, the policy could be reviewed. To include a stop to all immigration, at least until the 40m target is reached. Employers would oppose this, and those who do should take on apprentices in the UK.",
