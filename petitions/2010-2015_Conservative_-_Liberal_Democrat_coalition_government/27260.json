        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish to petition against the closure of Otley Fire Station and the cuts to emergency fire cover in West Yorkshire proposed by West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue Service.\r\n\r\nUnder pressure due to Government cuts to save \u00a318 million over the next four years, the authority is planning to close ten stations, including Otley Fire Station and shed 102 firefighter jobs in total. The plan includes the loss of 12 retained firefighters based at Otley along with the loss of the station in the Otley-Rawdon merger.\r\n\r\nThese changes would see five new stations \u2013 including a full-time facility at Menston, open to replace Rawdon and Otley; reduced down to one thinly staffed station for two areas.\r\n\r\nGreg Mulholland MP has called on the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service to withdraw proposals concerning the closure of Otley Fire Station.\r\n\r\nYet on 16.12.11 Plans for far-reaching reform of the county\u2019s fire and rescue service were given the green light by councillors.
