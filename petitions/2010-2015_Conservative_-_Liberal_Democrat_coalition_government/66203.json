        "additional_details": "In September 2008, the Prime Minster announced an ambition to abolish prescription charges for patients with long-term conditions over the next few years. Back in 2009 Diane Abbott MP was shocked to find out that people suffering from sickle cell disease and Thalassaemia have to pay for prescriptions or apply to be exempt.\r\n\r\nSickle Cell and Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder. Although there is a lot of treatment out there to manage the disease, there is no affordable cure. People with SCD and Thalassemia will live with this disease for the rest of their lives. So they should be exempt from paying for prescriptions just like Cancer, Diabetic and Epilepsy  patients are.\r\n\r\nSickle Cell and Thalassaemia should be included in the government\u2019s review of prescription charges. Since 2009 nothing has been done.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Sickle Cell Anemia join A World Without Sickle Cell Anemia on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/AWorldWithoutSickleCellAnemia",
