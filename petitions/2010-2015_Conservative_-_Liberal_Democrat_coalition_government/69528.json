This referendum should give the people of the UK the decision as to what extra support Scotland gets from the UK on all the major issues.\r\nThe Scottish will have had their say, and this being a democratically elected government it is time for the whole of the UK to be involved.\r\nWe feel blackmailed by the Scottish politicians for so\r\nmuch extra out of the UK and it is our time to impact their decision.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to see a referendum in the UK in May 2015.\r\n\r\n",
