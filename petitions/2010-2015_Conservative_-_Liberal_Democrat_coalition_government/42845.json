        "additional_details": "In the egg producing and poultry industry male chicks that are hatched are classed as waste.\r\nThe male chicks are sorted via conveyor belt systems in specialized factories, they are literally picked from the line and threw into bins. From the bins they are either taken to be gassed or put into a mascerator, this grinds up the chicks alive and it is perfectly legal to do this in the uk. We propose that the use of mascerators in this way should be banned. Please sign the petition to make this happen!",
