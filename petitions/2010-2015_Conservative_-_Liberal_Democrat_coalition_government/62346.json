        "additional_details": "I believe that the plans to reduce the price of Train season tickets for part time workers should be brought forward to hit with immediate effect on all lines. It should not only impact Train travel but also bus travel. Another thing, for far too long the average commuter who has had to travel distances not viable in a car have had to endure inflation busting rail increases. This should be lessened by offering Season Tickets through a Salary sacrifice scheme in order to gain a tax break on season tickets.",
