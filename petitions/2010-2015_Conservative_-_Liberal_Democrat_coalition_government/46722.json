        "additional_details": "Holy Family Primary School has been making a desperate case for a new build for over a decade, despite serving the largest catchment area in South Derry and growing enrolment figures. The Council for Catholic Maintained Schools has agreed that Holy Family has one of the highest priorities for a new build in S. Derry and has passed this information to the Department for Education for Northern Ireland. Although the DENI have this information, Holy Family is not one of the 22 schools approved for a new build this year. We would like the government to realise that standards at Holy Family School are below an acceptable level and need addressing as soon as possible. We, the parents, would stress the need for a new-build to ensure a safe and comfortable environment for both the staff and students. It is totally unfair that a school, that year after year gets good academic results, be ignored and left out in the cold.",
