        "additional_details": "This petition calls for stopping the stealthy militarisation of the British police force. Already the so called anti-riot police (who riot themselves) have a full panoply of armour and assault weapons, now it is being suggested they should have water cannon's which are a brutal, dangerous and lethal weapon. This must be stopped before people are afraid to protest democratically and peacefully - no doubt the intention of the government.",
