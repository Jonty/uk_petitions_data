It enables Labour to have an unfair sphere of influence. Quite often monies paid to unions go indirectly into election campaigns for the Labour party, both nationally and locally. This could be in the form of office space used after hours, use of franking machines, or in the form of producing 'independent' leaflets or posters which clearly attack all party's but Labour (Tory tax bomb posters from the last election).\r\n\r\nThis is unfair and undemocratic. The financial link between these two must be deemed illegal to restore democracy to a level playing field.",
