Our proposed solution would help redress the balance in funding.\r\nDonations to charities are dwindling. BUT people are still dying from cancer; child abuse and homelessness is on the increase; sport is under-funded; academies are closing; drug abuse is rife\u2026the list of deserving charities is endless.\r\nBut we all use mobile phones.\r\nIn 2013, over 80m mobile phone subs were taken out in the UK.\r\nUsers could ensure that at least 10% of monthly spend would be donated to a chosen charity with no cost to them or change in behaviour.\r\nExample: Just 1m users spending \u00a320 pm.over 1 year would immediately generate \u00a324m for UK charities. A fraction of the life-saving potential.\r\nWe urge Government to consider the massive impact this initiative could have on the stretched resources of UK charities.\r\n\r\n",
