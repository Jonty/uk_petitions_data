What we have found is that it has actually increased over the last decade or so because of social media and people have gone back to their previous caste identities\r\nThe caste system is absolutely horrible for the victims. It makes you feel sub-human. There is no description for the pain that victims feel, the people who suffer from it deserve legal protection. It is horrible, discusting and their should be law to persecute who discrimnate other people.",
