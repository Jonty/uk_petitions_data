If an intruder has broken into the owner's property when they are out or in bed overnight and the dog bites or attacks to alter the owners and to protect them and their home it is not fair that the owners should face a pentalty because the intruder shouldn't have been there in the first place and so the incident would not have happened.  It is out of the owner's control if someone gets injured as a result of breaking in when they have taken steps to protect their home by locking it up when they leave or go to bed. Why should innocent victims who have been broken into suddenly become the criminals?\r\n\r\nOwners should NOT face punishment for something that happens to someone who has gained unauthorized access to the home.",
