        "additional_details": "The Coryton Oil Refinery in Essex is in administration due to Petroplus Holdings, its parent company, becoming insolvent. The plant looks increasingly likely to be bought by Shell, who plan to shut down the refinery and turn it into a terminal. British workers will be laid off to safeguard jobs in its Dutch plant.\r\n\r\nIf we fail to support refining we will become increasingly reliant on foreign imports to supply the country\u2019s energy needs. This will inevitably lead to higher fuel cost.\r\n\r\nCoryton employs about 900 people directly, and many more indirectly, in the local community.\r\n\r\nThe local council has estimated the cost to the local economy at about \u00a3100 million. The government could save the refinery by investing a similar amount to make refinery option more attractive to investors. This is money the government would get back and almost certainly make a profit on.\r\n\r\nPlease help to save British jobs, British industry and keep fuel costs down for the British people.\r\n",
