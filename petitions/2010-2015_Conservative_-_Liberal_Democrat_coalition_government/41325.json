        "additional_details": "Often people living with diabetes do not think of themselves as having a disability, but many people with diabetes are covered by the law that protects people with disabilities from discrimination. Since 1 October 2010 the law against disability discrimination in England, Wales, and Scotland has changed from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) to the Equality Act 2010.\r\n\r\nI would like the Department of Health to install information leaflets and posters for Type 1 Insulin Dependant Diabetics in all Jobcentre Plus Departments in the United Kingdom. The information should define Type 1 Diabetic rights and laws within employment and offer help if needed to get back into employment.",
