        "additional_details": "Relationship abuse is the new description for domestic abuse and domestic violence. With more young adults as young as 12 starting to display relationship abuse towards their boyfriend or girlfriend and more celebrities getting involved with highlighting the issue.\r\nHowever until we educate the children and support them in understanding what they have felt and why, we will have another generation of abusive partners and victims. If they have seen it at home supporting them to understand their feelings and thoughts in a loving and supportive way.\r\nThis petition is to have the topic covered in PSCE in all schools from the age of 8 years or younger in an age appropriate way.\r\nPreventing the situation is more effective than the cure and will cost the state less in terms of financial support to the next generation of victims.\r\n",
