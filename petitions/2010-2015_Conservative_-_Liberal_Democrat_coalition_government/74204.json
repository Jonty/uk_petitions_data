        "additional_details": "Unemployment was \u201cfar too high\u201d, with almost 1.2 million people aged 19-to-24 out of work or training, warning that Post-16 education standards had to improve to address the crisis. A damning report was published by Ofsted that criticised school sixth forms and colleges for failing to teach about \u201cemployability skills\u201d. There is also rising disappointment from Employers in the lack of motivation and work ethics youths possess which is greatly apparent in failed Apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nWith already strained resources, Post-16 schools, academies and colleges are unlikely to take this seriously. However we want the Department of Education to partner with the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills to kickstart a change to the British Curriculum to include compulsory business and life skills training in FE, recognised by employers for example: Emoire Academy's BIABOX.",
