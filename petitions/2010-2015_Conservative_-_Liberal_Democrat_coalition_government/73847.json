        "additional_details": "I have to pay more council tax than I can afford and I am working . Just as shocking is that people ,especially single people on benefits have to pay towards this out of the basic low benefit . This is why many people can not afford to eat every day . People on low benefits should not pay it and people on low wages should pay less or none . This is a disgusting act against the poor who are now worse off than they have been for years . We are going backwards not forwards . There is the biggest divide ever between the wealthy and poor , than there has been for many years  ",
