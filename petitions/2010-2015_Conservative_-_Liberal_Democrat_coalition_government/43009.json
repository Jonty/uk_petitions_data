        "additional_details": "Belfast City Council recently lowered the Union Jack which was disgraceful and has incited the riots in Belfast over the past few days.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to ask the Northern Ireland Assembly to overrule Belfast City Council and to return the Union Jack to the town hall. If this does not fall into the legislative competence of the assembly at present, then the Secretary of State should do all that is necessary to allow the Assembly to overrule the Council.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland is wholly part of the United Kingdom and as such the Union Jack should be flown. Seeing that Belfast is the capital of Northern Ireland, it should be the Assembly that makes these decisions not a city council. ",
