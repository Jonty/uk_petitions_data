Our brave soldiers have and will continue to give their lives for our country , what do we do for them ? why are they being forgotten about ? We shouldn't be ignoring this condition we shouldn't question people's actions but ask why ? Why has a happy healthy brave person taken a different root , are on the streets or have no hope or self worth ? And what can we do about it ? I believe the government should take the first step into finding out exactly how many veterans suffer with PTSD then provide the support needed to each persons individual situation, where is their security ,where is their hope. Im not the only one to have witnessed this first hand it feels as though it's left to the families (if they have any) to try and give the support but as a country they have fought for we should be the ones who stand together to ensure they are not alone ",
