        "action": "An urgent review of the Business Rates system",
        "additional_details": "The current Business Rates system is seriously harming small businesses. This petition seeks to force a proper review of the Rates system, to bring it into line with modern business realities.\r\n\r\nUnlike other Business Rates e-petitions, this one is not suggesting a specific action, it is merely suggesting that a proper, independent review is critical if we want to promote small business & innovation.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, the 3 main issues with the current system are:\r\n\r\n1. It is generally based on building size and/or turnover. In the modern business world, neither of these parameters have much bearing on the ability to pay (I.E. profit).\r\n\r\n2. It is incredibly unfair, with a vast disparity across different business sectors.\r\n\r\n3. It works on 5-yearly reviews, in a world where businesses can see their markets changing almost daily.",
