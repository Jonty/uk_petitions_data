This long term illness is medicated by T4/Levothyroxine on a daily basis in the UK to allow individuals to live a normal life. This does not happen as the medication Levothyroxine is simply not effective in the treatment of the illness and its symptoms. Doctors will monitor thyroid levels accordingly to their criteria but as the medication is not 100% effective people continue to suffer.\r\nThis makes going to work very difficult at times due to aching limbs/body, numb hands/feet and arms, brain fog, memory fog, extreme tiredness/fatigue, puffiness in face and around eyes. There are over 160 symptoms of thyroidism. This long term illness is debilitating and it does not get better - this illness is a life long one and it deteriorates. This illness needs to be classed as a disability for the individuals who suffer with it, who struggle on a daily basis.  ",
