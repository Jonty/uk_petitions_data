        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon Her Majesty's Government to prevent Local Authority Returning Officers from enforcing school closures to facilitate the provision of polling stations.\r\n\r\nMore should be done by local authorities to seek alternative premises which are either local authority run, or can be hired by the authority for use as a polling station. Furthermore, national government should do more to promote postal voting, which could eventually reduce the number of polling stations required.",
