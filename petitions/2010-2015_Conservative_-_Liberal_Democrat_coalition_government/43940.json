        "additional_details": "Abolish the house of commons.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet is selected from local councillors.  All procedures are retained, the only difference being that government business is debated via teleconferencing in all the council chambers and the councillors vote on the bills.\r\n\r\nThe need for a centrally located single lower house was negated with the invention of television.\r\n\r\nTo simplify further, reduce the number of local councillors to 25% of the current number (approx 5000).\r\n\r\nLocal councils will use a weighted vote system when voting on regional issues.\r\n\r\nCouncillors belonging to the local party with the most votes, will have 10 chamber-votes. Other parties' councillors will have the whole number of chamber-votes that reflects most closely the popular vote.  (Eg. If it takes 4 times as many votes to elect a green party councillor than a councillor from the regionally largest party, then the green councillor will carry 40 votes)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
