Provided it can be proven he or she has been abusive to their ex-partner. This would remove the risk of any child being abused at the hand of the abusive parent.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to look into changing the law to give the parent who is not abusive the full parental responsibility if its proven the other parent has been abusive and that this parent who loses the responsibility has no more rights to the child   ",
