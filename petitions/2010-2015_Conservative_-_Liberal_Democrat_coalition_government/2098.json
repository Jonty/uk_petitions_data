Surely we want one petition with 100,000 signatures, not 100,000 petitions with one signature?\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that the public should be allowed to suggest topics, but not create the petitions. The moderators of the site can then consolidate suggested topics into one properly worded petition, which we can all then vote on.",
