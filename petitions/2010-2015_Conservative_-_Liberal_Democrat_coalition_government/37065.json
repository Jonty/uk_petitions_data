        "additional_details": "Every single year, our local councils spend excessive amounts (I've heard millions) of money on road repairs such as re-surfacing with stones that do not even need repairing just because they \"dont want to lose their budget\". I call on the goverment to crack down on all local counsils inappropriate wasting of money, review each councils usual monthly spending independantly and reduce their budget regardless so that they can't put our money to waste.\r\n\r\nI also call for the govement to crack down on  councils placing stones all over roads that have nothing or little up with them in the first place, and instead just concentrate on the few roads that actually need fixing, close them off for a few days and totally re-surface them.\r\n\r\nSurfacing roads with small stones is a waste of time, and additionally causes a lot of damage to nearby vehicles and properties. Make it illegal to place stonses and make councils do the job properly.",
