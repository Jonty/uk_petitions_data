Listing to 'I Will Kiss' by Underworld still motivates me.\r\n\r\nBritain is the inventor of more than 30 globally recognised sports, and we should hold an annual celebration of our sporting heritage: The UK Summer Games.\r\n\r\nWe already have stadia & facilities, and we have a highly determined workforce who could did us proud in 2012 and could do it again every year.\r\n\r\nThe UK Summer Games could generate annual revenue for the UK Government through sponsorship, ticket sales, merchandise and could help our economy by underpinning seasonal tourism.\r\n\r\nThis is our opportunity to take the legacy of the games to the next level. This is our chance to create a lasting global event of our own. This is our chance to showcase our sporting heritage on the world stage annually.",
