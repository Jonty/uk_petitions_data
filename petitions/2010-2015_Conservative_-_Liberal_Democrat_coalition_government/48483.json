        "additional_details": "I think many of us have had some sort of bad experience with a private rent landlord involving faulty repairs which they choose to ignore. No matter how serious the situation. Something need's to be done about this or nothing will ever change. local authorities should have more power to stop these situations from happening without the need of going to court, which would probably end up with the tenant getting evicted before this happens.\r\n\r\nI think every private rent landlord should be licenced to trade and should have to apply to the local authorities for a licence which would involve an assessment on electical safety regulations, gas safety regulations and understanding the Landlord and tenant act 1985 section 11.\r\nI think the local authorities should have more power to fine a landlord who breach these regulations and section 11 Landlord and tenant act 1985 and revoke a landlords licence if they repeatedly offend.\r\n\r\nThese cowboy landlords have got away with it for far too long.",
