        "additional_details": "Smacking a child is currently legally allowed in the UK, despite laws which make it illegal for adults to physically assault each other in this way.\r\n\r\nThe 2004 Children's Act allows the physical punishment of children, as long as the act leaves no \"bruising, swelling, cuts, grazes or scratches\".\r\n\r\nYet, all forms of physical punishment, including smacking, are prohibited in full-time independent schools, in children\u2019s homes, in local authority foster homes and Early Years provision. So why are parents still allowed to physically punish their children?\r\n\r\nResearch shows that smacking is not only ineffective when it comes to disciplining children, but it is also harmful to them.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the government to remove this harmful double standard and bring smacking laws in line with all other forms of physical punishment.\r\n\r\nWe request that the government makes the physical punishment of children, including smacking, illegal.",
