        "additional_details": "Should any visitor to the UK fall seriously ill then he is entitled to treatment at an NHS hospital. This is a guarantee given by the UK government so long as the visitor has a proper visa and adequate medical insurance. Yet in the case of my mother recently, and many others, the finance staff of NHS hospitals bully and coerce such patients, whilst still in their hospital beds, into producing cash to pay for the treatment. This has to stop. The NHS hospital should contact and collect from the insurance authorities and not harass the poor and already suffering patient.\r\n\r\nI suggest that a visa should include medical insurance that will cover hospitalisation costs in case of a medical emergency.",
