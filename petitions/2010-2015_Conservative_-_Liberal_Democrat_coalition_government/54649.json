        "additional_details": "After many service families marching into filthy quarters that have been supposedly 'cleaned' by Ideal Cleaners I would like to propose the MOD ends their contract as money and large sums of money at that are being handed over to this company to clean quarters to march out standard yet they are failing miserably! If family's cleaned themselves and left the quarters in such a state they would surely recieve a hefty charge. If they cannot end the contract the system at least needs to be revised, the option for us as the customer to inspect the work we've paid for would be a good place to start. It is not right that we pay for a service and do not recieve it.",
