        "action": "Changing of laws for lodgers regarding deposit protection",
        "additional_details": "Under current law landlords renting to tenants have to protect the deposit under a government approved scheme. However those renting to lodgers (i.e. someone renting a room in the owners house) do not have to do this. I think this should change, so that both tenants and logers have their deposits protected by a scheme.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are several other differences, this is one I feel is the most important, particularly as it's usually students who end up renting this way as it's usually cheaper and easier than finding a group to rent a house together with. This is a particular problem for foreign students, who can't remain in the country after there course finishes for the amount of time needed to take these things through to small courts, or are simply not familiar enough with UK legal  practices to know how to do this.\r\n\r\nA small change that I hope would make it a lot harder for rogue landlords to get away with unearned and undeserved deposits.",
