        "additional_details": "The aim of this petition is to introduce measures whereby employers are no longer allowed to discriminate employees or potential employees based on their appearance, ie, tattoos, piercings etc. The alternative image presented by many young people in today's society has prevented many from securing employment or in some cases losing employment based on tattoos, hair colour or piercings. This image is becoming more and more prevalent and has become socially accepted in many industries and in public generally. Discriminating against people who live an alt lifestyle is counter-productive to UK industry, as more and more young people purchase tattoos, piercings or colour their hair, and employers should not be able to discriminate against those that live the lifestyle - employers should be obliged to give everyone a chance base on competency, not appearance.
