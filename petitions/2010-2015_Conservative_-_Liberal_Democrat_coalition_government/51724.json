        "additional_details": "The Straid Road on the outskirts of Bushmills is an accident black spot. We are aware of at least 6 serious accidents in the past 12 months. There is no footpath from Castlenagree Road, along the Straid Road, into Bushmills. Both locals and tourists have no option but to walk on the road to and from Bushmills, this is treacherous. It is only a matter of time until someone is killed. There are families living on Castlenagree Road who cannot walk safely into Bushmills for local provisions which is less than 800 metres away. There is an urgent demand for a footpath on this road running from at least the Castlenagree Road to Bushmills. Also, there is increasing concern about the current obesity epidemic, which will only get worse, we are concerned about the health and safety of the rural families in the area, they have no opportunity to walk safely .....please help.",
