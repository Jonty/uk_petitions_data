        "additional_details": "Currently, around 12.2 billion plastic bags are given free to the UK public each year. These plastic bags take up to 1000 years to decompose. It is currently estimated that there are 46,000 pieces of plastic in each square mile of ocean. This has contributed to the 1 million sea birds and 100,000 sea animals being killed every year by waste in the sea. Also plastic bags have currently used 0.2% of the worlds oil.\r\n\r\n The government should help raise awareness of this and help to reduce plastic bag usage. They could ban it if simply reducing it is too hard.",
