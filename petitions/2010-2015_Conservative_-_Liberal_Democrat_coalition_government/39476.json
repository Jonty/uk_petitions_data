Imagine how hurt you will feel, you look on Facebook to see people sending there regards etc. Then one day you go on Facebook and you find this Facebook page, how hurt would you be? How angry would you be?\r\nOur soldiers give up everything to go on tours to places like Afghanistan and Iraq. They give up there family and friends, unborn children, possibly dying family to protect our country and others. Some may leave school without many qualifications but most have countless qualifications that they have studied for years to get, the join things like the cadets to add more to there cv and to get that basic military feeling. I want this page CLOSED DOWN as it is incorrect and disrespectful!",

            "details": "The vast majority of the UK ISP industry takes a responsible approach to what content it hosts, both of its own volition and in co-operation with law enforcement and Government agencies.  Where the industry is advised that content they host contravenes legislation, they will readily remove it.  In addition, ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nComplaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager.  Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal.  Arrangements similar to AUPs apply to many websites, including social networking sites.  Those people, who find user content offensive or suspect, therefore should report their concerns to the appropriate social network site."
