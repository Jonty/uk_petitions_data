        "additional_details": "For many years the Department of Health has refused to perform its duty and protects medical profits. Coronary heart disease is easily preventable and curable by six monthly checks using the new science of CardioRetinometry, and evaluation of retinal photographs of the arteries, providing almost immediate  evidence  of reversal of their disease by advice re supplements and adverse food and lifestyle factors. I estimate that over \u00a320,000,000,000 could be saved of the NHS budget. The Attorney General should look at the 1998 Competition Act and the restrictive practices of Official Medicine.",
