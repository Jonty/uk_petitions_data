Putting that aside there is a massive threat for facilities and employment locally.  Newcastle upon Tyne has been hit by the loss of Northern Rock to name one.  They are looking to take a community and make it a small city.  Green belt is green belt, we have thousands of houses in the North East empty.  Why not repair what we have rather than just build more!  ",
