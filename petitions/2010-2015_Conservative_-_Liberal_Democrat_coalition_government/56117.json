        "additional_details": "English Premier League managers should announce their team line ups well in advance of the weekly fantasy football deadlines.  For too long now, squad rotation has been the curse of the modern fantasy football manager, and it is impossible to know which of the top teams' many talented players to select.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a rule has the potential to spoil the weekend for thousands of people.  It's only right that this is rectified for the good of the country's morale.\r\n",
