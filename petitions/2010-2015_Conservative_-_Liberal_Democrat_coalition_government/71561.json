        "additional_details": "It's that time of year where people are out looking at the bright lights and listening to the loud crackles and bangs that fireworks make in the sky but for animals it's that time of year where they shake severely, hide under anything they can \"to get to safety\", suffer with anxiety, jump at every sound due to their high sensitivity in hearing.\r\nIt would be manageable for at most two days of the year: 5th November and the 31st December for fireworks to be set off, this should be done by an organisation and not for personal use because due to current law fireworks can be brought between 15th October and 10th November and again between the 26th December and the 31st December, this current law has no monitoring and allows anyone to set them off at any given time, this is not just a threat to the well being of animals, the elderly and most vulnerable are also a victim of this and I want the government to consider imposing a complete ban on the sale of fireworks to the general public.",
