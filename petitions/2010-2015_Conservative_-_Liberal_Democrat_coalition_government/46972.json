        "additional_details": "In blatant violation of Human Rights, many husbands & their families are arbitrarily arrested without any investigation/evidence, under Indian Penal Code section 498A & other wife-biased laws. According to 498a section, words of wife are taken Prima facie and husband & his family can be arrested. The law presumes the accused are \u201cguilty until proven innocent\u201d. The situation is also affecting residents of Indian origin in UK & negatively impacting their work and life. Many such residents in UK have to travel to India and fight false allegations. We request the Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister to help:\r\n1. Offer travel advisories like in USA for people travelling to India.\r\n2. Offer options to fight false cases and punish misusers of the law.\r\n3. To discuss with Indian counter-parts, to make amendments in the law, to stop its abuse.",
