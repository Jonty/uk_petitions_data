        "additional_details": "In the last few years billions of pounds of tax-payers money has been given to those on benefits. What I propose is a 'Benefit Card' a credit card-like item, funded by the government, which those on benefits can use to purchase essentials, so food, non-alcoholic drinks, toilet rolls and baby food (if applicable) ect. can be brought using this card.\r\n\r\nBy introducing such a scheme the factors behind unemployment would decrease, as this would remove the ability to purchase drugs, alcohol and non-essentials such as cigarettes. By removing the ability for those not in work to buy such products it would give a better incentive for those not in work to find a job. It would also reduce the amount of money given to those on benefits as only what is necessary would be paid for.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this scheme would reduce the amount of tax-payers money spent of alcohol and drugs, and increase the employment rate as there would be a greater incentive for those on benefits to find work.",
