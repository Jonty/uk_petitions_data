        "additional_details": "It is time we looked at a more mathematical way of taxing corporations, I would suggest we based this how spread out the pay is for said firm.\r\n\r\nThere is a formula relating to this known as the \"Gini Coefficient\"; essentially, this gives a number between 0 and 1 indicating how spread out a quantity is. Relating to the issue at hand: \"1\" would mean that one person collects all the pay whereas \"0\" would mean that everyone is paid equally.\r\n\r\nI suggest that we have a variable tax rate, so those firms that spread out the wealth benefit from a lower tax rate and those firms that have a huge disparity between employee pay are consequently penalised.",
