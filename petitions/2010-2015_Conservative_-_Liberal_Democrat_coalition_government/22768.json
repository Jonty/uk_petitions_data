        "additional_details": "Rheumatoid 'Arthritis' is an Auto-Immune Disease. It is second to Cancer. Rheumatoid is a serious illness and is nothing like Arthritis. The name of the disease is offensive to Rheumatoid sufferers. People are then ignorant when we explain to them what we suffer from. People only hear the word Arthritis, not Rheumatoid. Myself and every other Rheumatoid sufferer would love for the word Arthritis to finally be removed to enable us to get the recognition that we deserve. ",
