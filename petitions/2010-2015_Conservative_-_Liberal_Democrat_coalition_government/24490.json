        "additional_details": "This is to change the law in relation to unscrupulous companies who exploit and threaten honest business people. These companies offer free trials to a subscription service of work tenders. If you do not cancel the service you are invoiced for a whole year in advance.\r\n\r\nThey say free, free, free all over it and hide the terms and conditions, make sure they never contact you during the trial or at its end to see how it has progressed.\r\n\r\nThey do this to catch people who in most cases don't find the service useful, don't pay close attention to the hidden terms and have in mind it is free, don't enter any financial information so are lured in to this deceptive trap.\r\n\r\nit is causing untold stress and worry among well meaning and honest business people who try the service to increase business, but end up with it ruining them instead.",
