        "additional_details": "Offering tax incentives to haulage companies to transport goods and materials outside of peak hours (8pm to 6am) will increase the fuel efficiency of transport (cost saving), reduce the number of lorries during peak hours (congestion reduction) and maximise the efficiency of our transport network (demand reduction for new/extended roads/mways) which are under utilised outside of peak hours.  This is a win win for all with a good cost benefit.  Long term savings and liability reduction to increase road capacity diminish sharply are generated through this.  ",
