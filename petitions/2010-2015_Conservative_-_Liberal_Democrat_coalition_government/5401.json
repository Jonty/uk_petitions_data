        "additional_details": "Several councils have the right to enforce statutory notices on property owners for work they feel is required. If this involves a tenement of several flats, it is impossible to arrange this and have one person take full responsibility. The council then arranges for this work to be done. Not only is an expensive contractor employed, the council makes c. 15% (Edinburgh City Council) of the cost for 'administration'. This often far exceeds any actual expense. If councils continue to decide what work needs doing, who should do it, and make more profit on contracting excessively expensive companies, a conflict of interest penalises property owners. This service should be funded by council tax and not provide extra profit from owners already having large bills imposed upon them.",
