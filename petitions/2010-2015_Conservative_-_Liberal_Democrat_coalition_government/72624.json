        "additional_details": "North Somerset Council want to bring about changes that will drastically change the way people are allocated a care agency.\r\n\r\nNew changes will implement \"Zones\" e.g. Worle, Backwell, e.t.c. and each zone will be bid on my care companies to win a zone.\r\n\r\nI want the government to stop these changes from going ahead. We deserve the right to chose who provides this very personal service. Worse still the Council are selling it by saying they will improve the quality of care we receive which simply isn't true!\r\n\r\nIf you have care funded by North Somerset Council or know anyone who does I urge you to sign this petition. Maybe you are a carer and don't want these changes to affect your work or maybe you are just thinking ahead as the likelihood is many of us will require these services in the future.  ",
