The UK\u00a0should follow suit!\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from the OfCom website - up to 31p p/min is outrageous! Some international calls are cheaper!\r\n\r\nhttp://consumers.ofcom.org.uk/files/2010/01/numbering.pdf\r\n\r\n-*-*-*-*\r\n\r\n[regarding 0800 numbers]\r\n\r\nHow much do calls cost? Calls are normally free of charge from landlines but charges may apply from mobile phones. However, the operator must make an announcement before the call is connected telling the caller that they will be charged (the announcement does not state the exact charge). Calls from mobiles typically cost up to 31p per minute.\r\n\r\n0500 numbers cost similar amounts as 0800 and 0808 numbers from a mobile.\r\n\r\n-*-*-*-*\r\n\r\nMAKE\u00a0ALL\u00a0FREEPHONE\u00a0CALLS\u00a0FREE, AS\u00a0THEY\u00a0SHOULD\u00a0BE",
