        "additional_details": "At Benazir Bhutto International Airport Pakistan, the staff and custom officers are forcefully opening passenger luggage on hope of receiving bribes.\r\n\r\nIn order to persuade passengers to pay them, they are using certain tools to put holes in precious goods despite luggage being scanned and x-rayed.\r\n\r\nSome old and vulnerable passengers end up paying to avoid getting their goods being damaged.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not about being searched by the staff at the airport, as this is a security procedure. The issue is the staff taking bribe not to search and damage goods if they are not paid.\r\n\r\nWe urge the British foreign office to advice the Pakistani government of this issue and to enforce procedures to permanently stop their staff from taking bribes and harassing British nationals who transit through Pakistani airports.
