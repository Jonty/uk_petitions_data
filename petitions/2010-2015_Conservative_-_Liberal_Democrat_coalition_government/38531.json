        "additional_details": "Proposal to regulate the rental of property in areas where home owners reside. Many citizens proudly own properties and reside in friendly polite neighbourhoods but this is sadly being quickly eroded away. Rented properties in their areas let out hastily by landlords with little consideration for the area are causing a great deal of stress and erosion of the way of life for many.\r\n\r\nThis Petition proposes that tenants on housing benefits / low income are housed in designated areas and also better regulation of people in let properties to cover private landlords and housing associations.\r\n\r\nSuch actions will vastly reduce the cases of:\r\n\r\nNeighbor disputes\r\nNoise Complaints\r\nBreach of The Peace\r\nAnti-Social Behaviour\r\nRise of Crime in certain communities.",
