        "additional_details": "A  10,000 signature Petition was handed to David Cameron from 'Hampshire Against Fluoridation,' and  passed to Department of Health. Fluoridation of our water supplies is TOXIC MEDICATION. Fluoride is a medicine ( a medicine is defined by MHRA as 'preventing disease in humans' ).This is being done to prevent dental decay in children! It was voted against by 72% of the local people, ignored by Strategic Health Authority - ( to be disbanded at end of 2012). SHA decision upheld by High Court. SAY NO TO FLUORIDATION NOW. If there are enough signatures the Government have to debate it. Your local M.P. Julian Lewis, Hampshire County Council, New Forest District Council and all local Councillors are against it. PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION NOW. Fluoride will be in ALL our water not just our drinking water, you can't boil it out, it gets through your skin when you bath.You can't bath or shower in bottled water. Please SIGN this.",
