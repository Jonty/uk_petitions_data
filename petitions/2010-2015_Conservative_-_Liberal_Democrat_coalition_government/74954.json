        "additional_details": "The Department of Health and the World Health Organization suggest  that babies get all the nutrients they need from breast milk or infant formula, until they are around 6 months old. They recommend introducing solid foods at around this age as the digestive system will have developed fully enough to cope with solid foods.\r\n\r\nThere are many products within the baby food industry that say they are suitable from 4 months of age.\r\n\r\nI am a student health visitor nearing the end of my training. During the year I have come across many families who are confused by conflicting advise.\r\n\r\nMany families feel that if weaning before six months was a real concern, food companies would not be able to advertised their products from 4 months.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to raise the age on the containers of baby food from 4 months old to around 6 months, as this will co-inside with the Department of Health and the World Health Organizations recommendations.
