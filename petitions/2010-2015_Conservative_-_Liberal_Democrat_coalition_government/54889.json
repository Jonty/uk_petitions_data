        "additional_details": "It is obvious from the recent media interest in the BBC that the current annual TV licence fee is way above what it should be i.e. \u00a3145.50.  Over the past few years the BBC management have been squandering millions of pounds  of our licence fee money (which must be surplus to requirements) to the already overpaid and underworked executives. The so called \"golden handshakes\" & enormous pension payouts must stop. It is for this reason that I propose ALL television licence payers are given a one off refund payment of \u00a3100.  This would hopefully solve the problem of the BBC having too much surplus cash and also stop the BBC management giving outrageous payments to themselves.\r\n",
