        "additional_details": "That the Government should establish a People's Bank underwritten by taxpayers whose money is presently used to bail out failed speculators whose greed is destroying us and committing us to poverty and despair.\r\n\r\nBanks have no interest in the needs of everyday people nor of small businesses and not even the country in which they do business. They have proved that.\r\n\r\nIn effect, they exercise a brake on the dreams and aspirations of the people and on the health of the country. And seem completely geared to playing the market with risk-taking for high rewards and speculating with mergers and acquisitions.\r\n\r\nFree the people with their own bank! The infrastructure already exists and is an integral part of all our communities - the Post Office. Maybe we'll end up with \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and the Government will be rewarded with all the happiness it can bear!\r\n",
