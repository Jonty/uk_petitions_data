        "additional_details": "Ban the finance industry from charging any fees on an individuals investment capital. All fees and charges should only come out of interest earned or capital growth. The original capital amount should be protected. If the value of a fund suffers a reduction , in any given financial year, then fees should be paid to the individual( negative fee payment).\r\nThis should put an end to the common practice of  front loading charges and the corresponding reduction of pension-pots etc. It will also end the practice of awarding greedy bonuses, commissions and other back-handers all paid for by Joe Public out of their hard earned pensions/savings. All of which amounts to legalized theft. ",
