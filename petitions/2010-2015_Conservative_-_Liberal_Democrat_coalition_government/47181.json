        "additional_details": "With the G8 leaders coming to the UK this summer, the government has the power to help end world hunger. We want the government to follow the aims of the IF campaign:\r\n1. Putting pressure on the rest of the G8 give more life-saving aid to stop children dying from hunger and help the poorest families feed themselves.\r\n2. Put on the G8 agenda to stop farmers being forced off their land and to ensure that crops are used for food, not fuel.\r\n3. At the G8, launch a Convention on Tax Transparency to stop big companies dodging tax in poor countries, so that millions can free themselves from hunger.\r\n4. The UK to use its presidency of the G8 to push for governments and big companies to to be honest about their actions that stop people getting enough food.\r\nFor more information on these aims, visit the official website: http://enoughfoodif.org/issues",
