        "additional_details": "With the proposed increase in the Territorial Army to replace regular soldiers, give additional training to those Territorials in riot control techniques. If the situation demanded, and proper authority was given, they could be mobilised, equipped and granted temporary police powers. This would boost the number of trained personnel available by perhaps tens of thousands and help the over stretched police deal with a severe civil disorder situation. ",
