        "additional_details": "The Government has recently announced a change in the Law for Design Copyright. It currently stands at 25 years from the date of the published work and they are changing it to 70 years from the death of the Author, mainly due to lobbying by large companies.\r\nI believe the law perhaps should be changed from the day it is passed forwards or from 1988 (covering items just reaching 25 years)\r\nHowever, it should NOT be applied to anything that precedes this date as the protection has already long run out. For example, an item designed in the 1950\u2019s has already been out of copyright by some 30 years and it is wrong to give protection back to them after all this time.\r\nIt is wrong because there are now widespread and completely legitimate alternatives options for customers looking to buy that design, the original and the reproductions.\r\nGiving back this protection will damage legitimate business leaving thousands out of work in the UK, please sign up and say NO.\r\n",
