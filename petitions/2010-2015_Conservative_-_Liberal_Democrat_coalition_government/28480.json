        "additional_details": "Under current legislation, dogs siezed as being suspected as being banned breeds, and subsequently found to be not banned, cannot be returned to the owner if the conditions they will be kept in are unsuitable.  Furthermore, in these circumstances they cannot be rehomed either, and thus are destroyed.  These dogs have done nothing wrong, have shown no signs of aggression, and deserve a chance at life.  We the undersigned demand a change to the law, NOW, so that they can be rehomed to proper, assessed if required, responsible owners who know and understand the breed, who will have them neutered and attend properly recognised training classes and be supervised by a qualified behaviourist.  These dogs have no voice, WE are giving them a voice!",
