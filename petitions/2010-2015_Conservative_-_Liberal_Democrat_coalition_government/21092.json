Instead the council would like to auction it off to put more money in their pockets, yet N.E Sports are willing to pay rent and use the facilities (for which up to now has lay vacant) for the benefit of surrounding areas and benefit of young people..\r\nPlease join in with us in letting the council know that people would like this building to be used for the benefit of younger people and teenagers, to keep them safe and off the streets, to teach them new skills as well as life skills...please help if you think this is important... many thanks",
