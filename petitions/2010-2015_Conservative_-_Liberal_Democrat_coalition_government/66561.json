        "additional_details": "Are you aware that, as of 2014 Land Based BTECs will no longer count in school league tables? The knock on effect of this will be that schools, who currently offer Land Based BTECs such as Agriculture & Horticulture will be forced to drop them from the curriculum, as it will jeopardise their results. Please help us to campaign for Land Based BTECs to be included in school performance tables. The Vocational Curriculum needs to be more aspirational, more rigorous than it has been in the past. So why is it that Hair & Beauty will feature among the recently accredited BTECs, while Agriculture & Horticulture will not? While 1 in 10 UK businesses are from the Land Based sector, 230,000 companies employing 1,000,000 people in Britain today, the proposed vocational curriculum for 2014 offers no Land Based qualification that will appear in school measures. We want to urge the government to reconsider the removal of these from the accredited BTECs which go towards school performance tables.",
