        "additional_details": "The MOT test ensures all vehicles are maintained to necessary standards. Exempting pre-1960s vehicles will have widespread implications. Say no if you agree with just one of the nine reasons here.\r\n\r\n1. Insurance premiums are expected to rise for all enthusiasts.\r\n2. Previously non-transferable, registrations without an MOT could be sold off.\r\n3. If the number plate loophole isn\u2019t closed BEFORE the exemption becomes law, many dormant classics could be scrapped.\r\n4. Trade revenues from parts and labour will suffer.\r\n5. MOT exempt vehicles may find future road use limited.\r\n6. An MOT allows vital trade within understood guidelines of condition.\r\n7. An MOT-exempt vehicle in an accident will be held to greater account, bringing enthusiasts into disrepute.\r\n8. Allowing passenger-carrying commercial vehicles MOT exemption has huge cost implications for their operators.\r\n9. Rising public liability insurance for events attended by MOT-exempt vehicles could become too expensive.\r\n",
