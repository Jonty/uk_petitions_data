        "additional_details": "I'm not sure if this is a prominent issue or not, Its just I saw an article on an online newspaper about a returnee from Afghanistan who was forced to sleep rough in cemeteries as he couldn't afford to rent..... something along those lines! But due to the fact that we are withdrawing forces from Afghanistan maybe this could be a problem for those services personnel who have been made redundant. Therefore I propose that our forces who have served valiantly are given the right conditions they deserve as protectorates of our country! They should be given priority council housing so they are able to get back on their feet!\r\nIn tribute to their service we should treat our soldiers with the up most respect and not leave them to rot by the wayside!\r\nPlease sign this if you feel the same way!\r\nMany Thanks\r\n",
