This is to be achieved through an investment strategy for disposing of the Investments in an orderly and active way.\r\n\r\nIt is felt that the Government's arms-length investment strategy to creating taxpayer value is a blinkered approach.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to research other goals for the UKFI which could contribute to the overarching objective.",
