        "additional_details": "There is a desperate need of tougher Government regulation of Property Management Companies (PMCs) and Freeholders who ignore their responsibilities and leave properties in a state of ruin and disrepair, despite being paid thousands of pounds each year by the Leaseholders that have to live in these unacceptable conditions.\r\n\r\nPMCs and neglectful Freeholders have been taking full advantage of the fact that there isn\u2019t stricter regulation and many use threatening tactics to force Leaseholders to pay huge sums of money if they dare to challenge the high management fees for which they see no service for.\r\n\r\nThe only option for Leaseholders currently is to take PMCs and Freeholders to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal (LVT), which is a timely and expensive process.\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming levels of intimidation, stress and huge sums of debt faced by Leaseholders is totally unacceptable and there has to be tougher Government regulation in place to protect them.",
