        "additional_details": "The planned HS2 project is inappropriate for a country of this size.  At best, it will reduce the journey time from Manchester to London by 20 minutes; this improvement is irrelevant to the vast majority of travellers, and comes at an absolutely enormous cost.\r\n\r\nRail capacity can be increased by extending trains (and platforms) and using double-decker trains, which may require substantial modifications to their routes in terms of overhead clearance.  These modifications are costly, but small in comparison to the currently-planned HS2 project.\r\n\r\nThe planned HS2 project is not appropriate for Britain, and greater improvement in rail infrastructure could be obtained at much lower cost.",
