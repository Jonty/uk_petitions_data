        "additional_details": "The majority of people do not want another coalition government and strongly oppose far-right parties getting a foothold into the government. However, under the current voting system, these views are unlikely to be represented as we are only allowed to have one vote, so our votes are split between all parties that share this point of view whereas those who support far-right extremists do not have their votes reduced to a fraction of their strength.\r\n\r\nWhen the alternative vote referendum was held it had 30% of the public supporting it despite it being somewhat complicated. Perhaps a simpler system such as approval voting would be more popular and effective at representing the public's wishes and keeping the extremists out.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that a debate is held by the House of Commons as to what alternatives to the current voting system would be viable and then put it to the public, allowing more than one option to be selected, as to which electoral system we would like to use.",
