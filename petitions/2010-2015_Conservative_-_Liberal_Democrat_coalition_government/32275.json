If they failed to get an education and are unemployable that is their problem.\r\n\r\nJob seekers allowance is there for when people lose their job and need income until they are back in work.\r\n3 years is a long enough time for this to happen and if they fail to get a job within 3 years they lose this benefit.\r\n\r\nThis would stop people being on unemployment benefit all their lives.",
