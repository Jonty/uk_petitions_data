        "additional_details": "Overpopulation is the overwhelming challenge faced by the World; depletion of natural resources, degradation of the environment and unsustainable levels of food, water and energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThe British Government has a responsibility to form policies that address overpopulation at home and abroad: educating people to have smaller families, limiting benefits for larger families, improving sex education and family planning, promoting adoption rather than IVF, introducing financial incentives for 1 or 2-child families or voluntary sterilisation. Foreign aid should focus on birth control and environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\nI submit that the creation of a 'Minister for Population Control' is necessary to keep this issue in the public consciousness and on the Political agenda.",
