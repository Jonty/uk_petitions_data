We are heading for hyperinflation due to QE with no warning for the general public, or the savers and pensioners who are losing millions in lost interest payments just to hold up a bankrupt banking system ! We need QE in the real economy to create REAL Jobs ! Energy independent is a good start, money for Solar / Wind / Bio Mass, the production of bio fuels from Algae, put money into these industries, its a no brainer ! We import 50% of the gas, what happens when our currency loses purchasing power ? We need to address this issue now ! Its top urgent !  Fracking is just plain stupid !          ",
