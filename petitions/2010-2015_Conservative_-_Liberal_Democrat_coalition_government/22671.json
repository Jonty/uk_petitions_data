        "additional_details": "After the scandal of members expenses etc, is it right that MPs should have 'interests' outside of representing their constituents? Is it really democratic that an MP can be on the board of a multi-million pound company and able to represent their constituents objectively. I believe that it is a major factor in voter apathy and distrust of MPs. I propose that, rather than having a register of Members interests, Members shouldn't have any interests, other than as public representatives. If it means a rise in their wages to  compensate, then I would be for that if it means our parliament is more representative.",
