        "action": "Set up an NHS industrial sector to supply better medical instruments within the UK",
        "additional_details": "By purchasing medical instruments through procurement, and from countries that are providing us with poor quality instruments that are exacerbating the rates of healthcare-associated infections within the UK, I believe that moving production to the UK would be cost effective and would improve quality control.\r\n\r\nThe current budget for NHS surgical instruments doesn't take into account the amount of money spent on extra nursing time, extra bed days, correctional operations, and all of the other costs that come from using poor quality instruments.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion polls have shown that unemployment is regarded as one of the major issues for the country at this time. With the amount of brown-field (previously industrial) land available, the site for producing NHS instruments could be bought within the UK for a reasonable cost, and this country has the skills necessary for such a project.\r\n\r\nSign this petition if you support more British jobs and safer surgical procedures.",
