        "additional_details": "Join us in requesting that this Government retain the Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) Regulations 2008.\r\nThe Red Tape Challenge recommended scrapping the regulations but we believe this would be a very bad move for several reasons:\r\n-\tConstruction companies could revert to their old habits which are far from environmentally friendly\r\n-\tMore waste will end up going to landfill\r\n-\tThe audit trail of waste from construction sites would be lost, which could lead to more fly-tipping\r\n-\tWhen SWMPs are implemented using best practice they actually save contractors money\r\n-\tThey are NOT the burden that this Government seems to think they are.\r\nWe need to voice our opinions at the Public Consultation to be held later this year in order to retain these Regulations and maintain the good habits that they have started.\r\nPlease support us by adding your signature below \u2026\u2026. Thank you.\r\n",
