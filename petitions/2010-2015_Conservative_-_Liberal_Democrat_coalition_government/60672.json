People living on their own are paying exactly the same as households that have 4 or more people and this practice is grossly unfair.\r\nWater meters are not the answer as in time everyone will be forced to have one and to a lot of people these metres are a frightening prospect.\r\nPeople who live alone should pay at least a quarter less than a full household or the cost of water should be relevant to how many people live in the house.",
