Urban Strawberry Lunch, in the guise of Ambrose Reynolds and Liz Carlisle have invested time, sweat and boundless energy into providing sanctuary for rough sleepers and a space for artists and creatives alike. Now is time for supporters to rally and stand with USL in their struggle to retain their unique role and preserve this monument to peace for the people of this great city.",
