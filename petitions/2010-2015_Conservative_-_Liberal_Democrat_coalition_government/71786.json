        "additional_details": "The people who sign this e-petition clearly want the UK Government to keep all relative road signs in imperial measurements and NOT add metric measurements as well.  We also want in the consultation that our road signs are to remain in imperial measurements and can not be changed. This is in response to the UK Government consultation of The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD) 2015 as tucked away under \u2018other issues\u2019 the report notes: \u2018In order to improve road safety and compliance, ministers have decided that the revised TSRGD will no longer prescribe imperial-only height and width limit signs.' and \u2018Imperial-only signs can remain in place only until such time that they become life-expired, or replaced during routine maintenance, at which time the dual-unit equivalent must be used.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis will lead to ALL roads sign being in compliance with mainland Europe and eventually a move for the EU to impose a rule for all EU countries road traffic signs to be harmonised.",
