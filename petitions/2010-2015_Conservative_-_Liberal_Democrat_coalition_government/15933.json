        "additional_details": "There are plans to charge both the NRP and RP for using the CSA to collect payments.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is an on-going charge of between 7% and 12% on any maintenance paid to parents who rely on CSA to collect their child maintenance, as well as an extra 15-20% charge added to the non-resident parent\u2019s payment.\r\n\r\nSo for every \u00a31 currently collected the NRP would pay between \u00a31.15 and \u00a31.20 instead and the RP would be paid 93 pence.\r\n\r\nThe difference being pocketed by the Government.\r\n\r\nThis is unfair - many RPs need every penny of child maintenance in these difficult times, and also to expect the NRP to pay up to 20% more in equally unfair.\r\n\r\nWe would like these charges to be prevented and 100% of the NRP payment forwarded to the RP.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull details on http://www.gingerbread.org.uk/content.aspx?CategoryID=574",
