        "additional_details": "Weekly bin colections are no longer a right now that we have recycle bins. Weekly bin collection of general household waste only benefits those that choose not to recycle and costs money whilst our young men who lay their lives on the line in Afghanistan/Iraq have had their bonuses - if they survive their tour(s) - cut by 50% to as little as \u00a32500 for a 7 month tour. Shame on you Mr. Pickles. This petition calls for the re-instatement of fortnightly bin collections of general waste, the provision of recycle bins for fortnightly recycle bin collection for all households and the re-instatement of adequate bonuses for our war veterans via the use of  the savings made by adopting/exercising this petition.
