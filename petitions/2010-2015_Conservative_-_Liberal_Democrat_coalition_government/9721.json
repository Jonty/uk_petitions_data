A British Variant of the European Union is what such a Union would represent, and central to which would be a Parliament for the British that includes all the Irish and in which, in matters of interest and concern to the people of the British Isles as a whole, the judgement of the English would have no greater force or validity than that of the Irish, the Scots or the Welsh. As in the case of Strasbourg in the European Union such a Parliament for the British would be located not in a city that is already the Capital City of one of them but in one that is not. In such a Union of the British the Lower Chamber of the present Parliament for the British would revert to being simply the Parliament of the English. It would be for those matters agreed by English, Irish, Scots and Welsh alike to be of an English provenance only. The Upper Chamber would be abolished.    ",
