        "additional_details": "The government has once again announced its plans to reform the feed-in tariff incentives scheme for solar PV installations in the UK.\r\n\r\nMinisters have set out proposals that could see incentives for solar PV installations with less than 4kW of capacity cut by 35% to 13.6p/kWh. At this level a significant contraction is imminent and will ultimately squash what was once a huge growth sector.\r\n\r\nThe new proposals will be open for consultation until April 3, the government is proposing cuts to incentives for standard installations depending on the rate of installation between now and then.\r\n\r\nThis is once again an unacceptable compromise from the UK government that will see 1,000's of jobs vast numbers of SME's disappearing.\r\n\r\nThis must not be allowed to happen.",
