This should not be allowed.  Anything released in the UK should be in British English or have British English as the default option.  There are obvious exceptions, such as American media productions imported to Britain where the spellings will predictably be seen in filmed shots.\r\nThis is becoming a serious problem, and should be halted immediately.",
