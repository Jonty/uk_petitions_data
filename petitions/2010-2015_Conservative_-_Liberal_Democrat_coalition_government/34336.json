        "additional_details": "The Yanomani people have lived in the Amazon rainforest since the Stone Age.  Their way of life is being threatened by deforestation and the poisoning of their water by mercury.  The cause of this damage is gold mining.  I urge the Government to promote an international agreement backed by a United Nations resolution which would put a stop to all further mining and preserve the rainforests before any more damage is done.  We in the UK need the rainforest just as much as the Yanomani people do.",
