        "additional_details": "Alzheimer's and dementia are debilitating illnesses which destroy families and rob sufferers of their dignity.  A 2008 report by the health think tank The King's Fund, projected how the financial cost of dementia in England would rise in coming years. The King's Fund found that the cost in England would rise from \u00a314.8 billion in 2007 to \u00a334.8 billion in 2026, a rise of 135 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Alzheimer's Society records that there are around 800,000 people in the UK with dementia. One in three people over 65 will develop dementia.  Those suffering require long term care and support.\r\n\r\nThe best way to manage these costs is to invest in finding a cure or treatments to manage dementia, and solutions which allow people to remain in their homes and live with dignity.\r\n\r\nFurther investment is needed by the government now to improve people's lives and save long term costs.\r\n\r\n",
