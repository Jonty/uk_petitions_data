        "additional_details": "The Home Office should issue clear guidelines to courts handling asylum cases of those seeking asylum on the basis of their sexual orientation. Whilst the UK must protect LGBT people from the threat of torture, imprisonment or execution in their home country, decisions on whether someone is LGBT is left to the discretion of judges, who may rely on prejudices and stereotypes. Clear guidelines by the Home Office, like those existing in other countries, would lessen the possibility LGBT people being sent home to face persecution.",
