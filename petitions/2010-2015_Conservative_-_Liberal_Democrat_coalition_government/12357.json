My wife, and I suspect many mothers are, are unable to produce enough breast milk to satisfy baby's needs.\r\n\r\nAs such, I find it awful that we should fork out \u00a38 for a box of infant formula to keep our young alive.\r\n\r\nThe baby would most like starve to death without this fomula milk.\r\n\r\nThat is why I have setup this e-peition, to make infant formula available on prescription.\r\n\r\n(I would suggest a full assessment be made to each case to verify that the mother cannot produce enough milk for their child - rather than those who cannot be bothered)",
