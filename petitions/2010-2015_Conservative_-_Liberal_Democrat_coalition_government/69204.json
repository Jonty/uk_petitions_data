This was back when Bognor was a lot smaller in population.\r\n\r\nWe are fully aware that Bognor seems to lack the improvements which happen in Littlehampton.\r\n\r\nHow can decisions be made in Littlehampton when they do not necessarily know fully about our town's needs?\r\n\r\nIt would be good if the residents of Bognor were allowed to vote on this. If Bognor could break away from Arun District Council it would provide Bognor the opportunity to decide what happens with the income provided by large businesses within this area. ",
