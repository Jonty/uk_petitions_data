        "additional_details": "Convicted criminals should serve the maximum term of imprisonment for their respective crimes. A huge proportion of crime is committed by repeat offenders. They often commit further crimes whilst on license. Releasing offenders early puts the public at risk and lowers public confidence in the justice system.\r\n\r\nIt's a false economy releasing prisoners early as crime increases, draining money and resources investigating and prosecuting offences that need not have occurred in the first place.\r\nGuilty pleas after a trial date is set or on the day of trial should be stopped as often defendants wait  to see whether the victim or witnesses will turn up. This wastes lots of money and resources across the justice system and causes distress to victims and witnesses. All this to allow an offender a reduction on an already reduced sentence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
