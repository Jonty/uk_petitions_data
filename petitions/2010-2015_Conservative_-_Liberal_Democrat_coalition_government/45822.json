        "additional_details": "This e-petition highlights the discrimination faced by Self Employed people wishing to adopt children.\r\nAs an `employee' it has been recognised that there is an entitlement to Statutory Adoption Pay, as there is for Statutory Maternity Pay.  For Self Employed people there is Maternity Allowance. Therefore it should follow that a Self Employed person adopting should be entitled to Adoption Allowance \u2013 however this is not the case \u2013 there is no allowance! With a renewed focus on addressing the shortage of adoptive parents the lack of financial support is staggering.  This means that some Self Employed People are unable to adopt.\r\nI wish the Government to introduce an Adoption Allowance comparable with Maternity Allowance for Self Employed people. This cost would be a fraction of that required to provide foster care for a child, and in view of the fact that numbers of Self Employed people are rising, would increase the amount of people able to adopt.\r\n",
