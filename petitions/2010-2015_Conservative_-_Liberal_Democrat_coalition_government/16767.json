This means that responsible drivers are being forced off the road, and valuable police and court time and resources chasing and prosecuting offenders with no insurance.\r\n\r\nI would recommend instead that all vehicles automatically have third party only insurance with the option to vehicle owners whether to buy a more comprehensive insurance from ordinary insurance companies.\r\n\r\nThe cost to goverment for providing this third party insurance only cover to all vehicles will be practically nil, and added to the anual Road-Tax, with increased premium rates for repeat offenders.\r\n\r\nThis will mean that your vehicle will be automatically covered when taxed, and no vehicles are ever driven without insurance and third parties that are involved in accidents are always covered.\r\n\r\nThis will also limit the possibility of fraud.",
