        "additional_details": "The  Government to commission the Portsmouth Shipyard to construct a number of  \u2018disaster relief vessels\u2019. These could be adaptations of existing vessel designs ( i.e. HMS Bulwark) of sufficiently size and construction to accommodate \u2018First Aid\u2019 personnel, life-saving supplies and relief equipment, heavy lift helicopters, hospital facilities, engineering plant & machinery and construction equipment, etc.\r\nResponsibility for their operational command and active deployment would be given over to the United Nations,\r\nThe vessels would be incapable of being used in a combat role.\r\nOther G20 Countries would be invited to contribute to their fitting out and commissioning: Particularly in respect of  providing heavy lifting  helicopters.\r\nThese proposals would give the Country a sense of civic pride, and help retain the existing skilled workforce in Portsmouth whilst assisting those less fortunate people in the world which do not enjoy our humanitarian security and lifestyle benefits.",
