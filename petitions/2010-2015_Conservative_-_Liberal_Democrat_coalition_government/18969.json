        "additional_details": "Current crippling tax's for businesses, including very high premises and corporation taxation, along with little or no support for new enterprises looking to commence manufacturing within the United Kingdom we are becoming less and less attractive as a supplier of UK made goods. This is due to the high overheads generating overpriced goods. The result of this is that lack of UK manufacturing is contributing to our failing economy spiralling downwards with no hope of a quick fix unless a wholesale change in government business support is made.\r\n\r\nMy proposal, to help balance the UK economy and reduce unemployment, is a simple one. Set up a tiered business taxation system for premises and corporate tax's based directly upon profit. In addition the employers\u2019 national insurance contributions require further reduction by providing a number of tax free employees. These measures will provide opportunity for small to medium enterprise businesses looking to grow their manufacturing operations.",
