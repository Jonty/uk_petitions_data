        "additional_details": "Bingo used to be a fair game where everyone who played bought six tickets and had the same chance of winning. Now you can purchase over 100 tickets via machine that gives book players an unfair advantage. These machines win constantly inspiring more people to buy them with the mentality of \"If you can't beat them join them\". In these days of economic gloom they have people chasing money ,.paying over \u00a380 for a night out. This greed needs stamping out and a fair game of bingo reinstated. ",
