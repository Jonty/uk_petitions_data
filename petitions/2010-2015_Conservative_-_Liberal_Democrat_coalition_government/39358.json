Variable interest rates without any Government guarantee that energy savings will outweigh hikes in (high street) interest rates that could become unaffordable.\r\n2. Strategic planning for a given property is likely to be cursory, because the EPC process has to be inexpensive: homeowners are not experienced in planning for the 25 year term and measures may not keep pace with UKG policies and regulation.\r\n3. As has been seen in the financial sector, there is a risk of unfair contracts: a model UKG contract is needed so that the whole property is not forfeited because of default on some inseparable improvement to it.
