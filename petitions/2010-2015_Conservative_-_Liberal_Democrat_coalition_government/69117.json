        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, object to the planning application 14/02093/OUT to develop 14 houses on the site of 4, The Green, Cranswick YO25 9QU on the following grounds.\r\n\r\nThe proposed development intends to build a housing estate with access out on to the Village Green. This proposal will turn this commonly used path into a road with over 30 additional cars using it every single day.\r\n\r\nThe path is actually part of the Village Green and it is there for the enjoyment of everyone. Turning it into a road will increase the danger and traffic. This will reduce the enjoyment as it will become a danger to pedestrians, children on bikes and scooters, carers with pushchairs and the elderly.\r\n\r\nThis development is unnecessary as the Regional Development plan for Hutton Cranswick has already identified alternative suitable areas for new housing that will meet the village\u2019s needs by 2028.\r\nWe want the Government to decline this planning application and prevent building on this site.\r\n",
