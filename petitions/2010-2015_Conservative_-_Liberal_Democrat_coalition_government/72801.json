It is the Tenant who pays for this service and they should be treated as the customer: The decision maker.\r\n\r\nLandlords and Letting Agencies are the Supplier and Service Provider respectively and therefore should answer to the tenant; competing within the market to provide them with a quality service.\r\n\r\nI propose a simple bill which would allow the Tenant free choice over which letting agent is used, from the point of agreeing the terms of contract, including fees and rent charges.\r\n\r\nThis change would allow free competition within the market among agencies and create more natural fluctuations in fees and rent.  It would also dissolve the stigma attached to tenants; increasing their status to that of 'The Client' who is in receipt of an expensive service.",
