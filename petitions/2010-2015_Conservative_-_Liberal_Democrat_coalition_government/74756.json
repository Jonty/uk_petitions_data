        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, ask the Department of Health to ensure that EVERY woman in the UK is given effective treatment whilst suffering with HG.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests HG affects 3% of pregnancies. However, this is a misconception, the true figure could be much higher as the condition is widely mis-diagnosed. This often leads to women aborting wanted babies, either on the basis of misplaced medical advice or due to the inability of women to cope with the physical torture that come from HG when it is dismissed as \u2018 morning sickness' by many. 30% of all hospital admissions under 20 weeks are for HG yet actual diagnosis figures do not reflect this.\r\n\r\nAll women should have accurate information and assessment for HG when hospitalised for to vomiting in pregnancy. A full care plan with the correct treatment is provided to prevent women having to fight for the treatment they need.\r\n\r\nAll medical staff should undergo training on HG to understand its risks, treatment and the mental effects.",
