Today it was witnessed that a fall of 50% in one share (QPP) occurred on what was nothing more than nonsense lies spread by a US \"company\". This is blatant manipulation when over 1 billion \u00a3 can be wiped off a market price when less than 70 million in traded value. This fraud and manipulation of the share price MM's and others occurs FAR to often to \"show\" one price when it trades at others etc. This has to be investigated and it HAS TO STOP,",
