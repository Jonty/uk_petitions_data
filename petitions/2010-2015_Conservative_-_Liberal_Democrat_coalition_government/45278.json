The debt our country has.\r\n2. The people that will use HS2 due to high cost compared to a regular train.\r\n3. How many people will use HS2 in the country compared to how many wont.\r\n4. That it will likely be outdated by time it's built.\r\n5. How many people will need rehousing.\r\n6. Why they can't build it along side the tracks already in place for regular trains.",
