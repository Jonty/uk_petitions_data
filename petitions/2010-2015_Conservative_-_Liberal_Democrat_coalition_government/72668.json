        "additional_details": "The situation in Hong Kong with growing uproar among Hong Kong people against the rule of China shows that China is ignoring the Joint Declaration signed by Britain and China.\r\nIf China continues to ignore this then the UK Government must step in. In order to do this then the Government must ask the population of Hong Kong if they wish to go back to British sovereignty. If so, then the Government must intervene: to protect the civilians in Hong Kong against the unfair treatment given to them by Chinese authorities; to promote democracy in Hong Kong which suits Hong Kong people and to maintain democratic free elections that are not manipulated by Beijing.
