Presently many are already reacting to potentially life threatening medical emergencies in their day to day lives, often feeling afraid and unable to offer appropriate medical treatment, without the knowledge to deal with these situations. By accessing this course they would be equipped to have the skills and confidence to assess, identify, manage and treat their loved ones appropriately therefore increasing the chances of a full recovery.
