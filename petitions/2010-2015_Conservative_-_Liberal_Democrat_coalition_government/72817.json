        "additional_details": "With the proliferation of \"ciders\" perporting to be artisan, craft or real the government should create a legal definition of \"craft cider\" stating that the unconcentrated apple (or pear where applicable) should be a minimum of 85% with minimal additives. This will allow real cider enthusiasts to ensure that the product they are drinking is a genuine craft cider. It will also enable small craft cider producers to differentiate their products from other mass produced \"ciders\" with a much lower apple content or a high percentage of concentrate.",
