        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, believe that The Minister for Sport Helen Grant MP. is unfit for government due to her outspoken views on the non-celebration of the centenary of WWI\r\n\r\nMany Ex Service men and women deplore her statement in the Daily Telegraph in which  stated \"There will be NO celebration\" and are angered by it. Therefor we demand her resignation from her Ministerial position and that any activities or events etc.. that the Government are considering be given to someone else who appreciates the fallen of our armed forces to plan and implement.",
