Those who turn 18 are discharged from the service with no indication of where to go next. However, it\u2019s not just teenagers at a loss, people of various ages also struggle to seek help from a mental health service due to lack of information and accessibility of a mental health service.\r\nIt is time more help and information becomes available to those who need it urgently. There also needs to be more information provided to those leaving a child and adolescent service in order for them to be prepared when discharged.\r\nMany people die from mental health conditions each year and I strongly believe hospitals and doctors need to provide a more accessible service along with more information to help provide a better understanding of who is there to help and how they can keep themselves safe in the meantime.\r\nPlease help support this case. I strongly believe it could save a life.",
