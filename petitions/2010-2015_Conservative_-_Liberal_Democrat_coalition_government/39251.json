There is no Rhyme or reason for insurance to be this high. There than making huge amounts of profit for the insurance companies. We the general public are held to ransom every year with our renewal notice and we are forced to pay through the nose for a service that is extremely unfair. To quote insurance for new driver in a Vauxhall Corsa  \u00a32500, for a car that cost \u00a3145. No doubt you have similar stories now\u2019s the time to speak out WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF BEING TAKEN FOR A RIDE\r\n",
