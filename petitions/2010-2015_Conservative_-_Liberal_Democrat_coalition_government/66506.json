        "additional_details": "C4 decided to air a programme called going to the dogs even after there was a petition of thousands of signatures trying to prevent the programme from being aired.  The programme showed the barbaric underworld of dog fighting.  The documentary makers have been asked by the RSPCA to hand over the footage and evidence from the programme to themselves and the police but haven't.  I would like to see the documentary makers forced to handover any evidence they may have to try and secure a prosecution towards these dog handlers.  They are still at large, this is illegal, disgusting and must be stopped, tougher jail sentences & fines imposed to set an example to all.",
