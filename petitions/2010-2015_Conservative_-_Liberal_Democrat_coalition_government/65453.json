        "additional_details": "We ask the government to end the planned renewal of the Trident nuclear submarines. We would like the UK to go through with nuclear disarmament in the interest of all life on Earth. Please use the funds in a better way like investing/ researching into clean energies or other progressive ideas. Having a nuclear 'deterrent' is very unlikely to save lives whereas having a planet to live on will be very important to our children.",
