        "additional_details": "For reasons outlined below, the government should greatly extend & expand the canal system, build \"diverted flood\" reservoirs & construct a pumped North/South water pipeline for flood overflow & water redistribution.As a nationwide initiative, it must use a nationwide labour force, i.e. the unemployed & the prison population. UK weather patterns are increasingly unpredictable and floods regularly cause damage to homes, property & agriculture costing many millions of pounds, increasing the cost of insurance & food & thereby inflation. Most goods are transported by road or rail . There is also a North/South divide in terms of rainfall. More canals must be built to transport non-time-critical goods - reducing road/rail miles travelled & thereby CO2 emissions - & to receive input from local flood drains. Reservoirs must be built around every town to provide more storage & linked to rivers to allow flood water to be diverted. The nation needs a good idea to support. ",
