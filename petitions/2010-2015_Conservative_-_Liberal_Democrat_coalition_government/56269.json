None of the 60 or so killed there were treated with any respect so when an Islamist is captured they should also be put down on the spot.  These Marines did nothing wrong, but what they did do is demonstrate they have the balls our dishonourables are so blatantly lacking. Not since before the Second World War have we seen politicians sucking up so much to those who would destroy us.  SHAME ON YOU DISHONOURABLES.",
