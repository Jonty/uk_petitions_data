        "additional_details": "The Treasury recently introduced the Employment Allowance to support small employers, allowing them to reduce their Employers' National Insurance bill by up to \u00a32000 per year. This was not extended to domestic employers.\r\n\r\nWe are calling on the Treasury to extend the Employment Allowance to all domestic employers.\r\n\r\nDomestic employers, including working parents employing a nanny and people receiving disability benefits employing PAs and carers, are subject to the same employment laws as commercial employers but are excluded from the new scheme.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned strongly believe that domestic employers should be granted the same support as other employers.\r\n",
