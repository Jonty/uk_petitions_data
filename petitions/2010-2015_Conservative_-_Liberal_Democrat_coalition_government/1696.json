        "additional_details": "We should opt out of the Human Rights Act and bring in our own law. Or alternatively, call for changes in the Act which strip criminals of the human rights being used to escape appropriate punishment for crimes which have disregarded the human rights of others. The law is abused; does not protect victims of crime or allow justice to be brought; it also prevents this country from protecting its citizens from terrorists we want to deport. Crime might reduce if criminals could not call upon these rights to protect themselves when found guilty. If you disregard rights of others, you should expect to lose your own. Prison/ punishment should be harsh and not filled with luxuries. We are a soft target and we need to get tough.",
