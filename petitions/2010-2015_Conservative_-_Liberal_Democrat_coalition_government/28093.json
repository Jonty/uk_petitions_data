        "additional_details": "The action the British Government needs to take is to pressure Ethiopia and Kenya into granting indepedence for the Somali regions under their control. This will serve British interests,  reduce poverty, combat extremism and end human rights abuses committed by Ethiopia and Kenya.\r\n\r\nThis will benefit both the Somali people and Britain in a number of ways. Firstly, it will serve to improve the relationship between the Somalis and Britain.\r\nSecondly, British companies will gain preferential access to exploit the vast petrochemical wealth of these regions.\r\nThirdly, it will greatly reduce the threat of extremist groups such as Al-Shabaab and other violent groups from recruiting poor youngsters.\r\nFourthly, it will help to resolve the conflict in Southern Somalia as the two Somali states created can absorb refugees from Somalia and can use their resources to create peace in Somalia.\r\n",
