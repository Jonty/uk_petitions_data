        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to look into committing to the future extension of Crossrail to Gravesend. This part of Kent suffers from slow, unreliable train services and deserves the investment after years of suffering a second rate service. There is huge potential in the Thames Gateway for regeneration which won't be realised without this boost to the regional economy. Stopping Crossrail at Abbey Wood leaves some of the South's poorest towns cut off.",
