        "additional_details": "There have been recent suggestions in the press that the government is potentially planning to freeze or reduce the national minimum wage for those over the age of 21. The lowest earners in society should not be made to take a real terms pay cut like this. It would also be an economically wrong-headed approach as those on the lowest wages are most likely to spend them thus helping to boost growth.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the government to rule out such a move and to protect those on the lowest wages from real-terms cuts.",
