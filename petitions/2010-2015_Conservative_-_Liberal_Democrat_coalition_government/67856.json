        "additional_details": "The Fleece and other long-established music venues and theatres are increasingly under threat from noise complaints due to recent changes to Permitted Development Rights which allows offices to be converted to residential flats without planning permission.\r\n\r\nIn Bristol a developer has Prior Approval to change offices into 74 private flats next to The Fleece, a live music venue licensed until 4am. The developer has submitted plans for external alterations, with their lawyers arguing there is no legal obligation to provide noise insulation inside the flats as Prior Approval has already been granted.\r\n\r\nThis application is due to go before a Bristol City Council planning committee on 30th July. If approved it will encourage developers to save money by converting offices to flats without sound insulation near venues and theatres throughout the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government to intervene in the application threatening The Fleece.",
