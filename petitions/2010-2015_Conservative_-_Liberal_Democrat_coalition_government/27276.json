Many women are told they will probably feel sad for a few days and are unprepared for the overwhelming guilt and sadness they feel, sometimes for the rest of their lives. All clinics should ensure women are assessed, if they are happy to be, before an abortion to ensure this is the right choice for them, flag up any women who would be likely to suffer from PASS and that they are made aware of the potential for PASS. Please log onto http://postabortionstressawareness.co.uk for more information on PASS.",
