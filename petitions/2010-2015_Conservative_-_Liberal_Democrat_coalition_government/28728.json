They should be restricions aganst them going any where neer children under the age of 18 i.e parks, cinemas, swimming baths, living near schools, fair grounds and youth centres. If these criminals take away the childs human rights then that means they lose theres. We want harsher punishments for these criminals if caught doing anything that is against children i.e rape, abuses, pictures, films and downloading images of children under 18. We shouldnt be protecting these criminals rather protecting the inocent children who can not protect themselfs.  ",
