But the Shrewsbury Town Centre Residents Association are always trying to stop developments in the town centre that will improve the social and cultural scene.\r\nThe citizens of Shrewsbury have had enough of their continuous meddling into town centre improvements, and this is a general petition for people of Shrewsbury and Shropshire to sign to show that the greater public of the town and area do not welcome their input.\r\nIf you want Shrewsbury to improve and become a more modern and social town then please sign this petition.",
