This has been a Pilot Scheme run by Pennine Care in Bury Lancashire to Cover the North West. Hopefully this will be  Rolled  Out Nationwide.   Funding should come from Central Government or the M.O.D.  Because   In April 2013,  G.Ps. will be responsible for their own Budgets.   And funding for this Excellent  NHS Service may suffer.    Please support our Ex Service Personel   Some who Suffer in Silence,,",
