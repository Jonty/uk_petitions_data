        "additional_details": "Today government announced that the Feed in Tariff for electricity is to be changed three months earlier than previous planned!\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Energy Minister  said urgent action was needed to protect the wider Feed-in Tariff scheme (FiTs) and the raft of measures would help the solar industry avoid a boom and bust market.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuch actions will do nothing to sustain the current, expanding, solar panel industry.\r\n\r\nIs not the whole point of government policy in this area to increase our non-carbon electricity generation as quickly as possible?\r\n\r\nPV's have only come down by 30% so why is government cutting payments by 50%?\r\n\r\nThe motion is that the house should restore the date for Feed in Tariff changes to the end of March 2012 at which point any future reductions in FIT should be directly linked to the reduction in purchase and installation costs of PV,s.\r\n",
