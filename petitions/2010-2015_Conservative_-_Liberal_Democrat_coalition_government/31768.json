        "additional_details": "The news of the \u00a33.5bn raid on income tax breaks for the over-65s will leave people retiring next year an average of \u00a3259 a year worse off in what campaigners for the elderly condemned as an \"outrageous assault on pensioners\".\r\n\r\nIn the single biggest tax raising move in the budget, George Osborne said he was \"simplifying\" personal tax allowances and scrapping them for anyone born after 5 April 1938. This is an outrageous attack on those who have worked and contributed to the country's finances for years and again, 'steals' more from their pockets when they need it most. Costs rise for pensioners as much as anybody but they cannot raise their earnings or do much to cut expenses without becoming more vulnerable. Stop this measure before it is implemented! ",
