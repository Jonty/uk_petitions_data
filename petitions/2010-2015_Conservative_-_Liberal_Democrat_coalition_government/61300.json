A doctor in Birmingham knows that my daughter has asthma, and that a doctor in London knows which organs I would donate, and a doctor in Cymbryn knows my son has eczema. All this so that, at all times,\r\n doctors aren't just guessing but are actually making informed decisions if I am unfortunate enough to have to visit them. Why can't the general public be helped like this? Please help us all",
