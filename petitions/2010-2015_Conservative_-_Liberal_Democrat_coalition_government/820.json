        "additional_details": "Alzheimers sufferers are treated differently to people with any other disease.  Their care is not funded by the NHS, so they have to fund it themselves (unless they have no money or assets - then local authorities have to pick up the bill).\r\n\r\nI think this is discrimination and should be outlawed in this country like all other forms of discrimination.\r\n\r\nI want the government to make this discrimination illegal so that people with Alzheimers disease are treated in the same way as all other people with an illness.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition - you or someone in your family may have this awful disease in the future, and you could lose all that you have worked for!",
