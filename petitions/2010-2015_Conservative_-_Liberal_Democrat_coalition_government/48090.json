That their sentences are seriously extended as its not acceptable in today's society for these people to get away with what they have done under current laws. THE LAWS OF TODAY NEED MODERNISED FOR THESE CRIMES!!\r\n\r\nAlso people in all areas should be legally informed when ANY SEX OFFENDER is being released/resettled into their community so as the residents are aware and as a safeguard to their families, friends and neighbours.\r\n\r\nThese people need to know the severity of their actions and be deterred by all means possible. They need to understand that their crimes will not be welcomed or accepted by normal people in Society even when they have been released from Prisons or Detention Centers.\r\nTHEY NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THEY ARE NOT WELCOME IN OUR SOCIETY.",
