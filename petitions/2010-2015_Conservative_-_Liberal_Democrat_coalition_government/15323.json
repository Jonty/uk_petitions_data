        "additional_details": "Bring forward legislation to prevent or mitigate the practice of requiring one to declare that one has \"read and understood\" lengthy, impenetrable legal agreements before purchasing an online product or service. It makes a mockery of the law and turns honest  people into liars.\r\nExample (there are countless): the Apple ITunes software, a 5,000 word, 7-page document. Many, e.g. the Adobe Flash Player agreement (also 7 pages, 5,000 words) require the user to declare that they have \"read and understood\" the agreement. No-one seriously can believe in or support this disingenuous practice, which protects companies against litigation at the expense of rendering dishonest the vast majority of their customers. ",
