        "additional_details": "Over recent years there have been attempts to reorganise Oesophago-Gastric Cancer Services across the greater Manchester area.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, UHSM (Wythenshawe) was recognised by an independent expert panel as one of those centres with recognition of its expert team.  The team and the trust embraced this decision and continued to move forward with the development of the team and the services.\r\n\r\nOver recent weeks it has become apparent that duel organisations have been trying to exclude UHSM (Wythenshawe) from future provision of this service.  I and many others vigorously oppose this move and would welcome your support in helping UHSM to continue to deliver these excellent services on the Wythenshawe site",
