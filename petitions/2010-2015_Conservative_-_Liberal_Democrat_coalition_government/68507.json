        "additional_details": "The Government is currently considering a restriction of personal allowances for tax payers living outside the UK. In many cases this will affect pensioners and others currently surviving on a low income from the UK. To take away or restrict the personal allowance will cause major hardship to many people whose sole income is from the UK. Please sign this petition and also email your comments to The Treasury here...nonresidentspersonalallowanceconsultation@hmtreasury.gsi.gov.uk",
