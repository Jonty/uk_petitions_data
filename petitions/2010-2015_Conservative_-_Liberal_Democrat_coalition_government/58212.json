        "additional_details": "A national company which provides clean, affordable energy to the population to compete with the big six. This will increase competition, prevent price-fixing and all money made should be invested back into renewable energy to continue lowering prices.\r\n\r\nThis will also lower our dependancy on the private sector and other countries. This will allow energy bills to be fair as the big six will be forced into lowering prices.",
