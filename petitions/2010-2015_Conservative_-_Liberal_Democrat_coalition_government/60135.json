        "additional_details": "The way that ATOS carries out Work Capability Assessments is wrong.  For example, when a claimant is asked to attend for a WCA, the Health Care Professional will shake the hand of the claimant.  This is one way that they test for grip.  Another grip test is that if a claimant can hold a piece of paper in both hands then their grip is fine.  Claimants are not told that their grip is being tested.  This is not the correct way to carry out grip tests.\r\n\r\nIf the Government are going to continue with WCA's, they should be more open.",
