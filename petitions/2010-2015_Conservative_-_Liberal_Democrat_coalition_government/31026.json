        "additional_details": "As a young driver who has recently passed I have noticed that, particularly in my area of inner city Birmingham, the cost of car insurance has increased substantially, doubling or tripling in some cases. Where there was a quote for \u00a32000-3000 is now in the region of \u00a36000-8000.\r\nI believe this is totally unacceptable given the price/age/engine size of the cars that are trying to be insured, and propose that an upper band on the cost of the insurance be implemented, varying with the insurance band of a given car, so that younger drivers such as my self are able to drive legally on the road without paying extortionate amounts of money.",
