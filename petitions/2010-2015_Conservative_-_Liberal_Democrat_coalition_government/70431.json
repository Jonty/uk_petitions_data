In a typical 30-min show, most channels have at least 12 minutes of adverts, which frankly makes the quality of many channels very poor indeed.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to restrict TV adverts to only one advert per break, and also restrict the maximum number of breaks per hour.\r\n\r\nIt should therefore also be mandatory for 1 slot in every hour to be reserved and donated to charities.\r\n\r\nTo implement this in full there would also need to be a restriction on the number of breaks in an hour.",
