        "additional_details": "New policy to give UK drivers a chance to comply with road speed restrictions. Thus, I would like to put forward, to gauge interest, the idea that the maximum legal speed for a particular road is displayed ALONGSIDE every single speed camera in the UK, as a reminder of what speed drivers SHOULD be driving at. Currently, very few speed cameras have reminders of what legal speed should be adhered to beside them, which means if you have forgotten on a long stretch of road, the sign will then remind you of what you SHOULD be driving at.",
