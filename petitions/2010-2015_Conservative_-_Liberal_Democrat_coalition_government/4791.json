This means the government is intentionally keeping people below the poverty line, not by a bit, but by almost half. Job Seekers allowance needs to increase to the poverty line of \u00a3124 a week for a single person, \u00a3214 per week for a couple with no children, \u00a3256 per week for lone parents and \u00a3348 per week for a couple with two children. All these amounts are the official poverty lines set by the government.",
