        "additional_details": "Shortage of housing land  is the biggest single factor fuelling Britain's record house price levels. House-builders simply cannot find enough viable sites to respond to the demand across the country. At the same time, Local Authorities allow schemes for over-sized houses that waste the precious developable land resource. I suggest that the government should appoint a Green Belt and Affordable Housing Tsar to review how we encourage reasonable housing land supply through the planning system. The housebuilding industry and Local Authorities desperately need some fine-tuning to the system  fast and some deeper reforms need to be considered by Parliament post the General Election.",
