Today's report from the National Audit Office showing a huge increase in security costs for the 2012 Games will not have taken into account policing and providing security services relating to any protests that might result from objections to the Dow Chemicals' sponsorship of the 'wrap'. Why not anticipate that problem, save the electorate additional unbudgeted costs and allow the e-petition?\r\n\r\nYour excuse that this is not a matter for LOCOG or the government is clearly not true or tenable. You cannot claim that you have not been forewarned of possibility of increas budget over-runs.",
