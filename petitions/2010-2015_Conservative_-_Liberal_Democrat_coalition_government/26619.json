        "additional_details": "The Hermit youth club is something of a gem of Brentwood providing a safe and friendly environment for young people to socialise and meet new people. The club's rich heritage has staged bands such as Motorhead and Inme along with a large number of young bands. Without the club the hundreds of young people that the hermit attracts will have nowhere else to go which will leave them with no choice but to congregate on the streets without the security of the club. Please sign this petition to show your support for the fantastic work that the Hermit does for Brentwood and for music.",
