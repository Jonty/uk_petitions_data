        "additional_details": "It is outrageous that the government has entered exclusive talks on the future of the Olympics site with Qatari Diar and Delancey and rejected the bid by the charitable Wellcome Trust.   Wellcome's \u00a31bn upfront offer would allow the public investment to be recouped immediately, and the site would become a technology park.   Qatari Diar and Delancey are merely property developers;  their offer would take twenty years or more  to benefit the public.   With a year to go to the Games, it is hard to see much other public benefit from this immense investment.   Let the damage be repaired sooner rather than later. ",
