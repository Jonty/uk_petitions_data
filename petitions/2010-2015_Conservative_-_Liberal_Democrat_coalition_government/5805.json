        "additional_details": "Animal experiments are cruel, barbaric and should have no place in a civilised society. We have no right to inflict dreadful suffering on innocent animals in an attempt to cure human diseases, test product safety etc. Animal experiments can also be scientifically misleading; animals do not react in the same way as humans and there are many other non-animal alternatives available. All animal experiments for whatever purpose should therefore be banned completely. ",
