My husband takes on the majority of my son's childcare therefore we have to rely on one wage.\r\nI truly believe that if you are a high tax payer and have a child with special needs the government should not stop your child benefit.\r\nThe benefit does what it says on the tin.. its for the child.\r\nPlease join together and get the government to change the rules.\r\nParents who have children with special needs have lots of additional requirements which brings additional costs.\r\n\r\nSign now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
