        "additional_details": "Since decimalisation the retail sellers of fuel have been allowed to sell in tenths of a penny. The rationale for this was originally intended to enable a better means of tracking world oil price fluctuations.\r\nFuel is the only product that can be sold at a unit price that cannot actually be paid and the now ubiquitous and cynical addition of 0.9p to every litre of fuel is not done for any valid reason other than the opportunity to fleece the consumer whilst playing on the psychology of showing a lower price.\r\nPetrol and diesel, like beer, should only be sold at a legal whole pence price and the right of any retail fuel seller to add any part of a penny should be removed.",
