        "additional_details": "A website that uses a .co.uk domain name is created specifically to target a UK-based audience. Indeed, many multinational companies will operate a .co.uk website because research has shown that consumers in the UK are more likely to do business with a .co.uk website.\r\n\r\nMany of the .co.uk websites operated by multinational companies however, have a data controller that is based outside of the UK. Amazon.co.uk for example has a data controller that is based in the EU. As such, the company has no obligation to comply fully with the statutory rights afforded all UK individuals by the Data Protection Act 1998. Our right to ask a UK-based data controller to stop sending us marketing  (section 11) for example; a practice that is despised by many.\r\n\r\nMy petition therefore, is calling for a change to the law that requires any organisation operating a .co.uk website to operate that website as a UK-based data controller.",
