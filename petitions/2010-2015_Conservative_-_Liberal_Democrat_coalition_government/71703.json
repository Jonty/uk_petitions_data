        "additional_details": "As a student I find it extremely difficult to get from my home to school and then back again. And where I live, an outlying village between two large towns, it seems absurd that there are no bus routes connecting these villages to the towns. Currently I rely on the good grace of my parents, friends and neighbours to transport me to and from school. I know of many other people who are in a similar situation, and not just students, there are people who are less abled or are unable to drive.\r\n\r\nAlternatives include taking a taxi, which is in excess avergae of fifteen pounds. Or walking and cycling which carries a high risk of being involved in a collision.\r\n\r\nPlease consider our points and sign our petition, thank you for reading. ",
