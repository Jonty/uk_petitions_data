I am, however, concerned that it is not afforded the respect and recognition it deserves.\r\n\r\nA change in name will not only celebrate but serve to encourage the GREAT behaviour that we expect during the Easter weekend.\r\n\r\nI call on the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to support this. Your mission is to \"support the pursuit of excellence\" - this is my mission also. It is time we stepped up our game.\r\n\r\nGREAT Friday. ",
