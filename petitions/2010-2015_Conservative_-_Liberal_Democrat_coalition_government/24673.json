        "additional_details": "The government should include a category on all ballot papers for \"none of the above\" so that people who  vote have an opportunity to express a preference for none of the options listed. This will give the majority who do not currently vote an opportunity to engage in the voting system and to express an opinion that none of the options put forward are worthy of their vote.  Of course if \"none of the above\" is the majority vote, then NO candidate will win and no representation will be given, in accord with the majority wishes.  This will encourage candidates to seek to meet the majority wishes of those eligible to vote, and not just the majority of those who actually vote, on the assumption that the majority of voters dont actually want any of the candidates put forward to actually represent them.",
