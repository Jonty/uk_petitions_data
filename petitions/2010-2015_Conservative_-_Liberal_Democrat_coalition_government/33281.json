The first key finding of the Commission is:\r\n\u201cThe current adult social care funding system in England is not fit for purpose and needs urgent reform.\u201d\r\nThe same finding was reported by the Sutherland Royal Commission 13 years ago in 1999. Yet nothing has been done. The Government will publish a White Paper on Adult Social Care reform but only a \u201cprogress report\u201d on funding. This will delay a decision on funding until after the next General Election. Meanwhile tens of thousands of people will be impoverished just because they become ill. The National Federation of Occupational Pensioners says this is unacceptable. We urge the Government to address the elephant in the room \u2013 funding of social care \u2013 and bring forward proposals so that reform of the funding system can be operative before the end of this Parliament. Doing nothing is NOT an option!\r\n",
