A person dealing with severe brain injury, relies on a postcode lottery to decide if they are allowed funding for treatment physiotherapy and essential equipment, Families have very minimal support, either practically or financially. I want the government to provide care and funding for rehibilation for ALL brain injury patients, and more long term support put in place for the families that are full time carers to their loved ones. prevent funding cuts to organisations such as Headway.
