        "additional_details": "The proliferation of unhealthy fast food outlets is blighting the High Street, contributing to the obesity epidemic and costing the NHS & local Councils billions of \u00a3's. A doubling of the cost of takeaway food will have at least 6 benefits;  1. The Tax revenue could be used to subsidise the NHS to tackle the obesity crisis, 2. The increased cost of fatty, salty food would encourage more home-cooked healthy meals, 3. The reduction in obesity will save the NHS billions, 4. The streets would be cleaner from the diminished discarded packaging, 5. Our High Streets can return to conventional shops, 6. Home-produced meals will encourage traditional meal times and family occasions, fostering more social cohesion and behaviour. We call upon the Government to impose a punitive Tax on takeaway and fast food.",
