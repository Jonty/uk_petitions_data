        "additional_details": "This petition is to make foie gras illegal in the UK , in terms of serving in restaurants as well importing from abroad . Below you can read how foie greas is produced and what  how the animal is tortured\r\n\r\n How it is achieved -at just a few months old, ducks are confined inside dark sheds and force-fed enormous amounts of food several times a day. A farm worker grabs each duck and, one by one, thrusts a metal pipe down their throats so that a mixture of corn can be forced directly into their gullets. In just a matter of weeks, the ducks become grossly overweight and their livers expand up to 10 times their normal size.\r\nAbout 10 percent of the ducks don't make it to slaughter . They die when their stomachs burst. To a veterinarian, the ensuing human-induced disorder is called \"hepatic lipidosis.\" To a gourmet chef, these fattened, diseased livers are called \"foie gras.\" Foie gras is a disease !\r\n\r\n",
