        "additional_details": "Many men were shot for refusing to fight and kill during the First World War because their conscience's would not allow them to do so. Their bravery should be recognised in the same way as the bravery of those who did fight in appalling conditions is recognised. We ask for a monument to be built to them in Whitehall close to the Cenotaph. Both sets of men displayed great bravery dying in appalling conditions because of the crass stupidity of the Generals who remained comfortably in French Chateaux. ",
