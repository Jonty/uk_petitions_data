        "additional_details": "Our streets and open spaces are littered with numerous empty plastic and glass bottles. A way of reducing such an unsightly mess would be for the government to introduce a refundable tax on the bottles at the point of purchase. On return of the bottle to the point of purchase the tax would be refunded in full, most likely in the form of a coupon for further purchases.\r\nThis method currently works successfully in many European supermarkets and as a result their streets are considerably less littered than those in England and Wales.\r\nI would be grateful if you could sign my petition in order that this initiative can be brought about as soon as possible\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPaul Sales\r\n\r\n",
