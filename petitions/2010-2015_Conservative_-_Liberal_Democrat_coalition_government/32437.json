I have no objections if it was exculusilvy for terror suspects however this is for the general public.\r\n\r\nI wish the Goverment to review this planed course of action as it infringes upon our Human Rights and privicy. This power can be abused by the monitors for illegal uses and has echo's of the events with the novel \"1984\".",
