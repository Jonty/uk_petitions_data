        "additional_details": "Render safe or remove the wreck of the liberty ship, SS Richard Montgomery, lying off the coast of Sheerness in Kent, England. The ship sank during World War II. It still contains 1400 tons of high explosive munitions which are liable to detonate without warning. Such an explosion would be catastrophic for people in Sheerness and Southend-on-Sea and environmentally disastrous when the oil storage facilities on the Isle of Grain are washed away in the ensuing tsunami. The wreck also may contain mustard gas or other chemical agents the existence of which cannot be confirmed or denied under a freedom of information enquiry.\r\nMore detailed up to date information may be obtained at:\r\nhttp://www.ssrichardmontgomery.com The Richard montgomery matter",
