        "additional_details": "This petition has come from the Retired Members of UNISON, but you don't have to be a trade unionist to sign it. It affects everyone and is non-political. The law regarding elderly vulnerable people needs changing for you, and for your family:-\r\n\u2022\tDue to mental/physical incapacity many older people are as vulnerable as a baby. There would be public outcry if politicians opposed legislation for care of children as hard as they oppose legislation for care for the elderly.\r\n\u2022\tThere are specific laws protecting children, animals and domestic violence, but only regular laws to protect the Elderly\r\n\u2022\tWe are calling for the introduction of Elderly Abuse Protection Legislation as a matter of urgency.\r\n\u2022\tAs with child abuse, and racial or homophobic hate crimes, incidents of neglect and ill treatment that specifically targets an older person should be a specific criminal offence with additional penalties.\r\nJOIN OUR CAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n",
