Recent cases include an elderly couple being knocked over and injured on the pavement by a mobility scooter and a child being dragged along by one. Parents will happily let their child ride a bike in the street then deny any responsibility when the child damages someone's car.  It would also be a good idea to have compulsory training before children are allowed to ride a bicycle on the public road. While a parent will happily say \"go out and play on you bike\", when their child rides under the wheels of a car or truck, they will blame anyone or everything but themselves.  I doubt many would say \"go out and play with the traffic\"    ",
