        "additional_details": "It is time the Government investigated just what help and support is given to vulnerable adults within the community by the very agencies that are set up to help them and protect them from harm.\r\nToo often they are simply left to their own devices with inadequate housing, care and support.\r\nWe cannot, and should not,allow this to continue,in too many cases this has resulted in devastating effects, ALL of which could have been avoided.\r\nThe agencies tell us they are doing everything they can and bleat on about government cuts. Well its time for someone to stick their head above the parapet and SPEAK OUT.\r\nWe would like to present some case studies, along with this petition, to the government minister responsible for Social Care and for them to accept that the case scenarios are unacceptable and in some cases amount to Abuse and severe Negligence.\r\nThese people are failed in education, only to go on to be failed once again by the very people charged with keeping them safe.",
