        "additional_details": "Overhaul the rules relating to operation of Taxi's.\r\nWhy. In Singapore, the welfare state is much smaller than the uk. The government encourages all citizens who have lost jobs to work as taxi drivers. Taxi drivers rent their taxis from taxi operators and there are no limits on the number of drivers.\r\nThe effect is that there is vastly lower unemployment; welfare costs are vastly lower and for those working as taxi drivers there is a sense of pride that comes from being employed.",
