        "additional_details": "It is time for the Government to change the polling day from a Thursday to a weekend. The media often say that \"people aren't engaged in politics\" buy moving polling day to the weekend and looking at other places to vote. Supermarkets etc. People will have a chance to engage with voting, to have time to vote. Voting on a Thursday is a barrier to participation to the electorate and is anachronistic. ",
