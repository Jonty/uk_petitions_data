        "additional_details": "The new laws regarding motorcycle restrictions are quite ridiculous and also very dangerous for motorway commuters.\r\n\r\nMotorcycles are a cheap way for the youth to get to work, college and university. With car insurance at ridiculously high rates, public transport costs increasing and these ludicrous motorcycle restrictions it's as if the government is trying to make a youngsters life harder.\r\n\r\nThere are no restrictions for cars. At age 17 I could pass my test with no mandatory training at all and hop straight into an 8 litre supercharged car producing 900 horse power. Yet I am limited to a restricted 125cc motorcycle after completing CBT, theory test, module 1 test and module 2 test. It's also very expensive for young people, with tests costing around \u00a3150 each, without training.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for the government to change the laws to which they previously were, at age 17 once you have completed your CBT you may apply for your A license and complete the necessary tests.
