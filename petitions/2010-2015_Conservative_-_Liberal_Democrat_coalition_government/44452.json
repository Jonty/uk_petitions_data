To say that we cannot put up a petition which asks for those taxpayer funded employees who commit criminal acts, to be responsible for payment (personally) of any monetary compensation to their victims is tantamount to telling those taxpayer funded criminals - 'PRESS ON GUYS, YOU ARE FULLY PROTECTED AGAIINST ANY PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR CRIMINALS ACTS AND YOU WILL NEVER BE ASKED TO PAY UP - THE TAXPAYER HAS GOT IT COVERED AND THEY CAN'T COMPLAIN'",
