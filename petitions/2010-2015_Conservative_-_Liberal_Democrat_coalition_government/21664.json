Yet looking on the state of our roads, is it all getting spent on the upkeep of our roads, as it is supposed to be, or is it just another tax to go into the Treasury's coffers? The state of our nations roads is a shambles, and I want ALL of the \u00a3130 a year road tax I pay to be used to repair them, not only \u00a320 or \u00a330 of it. If you're fed up of paying money for nothing, please sign my petition.",
