        "additional_details": "I ask the government to require Network Rail to provide an adequate noise barrier between their new high speed line and the riding arena at Wendlebury Gate Stables.\r\n\r\nIf we do not have an effective noise barrier then the train noise will stop riders hearing instructors. This is too dangerous and we would have to close the riding school.  Even if we did not then our licencing authority would close us.  Closure would mean the loss of 15 jobs and a local amenity.  We provide  4,000 riding lessons a year, and local parishes have described us as a valuable local amenity with no local alternative if we are closed down.\r\n\r\nAnyone can sign a petition, adults, children, family members, and whether directly involved or just with a social conscience.\r\n\r\nTo sign see our website www.wgriding.co.uk\r\n\r\n",
