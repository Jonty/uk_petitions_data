        "additional_details": "The rioters have shown the worst of Britain's moral bankruptcy while the Police and those volunteering on spontaneous clean-ups have shown the best of what it still means to be British. This duality shows the fallacy of asserting rights without setting out their corresponding responsibilities. We need to repeal the shameful legislative mill-stone that began life as the touch-stone of New Labour's liberal fantasy and which is still in the hearts and on the lips of every institutionalised welfare dependant and thug when confronted with authority: The Human Rights Act. Let's replace it with a social covenant that sets out the minimum expectations of both the citizen and the government and which articulates these in terms of the responsibilities owed by each party. Let's confront the saccharine apologists for those who don't dare aspire to better themselves by ending our retreat from the moral high-ground, resisting the tyranny of the minority and refuting the debasement of British values.",
