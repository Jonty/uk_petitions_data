        "additional_details": "Why do we live in a benefits culture. Why should you live on benefits for life and it's actual cash you are given. Benefits should only be payable for 6 months and you should be given a ration book where you can only redeem the ticket for food. Not drink or cigarettes. You get a weekly value that has a pre printed date on it. This way it encourages those to get a job there are jobs put there but the atitude seems to be why should I work when I can sit at home for the same money. Well I am sick paying for all these wasters and it's time the government reviewed the whole system. In other countries you can't live on benefits.",
