        "additional_details": "Andy Townsend consistently ruins the ITV coverage of football. I have never met a football fan that enjoys his coverage and most that I discuss it with actively dislike it. I'm sure he is a perfectly nice man in real life, but he is really quite an awful commentator.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be a simple coincidence that since he's been an ITV commentator England have never won a major tournament. If you support England, you need to sign this petition.",
