        "additional_details": "I propose that all police officers must wear body cameras and microphones when attending a scene and during all arrests.\r\nThis will help not only the public but also police officers and the CPS\r\nWe have seen with very high profile cases recently that the very people who have the power to arrest and alter the present and future of any individual are not above errors in judgement or out right corruption and deceit.\r\nOne area which has resulted in thousands of people being given criminal records without any real prospect of a fair trial and hearing at court is the charge of drunk and disorderly.\r\nIf cameras and microphones were used this would help:\r\n1 Reduce the risk of abuse of power by the police officers\r\n2 Stop frivolous complaints against the police in arrests\r\n3 Restore and repair trust and respect between the police and communities\r\n4 Provide extra assistance and evidence for the police and CPS in gathering evidence\r\n5 Save taxpayers money",
