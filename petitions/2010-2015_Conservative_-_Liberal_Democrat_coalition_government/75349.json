Only applicable to a parent of a British citizen/passport holder\r\n2. Indefinite visa ( valid until the visa holder dies or the British citizen on whom its dependent on dies)\r\n3. Maximum stay duration of 6 months (like current visitor visas).\r\n4. Reduced duration between visits (minimum 3 months between visits)\r\n4. No recourse to public funds.\r\n5. Not allowed to work in UK.\r\n6. Must pay for medical treatments.\r\n\r\nIf a British passport holder can bring in his spouse and kids why are his/her parents treated differently ? ",
