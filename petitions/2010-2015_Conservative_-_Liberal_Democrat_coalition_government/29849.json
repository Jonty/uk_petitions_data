It may be that some people wish to live upon the interest on their savings. Those people cannot expect that their savings will continue to have the same value. But those people who allow interest to accumulate should be able to expect that the value of their savings remains the same, despite inflation.\r\n\r\nI wish to recommend that The Treasury instigate laws which require that interest rates on Savings Accounts should have a minimum interest rate of the level of inflation.
