Furthermore, we rank towards the bottom of the \u2018decency\u2019 league table when it comes to how we treat our test veterans.\r\n\r\nOfficial recognition from the UK Prime Minister, written or oral, would go a long way to honouring the service these veterans gave, together with an ex gratia donation from the Government of \u00a325million to help with the establishment of a Benevolent Fund to help assist those veterans and their descendents in need.\r\n",
