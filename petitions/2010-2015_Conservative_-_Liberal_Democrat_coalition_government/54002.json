        "additional_details": "The plans for the HS2 (High Speed 2) rail project should be completely scrapped in favour of developing a national true Fibre Optic broadband network to make the UK one of the fastest and best connected countries in the world with a future proof technology in place.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Switzerland and Latvia are the top 5 fastest connected countries in the world today.  The UK is ranked 17th currently.  The government is always going on about strengthening the economy.  Estimates for a full UK FTTP/FTTH/FTTB are around \u00a316-\u00a322bn which would mean there would still be money left over to spend on other proposed projects to help benefit the UK as a whole rather than just specific areas.",
