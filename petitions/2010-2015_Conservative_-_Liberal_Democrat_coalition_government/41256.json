        "additional_details": "In England, Scotland and Wales there is a facility for drivers to place a number plate on a retention certificate for up to 3 years. This is structured in a financial way of 1 year - \u00a3105, 2 years - \u00a3130 and 3 years - \u00a3155.\r\nIn Northern Ireland a number plate must be transferred directly from one car to another with a single \u00a380 fee. This causes a problem for drivers if they cannot afford to purchase their new car before selling their old car, meaning they must either put it on a another car, then onto the new car (incurring a double transfer - 2 x \u00a380 fees).\r\nDue to this policy, a number of drivers have lost their personal plate as they are not in a position to purchase their new car or have another car they can transfer their plate onto.",
