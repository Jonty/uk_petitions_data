Yes, they were shocking.\r\n\r\nSocial media helped more than it hindered. Friends and local groups kept in touch and coordinated safety. Cleanup efforts were instigated and supported through social media.\r\n\r\nDo not block it at the very time the innocents need it the most.  Get better at monitoring it for security and use it to promote the public good.",
