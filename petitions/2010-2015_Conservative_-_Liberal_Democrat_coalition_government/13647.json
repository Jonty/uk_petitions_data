It is possible that soon as the coalition forces leave Afghanistan in the next few years, it is likely that full scale civil war will ensue. . In some countries, perhaps moral and non-corrupt government by strong dictation rather than Western style democracy by consensus is needed for a culture in the circumstances. The Russians killed about 1 million Afghans but still lost. In the meantime let the Taliban and their murders road side explosive (IEDs) devices do battle on the air with extra fighter bombers, dromes and gunships; like Apache helicopters and even specially fitted out cannon bearing ground attack Hercules aircraft.",
