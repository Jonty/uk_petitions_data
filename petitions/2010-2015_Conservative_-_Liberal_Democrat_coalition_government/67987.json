        "additional_details": "When the switch over occurred from Analogue to Digital TV in Bridlington and the surrounding area there were promises made that reception would be improved.  This has not occurred.\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals the reception on many of the Freeview channels is so poor that there is no significant reception with the channels often breaking up and disappearing entirely.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for some action to be investigated and carried out to make the Freeview Television reception consistently great at all times irrespective of atmospheric conditions - perhaps through a local booster station or other method",
