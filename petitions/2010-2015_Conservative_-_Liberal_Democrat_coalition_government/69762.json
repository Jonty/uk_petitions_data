        "additional_details": "On 19 September, the nation learned that Scotland had voted to preserve the Union into which we were born for another generation. But, against a backdrop of increased demands for devolution from all corners of the United Kingdom, we have also rediscovered some of what bring us together. For the Union to survive for future generations, we need to stay conscious of this.\r\n\r\nI propose that the government debate the creation of a new public holiday, on 19 September each year, commemorating the act of the democratic preservation of the Union. While powers maybe increasingly devolved to towns, cities and regions, Union day would underscore the importance of stopping to reengage with the shared identity, history and culture of these islands. That way, the people of this country will have an annual opportunity, rather as US citizens do, to celebrate what unites our United Kingdom.",
