        "additional_details": "Danny Baker is a superb Sony award-winning presenter for BBC London and 5 Live. Today the BBC have announced that they are axing Danny's show on BBC London at the end of the year to \"cut costs\".\r\n\r\nThe BBC should want to keep presenters such as Danny Baker, rather than axing them. Danny's shows offer fun and originality as well as good old fashioned 'entertainment' and will no doubt be replaced by a presenter offering bland, run-of-the-mill radio.\r\n\r\nSo, come on you lot - please sign this petition to keep Danny's show on air!\r\n\r\nLondon can't afford to lose such a talented man from the airways.",
