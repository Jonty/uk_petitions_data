For all they know behind closed doors the said person may have debt, child support to pay etc.\r\n\r\nEven if they did not have any debts etc that would hinder their actual 'take home', you would think high earner tenants would be more reliable in comparison to who make no effort to pay their bills/rent.\r\n\r\nRent could potentially be paid on time, the right amount with no issues in comparison to many people who do not have a high wage or a wage full stop other than benefits.\r\n\r\n",
