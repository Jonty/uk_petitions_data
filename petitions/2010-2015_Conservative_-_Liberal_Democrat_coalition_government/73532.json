        "additional_details": "At the moment tax law ensures that companies based here, with branches in other countries, don't get taxed twice on the same money. They have to pay only the difference between our rate and that of the other country. If, for example, Dirty Oil plc pays 10% corporation tax on its profits in Oblivia, then shifts the money over here, it should pay a further 18% in the UK, to match our rate of 28%. But under the new proposals, companies will pay nothing at all in this country on money made by their foreign branches.Foreign means anywhere.\r\n\r\nIf these proposals go ahead, the UK will be only the SECOND country in the world to allow money that has passed through tax havens to remain untaxed when it gets here. The exemption applies solely to \"large and medium companies\": it is *not* available for smaller firms. The government says it expects \"large financial services companies to make the greatest use of the exemption regime\". The main beneficiaries, in other words, will be the banks.",
