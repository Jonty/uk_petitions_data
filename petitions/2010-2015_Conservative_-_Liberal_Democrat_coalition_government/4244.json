Iceland didn't let them and why should we? If we bail them out then there is no need for them to change their attitude and this will just mean in the future it will happen again. They have cost the economy a huge amount of money and there is nothing to stop them doing it again. Why should we pay tax, work hard so these people can pay themselves hundreds of thousands in bonuses and wages with public money? Its time this stopped and they were treated like any other private business and were allowed to fail and this may concentrate their minds slightly!",
