The records will be permanently deleted and patients can request a list of who has already viewed their data.\r\n\r\nThe Health and Social Care Information Centre already holds hospital information on patients in England, and in March 2014 will upload patient's data from GP surgeries. This information is held at the individual level and can be linked to key identifiers such as date of birth, gender and address.\r\n\r\nThe current provision for 'opting-out' is not an opt-out. It does not prevent GPs uploading patient information, nor does it stop patient data at the individual level being accessed by insurance companies, universities and commercial companies.\r\n\r\nPatients should have the right to determine how their medical information is used. Sign this action to ensure that you have the choice to keep your medical information private.",
