        "additional_details": "The practise of locking mobile phones to certain network providers, some times automatically without a users consent, is anti-consumer and provides little insentive for companies to 'unlock' devices.\r\n\r\nPhone network providers have no legal requirement to provide the unlock service, and those that do often do so (eventually) for a fee that is disproptionate the the required effort.\r\n\r\nIf the government is serious about culturing a free and open market, mobile phones should be owned by the consumer not tethered to the business providing the services; such that the consumer is free to switch providers as appropriate.",
