        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to review Wilts CC decision to sell off Urchfont Manor in the village of Urchfont.  As short term planning - this is cultural and educational vandalism.  Urchfont is a jewel that has continued to contribute to the Big Society ethos since its inception as the first adult educational centre to be established following WW2 in 1947 - it grows it's own food, provides accommodation, learning and food to the very highest standard by dedicated staff who live locally.  One would have to visit to appreciate Urchfont's magic.  Please please get involved and postpone this decision until further investigations by a Minister. ",
