        "additional_details": "Please would the Government apologise for sending a group of Italian/German POW's to Canada in 1940 which resulted in the loss of The Arandora Star Cruise Liner. My Grandfather was on board and was lost at sea.  The Liner was surrounded with barbed wire which meant that many clung to it as they tried to jump into the sea, it was not properly marked as a ship carrying POW and many lost their lives because the UK Soldiers locked the prisoners down below decks like common criminals when many of them - especially the Italian POW were not fascists but were treated like such!
