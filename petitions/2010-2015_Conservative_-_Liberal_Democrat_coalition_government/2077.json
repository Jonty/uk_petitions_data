        "additional_details": "I propose that the minimum age for driving motor vehicles should be 18. There are a lot of problems caused by young drivers and giving people an extra year to mature could stop a lot of these problems. This would save a lot of money in health and support costs and would also have a beneficial side effect of keeping the number of vehicles on the road down and increasing the use of public transport",
