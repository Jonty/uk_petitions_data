        "additional_details": "We want the Government to scrap the tax on pitch hire on 5-a-side football pitches. The government talks about wanting to solve the obesity crisis the country is facing, but then they hike up the prices that are already over inflated by the companies that run the pitches in the first place. Furthermore, the additional of VAT could stop free daytime use of these pitches, a service that is currently enjoyed by over half a million children.",
