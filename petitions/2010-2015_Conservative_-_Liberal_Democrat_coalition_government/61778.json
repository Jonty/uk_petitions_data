        "action": "Ban Trapping",
        "additional_details": "This petition represents an appeal by concerned taxpayers, citizens, tourists and visitors to the United Kingdom, to ban the barbaric and sadistic abuse of wildlife for sport and entertainment; the trapping and of all wildlife in enclosures, where they cannot escape from. The animals most victimized have no voice or protection. The trapped animals endure high levels of stress while being in cages, only to be horrifically killed. Ostensibly, this is done to train the hunter, but also for the entertainment of bystanders who take pleasure in watching animals writhe in agony while their bodies are ripped to pieces & killed. This practice is a stain on the reputation of the United Kingdom and is banned in most civilized, western countries.We ask that you ban these practices completely throughout the United Kingdom and mandate prosecution to the fullest extent of the law, with heavy fines and jail sentences imposed upon anyone found guilty of practicing these most repugnant acts.",
