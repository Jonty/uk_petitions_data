        "additional_details": "In election time, politcal parties draw up their manifesto in which they outline what their stance is on an issue and what action they would take if elected.\r\nHowever, they are under no obligation to keep these promises and all too often we see manifesto pledges ignored or broken. This has led to a considerable erosion of public trust.\r\nThe way to reverse this trendis by making manifestos a contract between government and the people. Should a single party win a majority at election, their manifesto should become a legally binding document and all promises must be kept - with the party leader being directly accountable for any violations and strict penalities being applied.\r\nWith such a law in place, more thought would have to go into the writing of manifestos to prevent inclusion of unrealistic pledges and voter confidence would be restored!
