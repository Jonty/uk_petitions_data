Most people do not know what my dad is saying but if people learnt it in schools then more deaf people would be understood and it wouldn't be intimidating to talk to them as most people think it is.\r\nI wanted to make this petition because deaf people are not treat fairly and hardly anybody knows BSL, it's not like it takes days or hours to learn it takes years and school is the perfect time to do this.\r\nWhere is the respect for the deaf?
