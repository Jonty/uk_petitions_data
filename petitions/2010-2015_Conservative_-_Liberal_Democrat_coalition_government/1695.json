        "additional_details": "At present, the rate of fuel duty on petrol and diesel (\u00a30.5795 per litre - as of 23rd March 2011) is wholly unsustainable and in some case studies and research heading British citizens into \"fuel poverty\".\r\n\r\nWhilst world oil reserves continue to fall and it is true that the Government collects huge revenues from Hydrocarbon Oil Duty and Value Added Tax, the people should be treated fairly as the cost of fuel is disproportionate to the income of lower earning citizens and families.\r\n\r\nI would urge members of the public to support this petition, and Parliament to debate the issue with a view to reducing the burden of Hydrocarbon Oil Duty.",
