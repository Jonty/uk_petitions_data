        "additional_details": "Mr Ken  Jones was born in Blaenavon in 1921 and died there in 2006, aged 84. He is best known for his winning try against the All Blacks in 1953. But also enjoyed a successful career as a Olympic sprinter.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the project could cost as much as \u00a380,000-\u00a3100,000 for both the commissioning of the artist and materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Organising committee of the Olympic Games has snubbed a request for a donation to the Ken Jones Memorial Fund.  This is Disgraceful\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease make the funds available  as Ken  Jones won a silver medal in the last London Olympics in 1948 and it would be a fitting tribute to have funding in place to have the statue erected within the timeframe of the 2012 London Olympics.",
