        "additional_details": "I want the Government to introduce legislation which will make it illegal for \"sex for sale\" advertisements to appear in any media.  The legislation should cover all aspects of advertising including paper, electronic or other media and should also apply to those who promote, publish, distribute or otherwise allow such advertising.\r\n\r\nSex of all kinds is readily available to purchase through ads in newspapers, Adult Services classified Ads, on the internet.  Fraud, deception and violence pull vulnerable women and children into the \"sex trade\" against their will.  Traffickers earn huge tax-free profits through forced prostitution.  Sex advertising increases the demand for prostitution and fuels human trafficking.  We ban tobacco and alchohol advertising, why do we allow this?",
