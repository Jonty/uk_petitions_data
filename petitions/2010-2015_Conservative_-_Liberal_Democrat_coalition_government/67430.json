        "additional_details": "(Ricardo; of the Hamilton family), who is currently being held captive as a legal persons (legal fiction) under the Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, which is being executed in violation of B's natural inalienable human rights (Absolute Rights). It is completely unlawful as B is a self governing body, who has disturbed no peace and has not injured any parties. We have seen picture evidence of injuries inflicted during the abuse of process made by the Thames Valley Police on the day of Thursday 3 July 2014. The injuries are a clear indication of the vexation, ill wilt and frivolous actions used to cause actual bodily harm. This abuse of process resulted in B's immediate admittance into hospital by way of ambulance. He was not charged or placed in custody by police although the attempt was made. Thames Valley Police have used 3rd party information, based on bias and assumption to deem B a legal persons in attempt to make unjustified claims that B is mentally unstable. ",
