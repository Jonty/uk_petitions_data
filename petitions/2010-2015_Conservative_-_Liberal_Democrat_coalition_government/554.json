        "additional_details": "We note with anger the cases of individuals such as Garry Mann who receive unfair trials in foreign countries and are recalled to serve sentences handed out by kangaroo courts through the European Arrest Warrant. We understand that the British courts are powerless to block any arrest warrant, even when they recognise how unfair the trial was and that a sentence may have been served in its entirety before the European Court of Human Rights examines their case.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant Scheme unless British judges can be given the power to block extraditions where trials have been clearly unfair.",
