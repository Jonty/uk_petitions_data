        "additional_details": "I believe that by introducing Micro Grid (M.G) utilization in housing policy to feed some power back to the National Grid (N.G) would be efficient and economical beneficial by following ways:\r\n1) M.G would increase Voltage of the N.G from low voltage to expected voltage at peak hours. This would inturn give less stress on generators in the N.G.\r\n2) M.G system should only use renewable resources Ex: P.V cells, hence no toxicity to the environment.\r\n3) M.G system would reduce load on grid coming from overseas countries and hence be economical in a longer run. This would inturn add to economic growth of the UK.\r\n4) Reduce low voltage risks.\r\n5) Initiate this first at the cities and than the towns thereby giving ample time for residence to have sufficient fianance to have it.\r\nBy the above reasons it is clear that M.G's are surely going to add to the economic growth of the UK and hence I request the government to take necessary steps to have M.G in the housing Policy.",
