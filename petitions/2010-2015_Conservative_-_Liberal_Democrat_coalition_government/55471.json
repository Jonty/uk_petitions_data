        "additional_details": "Government building to be available at low rental rates for companies willing to train Young People Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET). I have been running a successful IT Business for the last 4 years, founded in the recession. My struggle is that I would like to train more potential entrepreneurs, future CEO's and help to create new business models through our brand of ground breaking marketing software.  The problem is that we need large buildings to attract more Young People Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET).  I understand that the government plans to cut benefits for NEETs.  It is really easy to say earn or learn.  I aim to first inspire young people to want to earn or learn.  So please back this petition for government to free up empty properties to corporations like JaySoftware Ltd not only to charities. ",
