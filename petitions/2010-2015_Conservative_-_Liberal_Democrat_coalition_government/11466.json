For example, Article 8 of the ECHR states a right to respect for private and family life. It does not create a right to a private or family life. In addition, paragraph 2 of the Article creates a caveat whereby the \"right to respect\" can be set aside where national security, public safety, the national economy, the prevention of disorder or crime, health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others are placed at risk. A review body is essential to correct the errors of the judiciary.",
