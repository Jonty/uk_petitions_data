        "additional_details": "This petition is to address the current bullying policies in UK schools.\r\nBullying is becoming more and more common and schools are doing very little about it.\r\nI would like the government to reform the punishments and the way in which bullying is dealt with.\r\nSchools need to be more assertive in dealing with bullying, for example if they receive information from the victim about bullying it should be dealt with straight away and the bully should not be cautioned instead they should face a meeting with a teacher and the person they have been bullying, and if it continues   the consequences should be heightened. Bullying is causing more people to harm themselves these days and it should be dealt with as a crime.  ",
