        "additional_details": "I urge the UK government not to sell arms to Bahrain, even though they were invited to the recent arms fair in London. This boycott should stand, since the Bahraini regime is brutally repressing freedom of speech and freedom of peaceful protest by injuring and murdering those who try to practice these basic human rights. Britain should have no hand in giving such regimes the violent means to repress their own people.",
