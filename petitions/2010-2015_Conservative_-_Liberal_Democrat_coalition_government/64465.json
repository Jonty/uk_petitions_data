This is unnecessary and compromises the safety of the dental registrants as well as breaching their privacy.  Dental Professionals could be identified by a name and a unique number in the same way that the GMC uses to identify doctors.\r\n\r\nThe signatories to this petition call for the GDC to cease to publish the addresses of those on the dental registers and move to a more acceptable system for identifying registrants.",
