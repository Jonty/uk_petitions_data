        "additional_details": "The Football League Show has been axed by the BBC Because it was too expensive and falling viewers numbers.\r\nThe reason the numbers have fallen is because it was on after Match Of The Day about 23:45 on Saturday evenings and people don't want to wait up and see it that late, if they show it on a Sunday Evening around 20:00/21:00 people would watch it rather than not watch it and they would get a loads of viewers as TV in the evening on a sunday is boring.\r\nAnd where they say it is TOO expensive then make it cheaper which I expect can be easily done.",
