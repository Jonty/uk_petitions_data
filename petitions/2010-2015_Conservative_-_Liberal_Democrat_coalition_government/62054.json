        "additional_details": "As part of the Government's welfare reforms Council tax Benefit was abolished are replaced with Local Council Tax Schemes.  Local councils throughout the country are interpreting the guidelines differently and make no allowance for being a full time carer in receipt of Carers Allowance.  If you are of working age, despite being a fulltime carer, you have to pay anything from 10% -25% of the Council Tax bill.  This means carers are effectively losing up to 7 weeks of their Carers Allowance a year.  There needs to be clearer guidelines so that it isn't a postcode lottery and I would ask the government to legislate that carers should be exempt from Council Tax.",
