        "additional_details": "A primary cancer patient is reviewed during their remission stage, having successfully completed treatment, to check for active cancerous cells.\r\n\r\nA cancer patient who is given the all clear at the end of their 5 year remission stage, only to be told a few months later that he has secondary bone cancer at an extensive stage, begs the question why this was not detected earlier.\r\n\r\nThere is a high probability of cancer redeveloping and doctors are aware that secondary cancer may develop anywhere in the body, not just at the location of the primary cancer. So as obvious as it may be, unfortunately full body scans are not carried out.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to implement a system to carry out full body bone scans every 6 months to rule out secondary bone cancer during the remission stage, to ensure there's a better system in place for our loved ones who have fought this battle once and ensure secondary cancer is detected at its earliest stage before it is too late.",
