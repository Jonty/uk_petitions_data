From a \u2018slum\u2019 to a place where my teenage daughter could stroll late at night in safety.  New York now puts London to shame.\r\nZero Tolerance is misunderstood. It is about expecting people to abide by the rules. If they do not then they are prosecuted. It is not, as some people would have you believe, fascist police or racism. Zero tolerance meant a drop of over 50% in the murder rate and every other aspect of crime, year after year.\r\nThe Conservative Party have promised us better democracy. If you want London to be a better place sign this petition below to show your views that London wants a police force which acts on behalf of the law abiding.\r\n",
