        "additional_details": "The police have been abusing their powers and certain groups of people such as the mentally ill, the vulnerable, minor ethnic groups and youths for years by breaching certain human rights. Immediately address this issue please! Conduct full, in-depth, independent investigations and bring these abusers to justice. Please do not allow the police force to conduct their own investigations - they cannot be trusted. Be severe in punishing these police officers who abuse by stripping them of their jobs, their freedom and fine them heavily. You were happy to be harsh with the rioters and looters, now please do the same to the abusers within the police force.",
