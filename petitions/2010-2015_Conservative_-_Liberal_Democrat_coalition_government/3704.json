        "additional_details": "Introduce a law by which criminals who repeatedly commit serious crimes are given life sentences upon the third offence. It is reasonable to assume that upon committing a third serious offence a criminal is unlikely to reform after a short prison sentence. Therefore a person who has committed three serious crimes should be imprisoned for life and only released if they complete a full life sentence and a relevant judicial authority is convinced that the perpetrator is fully reformed and no longer a danger to the public. Serious crimes are those that are defined as such by the judicial system and it should also be within the power of a judge to invoke the three strike law for offenders who commit a very large number of petty crimes.",
