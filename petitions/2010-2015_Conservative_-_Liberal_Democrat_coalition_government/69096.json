        "additional_details": "Owners of motor vehicles can buy Excise Duty online, buy their Insurance online, but the transfer of  the Registered Keeper for a vehicle still has to be done by post by completing the V5. In this digital age I would like to see the ability to change ownership of a vehicle as an online function of the GOV.UK website, the same as paying for your Road Tax. I feel it will cut down on missunderstandings if the vehicle is then involved in an uninsured accident or criminal activity, and will of course save postage costs.",
