        "additional_details": "as a child I lost my father & grandfather whilst studying for my GCSE's, this caused me to achieve very low & I still suffer with feelings related to the loss in my life. I feel that if I had been given bereavement counselling as a child I would not be facing these problems in life & I would be able to move on from the things that happened. There are few services in the UK that offer bereavement counselling, children cannot afford to travel for these. I fear that there are many more children out there losing important people in their lives & aren't learning how to deal with the emotions around it properly. I feel that bereavement counselling needs to be offered to all children under the age of 18 who've lost someone in their lives due to death.",
