        "additional_details": "John Griffith-Jones was chairman of audit firm KPMG when it gave clean audit reports on the accounts of the failed bank, HBOS.\r\n\r\nUnder Griffith-Jones leadership, KPMG also sided with HBOS management when the former Head of Risk \u2018whistle-blew\u2019 his concerns about HBOS lending.\r\n\r\nToday HBOS is part of Lloyds and is 43% owned by the taxpayer as a result of the government\u2019s bail out of HBOS. Lloyds have written off \u00a346 billion of loans in total which fact totally contradicts the clean audit reports given by KPMG, chaired at that time by John Griffith-Jones.\r\n\r\nGriffith-Jones conduct has also been heavily criticised by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that the Government should immediately remove John Griffith-Jones from his position as Chairman of the Financial Conduct Authority, (the FCA).",
