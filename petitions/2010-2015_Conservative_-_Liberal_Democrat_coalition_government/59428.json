Qualifications should include a minimum of honours degree in social science, a masters in one speciality and a requirement to gain first hand experience of issues related to the public effect of policy. These are just examples but the key is that the minimum qualifications shall be set by chosen members of the public who have been chosen by the public. Those eligible to decide these qualifications will require real-life experience, skills and knowledge in areas of society such as health, criminal justice, education, transport etc.   This should apply to all members of parliament.",
