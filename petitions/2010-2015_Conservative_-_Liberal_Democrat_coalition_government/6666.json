This means resources such as housing, benefits, Health care, Schools, etc, are not being received by all those who deserve it due to there citizenship.  From previous years of mass immigrations the country has noticed that these resources have been extremely over stretched and have not gone to those who are deserving of it! I.E. British Nationals/those with (British Passports) Can the government look into this further and take note from other countries who have taken an active approach in looking after their own first!",
