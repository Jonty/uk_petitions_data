        "additional_details": "In London, much of the public transport (including Buses, the London Overground, the Croydon Tramlink and the Docklands Light Railway) is run as follows\u2026\r\n\r\nThe government plans the routes, owns the infrastructure, and sets the timetables and fares. Private companies then tender to run each route under franchise for a set number of years. They must maintain a certain quality of service or risk losing their franchise.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe this model provides a more efficient transport system, which prioritises the interests of passengers above those of operating companies, and we petition the government to bring public transport across the UK (including buses and National Rail services) under similar franchise models.",
