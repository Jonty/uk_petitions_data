        "additional_details": "Micro chipping your pet should secure legal ownership\r\nVets should HAVE to scan every animal that comes in.\r\nWe should have a log-in where our details and pet information are stored and can be instantly updated free or affordably it should be mandatory to update this information twice a year or if ownership is transferred. It would be useful to include an image of the pet and owner on the site.\r\nWe should be able to log on and report animals as Lost /Stolen. If the animal is lost or stolen a message should then pop up when animal is later scanned for a chip and the owner on system should be contacted. Owners have to prove who they are with passports/official photographic I.D and official documentation of micro chipping.\r\nIn short if micro chipping is seen as legal proof of ownership it will stop many disputes and help return stolen/lost animals to their rightful owners and would reunite many people with their pets.\r\n\r\n",
