        "additional_details": "We demand that the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham be made to abide by their own planning policies, and the wishes of their own voters and reject the unsuitable and inappropriate 'Fulham Reach' development which is proposed for the Hammersmith Embankment.\r\nThis planning application, number 2011/00407/COMB is opposed by 28 local groups of residents as well as over 200 individuals, and contravenes all the councils planning guidelines for this site in the Thames River Conservation Area. It is so far from being acceptable that the council is demanding \u00a313,000,000 in compensation under section 106. The site is one of outstanding heritage and local importance and will be permanently and seriously damaged if this development goes ahead. The best answer is not to build it if it is unacceptable. We need to leave behind for our children and their children a legacy we can be proud of, and not a tragedy.",
