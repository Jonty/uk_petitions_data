Who knows what spices are in that sausage roll?\r\nWe need to make sure that things are listed correctly to save people with allergies from having to suffer reactions at the hands of those who do not list what is in our food.\r\n\r\nWe as country have the legal right to know what we are consuming and to not be made unwell by unlisted or vague ingredients.\r\n",
