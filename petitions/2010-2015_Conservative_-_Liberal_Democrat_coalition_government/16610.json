        "additional_details": "The 11th September marks the 10th anniversary of the horrific attack upon the WorldTrade Centre in New York.  During that tragedy, Cornishman Rick Rescorla gave his life to save as many people as he could.  He personally and calmly led 2,700 people to safety and was on his way back for more when the towers collapsed.  Although a naturalised US citizen, Rick Rescorla was born and bred a Cornishman.  His home town of Hayle has commemorated him but the government of the UK has never acknowledged his actions that day, which remind us all of the true meaning of hero.  The UK government is hereby called upon to put this right, and to posthumously bestow the highest possible honour upon the truly heroic Rick Rescorla.",
