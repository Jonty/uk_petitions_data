        "additional_details": "A new testing system for people with M.E/CFS because M.E is slightly different and although I'm not well enough for work and the indifference and nature with M.E it's harder to judge by only a questionnaire and a 10 minute interview that can even score you a 0 points, which its a bit obvious that most cases that people with M.E cannot work, it effects up 250,000 people in the U.K and whilst some can work with it and many cannot, and it can also be a form of discrimination and also ignorance, and also when seeking a job with M.E some people can't work that full 16 hours, the inconsistency of the illness makes the person not employable, M.E can effect people on the week, day, hour, minute and there are levels of how it can effect in each day, unfortunately it's not black and white AND must be discussed a new testing way must be there to stop real ill people to be rejected by ESA!! http://chronic-fatigue-syndrome.me/",
