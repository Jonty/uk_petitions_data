        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop anymore plans to go ahead with this idea. First of all it would never work you would have a big convoy of trucks meaning no over traffic would be able to join the carriageway because they would have to give way to the trucks if a slip road gets full and starts queuing on the carriageway all the HGV traffic would stop not only that other road users would try and leave it to the last second to push in causing lane 2 to start queuing. Also crane and farm traffic would had to the congestion if the HGV's where on a ban meaning drivers being late for deliveries and because it had taken ages to get to point of delivery and a big lost of driving time drivers would be forced to stay overnight in lay by's as there is not many truck stops on the A12 causing more HGV drivers being at risk of fuel and loads being stolen meaning most police time being used up.  Maybe the Essex council should think more about getting the public to car share taking cars off the roads.\r\n",
