        "additional_details": "Northern Ireland and it's politics is a complex topic. Many people in Northern Ireland are subject to tribal politics at a young age through no fault of their own. In order to confront and rectify this issue for future generations - we propose the compulsory study of politics in all Northern Irish secondary schools.\r\n\r\nStudents should be provided with the tools needed to make informed decisions, especially as they approach voting age. With a minimum of 30 minutes of political education per week students will be armed with the knowledge to vote based on political policies as opposed to religious belief. This subtle change to academia is likely to encourage younger people to vote in order to secure a better future for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is time for Northern Ireland to move one more step in the direction of a peaceful, educated and democratic future.
