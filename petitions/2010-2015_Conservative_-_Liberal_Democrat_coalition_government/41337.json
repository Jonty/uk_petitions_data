Crime Rates have gone down, is outrageous, in fact crime rates have gone up 10 fold, and police won't deal with the matters, because they are chasing the money, and making false facts in order to gain conviction.\r\n\r\nWhen this order was made, it was to strip a criminal of his assets, not to punish him more than 50 times the original prison sentence.\r\n\r\nThe POCA law needs to be totally rewritten, and an Agency created that oversees the POCA confiscations, at the minute the POCA act is totally in breach of several European and International Human Rights. The police are becoming the modern crooks of society. Not catching big fish but going for small time criminals, which the act was not intended for. Either get the Act in line or abolish it.",
