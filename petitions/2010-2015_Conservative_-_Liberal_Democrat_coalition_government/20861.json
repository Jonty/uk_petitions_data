If it is legalised, we can regulate it to insure a more healthy and pure cannabis. Peoples future prospects have been blown away for being found dispersing or taking cannabis. If we legalised this, there would be no need for people to disperse it as much, and would lower the crime rate drastically. For this and many other reaons, it should be legal.",
