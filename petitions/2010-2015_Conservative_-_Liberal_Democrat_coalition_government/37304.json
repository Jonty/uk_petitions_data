This law is in force only in Scotland. A similar law should be in force in the rest of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls upon the Government to amend Part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986 to include the offence of inciting hatred on the grounds of any transgender or intersex identity, and real or presumed disability.",
