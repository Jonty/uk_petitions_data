        "additional_details": "Rising energy costs creates increasing fuel poverty and currently nothing encourages fair or efficient use of limited resources. The detail can differ, but the general model is:\r\n\r\nBased upon the number of persons residing (e.g. using the Council tax register) there will be a residence energy allowance. Increases for each additional resident will be a fraction of that for the 1st (e.g. +50% of base for 2nd, +20% of base for additional). Up to the residence allowance, and for all carbon neutral sources, tax is zero; from 100-150% tax is 10%; from 150-200% is 25% ; above 200% tax will be at 50%.\r\n\r\nThis can be revenue neutral, while helping those who most need it.\r\n\r\nAllowances would be made for properties that the government / local authorities will not allow to be double glazed or solar installations etc. due to Listing or Conservation area restrictions. Such restrictions should be minimized. Allowances could be varied due to the regional or exceptional weather conditions.\r\n",
