It is ridiculous how much we are expected to pay to watch premier league football now while the players earn massive wages  AND clubs make huge profits ! Enough is enough. \u00a325 is more than enough to go and spend an hour an a half watching a football match ! Let's put pressure on the government to to force clubs in to lowering admission prices either through wage capping or profit cuts! If you like me can't afford to take your kids to the match anymore everyweek then please sign this petition and let's try and do something about it! If we don't it will only get worse! ",
