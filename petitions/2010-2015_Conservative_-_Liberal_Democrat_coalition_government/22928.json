        "additional_details": "Many of today's graduates are finding it hard to gain employment in roles designed for highly educated University leavers. There is too much competition for these jobs, and those offering the roles are less able to judge whether graduates are genuinely suitable. This is because many students gain poor A-Level grades but are still accepted into University. Those of us who excel academically and attend University in the hopes of enhancing our career prospects have subsequently seen our degrees become worthless, as others who are poor academically acquire the same qualifications. I call on the government to create legislation that prohibits Universities from accepting applicants with poor A-Levels (or equivalent). The government already legislates for many things that govern the way Universities are managed (including tuition fee limits). University education needs to be returned to being an elite option for only those who excel academically.",
