        "additional_details": "The UK's Climate Change act 2008 requires an unrealistic and unilateral reduction in CO2 emissions. Hence the requirement for thousands of inefficient windmills, a bio-fuel component of petrol and many energy-related subsidies. These and other measures are hugely expensive (funded by a surcharge on fuel bills) and damaging to UK industry and slowing our economic recovery. All of this is proving to be a monumental folly: environmental meltdown exists only in computer models and not in the real world. It would be far cheaper to offset the consequences of the slight warming being experienced, eg with sea defences if and where needed -- a case of cure being better than prevention. The Climate Change act must be repealed. ",
