        "additional_details": "A committee of Mp's has suggested that all children in Primary schools should have compulsory sex education from the age of 5. This is to combat the rise in STD's teenage pregnancies and increased abortion rates. ALL the facts point to an increase in these things due to more information about sex than ever before. Why not let children be children at primary school. Teachers have a big enough struggle getting children to read and write. They should not have to discuss things with young children that if they did so outside the classroom, they would be arrested for.",
