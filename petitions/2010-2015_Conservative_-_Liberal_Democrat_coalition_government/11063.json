At present cash benifits are spent on; cigarettes, alcohol, drugs and electrical goods, it is wrong to spend benefits on these items. I would like to see the goverment impliment a food and clothing  VOUCHER system,  Rent and utility bills could be negotiated by the benefits office  to get the best deal for the tax payer with direct payment to the property owners and  Utility companies. We need to get back to basics and start again, this will galvanize those families who receive voucher benefits into awareness and value any cash they get from paid emploment.\r\nThis method may cost to impliment but the savings could be in the billions. yes it would take away the independence of the benefit claiment to spend and may create  a curtain divide in society of  social stigma of being on benefits, this will force them to get a job to rid themselves of social stigma.",
