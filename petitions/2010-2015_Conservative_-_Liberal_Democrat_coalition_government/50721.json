        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the reinstatement of the death penalty for those convicted of acts of terrorism against the UK.  There is a distinct lack of deterrent for such heinous acts as the London bombings and public execution of Drummer Lee Rigby.  Even after any conviction the perpetrators of these crimes will still have the opportunity to preach their deluded beliefs which could further insight those who are easily misguided in society.",
