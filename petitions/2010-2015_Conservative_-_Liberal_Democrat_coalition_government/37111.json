        "additional_details": "The American Pit Bull - The most victimized breed of dog ever to exist. What the media won't show you... how good these dogs actually are.\r\nPitbulls have been around since the 1800's. They haven't done anything apart from being Friendly, Loving, Playful, Happy animals. A Dog is a mans bestfriend. APBT (American PitBull Terrier's) are abused by bad owners for bets, which lead to serious injuries. But pitbulls are seen as scary, mean, agressive, dangerous, etc because people are usually only shown the governments/police's point of view, which isn't right. But most of the good owners can tell you that Pitbulls are like family to them, bestfriends, they are always there for them violent or not, they aren't normally agressive, they are just like any other dog who deserv the right to be with any family in any country who are responsable, without any stereotypes!",
