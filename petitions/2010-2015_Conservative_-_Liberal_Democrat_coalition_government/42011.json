Why can't the tax payer take over a small part of London (near Westminster) turn it in to flats that a Politician can live in during their time in London?  This would save the need for tax payers to foot the bill every 5 years for a new property, which we never own.\r\nAlso each constituency outside of a 45min journey to Westminster should have a property that goes with the job.\r\n\r\nAfter each change of MP the properties changes hands over to the new incumbent.  This would save tax payers millions over the years.\r\nWhy should the tax payer be expected to foot the bill for property they never own?\r\n",
