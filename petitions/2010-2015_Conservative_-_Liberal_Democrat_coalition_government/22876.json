        "additional_details": "In view of the huge cost of fraudulant benefit claims, and the apparent ease that fraud occurs, I want the government to embark on a comprehensive exercise whereby every single current claim is checked for authenticity. For this to be effective it may mean temporarily suspending every current payment until the check takes place. This may involve hiring an army of reliable checkers to conduct the exercise over, say, a three month period. The cost of hiring these people to be met from ongoing savings as fraud is rooted out. It would also give temporary employment to many thousands of people. This would boost economic activity in these difficult times. There could be safeguards put in place to ensure that people in genuine hardship are assessed as a matter of urgency. The army of checkers could also capture data from each visit / assessment interview for the proposed \"single view\" database. ",
