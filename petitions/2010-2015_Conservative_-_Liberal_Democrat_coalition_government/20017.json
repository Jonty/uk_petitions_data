Many people do NOT want their wages to be channeled through the parasitic Banking industry. Why should the banking industry get our wages before we do ?. Every worker should be able to inform their emloyer that they want a wage packet and that they do not want wages paying into a bank. This should be a legal right of every legal worker in the UK.",
