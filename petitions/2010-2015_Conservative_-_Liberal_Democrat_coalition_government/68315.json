        "action": "Stop Pharmaceutical Companies and Food Manufacturers from controlling our health",
        "additional_details": "The pharmaceuticals industry and food manufacturers have kept us in a state of ill health to increase their own profits for decades.\r\n\r\nThere are also representatives from these companies paying for research to be done (influencing the outcomes), influencing our GPs and even NICE guidelines.  This has to stop and the government should be impartially investigating our health, diets and making recommendations based on fact not profit margins.  Simple treatments and cures (such as simple sugar for topical treatment of leg ulcers) should be allowed to be utilised in our NHS instead of charging extortionate amounts for costly (and often ineffective) medicines which drains the NHS resources and keeps us in a state of requiring more and more.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to have this debated in the House of Commons.",
