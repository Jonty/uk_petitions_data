        "additional_details": "The main reason for having bus lanes is to encourage the use of transportation methods that are more environmentally friendly than cars. Buses, bicycles and motorcycles all fit into this category. However, not only do taxis pollute just as much as cars when they are occupied, they often make extra journeys from one fare to the next. This means that they are even more damaging to the environment, and so their existence should not be encouraged in this way.",
