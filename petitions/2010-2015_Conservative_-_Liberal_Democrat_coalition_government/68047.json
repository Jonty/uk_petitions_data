        "additional_details": "The UK should start the process of imposing trade sanctions against Israel as soon as is possible. This is in reaction to Israel's current disproportionate and irresponsible military action in Gaza, Israel's longstanding disregard for the human rights of the people of Gaza, and Israel's on-going annexation of it's own country in Palestinian lands and it's control over Palestines land and sea borders. By doing this the UK will therefore be making it clear to Israel that there are now consequences for these actions, and they cannot continue to take repeated military action at such a high cost in terms of Palestinian lives.",
