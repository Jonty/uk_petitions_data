        "additional_details": "\r\nI propose to divorce London from the rest of the United Kingdom, to make London a World City state, that way London can get on with what it cares about most \"Money,Banks,Services\" and the rest of the united Kingdom can create a new fair United Kingdom that isn't \"all about London\" This in my opinion is the only way to save the Union, maybe a new Looser union could be created incorporating Rep of Ireland, Ulster,Scotland, Wales, and most of England (and with ties to the English speaking world), the capital could rotate on a yearly basis, no central power base, and investment would be shared amongst the nations.\r\n\r\nThe action i would like the government to take is to hold a referendum asking the British people \"Should London be divorced from the United Kingdom?\" Yes or  No?",
