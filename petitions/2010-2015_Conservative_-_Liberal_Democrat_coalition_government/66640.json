        "additional_details": "I have had a swisscard in my wallet for many years now complete with a non-folding  0.5\" blade which I use for various things like cutting cable ties, etc.\r\n\r\nRecently I discovered that unless I have a reasonable excuse for carrying the blade which must be decided in a court of law then I could be arrested for it.\r\n\r\nHowever if I bought a penknife which has a much longer and sharper blade on it, as long as the blade does not lock I do not need any excuse to carry this blade.\r\n\r\nI looked at my house keys and realised they are probably far sharper than the blade inside the swisscard, so if I'm not going home does that mean it's illegal to also carry my house keys around with me?\r\n\r\nThis law needs to be altered to add some exceptions for some of the minor knives out there, such as the swisscards, rather than a blanket ban on all non-folding knives regardless of whether they pose any real threat.",
