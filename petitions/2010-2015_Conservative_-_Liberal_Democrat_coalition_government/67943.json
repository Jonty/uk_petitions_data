        "additional_details": "In Feb 2014 my e petition was debated in Westminster (170,000 Signatures) \u2013 On the issue of pricing in the SET SCHOOL HOLIDAY PERIOD - You expect US parents to stick to these periods and thus giving our children the \"best\" education, Yet you have done nothing in helping families by working with  industry by looking at what solutions are possible to help ease pressure on pricing and smooth out peak periods causing these issues, I have met at MY cost and MY time most major CEO\u2019s inc. Mr Keith Williams of British Airways and Correspondence from Sir Richard Branson with immense support from the Virgin Group, Department of Education the list is endless. Together with the Edu. Dept. solutions can be found \u2013 You have refused a meeting with myself and so I have had no option than to try another route to help our Children have irreplaceable memories of time spent with their families - I have started your job, Please take over and finish it \u2013 Family time is Quality time, Paul Cookson HPIHERO.COM",
