        "additional_details": "Britain has some of the most numerous and diverse traditional customs and crafts in the world. We believe that like our ancient heritage sites these deserve to be protected for future generations. Other nations have moved to protect their customs and traditions by ratifying the UNESCO Convention on Intangible Cultural Heritage,listing various customs and crafts as important enough to be protected. The government have failed to ratify the convention. As a consequence many of our traditional events are now under threat. We call on the government to ratify the convention as soon as possible to prevent any further loss of our traditional customs and crafts.",
