        "additional_details": "I recently had a road cycle accident, the result of which meant I went to hospital for a CT scan.  The doctors confirmed I was in better condition for the sake of wearing a cycle helmet.  The cycle helmet I was wearing lost the entire back half due to the impact on the road.\r\n\r\nMy local MP wrote to the Department of Transport to raise the issue for the compulsory use of cycle helmets.\r\nThe reply was quite surprising.  In short not enough lives would be saved, based on their scientific research, to warrant a law to be put in place.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, one life saved is surely evidence of the benefit of cycle helmets?\r\n\r\nI worry for the children who ride the streets without adequate protection.\r\n\r\nAn accident maybe too late for parents/cyclists to realise how essential cycle helmets are.\r\n\r\nPlease sign.",
