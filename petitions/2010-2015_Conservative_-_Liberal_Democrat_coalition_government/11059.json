Should we not have a say in where our taxes go, Shouldn't they go into areas that benefit us the tax payer, such as a strong police force, where you know that if you ever need them they will have enough resources and man power to help you straight away? Or bigger Prisons where we can keep criminals off the streets for longer rather than reducing or giving them suspened sentences? It is sickening when you find out that an Alcoholic and Heroin addict who is regularily in trouble with the police for theft. is getting almost a thousand pounds worth of benefits a month, as his addiction is supposidly a 'disability' This is almost the same amount as the upstanding admirable police officers arresting him earn, where is the justice in that?",
