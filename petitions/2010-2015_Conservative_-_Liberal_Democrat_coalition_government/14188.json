        "additional_details": "The Goverments commitment to the E. U. to generate nearly a third of our electricity from renewable resources within the next nine years, is not going to happen, unless something is invented to combat the vagaries of the wind & the need to have gas-fired stations running on standby, should the wind drop .  One thing that would do this is a Rechageable Battery .  The largest Rechargeable Battery at present is at Fairbanks, Alaska - it will supply power to 12,000 homes for 7 minutes, it also weighs 1,300 tons . This is far too small, but one 100 times it`s capacity would be more like it, to store intermittent power & release it when required . I propose that the Government pursues this idea, with prizes & grants for practical inventions, so that the full potential of Wind Generators be realised . It should not be a penny-pinching operation, as the savings would be enormous & patentable.",
