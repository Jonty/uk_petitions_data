If Turkey becomes part of the EU, there may chaotic more conflicts amongst believers of various religions & cultures in the EU. Turkey is the gateway for immigrants (legal & illegal) and asylum seekers from the Middle East & Africa. EU reaching is breaking point as regards absorbing more countries and it would become too expensive, unwieldy & chaotic. MEPs and staffing of the administration of the European Parliament are expensive and is a \u2018gravy train\u2019, as well as UK having to subsidise poorer EU states.  It is good that UK currently opted out of EU foreign policy, security, taxation, defence and the Euro monetary currency, but for how long? Where does the demarcation as to where Europe ends and Middle East and Africa begins?",
