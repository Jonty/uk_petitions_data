        "additional_details": "EU proposals, that Boris Johnson and others are keen to adopt, are aimed at pricing older diesels off the road. Most pre 2006 vehicles will have been scrapped by the 2020 deadline, so any extra taxation will be purely to raise money. Natural wastage will solve this perceived problem.\r\n\r\nThese indirct 'taxes' hit the low paid/poor, more than most. They are more likely to run older cars out of necessity, can't afford to buy new and have low annual mileages. They were encouraged to buy diesels and now they are condemed and victimised.\r\n\r\nPlease vote for this to be rejected, with current 'tax' rates frozen for older cars and new tax regimes only applying to new cars, where buyers have a choice.",
