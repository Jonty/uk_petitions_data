The tube in currently being upgraded but nobody will appreciate all the effort if we still have to travel in soaring heat!\r\n\r\nThere is always an excuse like the tunnels aren't big enough, there isn't enough money or we only get 2 weeks of summer. That's not the can do attitude the people who built the tube had 150 years ago. And its still hot no matter what time of year due to the vast numbers of commuters these days.\r\n\r\nIts embarrassing that we have such an amazing city but don't have something as basic as this. The olympics showed off our city and tourism is now booming but I wonder what people say about London when they go home to their own country.... yeah its nice but I nearly collapsed from the heat try to get from A to B.\r\n\r\nJust get on with it.... please!",
