        "additional_details": "Most cyclists all over the country do NOT stop at Red lights. This is both dangerous for themselves, and other road users. Red Lights are there for a reason. A bike is still a vehicle on a road, and this should also not be an excuse for them to cycle on pavements instead.\r\n\r\nOver 19,000 Cyclists were either killed or injured on the roads last year according to ROSPA. It makes you wonder how some of them came to such a catastrophic end.\r\n\r\nThe Law must change to stop cyclists going through red lights for their own safety & for the safety of others too. We must take action to save lives! ",
