We call on the government to make it a requirement a) for all jobs to be advertised with a gross salary only and b) for the written statement of employment/employment contract constructed under English law to include a gross salary or, where this is not practicable (e.g. oil industry employees working offshore), gross equivalent using a normal single person\u2019s tax code.\r\n",
