Much of the objection to Inheritance Tax is the thought that the government squanders this money, by attempting a redistribution of wealth that is not properly targeted.  By taking a small amout (2 - 3%) of the money that currently goes to the Treasury, and giving it directly to a charity of the deceased's choosing, those with the most genuine needs will benefit.  It will also hopefully increase public interest in less well known, but equally important, charities.",
