        "action": "Stop the British Government using innocent British holidaymakers as political pawns",
        "additional_details": "Year on year the Foreign and Commonwealths policy on giving advice on overseas travel is that it is 'reviewed daily'. This leaves British holiday makers unable to obtain refunds from travel operators due to political disturbances/wars/threats of terrorism until days before they were due to travel, or facing losses of thousands of pounds if they choose not to travel. Even when the rest of Europe is evacuating their citizens from 'high risk' areas, British tourists continue to travel without option. I believe this is wrong. No one should have to spend what was supposed to be the best time of their year anxious. I ask that the FCO has the courage of its' convictions, publishing time scales for their decisions, and giving people the opportunity to make informed decisions in advance, without penalty.",
