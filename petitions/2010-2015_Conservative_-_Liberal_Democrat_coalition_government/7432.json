We need to stop being soft and actually deal with this.\r\n\r\nThese people are criminals and as violence becomes more widespread and intense with little to halt it, it becomes apparent that the police forces are undermanned and will struggle at an accelerating rate as criminals realise there is little in their way.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason we must utilise a military force capable of dealing with the problem.",
