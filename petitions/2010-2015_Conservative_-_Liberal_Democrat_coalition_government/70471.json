        "action": "Decision to stop free access to IVF treatment within Mid Essex",
        "additional_details": "On the 25th of September 2014 the Mid Essex Clinical Commisioning Group stopped offering free access to IVF treatment on the NHS, citing funding from central government and budget deficit issues.\r\n\r\nI want the government to intervene on this situation and overturn this decision. I would also like legislation or similar to be put in place to protect IVF funding within the NHS that will prevent other areas from following suit on the back of this decision.\r\n\r\nI do not live in the Essex area but still feel very angry by this decision.\r\n\r\nIt seems incredulous that decisions can be made that prevent access on the NHS to IVF (which is not a lifestyle choice)  when people who have made certain lifestyle choices remain able to access free NHS treatment for their medical problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
