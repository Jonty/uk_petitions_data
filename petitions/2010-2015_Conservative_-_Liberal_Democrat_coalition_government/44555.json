We would like to change this by persuading Mp's to consider the idea and make changes to the law allowing prisoners to vote freely during general elections. We strongly believe that prisoners should have the freedom to vote as it is a human right meaning it should apply to everyone. Please help us by supporting us by signing out petition. Thank you.\r\n\r\n",
