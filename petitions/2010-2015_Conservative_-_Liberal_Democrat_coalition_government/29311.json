        "additional_details": "Stalking affects all aspects of life from personal health to all relationships, but the perpertrators of this crime have very little chance of being convicted, and the victims never seem to recieve the justice they have the right to. Stalkers affect everyday life of their victims and know that the stalking laws do not work in our government system, so they stalk with impunity knowing that probably nothing will happen to them.\r\nThe government must bring in proper sentencing and make the laws clearer for convictions to be custodial sentences instead of a slap on the wrist, the police should be able to remove all and any equipment used to stalk victims. Also web sites that allow peopl to contact others anonamously should be monitorede or even outlawed, these sites make it harder to find stalkers that hide behind these sites .\r\nMaybe stalking should be classed as a form of terrorism and be treat as such.\r\nTHERE NEEDS TO BE A CHANGE IN THE LAW AND WE NEED IT SOON",
