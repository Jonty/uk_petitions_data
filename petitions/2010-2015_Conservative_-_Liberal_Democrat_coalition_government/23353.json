        "additional_details": "we the undersigned demand clearer and tougher sentences for those convicted of animal cruelty and neglect. It has been proven through vigorous research that many animal abusers go on to abuse children and commit further acts of depravity and violence, we the representatives of animal rights demand that the government polices and sentences animal abusers according to the gravity of the crime and introduce minimum custodial sentences for proven malicious abuse to animals. Further to this we demand that you as the government introduce a register for animal abusers much like the pedophile register and that all those convicted of animal abuse should remain on that register and without rights to ownership of any animal once on this list and for the duration of their lives.",
