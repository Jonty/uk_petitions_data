Years have past and every thing and every one has to change to keep up with the times but certain aspects of the NHS form it's core and the above statement is one of them. Patients attending A&E departments can't even think about getting their illness/injury treated before geting a car parking ticket for fear of a car park attendant harassing them about the car park ticket! Further why does England have the charges and not Wales and Scotland. Why are we in England subsidising the NHS for the people in Wales and Scotland.\r\nAbolish car park charges within NHS establishments in England",
