        "additional_details": "Nine months ago, the voters of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire voted for a UKIP MEP to represent them in the European Parliament. It was the political parties themselves that then decided the individuals who would represent them if the party was successful in the elections.\r\n\r\nIt is completely undemocratic when the voters voted for UKIP, to find themselves just 9 months later with a Conservative MEP.\r\n\r\nBecause UKIP won the election and not Amjad Bashir, he should be made to stand down and replaced with another UKIP MEP.",
