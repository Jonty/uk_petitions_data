        "additional_details": "Bounty Club representatives are allowed on maternity wards to make direct contact with new mothers outside visiting hours often harassing them when they have just given birth and still groggy from drugs and before relatives can visit and even  when they are feeding their baby.  They pressurise mothers into giving away contact details which are then passed onto numerous companies to sell them product and services.  They lie to the mothers saying that they can only obtain the Child Benefit form from Bounty Packs and also harass them into allowing their newborn to be photographed often lying it's for security purposes.  The photos are expensive and amateurish.",
