        "additional_details": "All MPs are currently forced to swear allegiance to a hereditary dynasty, even if they have no belief (or interest) in the monarchy.  Parliament should debate an alternate voluntary oath whereby MPs can instead take their seats swearing allegiance to their country, their constituents' best interests, and their own consciences. An oath that all MPs can honestly swear is a step towards greater integrity in public life. Such an oath would clearly state why MPs are elected and whom they should serve.",
