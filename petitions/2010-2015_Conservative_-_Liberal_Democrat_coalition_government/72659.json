This is because developers force through planning on cheap land to build expensive properties.\r\n\r\nThis could be readdressed when all brown field sites and redundant sites are used and when technology has developed in such a way to make such development viable.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State should always look at the history of flooding in the area before over turning local planners.",
