        "additional_details": "Everybody in the nation deserves the right to a good broadband speed, rather than investing vast amounts of money into super fast broadband for a lucky few the government needs to ensure everybody has access to broadband speeds comparable to the national average of  6.2Mbit/s (2010). In rural areas or in remote villages and towns its rare to see speeds over 1Mbit/s with a vast majority of people seeing speeds barely faster than dial up speeds. Therefore the government should set a legal requirement for ISP's to provide a minimum broadband speed to the entire nation, of at least 2Mbit/s.",
