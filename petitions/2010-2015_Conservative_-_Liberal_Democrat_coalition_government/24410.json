        "additional_details": "I, like probably several million of you were married in the 60's and 70's and went to work leaving our wives to look after the children. When we retired our wives were left with a paultry pension and were \"granted\" with a \u00a39.5K tax allowance. We, the \"bread winnners\" were given the same allowance. But we cannot offset our tax against our wive's allowance. During those years of rearing our offspring we were not afforded the huge allowances provided today yet we have to pay tax on our home provided child care. I appreciate that this may also apply to wives working as well as husbands during this period.",
