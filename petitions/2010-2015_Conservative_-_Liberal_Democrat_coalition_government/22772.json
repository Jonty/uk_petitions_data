        "additional_details": "Theresa May is incompetent and has blamed her bad decisions on an innocent man and used him and many other people as pawns in her so called career in Government and she should hand in her notice immediately and opt out of any kind of bonus , extra pension or any other benefit that she is due to receive because she has let herself down and the whole country .We as tax payers all know this is her mistake and she is throwing every excuse out to shift the blame from herself . She has been caught out telling lies before and will be caught out again on this subject. If she was not trying to get her picture taken all the time with the PM and for the news papers maybe she would have done a better job . She should leave her job NOW instead of blaming everyone else for HER mistakes .  ",
