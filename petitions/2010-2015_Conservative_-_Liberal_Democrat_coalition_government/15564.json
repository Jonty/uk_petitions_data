        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon Her Majesty\u2019s Government to end the hypocrisy of the gender pay gap in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and to begin actively pursuing a course to remedy this inequality. At all levels of our society, in the public and private sectors, men and women should be paid equally for equal work by their employers. The Chartered Management Institute\u2019s revelation that the pay gap between female and male managers has widened to an average of \u00a310,546 exemplifies this ingrained inequality. We believe it has no place in the 21st Century and asking women to wait almost 100 years for salaries to equalise is unacceptable.",
