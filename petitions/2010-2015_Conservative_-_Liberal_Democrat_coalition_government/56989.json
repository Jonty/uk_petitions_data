        "additional_details": "We call for the creation of a Federalised system for the UK as a whole so each member of the union has there own speakers,  each state would be split into seperate states to give voices on local issues and more controls to local governments but the UK government remains  to oversee aspects such as defence and foreign policy. This will benefit all members of our union and potentially save the United Kingdom in todays climate ",
