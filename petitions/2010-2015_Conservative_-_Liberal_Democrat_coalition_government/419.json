        "additional_details": "The Humber Bridge debt has been paid many times over since its construction. We pay the highest crossing toll in the country yet the region  holds the record of having the most unemployed people chasing every available job. With new eco opportunities soon to become available on both banks of the Humber Estuary the bridge toll barrier must be lifted by abolishing the debt.",
