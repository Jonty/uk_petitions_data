Under the Tory government there is a continued role of the private sector, the risk of increased bureaucracy and what to do with failing parts of the NHS.  The bill as it is will end the NHS as we know it.  We will be thrust into a privatised system of care which favours the rich.  Where poorer people will not have access to the care which they need because they cannot afford it.  The Health Bill is being pushed in so quickly it had in one day 1000 + amendments yet is already in its third reading.  We must have a say as to what happens to our NHS before it is too late.  Let the public who pay for it through taxes and use the service be the voice for what happens to it.",
