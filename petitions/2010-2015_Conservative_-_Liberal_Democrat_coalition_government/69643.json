        "additional_details": "The new Milbury Reach housing estate was built without the necessary improvements to the local broadband network infrastructure.\r\n\r\nNow that hundreds of families moved-in, the network exchange is overpopulated and the service is considerably below the minimum modern standards.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there aren't other alternatives in the area and BT doesn't have any plans to upgrade the exchange. This leaves hundreds of families without something that is an essential tool for education, communication and entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this petition is to gather enough support within the residents, local government and central government, to influence BT to upgrade the outdated equipment.",
