        "additional_details": "Seen as though soldier's are working their socks off. They are risking their lives to fight for our country; 1 or more of our soldiers get shot every week. How can they get a lower wage than people running around a field kicking a ball for our entertainment? Soldiers need to provide for their family; they don't get enough money anyway for their family whereas footballers and actors and actress' have too much money that they start to take drugs because they don't know what to do with it. Instead of them buying drugs, they should give it to charity or to the ones that actually need it. I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THE SOLDIERS WAGES HIGHER AND PROBABLY THE FOOTBALLERS/ACTORS/ACTRESS' LOWER! Thank you for reading. Best wishes.",
