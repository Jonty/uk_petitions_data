        "additional_details": "If we were to remove the need to charge for the use of the Tube system, the need to spend money on electronic barriers, ticket offices and ticket inspectors would no longer exist.  The resources used for these purposes could be better used in maintaining the system itself and to provide better customer service for all users, as well as saving a considerable amount of money.  By removing the element of money, TFL, the London Mayor and Assembly would be in a better position to justify the charges made for the Congestion Charge to those transport users insisting on using the roads for personal transport.\r\n\r\nIf we were to make all public transport free in London, TFL would be in a position to change it's status to a non-profit making body, making further monetary savings.   The onus would then shift on to the public to justify the use of personal transport when a free transport system is in place.",
