        "additional_details": "We are petitioning the government to introduce student style payback schemes to cover the cost to public services that are incurred through crime.\r\n\r\nThe amount that criminals currently have to pay back is tiny, in comparison to what they cost the country. The prospect of having to pay back a proportion of their earnings or benefits over up to 25 years is a massive deterrant.\r\n\r\nMy father was recently assaulted - the cost of this will be huge including the police who have had to deal with the case, A&E, GP's, he will need an operation, as well as the courts being involved.\r\n\r\n",
