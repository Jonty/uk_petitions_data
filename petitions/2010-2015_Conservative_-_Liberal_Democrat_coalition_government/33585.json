        "additional_details": "In the light of past students involved in nasty road traffic accidents on Brinkley Grove Road, we are campaigning for a road crossing to be put in along this road.  We are asking for Essex County Council to set up a crossing near the Gilberd School to ensure a safe crossing onto Langdale Drive and beyond.  This crossing would also benefit younger students from primary schools in surrounding areas.  We would be grateful if you could add weight to this vital campaign by asking the members of your immediate and extended family to complete this petition.  We will then present this petition to the necessary authorities, with support from Ward councillors Oxford, Turrell and Goss and endorsed by Mr Bob Russell MP.",
