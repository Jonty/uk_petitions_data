        "additional_details": "Cervical cancer is one of the only preventable cancers. However because of the law stating women cannot attend cervical screening until the age of 25 (in England) many women under 25 showing symptoms are being refused. This leads from women having abnormal cells that can be treated to finding out later in life that they have cervical cancer and in some cases sadly losing their life.\r\n\r\nIf you went to the doctors stating symptoms that related to other illnesses/diseases it would be investigated so why should your age affect you being investigated for a life threatening illness/disease. One that could be prevented if caught early enough.\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be changed to stop so many young lives being lost.",
