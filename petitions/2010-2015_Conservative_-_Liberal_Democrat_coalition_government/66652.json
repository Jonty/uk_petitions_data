        "additional_details": "Monosodium Glutamate is given to mice to make them obese and to give them type 2 diabetes. it is also responsible for making humans obese and giving them type 2 diabetes. it is also believed to be responsible for some dementia's, a rise in mental health issues including ADHD and autism.\r\n\r\nIts only benefit in processed foods is to make bad food taste good, and for that reason I believe that it should be banned as a food additive.\r\nMonosodium Glutamate shortens lives, and creates health conditions that reduce the quality of life for millions of people. Please support this e-petition, please spread and share and make this viral, many lives depend upon it. if you are uncertain, research msg obesity, msg dementia, msg diabetes, etc even check out msg mice on google images, it will shock you.\r\nI ask the department of health to ban the use of msg in any of its forms, it also has over 50 names including yeast extract, soy sauce, etc.\r\nThank You\r\n",
