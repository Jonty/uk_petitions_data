Many people here use Skateboards, BMX's and scooter but the problem is no one has anywhere to use these. The two possible places to hang on on these is either the Comprehensive school or at the top of the local tescos. Where ever we go we are constantly moaned at and sent away. We have contacted Swansea Council but they keep ignoring us, we just need something to do.",
