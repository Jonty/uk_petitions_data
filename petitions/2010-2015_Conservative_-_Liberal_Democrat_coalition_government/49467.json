They are distributed like the architecture of the internet, designed to function when parts of it are destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe final goal a one world government, a government with no recognition of sovereignty, no recognition of family traditions or religious belief. A world government of the unelected who recognize only their god, their agenda, and the goals of the secret societies they frequent.\r\n\r\nIt is the wish of the people that an independent unbiased public investigation without ties to Freemasonry be carried out and those guilty of crimes against humanity be brought to justice and regulation must be put in place to unveil the mask of secrecy that exist in every part of public service.\r\n\r\n",
