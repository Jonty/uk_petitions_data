It would allow young couples and singles to get their own place to live, and at a reasonable price.  They are quick to build and imagine the jobs it would create.  With modern techniques and technology in insulation etc., they could be made very \"green\" and cheap to run.\r\nYou never know, they could even last as long as the ones built after the last war.",
