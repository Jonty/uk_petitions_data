Too many Teachers are being allowed to teach our children in our schools today, who have disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism, Asperger\u2019s, teachers have very little or no understanding or knowledge of these conditions? We as parents wouldn\u2019t think it was acceptable for our children to be taught English or Maths in our schools by unqualified Teachers who had no knowledge or understanding of these subjects.  So why is it acceptable for a teacher to teach a child with disabilities who have no understanding, knowledge or training on the above diagnosis?\r\nEducate and Train all Teachers/LSA and SEN in School throughout England about ADHD, Autism, Asperger\u2019s so Teachers have a better understand so they are aware of their disabilities and the diffculties these children face. Stop Discrimination against our children in schools.\r\n",
