        "additional_details": "Castlebar Park currently has only a foot bridge that accesses both sides of the train station. More importantly it is the main link to Hathaway Primary School and Castlebar School.We also have a children centre which is widely used for numerous educational, emotional, social learning. Within this area are two large communities. Parents and carers use this bridge daily to access the schools, and currently leave their buggies on one side of the bridge or carry them over the bridge. Any person with physical diabilities, or wheelchair bound have no way of using this facility. We propose that the bridge is removed and replaced with a ramp style over carriage that will allow users to access the schools, childrens centre and train lines with wheelchairs, buggies, bikes and other items.",
