These riot police MUST have the authority to ACT BACK with FULL FORCE against any rioting behavior they witness.  This means the use of tear gas and water canon's if needed.  The police simply cannot stand by and watch these actions occur.  These thugs need to be shown their mindless acts of violence will be responded to with force - otherwise there is no reason for them to stop!",
