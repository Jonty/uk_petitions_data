The only exception should be a registered breeder or a registered animal shelter who will conduct home checks first.\r\n\r\nThese private adverts potentially are supplying criminal dog fighting gangs with cheap or free dogs.\r\n\r\nNot only are they helping criminal activity for a profit they are also playing a part in animal cruelty.\r\n\r\nRecently a dog was re homed through one of these ads that probably shouldn't have been homed with a family or at all. Sadly a young child died.\r\n\r\nAnimals should be re homed through animal shelters dedicated to behaviour and home checking, or returned to a breeder. ",
