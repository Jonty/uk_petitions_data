This international gathering presents world leaders with a once in a generation opportunity to put in place an internationally binding law of Ecocide that will outlaw the destruction of Earth's ecosystems.  This is about creating Earth Rights to protect our Planet, and a positive legacy to pass on to future generations.  Other world leaders are attending - let's persuade David Cameron to join them.",
