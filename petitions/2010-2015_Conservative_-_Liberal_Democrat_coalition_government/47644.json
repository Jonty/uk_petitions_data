        "additional_details": "With the demand for energy and its associated costs continuing to grow its imperative that Britain takes a world leading stance in renewable energy sources.\r\n\r\nI propose that all new build homes and buildings, irrespective of use, are fitted with solar panel roofs. This will allow Britain to become a world leader in Solar Panel technology and design and at the same time allow it to meet its obligations for renewable energy sources.  In addition the additional jobs created through an increase in the size of the solar industry within the UK will contribute positively towards the UKs recovering economy.",
