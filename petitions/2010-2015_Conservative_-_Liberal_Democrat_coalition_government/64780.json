        "additional_details": "Halal is the slaughter of animals, in accordance with religious dogma, by slitting the throat of a conscious animal and allowing it to bleed to death.\r\nThis practise, and any resulting sales, should be banned immediately. It is barbaric and cruel, and allowing it to perpetuate is pandering to ideology simply because it has religious significance.\r\nThis is not a racist petition, and I have no time for people who would seek to justify support of this petition in such terms. This is not about race in any shape or form, it is about religious ideology which is (often insidiously) being forced upon those without such convictions, and, more importantly, about protecting animals from unnecessary cruelty .",
