        "additional_details": "I am asking that the DWP revoke the following benefit reforms :\r\n-Introduction of PIP to replace DLA\r\n-introduction of Under occupancy tax\r\n-benefit claimants to have funding suspended when appealing a decision.\r\n\r\nReforms should only be put forward once extensive and highly publicised research by independent bodies are carried out.\r\n\r\nI believe the above reforms have not been thoroughly discussed with all concerned. The department do not seem to be aware of the huge negative impact these reforms will have on lives.\r\n\r\nI propose that:\r\nall social housing residents with one \"extra\" bedroom & are disabled, I'll or elderly should not be subject to ANY variation of the under occupancy tax.\r\n\r\nDWP should be heftily fined for getting a benefit decision wrong putting the onus on a correct decision first time.\r\n\r\nClaimants GP's should be mandatorily consulted on ALL disability/illness related benefits.\r\n\r\nPIP criteria for highest rate mobility should be the same as DLA",
