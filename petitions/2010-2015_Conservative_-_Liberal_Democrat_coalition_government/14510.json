The UK spends millions in charitable donations every year. Sentencing young people to x number of hours of community work does not educate that person and does not in anyway give them any kind of life autonomy. My suggestion is to get them to contribute to a much wider cause, working with these Charitable Organisations all over the world. The best Education is absorbed first hand through the realization. Unfortunately people seeing poverty on the News and Media do not realize what it means and make a comparable decision as to what it means.   ",
