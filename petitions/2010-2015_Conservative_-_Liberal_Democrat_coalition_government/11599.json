I want to start a campaign to reintroduce (paid) compulsory National Service for any youth (male and female) who is either not actively seeking or in full time work or serious and meaningful education. I believe this will instill the necessary discipline and respect, pride in their country and self esteem in themselves that is quite obviously and shamefully not part of their lives. I am not suggesting that they simply learn to be 'soldiers', but that they are taught and trained under strong army supervision, enforced with strong and zero tolerant discipline how to be decent law abiding members of society, and hopefully rejoin society; literate, drug dependant free and with a trade and/or skill.\r\n\r\n",
