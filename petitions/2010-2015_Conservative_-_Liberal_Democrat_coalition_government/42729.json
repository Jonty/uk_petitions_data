        "additional_details": "Two little thought experiments: 1) would the value of a property greatly fall if  it happened to be located in a neighbourhood where no local services (street cleaning, refuse collection etc.) are provided? Yes it would. 2) if a property is habitable but vacant and legally owned by an identifiable landlord, would the council tax still be payable on the part of the landlord? Yes, it would.\r\nHowever, local services are a Public Good, in this respect landlords are acting as free riders, enjoying the benefits of the local services which help to maintain a tidy an functioning neighbourhood thus contributing towards the value of the property itself, without paying any price for it.\r\nTherefore the proposal is simple, whoever legally owns the property pays the council tax in order to provide for services that help underpin the value of the property itself in the neighbourhood in which it is located.
