        "additional_details": "There is an ever increasing number of accidents caused by car drivers failing to see, and thus hitting motorcyclists and cyclists.\r\nYou can educate drivers as much as you want, but what would really help is if everyone did some time on 2 wheels. Speaking to friends I find that most car drivers simply don't know \"how\" to look for bikes.\r\nBeing on a bike would greatly increase the amount of empathy for motorcyclists/cyclists, awareness, and general understanding.\r\n\r\nAlso, small engine motorcycles produce far less emissions than cars, and it would prevent young and inexperienced drivers crashing and killing all of their friends in accidents in cars - they would gain experience on the road on a motorcycle.",
