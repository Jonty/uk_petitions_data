This is despite the fact that Andrew Lansley and those at the DoH do not pay anything like this much into their pensions.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that all politicians and civil servants should also pay the same rate of contribution as doctors, unless the government decides that the increased rate for doctors is grossly unfair and is scrapped.",
