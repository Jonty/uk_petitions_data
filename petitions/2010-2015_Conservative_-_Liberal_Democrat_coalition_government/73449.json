        "additional_details": "This is a petition to Warrington Borough/Lymm Parish Council for funds to install some safe and secure swing gates to each of the 3 entrances/exits of the May Queen Playing Field in Lymm, Cheshire.\r\n\r\nAs many local residents will know this is a popular area for dog walkers and families of all ages, not forgetting the main hosting ground for the May Queen festival in June each year.\r\n\r\nThe current state of the field is semi secure, but as many local residents know, more could be done to make this a safer exercise area for small children and dogs. 2 of the 3 exits are blind spot exits leading straight onto roads,  often dogs are running straight out of them and it is an accident waiting to happen. Please let's not wait and learn from one tragedy, and do something to prevent this before it occurs.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition you will be supporting the campaign for 3 more secure exits on Lymm May Queen Field.\r\n",
