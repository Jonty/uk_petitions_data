        "additional_details": "Many small local businesses are having their customers taken away by large corporate supermarkets that offer lower prices. However, the money from these supermarkets does not help support local families, but rich shareholders and staff that have been brought in from other branches and do not live in the area. We propose that these supermarkets do not infringe on local businesses and must be a minimum of 0.5 miles away from local businesses. We hope that this can reduce the 50% of local businesses that close within their first year of opening. ",
