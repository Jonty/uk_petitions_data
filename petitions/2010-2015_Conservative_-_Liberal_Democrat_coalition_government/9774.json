        "additional_details": "Remove the RIGHT of all prisoners to any and all non-essential items (including those brought in from outside), activities and food (standard food should be basic, cheap and preferably tasteless, standard activities should be basic books from a prescriptive list and forced exercise).  Introduce an electronic credit system that will allow prisoners to buy back these luxuries. Create a structure to allow all prisoners to earn credits by undertaking work, useful education etc and allow prison officers to punish bad behaviour by removing credits (in other words a fine).  Do NOT allow conversion to or from any form of physical cash or transfer of credit between prisoners.  Vary the rate of earning or the cost of luxuries based on the severity of crime, previous behaviour and effort of prisoner.",
