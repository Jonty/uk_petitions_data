The \u00a350m that was illegally channelled away from the government purse allowed this club to operate well beyond its means at a highly inflated level.\r\n\r\nThis has been to the detriment of the Government, Scottish Football and their own fans who now face seeing them going out of business.\r\n\r\nDespite knowingly taking on this \u2018risk\u2019 new owner Craig Whyte is now looking to steamroll the club through the legislative process whilst attempting to gain access to the top flight of the Scottish Game.\r\n\r\nRangers FC and their owners need to pay their dues, pay their taxes and take the full punishment that is imposed on them.\r\n",
