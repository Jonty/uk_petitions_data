        "additional_details": "This petition calls for any two consenting adults to be allowed to marry, regardless of their gender or biological sex. Unlike marriages, civil partnerships are often not recognised internationally, and in addition those in civil partnerships do not experience the same rights as married couples do. Ultimately, the fact that love is experienced between two people of the same gender, or indeed where one or both of them may be transgender, should be recognised in the legal system by allowing these couples the right to marry.",
