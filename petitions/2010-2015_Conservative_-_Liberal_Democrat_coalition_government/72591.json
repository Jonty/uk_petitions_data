Mr Grewal had gone to India to settle a property dispute in the Punjab courts and he was last seen alive on 16th May 2013.\r\n\r\nHis brother, Jaswant Singh, 64, was arrested, held and later found guilty of murdering Mr Kulwant Singh Grewal. Currently Jaswant is on bail in India, however, has since returned to the UK.\r\n\r\nJaswant has NOT carried out his sentence for his crime in India, but is now living freely back in the UK. Where is the Justice?\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to help and support Mr Grewal's Wife and Family to find Justice so that they are able to move on with their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
