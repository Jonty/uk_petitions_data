        "additional_details": "Having suffered an injury at the birth of my daughter 3 years ago it has become apparent how dangerous forceps deliveries are, not only to the baby but too the mother also.\r\nForceps are used when there are factors preventing a natural birth and usually after a prolonged labour. By this time there has already been a huge amount of stress on the mothers body and although intervention is necessary, forceps should be seen as the method with the highest risk of injury.\r\nC-Sections are readily available and should be the only option towards the later stages of labour.\r\nForceps should be banned in the delivery room to prevent such deliberating injuries or at the very least pregnant ladies should be advised of the rarely spoken about injuries associated with forceps. All mothers deserve to be able to make an educated choice in the delivery method for their child.",
