        "additional_details": "More money should be given to arts as it is given to sport. You hear about sports scholarships, but what about students who act (and want to gain a degree in something different)? Many schools fund sports more than the arts, if a play is wanted to be put on - go ahead with limited money for props, costume ect, but a football match will be funded (majority of the time). Expressive arts gets people to socialise and build team work skills as much as sporting activities, but why are they funded less? More funding to the arts is what I propose. ",
