        "additional_details": "We believe that the government should fund the building of a series of power plants in which human beings power a wheel that turns a turbine, much like hamsters.\r\n\r\nThis would have several benefits.  Besides being a completely clean and renewable form of energy, it would also reduce unemployment and eliminate the epidemic of obesity that plagues our otherwise green and pleasant land.  It would also save the NHS money by reducing obesity-related ailments.\r\n\r\nI for one would be happy to do a few hours a week in the wheel as it would save gym membership fees.\r\n\r\nWe realise that this sounds pretty ridiculous, but is actually a plan with no drawbacks and many benefits.\r\n\r\nThankyou for your time",
