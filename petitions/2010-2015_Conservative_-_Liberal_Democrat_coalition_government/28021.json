        "additional_details": "At the moment a house bought for \u00a3250,000 falls into the 3% stamp duty bracket and would cost the purchaser \u00a37,500. A purchase for \u00a3249,999 falls in the 1% bracket and would only cost \u00a32499.99.  This skews the market and leaves homes in the \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3275,000 price bracket very difficult to sell. Making stamp duty progressive would drop the additional cost to the buyer of a \u00a3275,000 house from \u00a38,250 to \u00a33,250 making it much more affordable. It would also be fairer. I would like the government to make stamp duty on house purchases progressive in the same way that income tax is.",
