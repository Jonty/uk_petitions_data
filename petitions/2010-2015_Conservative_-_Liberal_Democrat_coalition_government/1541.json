        "additional_details": "All MP's should be more directly  and accessibly accountable to those that elect them.  Party politics often dictate how MP's should behave and vote when local electorate wishes should prevail. Thus, being able to recall an MP at any time within the life of a parliament gives power back to those who elected her or him.  A bill should be introduced as soon as possible and certainly within the lifetime of this Government making this power of recall legally binding.",
