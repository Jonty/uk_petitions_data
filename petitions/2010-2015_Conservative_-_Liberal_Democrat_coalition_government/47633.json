        "additional_details": "West Ham are set to take 60m of tax payers money to take the Olympic stadium which could potentially see the end of Leyton Orient due to close proximity. In such tight economic times its a complete and utter waste of our taxes. Not to mention the fact its biased over all existing Premier league clubs, some of which are finding times tough, unless West Ham are able to pay in full for the use of the stadium it should not end up in their posession.",
