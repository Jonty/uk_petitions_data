        "additional_details": "David Cameron said all migrants should learn that the Queen is a useless puppet, has no power, take no responsibility and she used in ceremonial occasions only. Many people also believe that monarchy brings income from tourism and most people believe that Queen has no other meaningful use.Sooner or later Scotland will become independent state, Wales most probably will follow. England suffers from lack of leadership. We haven't got a leader who will represent the country in a contemporary manner in a 21st century. England needs a modern professional leader who will take responsibility and deliver excellent value service to taxpayers in the country. For these reasons I propose to elect a President for England. Monarcy will be kept for tourists as usual.\r\n",
