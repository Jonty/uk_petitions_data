        "additional_details": "The overly aggressive and unnecessarily loud behaviour of politicians, in particular during PM question time has become unacceptable and is no longer  fit for the purpose of meaningful debate. It reduces elected representatives to verbal hooligans in the eyes of the electorate and any wider audience, however intelligent they may be.It is posturing and theatrical behaviour of the worst kind, designed to avoid addressing  significant issues. Such behaviour is one step away from that of rioters or football crowds who are usually considerably younger and often have less personal control. It is tiresome for any listener. It is time for a fundamental review of acceptable codes of parliamentary behaviour including how standards will be monitored, thus ensuring a meaningful debate of a high quality and principled leadership",
