        "additional_details": "Under radical proposals by a former advisor to David Cameron, children could be made to stay in school for nine hours a day - 45 weeks of the year. The scheme would see holidays slashed from thirteen weeks a year to just seven, and stretch the average school day from around 9am to 6pm. The former head of the Number 10 Policy Unit suggests his ideas would boost education standards, cut crippling childcare costs, allow millions of mums to return to full-time work, and even slash youth crime by taking troublemakers off the streets. We want to know what you think? Is this is a good idea, or a leap too far? please sign if you want the government to scrap this idea",
