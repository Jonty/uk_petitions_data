        "additional_details": "Secret justice could become a regular feature of British courts and tribunals when the intelligence services want to protect their sources of information.\r\n\r\nCivil courts, immigration panels and even coroner's inquests would go into secret session if the Government rules that hearing evidence in public could be a threat to national security.\r\n\r\nThe proposals, which run counter to a centuries-old British tradition of open justice, were introduced to a sparsely attended House of Commons yesterday by the Justice Secretary, Ken Clarke\r\n\r\nWe must show out total opposition to these proposals",
