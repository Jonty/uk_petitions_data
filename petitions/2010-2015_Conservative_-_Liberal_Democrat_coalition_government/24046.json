        "additional_details": "Having drained an already dying enterprise within the British Isles, the governments scheme to cut Arts Council funding has begun to have a knock on effect, killing off the small time, and independent film makers, writers, producers, directors, Fringe Shows, artists etc. These may not be the big money makers the government want to see, but they are the heart of Britain, because without art, we are machines.\r\nThis e-petition is to direct money back into arts funding.",
