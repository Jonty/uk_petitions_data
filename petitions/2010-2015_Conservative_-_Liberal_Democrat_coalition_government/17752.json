        "additional_details": "My company, like many others give a yearly (if at all) pay rise to all employees, this is done in the form of a percentage of salary rise, this is wholely unfair to the lower paid, this year we were lucky enough to get a 1.5% pay rise, to the lowest paid in our company this is peanuts and will not even be enough to account for the cost of living increases year on year, whilst 1.5% of the salary of the highest paid in our company is a sizable sum for them and is ten times what the lowest paid get, I propose all pay rises should be a fixed sum for all employees, to help re-dress the balance between the highest and lowest paid, and help to stop employees falling below the bread line.",
