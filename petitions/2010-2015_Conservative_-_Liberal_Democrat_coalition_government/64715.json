        "additional_details": "Why are prison sentences automatically halved so that one half is spent in prison and the other on license? Because the government mandates this.\r\n\r\nJudges should have the authority to impose, remove and vary the entitlement of a prisoner to release on license according to the history of the convicted person and the nature of the crime.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks for judges to have the control when sentencing.",
