This is bad manners and I would term this kind of behaviour \"cycling fascism\".  It should be made compulsory for cyclists to use hand signals to indicate where they are going to pedestrians and vehicular traffic. This is only common courtesy and will improve cycling safety. The police should also fine cyclists who cycle through red lights at speed (particularly if pedestrians are crossing).   ",
