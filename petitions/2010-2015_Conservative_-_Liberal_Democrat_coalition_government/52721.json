We need to stop HGV's driving through London at peak times, making it dangerous for cylists on their commute.\r\n\r\nI propose that we ban HGV's from the roads during the times of 07:00-10:00 and 16:00-19:00 to allow commuters to get to and back from their place of work safely. Commuters usually cannot determine their own work times therefore have to use the roads during these busy hours. THESE HGV CAN NOT SEE US, and apart from being a danger to cyclists, they feel distressed when something does go wrong. Its not fair on both cyclists and HGV drivers.\r\n\r\nLets make London roads safer for all! ",
