        "additional_details": "Following Princess Anne's speech at the Horse Welfare Society I wish to start a petition against eating horses.  I feel the public should speak about this debate.  It is not for a member of the Royal Family to use their influence on this political issue.  Eating horses is not the answer to ending their suffering.   They will just become the next factory farmed animal on the list. I want the government to ensure that the United Kingdom remains a place where horses are not eaten for profit.",
