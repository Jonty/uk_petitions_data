        "additional_details": "I propose to ban of permitherin products being sold in unlicensed premises to animal owners.  Many companies produce flea treatment spot ons and collars which contain permitherin but they are not giving the correct information about the harmful chemical which they are using.  Permitherin is an ingredient used in cat flea collars and spot on drops but this can be fatal for some cats, as many can have an allergic reaction to this chemical.  It is my belief that consumers need to be given the correct information and know the dangers surrounding the contents of their purchases.  Many people buy these products under the illusion they are helping their animals, however in some cases can lead to their beloved pets death.  I believe the government should ban these products being sold to anyone in supermarkets where the staff have no knowledge about the products they are selling.",
