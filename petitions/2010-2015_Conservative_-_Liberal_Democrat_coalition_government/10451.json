        "additional_details": "When teenagers are committing crimes like an adult (crimes like rape, pre-planned murder, arson, rioting, looting, organized crime) they should be punished with same force of the law as for an adult offender. Physical age of teenager is not to be considered for these types of crimes. They are more matured in their mental age for which they are involved in these crimes. In many cases they take advantage of their 'under age' criteria and get away from harsher punishments. This should be stopped.",
