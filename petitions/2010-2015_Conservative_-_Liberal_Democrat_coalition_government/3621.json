These vouchers should allow jobseekers to redeem them for food, non-alcoholic drinks, rent and utilities. This would stop people exploiting the benefits system, and the generosity of the British taxpayer, to buy alcohol, cigarettes, satellite tv, etc, and encourage them to get a job if they want to enjoy luxury goods.",
