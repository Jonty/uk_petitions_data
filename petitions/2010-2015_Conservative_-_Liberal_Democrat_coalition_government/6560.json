If we had a vignette system such as that used in Switzerland, they could be charged an annual fee for driving on our roads. They could be colour coded like tax discs so you could instantly tell if a vehicle was using the correct vignette. These could either be bought at the port of entry or issued at Popst Offices. I am sure that this would bring in millions of badly needed income.",
