We have plenty of companies who could furnish these requirements and keep them authentic. As they are contributing to a project by paying taxes into a project and whether they agree with it or not they are benfiting for the sake of the British Isles.\r\nTo me this is another example of the mavericks who don't use their brains with regard to the British public or our economy.\r\n\r\nThis has be addressed urgently and we do not have months to do this!!",
