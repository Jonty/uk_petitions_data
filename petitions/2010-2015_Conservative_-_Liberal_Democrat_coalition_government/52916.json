Other councils have a discount in place or no benefits at all.\r\n\r\nThe points are should members of the Reserve Forces have the same access to fitness facilities as their Regular counterparts? and with physical fitness of the Reserve Forces generally lower than that of a Regular Regiment/Battalion should the government have all local authorities adopt a policy like Hyndburn Borough Council?",
