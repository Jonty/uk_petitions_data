        "additional_details": "Under the current system when a school is to receive a visit from Ofsted the schools give warnings to both teachers and students to \"be on their best behaviour\".\r\n\r\nThis creates a false positive on many school results. While schools should often act as they would during inspections many do not. From my experience (at a school that was put into special measures) the reforms and improvements came far too late.\r\n\r\nTherefore i suggest random unwarned spot checks on schools, visiting every school once or twice per year at random.\r\n\r\nIn addition are the issues of school lesson plans, at my old school there was never a plan and the plans that were falsely created for Ofsted inspectors were highly flawed, lacking in any real educational value but fitting the Ofsted guidelines.",
