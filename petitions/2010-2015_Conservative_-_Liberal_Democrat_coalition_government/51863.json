Only if they are kept in public hands so that WE can benefit from profits as opposed to private investors. Mr Osbourne keeps telling us we need to return the banks to the private sector but this is not in the best interests of the general public so we need to stop him. His decisions seem compromised by loyalty to the wealthy,  If banks are so profitable then why not keep at least a 50% share in the public hands.\r\nVote now to save our future!",
