        "additional_details": "The Petitioners are concerned that the four outstanding grammar schools in Southend  are facing an urgent funding crisis, as their two and three year budget forecasts show that they cannot\r\ncover the costs of all of their lessons;\r\nFunding Forum cannot close this gap and that successful schools such as the grammar schools in Southend are facing the worst cuts; further that the\r\nPetitioners recognise the fact that their schools have reduced staffing to the minimum, have stopped replacing equipment, while at the same time increasing class sizes and reducing the number of subjects taught; and lastly that the Petitioners believe that there is nothing left to cut.\r\n\r\n",
