        "additional_details": "For a number of years now the system of bestowing honors such as CBEs, OBEs etc has in the public eyes been brought into disrepute. Honors being given to people who have been very very well paid for what they have done or sports persons equally well paid achieving a one off award or celebs who seriously do not deserve an award. This petition calls on the Prime Minister to re evaluate who should recieve an honor on the basis that no one should recieve an award if they have had a criminal record, or donated over a certain amount of money to a political party or were very very well paid for what they did or achieved a one off sports acklade. The acids test for any recommendation for an honor should be charitable and deserving in the eyes of the public with no alteria motive, life long service to the communitee, service in HM forces  - awards allocated equal amoungst the ranks and for medical consultants / Specialist who have found cures.",
