        "additional_details": "Law and practise enforcement procedures to protect innocent members of the public via special mandatory law to take prints, swabs, samples and tests of UK citizens and visitors to the UK. Conceptions of justice, political legitimacy, and human flourishing are sought by many citizens and foreigners to realise their own human dignity and integrity, or well-being which is entirely free of any UN human rights. Such a new law would provide public protection favoring innocent members of the public and visitors to the UK. This law would identify dangerous sadistic criminals and sex tourists that tour the UK. There is currently more than 30, 000 registered sex offenders in the UK. This new law enforcement creates the most concise database available to Police Federation and Criminal Justice system. The current population in the United Kingdom, 62,641,000 - 2011 Source: World Bank. This e-petition needs 13, 000 signatures or more to make impact and lobby the new law in parliament.",
