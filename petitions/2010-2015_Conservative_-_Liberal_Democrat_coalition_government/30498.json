        "additional_details": "We are Campaigning against the use of children as soldiers in armed conflict and war. we found out that it is a global issue and more than 50% of people are unaware of it and the government hasn't taken any severe action against it or to stop it.\r\n It is an everyday issue and children 7- 18 all over the world are being forced to fight in their countries wars instead of getting an education. It is a terrible situation to be in for anyone, let alone a child. This must stop. We want the government to help reduce the amount of child soldiers that there are in the world.\r\nPlease sign our e-petition and help raise awareness on this issue and take action against it.\r\n",
