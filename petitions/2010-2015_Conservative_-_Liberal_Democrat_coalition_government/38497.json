        "additional_details": "The north east geographically closer to Edinburgh than Westminster.  Gordies have more in common with the Scots than southern England.\r\nLike the Scots, the North East has for years suffered from Westminster indifference, lack of investment, closing of vital industry, and important decisions which benefit the south and disadvantage the North. The North has been used by a number of politicians as a semi fascist experiment, wind farms being a prime example, very few in the south, thousands in the north and Scotland, the Olympics are another good example, very little benefit in the North and huge benefits for the South east. We call upon both the SNP and central government to consider this proposal by referendum during the term of this parliament.",
