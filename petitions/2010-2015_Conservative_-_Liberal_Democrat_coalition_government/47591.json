        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, ask this Government to help the medical professions including GP's, by means of financial support, education and research,  to have a better understanding of the condition 'Post Polio Syndrome'. To date, their knowledge is very\r\nlimited and this is very distressing and\r\nfrustrating for the patient who has Polio, to which there are an estimated 120,000 in these isles. GPs seem to be disinterest in this debilitating condition. They need to be educated, so instead of giving little or no support, they can give the appropriate support and help. They are being paid to treat us but we are not being offered the\r\nappropriate help to assist us in maintaining a more  healthy and balanced lifestyle. Polio is all but eradicated from the UK, but there are still around 120,000 people who have survived it and now face another challenge in their lives. Please, let's not forget them. ",
