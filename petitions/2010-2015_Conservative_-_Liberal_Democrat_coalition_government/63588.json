        "additional_details": "I propose that the Government investigate the viability and advantages of this proposal which would allow the granting of free off peak bus travel for those who are \u2018registered\u2019 homeless and qualify for night shelter access.\r\n\r\nThis would allow homeless people to visit family and friends, treatment centres and for a while, escape some places where they may be bullied or otherwise mistreated.\r\n\r\nA further added benefit would be that while travelling on a bus they would be dry, warm and comfortable during most of the hours of 7am to 7 pm when a night shelter is closed and have a change of scenery away from the town and city centres with opportunities for being led astray or congregating to cause a public nuisance?\r\nThey would also be less troubled by foot ailments and footwear problems\r\n",
