        "additional_details": "We wish to have the BBC removed from royal charter and create their own revenue through means other than licencing.\r\n\r\nThe BBC operate under a Royal Charter which they have not honoured with regards to the Jimmy saville scandal (see Royal Charter 23.a,b,c,d,e,f) or the duties of the Trust. In this charter the trust is to represent the interest of licence fee payers and ensure the constitution acts accordingly, openly and honestly and in the public interest, with regards to the recent scandal and ongoing police investigations they have shown nothing but disregard by helping with covering up this attrocity. We now live in a digital age and pay subscription fees to various broadcasters such as SKY, VIRGIN etc yet we are forced to pay a ficticious entity without a choice to receive a service.This is not in anyones interest but their own!!!",
