        "additional_details": "In September 2003 the B.B.C reported on a new craze sweeping the nation called \"Dogging\", involving sexually deranged people engaging in sexual acts in public places.  Also in 2003 the sexual offence act came into effect prohibiting sex in a public place. Clearly this was not enough to restore order to our nation because over ten years later and used condoms are still littering our streets and even our national parks!\r\n\r\nBringing these reprobates to justice is currently very difficult. Charges could be brought against them relating to exposure under the 2003 sexual offence act, but the policy of the Association of Police Officers is that arrest should be the last resort.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to address this problem immediately by making changes to the law and calling for robust policing in these respects or else we have no business calling our selves a civilized nation.",
