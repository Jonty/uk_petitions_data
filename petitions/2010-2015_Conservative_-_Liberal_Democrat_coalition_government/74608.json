        "additional_details": "It could as simple as adding a new programme to change4life, people ignore the fact that today's teenagers are dieting more than ever. In a world and society where ideas, opinions and stereotypes are at your fingertips, mass communication has changed the average teenagers concept of body image.\r\nOur group are currently doing GCSE Citizenship coursework about \"Diets in the Media\", we chose this subject because before our eyes society is becoming stricter and stricter on body image, especially for women. We recently launched a small survey in our school and found out that around 47% of girls had dieted! (These were girls aged 12-15) We were shocked at these results because we had honestly expected some people to lie because this is a personal issue, but it was almost a draw.\r\nPlease share and talk about this petition and cause anyway you can and help us raise awareness of this important issue.\r\n",
