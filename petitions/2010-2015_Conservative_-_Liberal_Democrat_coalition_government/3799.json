        "additional_details": "The death penalty is not a justification for any form of crime. If we are to live in a society of pragmatism and decent democracy based upon the fair values of justice then any form of reintroduction of the death penalty is purely uncharacteristic of not only British society but the world in general. The consensus against capital punishment is slowly but surely gaining ground around the globe for good reason. Let us not let populism take control of the agenda, let us be civil and not let the extremities of society dictate the course of reason. Let us ensure that something as barbaric and obsolete as the death penalty never take hold in this country again.",
