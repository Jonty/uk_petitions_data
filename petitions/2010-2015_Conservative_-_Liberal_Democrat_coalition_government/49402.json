Where judges suspect that one parent is implacably hostile to contact, they must appoint a specialist family psychologist or psychiatrist to report back in one month.\r\n3. Contact/residence cases should last no more than six months.\r\n4. To improve judicial continuity the case should be reserved to the first judge who sits at the first directions hearing.\r\n5. All judges, CAFCASS and other case workers should undertake a distance learning course on Parental Alienation.\r\n6. When a parent is found to be practising Parental Alienation there should be punishments put in place from fines to custodial sentances for extreme cases.",
