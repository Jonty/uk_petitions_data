This democracy has been won with great difficulty and we do not wish to lose it at what ever cost.   Living in a most democratic country in the world we need to protect our right to privacy of all the information that the Government has collected on us for driving licenses, passports, vehicles, supermarket shopping, scanning while getting in and out of airports, speeding cameras, tax purposes, banking purposes etc.\r\nIn order to protect our right to privacy we need make sure that the govt and other agency erase all the data on citizens who have minimal adverse records and make sure they do to sell this to private companies.  Please sign this petition so information is not sold or released at all to any one",
