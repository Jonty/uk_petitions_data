        "additional_details": "That HM government should re-instate the 50mph national speed limit in the interests of road safety for all road users and fuel economy, not only in the interests of road users, but also of the nation as well.\r\nFar too many die on our roads owing to excessive speed of drivers, lower speeds are easier to police and journey times are only marginally affected.\r\nAt a time of fuel shortage and high fuel prices the savings resulting from a 50mph limit are enormous and far outweigh any illusory notions of freedom being compromised by it.",
