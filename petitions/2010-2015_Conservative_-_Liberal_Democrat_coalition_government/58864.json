        "additional_details": "Owen Paterson, the Environmental Secretary is proposing to allow property developers to destroy ancient woodland sites in exchange for an offset agreement to plant a larger number of trees elsewhere.  An ancient woodland is more than just a number of trees, it is a whole bio-diversity that cannot simply be replaced elsewhere. Planting 10 new trees for everyone destroyed will not re-create what you have lost., unless you are willing to wait 400 years or more.",
