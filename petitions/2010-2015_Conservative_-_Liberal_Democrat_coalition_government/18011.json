It is a requirement of their jobs to have this vaccination otherwise they cannot work.\r\n\r\nUnder current Government rules they are not entitled to any compensation from the outdated Vaccine Damage Compensation scheme, which is despicable given that their lives have been ruined through no fault of their own.\r\n\r\nMore than 150 MP\u2019s have lent their support to demands for a better deal for these victims, yet nothing has been done to help them.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health must investigate the reported serious side effects to this vaccine, review the current compensation system and help the victims suffering awful debilitating illnesses due to receiving the vaccination.\r\n",
