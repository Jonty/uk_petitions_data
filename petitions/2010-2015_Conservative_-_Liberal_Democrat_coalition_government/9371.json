The parents should be made to undertake  community service, ie. picking up litter and graffiti removal to pay for any offences their child has committed or damage they cause.  When a dog does the toilet in the street, 'you', the dog owner are responsible in cleaning up, as the dog can't, or you're libel for a fine, this should also be the case for adults and their children.",
