We need to stand up for them! Animals suffer in pain and die without any justice! What's a few months in prison? Murderers are murderers end of. We need to wise up and start realising animal cruelty cannot go in forever. We need to act now.\r\nI want to see these \"people\" who abus animals have bigger sentences than a few months. We are to easy on these so called \"people.\" THEY SHOULD DO THE SAME TIME FOR KILLING AN INNOCENT ANIMAL AS THEY WOULD A HUMAN BEING!\r\nIf we act now, we can minimise the chances of animal cruelty.\r\nThank you for reading and I hope use take this into deep consideration!",
