        "additional_details": "I would like to see all Payday Loans made illegal, These companies do little to check if a person can realistically afford to repay them and when they cannot they hit them with outrageous charges that can equat to \u00a310 or more a day, further plunging a person into unpayable debt. Most companies dont allow repayment plans, Will not freeze charges and interest and Only insist on full repayment immediately otherwise use threat of legal action against you. On top of this you have to constantly phone them on high rate call numbers and wait an age to speak to someone, who is generally rude and unhelpful.These companies are outlawed in some states in the US and we should rid our country of them too.",
