They are also expensive to the tax payer and new spaces are limited meaning many people don't end up with the length of sentence they really deserve.\r\n\r\nWhy don't we save the country alot of cash protecting the human rights of people who couldn't care less about the rights of their victims by offering the sentences up for open bidding by the prison systems of poorer countries?\r\n\r\nI am sure that if someone realises raping a baby or running over and stabbing a soldier means 25 years in a Nigerian jail for example they might really think twice before committing the crime. These poorer nations will jump at the chance to earn the extra cash from us.",
