        "additional_details": "The Government (UKBA) should review its policies and consider  allowing foreign who have contributed National Insurance (NI) for a number of years and also  positive contributions to the community e.g voluntary services to stay in the UK. A number of foreign nationals who entered the United Kingdom legally and have maintained contact with the UKBA to avoided overstaying their visas have now been affected by the change of policies making them have no legal status. The change of policies should aim not to affect those who already have entered the UK already as it is costly to the government in getting them out off the country than allowing them to stay and continue contributing to nation through paying taxes, NI , sharing of knowledge and diverse expertise.
