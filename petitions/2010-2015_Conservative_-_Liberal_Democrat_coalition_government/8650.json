        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the increase of representation of the people in national politics. Replacing the appointed - and therefore, undemocratic - members of the House of Lords with a compulsory 3 month term of service by members of the public would, in one stroke, re-engage society with national democratic institutions. The rules would be similar to those of Jury service, inasmuchas exceptions could apply for people for whom it was difficult to meet the requirement. The funding used to run the House of Lords would be used instead to cover the costs of people's wages, travel and the like. Some practical difficulties could be overcome by using multi-media technology, e-conferencing and so on. A much broader representation of the population would be engaged as a result of the creation of The People's Parliament.",
