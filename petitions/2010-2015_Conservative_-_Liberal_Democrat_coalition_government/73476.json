        "action": "High Intensity Discharge Headlights Require More Research",
        "additional_details": "Modern High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlights dazzle oncoming drivers and may be linked to eye disorders. This petition demands that the government immediately initiates independent research into the effect of headlight brightness, including LED, HID and halogen headlights on oncoming traffic and into eye related health concerns from these lights. This research will not be funded by any car manufacturer or headlight manufacturer or party with vested interests in the technology. It also demands that the government collects and publishes statistics to analyse the rate of any accidents at night involving a road vehicle since the introduction of HID and LED headlights and whether headlight brightness may have been a factor.",
