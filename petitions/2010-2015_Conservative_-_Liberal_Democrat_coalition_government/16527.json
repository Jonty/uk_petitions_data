These people can't get jobs, can't easily cope with everyday life and many wind up in our prisons.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask government to set a target date of 2025 to achieve universal basic literacy and numeracy for children leaving secondary school, to report annually on the performance of every school in this regard and to provide both sanctions and appropriate funding for schools that fail to improve toward this goal.",
