        "additional_details": "On 9 September 2013, the London-based Hammarskj\u00f6ld Commission reported that there was \"significant new evidence\" about the plane crash that killed United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and recommended that the adjourned 1962 UN Inquiry should now be reopened.\r\n\r\nUN Assistant Secretary-General Bernt Carlsson was the highest profile victim on Pan Am Flight 103 which was sabotaged over Lockerbie on 21 December 1988.\r\n\r\nSince Bernt Carlsson's death has never been investigated, the British Government should propose extending the remit of the new UN Inquiry to cover the deaths of both senior diplomats: Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld and Bernt Carlsson.",
