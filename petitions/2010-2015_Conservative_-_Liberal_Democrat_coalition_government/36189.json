        "action": "End UK reliance on 'the city' and the financial sector",
        "additional_details": "The government must stop pandering to lobbying from the City and immediately investigate more sustainable and stable ways  to make Britain great once more.\r\n\r\nThe city has let the nation down, lined it's own pockets and created economic instability.  The majority of ordinary hard working UK tax payers are suffering because of this.\r\n\r\nAny new incentives / investments should DIRECTLY support economic stability for the majority of British tax payers.\r\n\r\nBecoming increasingly dependant on financial revenues is NOT representing the interest of the public.  Supporting a clearly failed financial system that supports only a few is in direct opposition of the constitution and the governments elected role.",
