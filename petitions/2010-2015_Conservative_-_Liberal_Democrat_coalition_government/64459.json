        "additional_details": "After the tragic loss of a talented teacher yesterday can we STOP the increasing violence experienced in schools?\r\n My INFANT SCHOOL teacher colleagues and I are subject to spitting, biting, punching, kicking and attacks using scissors!\r\nWe are failing children, failing those who want to learn but who are denied attention from their teachers because of the violence and disruption that pervades every classroom!\r\nThere are many troubled children with underlying problems who need to be guided in developing social skills such as empathy and compassion first! We need a return to more specialist schools and emotional and behavioural units within schools to address this escalation in violent and disruptive behaviour.\r\nI would urge the Govt to fund and reopen specialist schools and units within existing schools. Please sign this petition so that we stop failing the children of this country and please sign it to prevent another teacher being murdered by a 'disruptive' pupil!",
