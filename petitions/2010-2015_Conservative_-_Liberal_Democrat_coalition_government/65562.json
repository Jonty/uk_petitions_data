        "additional_details": "In the build up to the European Parliament Elections 2014 the BBC gave large amounts of air- time to the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) that were disproportionate to the air time given to other political parties of similar standing. We, the undersigned, believe that the BBC, as a publicly funded body, answerable to government, ought to be unbiased and show no favouritism to any political party. We propose that an investigaion be launched to ascertain the truth behind if and why UKIP were seemingly favourably covered. ",
