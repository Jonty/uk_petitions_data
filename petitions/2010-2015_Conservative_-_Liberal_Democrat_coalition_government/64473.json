Pushing mothers to go out to work and therefore to need childcare is counterproductive.\r\n\r\nThe family is the vital and basic unit of society and needs to be protected and defended. By 'farming out' the raising of our children to nurseries and creches with are distancing ourselves from them and creating a generation without love or respect for their parents or for society.\r\n\r\nI want the government to allow all the same benefits to mothers who choose to stay at home with their children as to those mothers who choose to work.\r\n\r\nDon't make or support policies that penalise (financially or practically) mothers who choose to take care of their own children.
