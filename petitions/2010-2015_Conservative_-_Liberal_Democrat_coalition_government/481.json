        "additional_details": "My wife and I are absolutely appalled to hear Ecclestone's proposal for a future second-rate coverage of Formula 1 on BBC.  We pay our licence fee to see it live on BBC 1 and that is how it should stay.  Seeing highlights is useless especially now that the Pirelli tyre situation requires minute-by-minute changes to race strategies.  We realise that Murdoch and Ecclestone are working together to try to milk the British public but the government must intervene to block Sky's dominance.",
