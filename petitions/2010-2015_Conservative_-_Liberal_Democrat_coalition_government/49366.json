        "additional_details": "As Britons, we have a rich inheritance of chivalry, honour and gallantry. An integral component for millennia was an individuals ability to bear his arms.\r\n\r\nThe popularisation of firearm use in the 18th and 19th century began to destroy this great tradition that defined generations of our ancestors. As it eased our ability to kill another man in combat.\r\n\r\nI see no reason why the barbaric use of firearms should make our heritage made ill, and have our right to bear swords, and similar arms, as illegal.\r\n\r\nArms, and ones ability to wield them, once symbolised the honour and integrity of an individual. It also strengthens the ability for one to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to legalise our right to bear armaments (swords and similar arms) in public. It should be subject to regulation, especially for those who have criminal records and mental-health problems.",
