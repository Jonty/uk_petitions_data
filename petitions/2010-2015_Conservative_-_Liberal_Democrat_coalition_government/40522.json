        "additional_details": "The benefit system is constantly being hyped up by government after government, with the same persistent tone 'we will change people's perceptions on benefits, and get people back to work'.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the unfortunate people who were perhaps been made unemployed or redundant because of factors beyond their control. Then I believe the current system should be upheld.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, for persistent 'benefit-receivers' that have been out of work for longer than 6 months I think we as a country should implement a voucher system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis would reduce the amount the job seekers spend tax payers money on drugs, alcohol and cigarettes.",
