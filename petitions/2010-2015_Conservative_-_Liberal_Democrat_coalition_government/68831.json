That there be a formalised and publicised accountability inspection of local authorities carried out in relation to the Children & Families (C & F) Bill specifically;\r\nHow well local authorities are upholding the principles in delivery of a  Parent Carer and Young People Special Education Needs and Disability Advisory Service,\r\nHow they are supporting and widening Parent Participation in developing Services\r\n-and-\r\nSupport offered to parents to participate meaningfully in Co-production of Education Health and Care Plans .\r\n\r\n2.  Explain clearly why such formalised approach  cannot be made. Transparency is essential as parental and carer confidence in the system is low\r\n",
