The requirement that these words be removed from religious ceremonies and documents is wrong.\r\nThis proposal did not form a part of any election manifesto in 2010.\r\nWe demand that the government scraps these proposals immediately.\r\nThat demand has nothing to do with homophobia. It has everything to do with concerns that ethical correctness is being replaced by political correctness, and that a proposal is being introduced for which the government has no mandate.\r\nThis is neither morally right, nor democractically acceptable.",
