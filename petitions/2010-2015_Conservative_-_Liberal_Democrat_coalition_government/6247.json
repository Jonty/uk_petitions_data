It's lower carbon footprint will improve the UKs emissions and the tax on it should be less as such. Fast food places could sell used cooking oil back to councils for a small fee who then can process large amounts of oil for cheaper than an individual and sell the results back to the comsumer. This could provide cheaper fuel for many motorists and a small amount of revenue for local councils and businesses ",
