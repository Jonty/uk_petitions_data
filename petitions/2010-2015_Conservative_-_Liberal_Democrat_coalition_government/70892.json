Places like football grounds, music venues, airports, even some bars. We need to stop this practices but allow normal pubs to stay in business.\r\n\r\nThe government should bring in a law to cap the price of a pint of drink with alcohol content of less than 5.5% to \u00a34. This would be a simple way to help everyone with limited income to still enjoy a drink whereever they go.",
