These people caused the damaged, so they should be responsible for repairing/cleaning our towns and cities. Our prisons are already overcrowded and those people who looted/caused damage hopefuly will have a sense of community if they become part of restoring it. They could help to organise and build new youth centres, which should give them a sense of responsibility and belonging to their community.",
