        "action": "For it to be made illegal for one parent to suddenly stop contact with a child without good reason",
        "additional_details": "After 5 years of having my daughter 3 nights a week my ex partner suddenly stopped me seeing my daughter because she did not like the look of my new house.  Although my name is on the birth certificate she was able to stop contact for around six weeks as interim contact has to go through court . This puts a massive emotional strain on a person and has a huge impact on theirs and the childs life.  Sign this petition if you think it should be illegal for the parent with full custody to stop the parent with contact from seeing their children without reasonable cause.",
