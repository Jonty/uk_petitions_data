She tried to ride the storm and avoid asking for benefits but things did not improve.  She applied for JSA only once she was desperate and was told that because she did not sign on the year before and her NI contributions were unpaid, she is not eligible for JSA.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal at Appeal said no NI = no benefits, and that they have NO discretion to consider the facts.  The Tribunal should be given the discretion to judge each case on its merits.  We all know that there are some more deserving than others.  I'm not sure that I can think of a more deserving case.",
