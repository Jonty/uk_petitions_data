        "additional_details": "The government must stop and look at the direction it has taken over the last few years. Currently it tells us, the people of the UK what we should do, or say and how we should behave. The MP's are elected to be our voice. To represent us, the people. Not control and dictate how we should live.They should be doing what the people of the nation want- We, The People, Are The Majority!\r\nWhat i want is honesty. No bluffing, or spinning... Maybe it is time for a new party made up of the people, for the people???\r\nWith so much doubt and suspicion regarding a huge number of global events, various governments accused of lying, torturing, abusing, and so much more, we need to dig down to the foundations of what our nations are built upon and rebuild the government, so the people come first.
