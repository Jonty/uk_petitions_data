        "additional_details": "Many communities provide shelter for the homeless, but do not accomodate those with dogs. People living alone on the streets often rely on their pet for companionship and protection. Also, sadly, because people give more money/food for the dog than they do the owner.\r\nThese homeless people are obviously unwilling to part with their only friend (to an uncertain future) just to get a roof over thier heads, and why should they?\r\nLocal authorities and Housing associations should provide homes for these people, so they can get off the streets. Group such homes/flats together so they don't generate complaints from non-dog-owners.\r\nGive the homeless the same rights as other dog owners.",
