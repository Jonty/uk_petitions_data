        "additional_details": "At present women with 'unplanned pregnancies'  don't seem to be advised to seek appropriate counseling & the ones that seek help are sent to pro-abortion providers. The services of those such as BPAS etc are not independent/impartial & are designed to lead women astray on the issue of abortion & esure they are not fully informed with regard to the 'procedure' or other long term related impacts on their health. It's unacceptable that the counseling providers are far from impartial & are in fact sponsors/beneficiaries of abortion. I request that government change the law to ensure that women with 'unplanned pregnancies' are not brushed under the carpet & it ensures that they have a right to be fully informed about the biggest so called 'choice' of all.",
