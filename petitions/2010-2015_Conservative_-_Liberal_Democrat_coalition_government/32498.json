        "additional_details": "It now seems common practice to place the 'Red and Green Man' indicators on pedestrian crossings and traffic lights just above the 'Wait' button.\r\n\r\nHistorically they were always placed on the opposite side of the road.\r\n\r\nWhen waiting to cross, pedestrians are looking forward, watching the traffic. When the Red and Green man were on the other side of they road, they were clearly visible and right in your field of view.\r\n\r\nWith the new positioning, they typically end up being behind you or over your shoulder. Therefore you don't clearly see them. On some  busy crossings they can be hidden by crowds. Also when approaching the crossings sometime there is no indicator visible.\r\n\r\nPlease bring back having them on the opposite side of the road, where they are clearly visible.",
