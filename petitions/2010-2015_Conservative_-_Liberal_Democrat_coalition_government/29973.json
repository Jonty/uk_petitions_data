London's roads will be 100 times more busy than normal because of the Olympics. The ill & elderly could be dying because they are stuck in traffic while celebrities & VIPS use the special traffic free lanes set up for them. This is a complete JOKE. Londoners put at risk. Allow ambulances to use these Lanes, put peoples health before a ceremony!",
