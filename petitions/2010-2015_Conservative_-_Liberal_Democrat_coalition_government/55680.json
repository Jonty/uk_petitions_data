        "additional_details": "Ellesmere Ports EPIC leisure centre is set to be demolished and a new sports centre will be built in 2015.\r\nThe Epic\u2019s main swimming pool is 33.3 meters long and is the largest swimming pool in the area. The New sports centre will only have a 25 meter pool .We the people of Ellesmere Port are coming together to insist that the powers that be DO NOT DOWNSIZE OUR SWIMMING POOL! We ask the question \"If we are building a new pool, why on earth make it smaller?\" If anything it would make more sense to build a full sized Olympic swimming pool given our countries recent accomplishments in the London 2012 Olympics and perhaps we could have our very own Michael Phelps. Why not build a diving board so we can inspire the future Tom Daley's and Sarah Barrow's. The EPIC's swimming pool is used by many swimmers, professional and amateur, old and young, who enjoy the many health benefits that swimming brings to life, back pain relief, stress reduction, weight loss, cardiovascular fitness etc\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
