Nothing positive ever comes out of these sessions. It just consists of cheap political point-scoring.\r\n\r\nLeaders of all parties in the House of Commons should do what they can to stop this embarrassing spectacle. MPs should commit to asking reasonable questions and listening to the answers. The Prime Minister should commit to giving real answers rather than sound-bites.",
