        "additional_details": "No one will die because of phone hacking but quite likely people will die this coming winter because they can't afford to keep warm - the domestic energy price scandal. I want the government to devise ways of making the energy market more competitive and curbing the power of the big six to raise prices at will. Possible actions: force the generators to pool the supply of electricity; a windfall tax but used to increase individual tax allowances; force the big six to sell their generating operations. If it was right to break up the big brewing companies in the 90\u2019s and right to make BAA sell an airport it is surely in the greater public interest to do this. Action is needed now.",
