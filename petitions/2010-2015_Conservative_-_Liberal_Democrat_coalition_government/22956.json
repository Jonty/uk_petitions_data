        "additional_details": "Vets are in the practice of marking-up the cost of medications by upto 500%. This is a fact that overcharges anyone purchasing medication direct from vets but it also hits the vulnerable including the elderly. Vet charges should be regulated and only reasonable  charges should be allowed. Vets already make a massive profit from their consultation charges and other professional charges.",
