        "additional_details": "This petition would see possesion of ALL currently illegal drugs in quantities deemed to be for 'personal consumption' decriminalised. As with the Argentinians who utilise a similar system with regards to drugs, the major reason for this need to decriminalise is that 'adults should be free to make lifestyle decisions without the intervention of the state'. Furthermore, this would clear countless space in the overflowing and inefficient prison systems, as well as saving police spending and aiding economic reform.",
