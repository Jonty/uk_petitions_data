        "additional_details": "The sporting achievements and service to football of Bob Paisley during his tenure as Liverpool Football Club Manager far outweighed any achievements of his contemporaries. In the 9 years he served as manager Liverpool Football Club were Division 1 Champions 1976, 77, 79, 80, 82, 83, he won the League Cup 1981, 82, 83 the  European Cup 1977, 78, 81 the UEFA Cup 1976 and the  European Super Cup in 1977. Although awarded  the OBE for services to football, both Sir Matt Busby & Sir Alex Fergusson were Knighted for lesser achievement. I think it would be fitting that consideration should be given for Bob Paisley to be awarded a posthumous knighthood for his tireless dedication to football and moreover, Liverpool Football Club",
