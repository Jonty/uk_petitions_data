From the 30th June 2014 this will cease to exist, due to an end in its funding.  We the signatories are against the withdrawal of funding for the learning opportunities in this area, as a deprived area of Merthyr Tydfil; we feel that our chances of employment are very slim.  What you as a government could and should do is create training programmes and Adult learning programmes.  There are numerous benefits from adult learning for instance, when learning new skills we open up new opportunities that might not have been available to us before.  It builds on our self-confidence; personal development, independence and our health and well-being improve. Learning transforms who we are as individuals. ",
