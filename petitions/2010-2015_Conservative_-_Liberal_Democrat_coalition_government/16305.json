        "additional_details": "I want the government to reform the CRB check process. At the moment Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) checks are not transferable across different local authorities yet they are checked against national databases. CRB checks should be like a driving license and be valid nationally. The process costs employers and employees a lot of unnecessary expenditure due to the fact that new employees must have one completed even if they had one completed as recently as the previous week but in a different local authority. It doesn\u2019t make sense.",
