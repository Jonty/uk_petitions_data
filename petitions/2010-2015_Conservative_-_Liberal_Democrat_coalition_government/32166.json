        "additional_details": "Most agree that greater local community engagement by individuals would help improve our society.  Local government should be allowed to provide incentives to encourage people to volunteer for local community activities.  One example might be a voucher scheme to allow say a \u00a320 reduction in the next year's Council Tax if an individual has attended three volunteering sessions during the preceding year.  A small incentive such as this will hopefully encourage far greater numbers to get involved in community volunteering.",
