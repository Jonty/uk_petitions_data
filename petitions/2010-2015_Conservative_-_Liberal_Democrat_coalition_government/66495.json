Norway is in EFTA/Single Market/EEA. The EEA = Single Market = allows for free movement of: goods, services, people and capital, with EU countries. With EFTA, Britain would run it's own: agriculture, fisheries, Home Affairs and Justice.\r\nAs a member of the EU/Single Market/EEA, Britain has 15,000 EU regulations and also 4,500 EEA/Single Market regulations. By switching to EFTA those 15,000 EU regulations could be changed. As a member of EFTA/Single Market, EU taxes would not apply.\r\nEFTA countries have free trade agreements with other countries e.g. Canada. EFTA has an office in Brussels and also a website.",
