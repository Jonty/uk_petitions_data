        "additional_details": "Royal Mail is currently exploiting stamp collectors with the increasing number of  'special issues' each year (some of dubious merit) and the value make-up of those issues, which often include several high value stamps, not used for everyday postage and for which, by being destined for collectors' albums as either 'mint' stamps or on First Day Covers, Royal Mail does not have to provide any service in return for their selling price.   Only the Christmas issue now includes a 2nd class stamp, the value widely used on 'ordinary' mail.   The Government should require Royal Mail to include a basic 1st class and 2nd class stamp in every special issue, with miniature sheets comprised only of such values.",
