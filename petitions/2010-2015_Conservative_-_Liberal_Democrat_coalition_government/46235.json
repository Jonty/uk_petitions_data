        "additional_details": "For several years the problems created by commercial vehicles, and vehicles of a similar type parking, in residential roads overnight and weekends. In my area the vast majority of the roads are narrow, although legal, the indiscriminate act of large vehicles parked on these roads, causes many traffic near misses and some times threats to other members of the public who use the public highway. The Police have all but disowned the responsibility for enforcing the act of keeping our roads clear of uneccessary obstructions.  Local Councils argue that they do not have funds to spend on monitoring traffic problems.\r\nEven getting extra yellow lines to enforce really bad examples of inconsiderate traffic hazzards.\r\nQuiet residential area's are fast becoming parking zones for company vehicles and other types who seem to think that leaving an oversize vehicle has become a right, even if they block other residents drives and access points.
