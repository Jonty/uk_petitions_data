        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to ban the press reporting of the Fusilier Lee Rigby murder trial, if necessary by the issue of a DA-Notice, in order to deprive the accused of the oxygen of publicity for their views resulting from a full trial, arising from their \"not guilty\" pleas.  The Nation, including their own co-religionists, should not be exposed to the publication of the accused's twisted views, excuses and opinions, which are not in the public interest. ",
