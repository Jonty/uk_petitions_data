I would like the government to reduce the age to 17. As a 17 year old I enjoy an occasional drink and I find it hard to deal with the fact we are so exposed to it (tv, radio, posters), yet are criminalised when wanting to try it. Let the actions of others not speak for the whole of our generation but them.",
