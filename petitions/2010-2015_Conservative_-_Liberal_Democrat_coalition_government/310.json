        "additional_details": "Because they continue to demonstrate that they are completely out of touch with the population in their sentencing of criminals we want you to introduce legislation to remove judges from the criminal justice system once any person has been found guilty of an offence.  At that point of a trial the usefulness of the judge (in maintaining the legality of proceedings) is redundant.  Sentencing needs to be more in keeping with the opinion of the public opinions of this country so panels of 'sentencers' consisting of randomly selected taxpaying individuals need to be established round the country so that sentencing is appropriate to the part of the country the crime is committed.  Judges demonstrate most admirably that it is not possible for them to see that as far as the public is concerned 'the punishment MUST fit the crime'.",
