An income account, a gifts account, a dividend account, etc.\r\n\r\nThe job of HMRC can then be largely automated by running automated scripts to look at people's expenditure vs their income.\r\n\r\nMake the current account numbers like phone numbers - so they can be moved from one bank to another without people needing to change their details with their employers, direct debits etc. This will encourage competition.\r\n",
