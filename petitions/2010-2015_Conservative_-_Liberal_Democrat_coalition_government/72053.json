Many of these companies are foreign owned and pay few UK taxes.\r\nUK Vat and income tax payers should have a legal right to view such matches live, without having to subscribe to see them, or they should be available on the Internet live for free.\r\nThe BBC claimed it could not afford to compete with rising fees, yet we now discover they paid over \u00a32m extra in redundancies and pensions to executives, and massive \u00a31m + fees to \"celebrity\" presenters money that could have won them cricket and rugby match broadcasts.\r\n",
