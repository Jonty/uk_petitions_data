        "additional_details": "Adrian Chiles claims to know a lot about the world of football, but I doubt he has ever played 90 minutes in his life. A lot of the present football commentators and pundits are ex-players, e.g. Gary Lineker, Roy Keane & Alan Shearer; also all ex international players.\r\n\r\nThis petition has been created to make Adrian Chiles prove his footballing worth, and sod off back to The One Show.",
