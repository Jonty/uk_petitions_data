        "additional_details": "On the 5th of December 2013; Nelson Mandela passed away. Many people feel that having a Nelson Mandela day would be recognition for the greater good he did for the anti aparthied in South Africa including many parts of the world. I don't know anyone living today that could even touch or have an incling of what Nelson Mandela went through being incarcerated for twenty six years of his life and still came out fighting for the cause of the greater good. By this I mean the anti apartheid in South Africa. May Nelson Mandela rest in eternal peace.\r\nThese are my reasons for the petion to have a Nelson Mandela day.\r\n",
