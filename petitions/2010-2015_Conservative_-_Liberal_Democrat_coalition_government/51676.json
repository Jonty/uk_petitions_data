He is a long way from fitting the caricature of a fat-cat banker.'\r\n\r\nNils Pratley. The Guardian.\r\n\r\nThe removal of Stephen Hester as Chief executive is bad business & bad politics because:\r\n\r\n- He is respected and admired by his 126,000 staff\r\n- He is a 'decent man' (see above) in an industry in need of them\r\n- His has returned the bank to profit\r\n\r\nHe is RBSG's best chance of success, therefore, he is the British publics best chance of a decent return on its investment.\r\n\r\nHe should be allowed to leave on his own terms; i.e. when he has lead the organisation through a successful re-privitsation.\r\n\r\nAs the majority shareholder the government should exercise its right to overturn the boards decision to compel Stephen Hester to commit to a specified tenure and accept he has earned the right to decide the point of his own departure.
