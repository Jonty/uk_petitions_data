        "additional_details": "Schools should be able to set their own holiday dates and spread them across the year. This would allow a fairer distribution of time to take holidays, both for the teachers and parents. This would also benefit the whole travel industry, as at the moment, set holidays only lead to some individuals not being able to afford to go away at peak times. Even just setting the holidays a week either side of the ones already in force, would make the world of difference in price range.",
