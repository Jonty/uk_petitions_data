        "additional_details": "As we have seen from the riots many under 18s cant be sent to prison. Instead they are handed referral order and taken on trips to Alton Towers. They even boast \"what are the police going to do, give me an ASBO\". I think in order to install discipline boot camps should be created, controlled by the military. They might think twice, about their anti-social behavior. I want the government to stop being soft on people under 18. Its about time they learnt respect and values our society holds. Other countries have this system, why don't we?",
