Make the sentence, which logically should be binding, mean it.\r\n\r\nI'm only 17 but surely it's pretty clear to the nation that life means until the prisoner dies? 3 life sentences? Makes no sense.\r\n\r\nWe're told it's too expensive to do so; well cut back on things then - bread and water. But that's not what this petition is about.\r\n\r\nSupport what, logically, shouldn't even need to be discussed.\r\n",
