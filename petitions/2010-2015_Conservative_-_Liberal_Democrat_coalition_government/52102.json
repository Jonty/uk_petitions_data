        "additional_details": "Young people now have to stay in some form of education or take a job which leads to a qualification for a further year starting with the current year 11 students who have just taken their GCSE's.  However, the provision for post 16 transport has not been altered to reflect the change.  Local authorities are able to set their own criteria for transport charges, but these charges should be consistent for all young people until the time they are able to leave education, that being post 17 for the next 2 academic years, then post 18 thereafter.",
