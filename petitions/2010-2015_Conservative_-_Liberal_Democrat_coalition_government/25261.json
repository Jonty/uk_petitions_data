        "additional_details": "A recall election is a procedure by which voters can remove an elected official from office through a direct vote before his or her term has ended.\r\n\r\nIf 25% of the people in the constituency sign a petition to recall their elected official that should enforce a by-election. It should not be Parliament to decide the terms of a recall, its the people. If the people sign enough votes thats enough for a recall. MPs are elected with less than 50%  of the vote. 25% of the vote based on the election results is enough for a recall.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the people want to recall an MP who promised a referendum on Europe prior to the election, yet in Westminster voted against a referendum then why should the people not have the right to recall that elected official who lied to his constituents. Same for an MP that promised never to vote for an increase tutition fees.\r\n\r\nLet's clean up Parliament and end the dirty tricks of making promises they have no plans on keeping.",
