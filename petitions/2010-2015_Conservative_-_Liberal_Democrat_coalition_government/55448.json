        "additional_details": "I wish for the government to put in place more stringent environmental laws to help boost and preserve the UK's wildlife. One such law would be to implement a fee for clearing wildlife for development and all new developments must create new habitats for wildlife and be environmentally friendly. Another point is to ban all forms of GM being released in the UK since the risks involved are unknown, and I believe it shows that respect for the natural world has been altogether lost.",
