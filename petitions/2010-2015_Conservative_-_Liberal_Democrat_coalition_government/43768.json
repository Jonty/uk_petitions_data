        "additional_details": "To make it illegal for Union Representatives to be paid for using Tax Payers Money and make it law that all Union Representatives in any company should have their time paid for by the Unions NOT the employer.\r\nIt is currently normal to find Union Representatives within organisations who carry out Union Work on a full time basis but their salary is paid for by the company for whom they work. Where this is most troubling is when the Union Representatives are employed in local or central government jobs but work fulltime as a Union Representative. Where this is the case Tax Payer Money is being used to fund Union workers but the tax payer has no ability to opt out of funding Unions. Tax payer money should not be allowed to be channeled to paying for Union Workers and Unions should be forced to pay for Union staff who work within any organisation or company.",
