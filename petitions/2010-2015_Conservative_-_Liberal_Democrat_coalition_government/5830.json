        "additional_details": "Though the ecological effects of GM crops are not entirely clear, they are unlikely to be physiologically harmful as, unlike pesticides and weed killers, specific genes introduced to GM crops produce known natural nontoxic compounds. Merely ingesting GM crops will not change any one's own genetic makeup. Perceived advantageous characteristics are the result of natural slow random adaptation and survival of the fittest in a particular environment/niche or as a result selective breeding. Cloning crops (and even for animals) merely ensure that such advantageous characteristics are retained and perhaps used for natural reproduction of future offspring.",
