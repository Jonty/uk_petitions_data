The working population do much of this through Taxation & National Insurance which helps fund Medical facilities, Benefits etc.\r\nBut we are not treated equally.  Why should Benefit claimants not pay TAX on their Benefits (an INCOME), nor National Insurance?\r\nThis will assist in monies to the coffers of Government as well as CONDITIONING those non workers to have responsibility to Society & to Value what they receive.",
