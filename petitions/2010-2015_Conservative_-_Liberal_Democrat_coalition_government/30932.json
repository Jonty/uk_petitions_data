        "action": "Council's should ban the tethering and grazing of Horses on all Public Council except when specified by Natural England.",
        "additional_details": "The issue with horses on public land is a long standing one in many Borough's and should no longer be brushed under the carpet by local council's. Many local residents find it very distressing and cannot enjoy the open spaces that are provided for the majority, not the minorirty of people who put public health & safety at risk. We are requesting that Council's take responsibility to prevent the suffering of horses and ponies on its land by people who regard public land as free grazing and think they can do so without due regard to the public or the horses they own.\r\nThis petition calls for a ban on grazing on public land unless it is a requirement of Natural England who monitors some nature reserves (SSI sites). In such cases all horses should be free roaming and comply with the DEFRA codes on welfare of horses.\r\nAny horses put on land without permission  are to be immediately removed.",
