        "additional_details": "True Cockneys are dying out after Bow Bells muted True Cockneys could be a dying breed, research has suggested, as the Bow bells which define them are no longer heard by newborn Londoners.\r\n\r\nAccording to tradition, true Cockneys must be born within earshot of the bells of St Mary-le-Bow Church, Cheapside. In days gone by, they could be heard across much of north and east London and as far south as Southwark, meaning any baby born within earshot was defined as a Cockney.\r\n\r\nNow, research by 24 Acoustics suggests the noise of the bells only reaches the city of London and Shoreditch. Not only is there little private housing in the area, but the only hospital now within earshot has no maternity ward on site.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to look at various ways of helping to keep the proud cockney's history & culture alive for future generations.\r\n\r\n",
