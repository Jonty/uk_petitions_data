        "additional_details": "As it stands at the moment, the decision as to whether or not to give medical assistance to babies born under 24 weeks gestation is left up to the individual hospitals. I for one find this very disturbing and it has resulted in many babies being left to die despite showing signs of life and breathing for them self.\r\n\r\nWe will fight for every innocent life and ask for a law stating that all premature babies that show signs of life be given some form of help to survive no matter what their gestation may be. In circumstances where the hospital does not have the facilities to help, we simply ask that every effort possible be made to transport  the babies to a place that does have the facilities needed.\r\n\r\nA Life is a life,No Matter how small!",
