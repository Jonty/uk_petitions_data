        "additional_details": "The M6 Toll road is underused and even at the daily peak road traffic volume is very low. I propose that a trial period of 12 months is set with certain sections of this road having unrestricted speed limits, similar to certain sections of Autobahn in Germany. Large sections of the M6 Toll road are smooth, well made, wide, well lit, and have an unrestricted view of more than a mile in some areas. It seems inappropriate to maintain a 70mph limit on this road when there are no other vehicles within several hundred or even thousands of metres. This trial would allow the Department for Transport a safer environment to test whether the UK driver is capable of higher speeds on long expressways. It would also likely increase the revenue made by M6 Toll by a significant amount.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in this way of high speed travel, to that of high speed rail. ",
