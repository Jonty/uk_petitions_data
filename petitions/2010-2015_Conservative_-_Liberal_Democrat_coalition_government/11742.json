        "additional_details": "I believe that there is a great need for all taxes to be used for the benefit of UK citizens and not spent on overseas aid.  There is little auditable records to confirm how much of our aid actually reaches the people to whom it is intended.  I understand that many people would wish to see money spent on international development, but this should be by choice.  Firstly, people can make donations through DEC.  Secondly,  I feel that the National Lottery needs to be developed to enable puchasers of lottery tickets to indicate at point of sale where their donation goes i.e. UK Arts, Sport, Health etc or Overseas Aid.  Where customers do not indicate the choice of charity then it defaults to the Government choosing. ",
