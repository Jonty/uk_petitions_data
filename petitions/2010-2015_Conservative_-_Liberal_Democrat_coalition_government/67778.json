        "additional_details": "Please ask Vietnam to act to stop this illegal trade - these poor bears are kept in cages they cannot stand up on all fours in and bile is daily extracted in dirty conditions and open wounds are often infested. The cruelty is beyond belief - all for Chinese Medicine when they could use a substitute. They are given poor diet and kept in the dark in garages and cellars. I suggest an amnesty to get the bears to the animal shelters and if anyone caught after that a substantial jail sentence and monetary reward offered for whistleblowers.",
