        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister should not interfere with this very significant proposal.  This brave initiative if it proceeds will represent a significant simplification of pension provision for most people going forward - who can see what they will get and that - if they choose to make additional provisions for pension or other income in retirement - they will not have to worry about the impact of any private income or pensions on state pension entitlement. The present system is a mishmash and a considerable disincentive for lower income people to make any provision for the future",
