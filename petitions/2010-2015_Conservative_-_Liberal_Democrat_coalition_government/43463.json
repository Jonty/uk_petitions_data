        "additional_details": "Many of our wild birds are going hungry and are not surviving through the harshest months of winter. The critical decline in their numbers shows that there is now legitimate cause for reasonable action. The natural source of food for many of our wild birds are Wild Rose Hips, Hawthorn Sloe, Viburnum and other berries. In many counties these berries are unable to form because farmers are shearing them away by annual hedge cutting, which is basically denying birdlife natures sustenance. We would like to see it become mandatory that no annual farm hedge cutting takes place (unless it is necessary for safety - e.g down the roadside etc) and the hedging should be allowed to berry or fruit for at least 2-3 years before cutting, and then cut only after the birds have had the chance to pick them. Together we can help the bird population recover. Thank You\r\n",
