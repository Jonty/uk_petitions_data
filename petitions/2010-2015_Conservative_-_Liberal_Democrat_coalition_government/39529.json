My GP practice would not give me a Flu Jab because I Didn\u2019t falls into a priority group.\r\n\r\nI needed to have Cancer or other condition where my immune system was compromised, COPD, Asthmatic, MS etc. I don\u2019t have a problem with that, but was told I would have got one if I was a carer for someone in that group, sadly I am not as Mam passed away.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s the ordinary Joe Blogs that would be looking after anyone who catches flu, so it would seem better, to prevent it from us catching it as prevention is far cheaper than treating the flu itself.\r\n\r\nWe need to end the disparity of care, and still ensure that \u201dCare is free at the point of delivery, and not on the ability to pay\u201d.\r\n",
