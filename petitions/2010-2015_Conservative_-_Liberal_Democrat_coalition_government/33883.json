        "additional_details": "The purpose of this e-Petition is for the Government to provide the UK Public with simple easy to understand data about the performance of the Government against key issues of the days from a single online source on a weekly basis. Issues such as\r\n\r\n1. Performance against stated manifesto targets (i.e. Debt Reduction)\r\n\r\n2. Performance of Government against key issues of the day (i.e. Number of Immigrants, Number of Benefit Fraud prosecutions)\r\n\r\n3. Other meaningful statistics such as People in work, Number of known people with links to terriorist organisations, the cost of benefits, average public sector worker pension costs etc etc\r\n\r\nIf accurate online data were provided from a single point, this would at least let the people of the UK know that the government understands their issues and are monitoring/managing them.\r\n\r\nSimply put, a counter against each measurement that updates in real time. i.e. National Debt - \u00a3xxx,xxx,xxxx as of Date/Time. etc",
