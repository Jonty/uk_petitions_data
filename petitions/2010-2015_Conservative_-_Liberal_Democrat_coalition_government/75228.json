        "additional_details": "We have seen recently how a failure to educate children the fundamental skills when teaching PSHE and C has caused vulnerability to rise for children exposed to sex, alcohol and other addictive substances.\r\nThe Department of Education must introduce a criteria which schools should be obliged to follow. This criteria will force schools to teach their students about sexual relations and damaging effects of pornography; the consequences of binge drinking and drug use.\r\nIt is shocking and horrifying that in the twenty-first century, the government is still wary about such topics showing it to be unfit to act on the situation. The 'cosmopolitan' world we now live in encourages children to know about issues that are effecting them.  ",
