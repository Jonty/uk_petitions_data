        "additional_details": "Abolish term time equated pay system for school support staff, this system discriminates against them on the basis they are technically unemployed for 9 or more weeks, but unable to claim any benefit, should they wish to.\r\n\r\nStaff should be paid the rate they earn per hour and not the adjusted rate, retention of earnings to be paid back during school holidays is unfair, insulting and discriminatory.\r\n\r\nMany school support staff are never advised about the equated pay system when they apply for jobs and believe they are being paid 52 weeks a year, when they are not, they are being paid 44 weeks or 45 weeks spread over 52 weeks, most believe they are receiving 13 weeks holiday pay.\r\n\r\nSchool support staff should be paid either 52 weeks per year similar to teachers or paid for the weeks they earn and be allowed to claim benefit like any other unemployed person.\r\n\r\nThis system is a blatant act of discrimination and needs addressing.",
