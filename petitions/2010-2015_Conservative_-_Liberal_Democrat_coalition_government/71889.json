        "additional_details": "We call on the UK Government to stop its policy of allowing 15 year olds and even 16 year olds to be recruited into the Armed Forces. The recruitment and targeting of young people and vulnerable groups has been criticised by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. 2014 - 2015 is the year to end this policy. The age of recruitment should be 18+.Some children will just join because of the money and will not realize their mistake until it is to late.\r\n\r\nWhy is this important?\r\nWhat better way to commit our country to peace during the commemoration of World War One and remember the hundreds of thousands who died from the UK alone, including boy soldiers like Rifleman V J Strudwick who was killed at 15? Why is it that in 2014 the UK is the only country in Europe - and the only country among the permanent members of the UN Security Council - to recruit 16 year olds into its armed forces?\r\n",
