The BBC would become far more competitive, in terms of quality programming, if they were given the chance to generate their own revenue and profits. Daytime repeats of antiques and luxury home shopping could be replaced with better funded programming. A large percentage of viewers already pay for monthly subcription with Sky or Virgin.",
