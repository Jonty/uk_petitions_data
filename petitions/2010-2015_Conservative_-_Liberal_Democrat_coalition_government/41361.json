        "additional_details": "Make elderly people retake their driving theory and practical tests at 70 years old.In the last month i've had serious near misses with elderly people pulling out of junctions and pulling out of stationary parked traffic.i've witnessed two elderly men cause damage to other peoples property in the last month,both of whom are unable to park anymore.one reversed into a stationary parked car and caused a considerable amount of damage and the other was also trying to reverse park but instead mounted the kerb and hit the front wall to a house,which in itself is extremely dangerous as if the children of the house were playing out that day then it's safe to say they wouldn't be here anymore as there most certainly would have been a fatality.Elderly people do not have the motor skills as they deterioate with age and so does mental awareness.",
