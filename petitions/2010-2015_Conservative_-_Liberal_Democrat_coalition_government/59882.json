        "additional_details": "The topic of Cannabis needs to be addressed without prejudice. The government needs to start looking across the world to see what is working, and what could work for us. What essentially do we agree on? Cannabis should be kept off the streets. Drug dealing can be a dangerous and risky business and there is a way that we can lower these kind of crimes:\r\n\r\nWith inspiration from Barcelona, we should be able to open up Private Marijuana Clubs where membership is for over 21's only with a strict no driving home rule. Clubs should be properly ventilated and monitored by the police. With clubs in place, street dealers will have less business and crime should drop as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\nAction Required:\r\n\r\nConsideration of opening up Private Cannabis Clubs to  localise the use of drugs to a safe area and limit the operations of street dealers.\r\n\r\nResearch how other countries are dealing with Marijuana\r\n\r\nResearch public opinion on this issue and take it into consideration",
