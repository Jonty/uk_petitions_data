        "additional_details": "The current practise of only have one seller of a product, such as a live television sporting event is anti-competitive, and monopolistic.\r\n\r\nConsumers should have a free retail market created by an open wholesale market to interact with, and the current practise is contrary to the spirit of normal competition regulations.\r\n\r\nEnd the monopoly that certain disreputable companies have enjoyed with impunity for so long.\r\n\r\nSupport this petition if you support the idea that all products and suppliers should face equal exposure to competition regulation, and that all live broadcast events on television, radio, internet (and all other forms of public transmission) should be open as a wholesale market for competitors.",
