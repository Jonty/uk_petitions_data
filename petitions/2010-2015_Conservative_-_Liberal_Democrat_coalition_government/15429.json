        "additional_details": "Two years ago resident wardens who live on Sheltered housing schemes were replaced by floating support advisors under the Supporting People Programme. Instead of having 24 hour cover residents are visited on allocated days which have been decided by the housing provider. This has lead to confusion and isolation for residents who are mostly elderly. My research has shown that Supporting People was never meant for residents living in sheltered housing. It is just being used to save money. I want the Government to bring in laws to do away with this practice and force housing providers to reinstate sheltered housing wardens that live on site. I know some M.Ps are aware of this problem.",
