        "additional_details": "HI PEOPLE THIS PETITON IS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF HOW DANGEROUS THE NORTH BANK ROAD IN WHITTLESEYIS AFTER YET ANOTHER FATALITY THIS WEEK ITS TIME FOR CHANGES. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE TO THIS ROAD AS ITS TO NARROW, HAS A VERY SHARP BEND AND PEOPLE SPEED ALONG IT. MY SUGGESTIONS ARE SPEED CAMERAS, TAKE AWAY PART OF THE BANK, BARRIERS, WHITE LINES DOWN MIDDLE OF ROAD OR AVERAGE SPEED CAMERAS AS THEY HAVE ON THE FORTY FOOT ROAD. SURELY LIVES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN MONEY AS ANOTHER FAMILY HAS LOST A CHILD. PLEASE TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION",
