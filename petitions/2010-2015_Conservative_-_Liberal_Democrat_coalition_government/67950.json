        "additional_details": "On 22nd July 2014, HSBC decided to offer a two-month notice of closure of Ummah Welfare Trust's bank account with the bank which the charity uses for its operations. This comes in at a time when the charity is most active -especially given the recent crisis in Gaza.\r\n\r\nThis is a despicable manoeuvre and a continual of various banks' unempathetic aim to stop and prevent charities and non-profit organisations from carrying out their much needed humanitarian work.\r\n\r\nAs a concerned supporter of international aid work and UWT in particular, I demand HSBC to allow UWT to resume its operations by allowing the charity's bank account to remain open. I also request the Government to allow charities and non-profit organisations to function without hesitation and pressure from businesses which have an agenda and block people from carrying out noble work that their hearts desire.",
