        "additional_details": "The BBC receives our TV licence fee which it uses to fund a range of services however it is unfair on TV viewers that tend to watch cable or satellite TV channels that they should be paying to keep the BBC's TV and Radio stations going.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should be self funding and work based on it's own commercial strength across both BBC TV and Radio. As advertisers will only support it if programmes were of suitable quality therefore the quality of shows could improve.\r\n\r\nOffensive comments such as Jeremy Clarkson's comments on \"The One Show\" 30/11/11 about public sector strikers and those with mental health issues would not go on air without immediate apology as they would naturally be concerned that advertisers would stop advertising on the BBC.\r\n\r\nWe see too many repeats and a failure of the BBC to open BBC3 and BBC4 during major sporting events to allow a good range of programmes (sports and other gene) to be broadcast without reducing the quality or quantity of the coverage.",
