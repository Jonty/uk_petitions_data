Having been humiliated  today over the decision of the Chancellor  not to introduce  a mansion tax and recently over the Government's response to Leveson together with losing deposits at recent by-elections, it is time for Nick Clegg to do the decent thing and pull the plug on the Coalition Government. He owes it to the nation, to his party to the young people whose prospects are looking bleaker by the day and to all decent people for whom  this coalition is proving to be a disaster. ",
