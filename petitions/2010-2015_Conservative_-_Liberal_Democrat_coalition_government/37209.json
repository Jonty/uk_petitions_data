        "additional_details": "The announcement today that Virgin Rail are not to be awarded the renewal of the West Coast Mainline franchise flies in the face of all common sense.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be right that the decision to award the franchise is so significantly influenced by the net payment the train operator says it will pay to the Government.  Surely other factors are just as, if not more, important, namely reliability, value for money and customer satisfaction; if so then the present operator, Virgin Rail, must rank higher than the proposed new operator.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call upon the Department for Transport to suspend the award and to reconsider the decision to move the franchise away from Virgin Rail, taking into account the views of existing users of the service.",
