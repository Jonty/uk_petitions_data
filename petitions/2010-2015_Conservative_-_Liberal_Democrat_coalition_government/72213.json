        "additional_details": "The Government does not wish to implement hybrid Damages Based Agreements ['DBAs']. This prevents  access to justice.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary, advocate hybrid DBAs. Lord Dyson is \"disappointed\" by the Government's stance; given he leads the current review, this highlights significant issues. Lord Justice Jackson, who reviewed the CPR, advocates hybrid DBAs.\r\n\r\nUnder the Rule of Law and Separation of Powers, the Legislature and Executive cannot ignore the Judiciary's stance. The Judiciary, who arguably have their finger on the pulse, should not be marginalised to suit the political ideology\r\n\r\nFailing to consider hybrid DBAs defeats the purpose of DBAs to allow for revolutionary and cost proportionate access to justice.\r\n\r\nConfusion concerning DBAs has led to them not being utilised and denies oft marginalised individuals access to the Court system.\r\n\r\nThe Government is urged to launch a consultation so concerns that \"vested interests\" are being protected can be laid to rest.\r\n\r\n",
