        "additional_details": "Let's put an end to criminal activity all over the UK by insisting that new legislation is introduced to make Scrapyards registered for business.\r\nCriminals are stealing metals from church roofs, hospital generators, railway cabling, drain covers and from headstones and monuments.\r\nNot only is this dangerous but causes travel delays as well as heartache to relatives of the deceased. Recently in Cardiff hospital operations had to be cancelled as cabling to generators was stolen.\r\nIf Scrapyards were regulated and forced to only take scrap from people that provide ID, have their photograph taken with their scrap items and paid by cheque, this problem would be eradicated.",
