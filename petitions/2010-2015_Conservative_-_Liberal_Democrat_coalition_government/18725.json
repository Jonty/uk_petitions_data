        "additional_details": "In our world today we have been unable to bring to the forefront our total agreement that all functions in human society are flawed.  All functions in human society are flawed because each function has a negative effect on somebody somewhere at any given time, day, month, year or century.\r\n\r\nTo eradicate these problems I propose that we should set up a new Philosophical Subject in Schools and Universities, called Human Made Utopia (Philosophy), as a medium to be used for the exploration of alternatives to human society's problems.\r\n\r\nUnited Nations should set up a body that has full responsibility on how the proposed subject Human Made Utopia (Philosophy) is to be taught including the implementation of Students\u2019 research finding.\r\n\r\nI have contacted various departments of UNESCO\r\nI requested the assistance of UNESCO to introduce the concept of Human Made Utopia as an academic discipline worthy of study and development to the United Nations Council.\r\n",
