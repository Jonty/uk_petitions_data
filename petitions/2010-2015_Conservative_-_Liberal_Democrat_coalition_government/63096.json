        "additional_details": "\r\nIn the countryside in particular the Pub is a specially prized meeting and eating place, adding not only to community cohesion, but also the viability of tourism. Unfortunately laws in our land do not make the conversion of Pubs and Shops to residential use, even in the presence of a reasonable business case illegitimate.  Please support this petition if you feel that there ought to be some strong coercion in Law to compel individuals to only seek ownership of a Pub or a Shop if they want to run it as such.  Conversion should be only consented to by the relevant authorities after proper public consultation and independent investigation of the viability of the business.  A breach therefore of the Law as recommended by this petition would compel the owner(s) to either offer the property concerned for sale on the open market, or apply for conversion via engagement with a more thorough analysis as summarised above.",
