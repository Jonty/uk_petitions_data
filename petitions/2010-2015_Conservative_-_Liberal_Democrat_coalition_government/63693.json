        "additional_details": "This petition is against Philip Davies MP suggested amendment to the Deregulation Bill where he is suggesting abolishing Sunday Trading Laws.\r\nSunday Trading Laws are very important in society as it allows families to spend time together and actually have some 'rest time' when the cannot work.\r\nFurthermore, as society is becoming increasingly digitised there is no need to extend working hours on a Sunday.\r\nThe Sunday Trading Laws strike a fair balance between work and rest and it would be extremely detrimental to abolish them.",
