        "additional_details": "In view of the growing obesity crisis, I petition HM Government to introduce vouchers to help towards the cost of buying fresh fruit and veg. This could be financed by taxing unhealthy foodstuffs, e.g. chocolate and crisps. Trying to eat healthily is not exactly cheap, and this measure would especially induce low- and single-income families to buy healthier options.",
