We believe there are three options for the period of time he would have to live on that amount.\r\n(1.) 6 months, it seems unreasonable that anyone in their right mind would want to live on that amount for longer than this, unless there was absolutely no choice.\r\n(2.) The average period that an individual claims Job Seekers Allowance.\r\n(3.) An individual joining JSA is selected at random, Ian Duncan Smith then lives on the equivalent of their benefits for the period that they are claiming.",
