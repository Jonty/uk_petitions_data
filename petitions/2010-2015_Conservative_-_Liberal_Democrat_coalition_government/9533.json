        "additional_details": "The recent national riot has revealed the fragility of modern society and the failure of the civil force to in any way maintain public order. It has also unmasked the face of a secular society come of age and the sight is deeply disturbing. The road along which we as a nation are travelling at present is highly uncertain and dangeous and its destination unknown. It is therefore advisable as a matter of urgency that all firearms be permanently removed from all retail outlets accessible by the public at large, because a failure to do so could prove an unmitigated disaster.",
