        "additional_details": "Although the number of physical and sexual assaults in Britain is decreasing, the figures of rape, attacks and muggings are still frighteningly high. We propose a simple solution to a serious problem; one full day of self-defence classes every half term. We believe that this will protect young people from dangerous situations and make sure that they are able to defend themselves. However, it is important that violence and bullying are not promoted. This is a nationwide problem so it needs a nationwide solution.",
