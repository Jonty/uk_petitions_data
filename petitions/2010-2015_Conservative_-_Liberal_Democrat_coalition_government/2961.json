        "additional_details": "The A1 is a vital road transport artery for the people and businesses in the East of England.\r\nAnyone using this crucial road between London and the Scottish border (and beyond), will have been frustrated by the stop-start flow of this vital road.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a proper motorway along the full length of the East of England is literally strangling the economic development, competitiveness and transport of people and goods. This part of the country is vital for our food production and an upgraded A1 could help reduce the need for food imports.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to recognise the importance of this major artery and divert funds from less essential budgets (Foreign Aid, MOD) to upgrade the A1 before the end of this decade.\r\n\r\nPlease support this important petition.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
