This should apply to all regulations.\r\nNo one younger than 18 should be allowed to vote in any election or referendum because, by definition, they have not reached a level of maturity to take such important decisions.\r\nIt is illogical to allow a person a vote but not to allow them to drive a car, make financial commitments or leave education. The argument that political decisions affect their future would apply equally to 3 year olds. ",
