To make roundabouts safer. Vehicles will no longer be able to enter roundabouts at high speed.\r\n2. To improve traffic flow at roundabouts where traffic flow is particularly heavy on one entrance, thus preventing traffic on other entrances from entering safely.\r\n\r\nIf all vehicles must come to a complete stop before entering the roundabout, it provides a more equitable opportunity for other vehicles to enter roundabouts. It will inherently reduce the average speed of traffic on roundabouts. ",
