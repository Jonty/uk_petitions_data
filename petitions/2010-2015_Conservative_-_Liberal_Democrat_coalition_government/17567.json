From that moment on the world of modeling, fasion & media set a standard... an Unrealistic standard that is not in tune with today's modern woman & society.\r\n\r\nThis Campaign is set to raise awareness & put a stop to this problem that has been \"hushed\" for far too many years, and many thousands knew the standards were unrealistic and discriminative but rarely came forward or voiced they're opinions against this Global problem.\r\n\r\nDiversity For Models & Models Of Diversity aims to make changes in an industry that far too often raises concerns over discrimination, racism & the health issues of those who are seen in the fashion & media industries, but also to offer advise and guidence for those that want to get into this industry.\r\n\r\n",
