        "additional_details": "Croda Building site in Kilnhurst, run by Gleeson, is creating Chemical & Gas smells regularly. Smells affecting washing, general health, childrens health in particular,  and unable to have windows open.\r\nThe Enviromental Agency and local Council have been involved and nothing seems to be being done. The only contact details the locals to have to report problems are only Monday - Friday 9-5, NO weekend cover!!\r\nI would  like the Government to have better control over the smells and an obvious response when problems do occur, 24/7 contact details to report the frequent weekend problems and re-assurance there will be no long term effects from the chemicals.",
