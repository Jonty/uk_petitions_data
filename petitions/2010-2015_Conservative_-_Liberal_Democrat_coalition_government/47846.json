I would like the government to fund some sort of safe place for depressive people to go to, to talk to other people who have the same issues as they have with also professional people to talk to as well because otherwise you will be waiting months to get an appointment for a psychiatric by then it may be too late . This is a serious matter because around ONE MILLION people die from killing their self's every year.    ",
