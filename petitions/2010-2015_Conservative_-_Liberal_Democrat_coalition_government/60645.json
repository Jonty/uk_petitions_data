These patients are being unfairly discriminated against by being denied the facility of using their Doctors Dispensary.\r\nThis antiquated regulation is clearly anti-democratic being selective against a section of the rural patient population depriving them their right to \"patient choice\" and goes directly against the policy of \"no decision about me without me\" as enshrined in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. We have one rule which is giving us the right to have a choice and the other taking it away!\r\nWe the undersigned request the government repeal the Regulation.\r\n",
