        "additional_details": "Since its introduction in 1999, the National Minimum Wage has helped raise the living standards of millions of people in the United Kingdom. Every time the Minimum Wage is increased, a million people benefit.\r\n\r\nThe Minimum Wage sets a floor beneath which people cannot fall, preventing a race to the bottom for employees' wages and living standards. A 2003 study from the University of Warwick  found no evidence of a negative effect on employment through the presence of a National Minimum Wage.\r\n\r\nBut we are greatly concerned that the Government is considering changing the terms of reference of the Low Pay Commission to consider freezing or cutting the National Minimum Wage.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned call on the government to:\r\n\r\n1) Reaffirm its commitment to a National Minimum Wage for all, with no opt-outs\r\n2) Reject any policy of cutting or freezing the National Minimum Wage\r\n3) Properly enforce the National Minimum Wage with greater punishments for employers who break the law",
