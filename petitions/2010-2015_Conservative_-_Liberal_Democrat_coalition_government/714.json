        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish the Government to treat the provision of Child Benefit fairly. Those who have a higher rate tax payer in the family will lose the benefit even if one parent is at home, but a couple earning just below the higher rate tax band will retain it. The Government need to act fairly in these times of cuts. The Government should introduce a combined total income. ",
