        "additional_details": "Around 70% of British Pakistanis originate from in and around Mirpur, Azad Kashmir. Although living in Kashmir they are not ethnic Kashmiri but are ethnic Paharis. They are the inhabitants of the Pir panjal mountains and foothills, and speak a language called Pahari which literally translates to 'mountain language'. Although they speak Pahari which is distinct from urdu and punjabi, they have to pick either punjabi or urdu on forms (census etc), they also have to refer to themselves as punjabis or Pakistanis as there is no Pahari or Kashmiri option. Pahari is the most spoken language in Britain after English, and the Pahari people have been in Britain longer than other migrant groups from Pakistan (Punjabis,Pashtuns) but still the government hasn't recognised the people or their language truly.",
