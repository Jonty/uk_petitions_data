        "additional_details": "I believe it is immoral for owners of empty property to be charged council tax. This practice penalises those that have had to move due to a change in job or other circumstance, left unable to quickly sell their house/flat due to the current poor housing market. No council services are used and council tax is being paid elsewhere. This is particularly so in Scotland where the tax includes water and sewerage, not used when the property is empty.",
