        "additional_details": "Nadine Dorries has announced that she only needs 46 signatures to trigger a leadership contest to get rid of David Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party and thus, presumably, the Prime Minister. Having called him and George Osborne \"arrogant posh boys\" who are \"out of touch\" it is clear that she doesn't like Call Me Dave.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe that Dorries, someone who wishes to tell women what to do with their own bodies, is \"arrogant\" and \"out of touch\". As such we urge the Coalition Government to pass a law which provides for the abolition of Nadine Dorries on the collection of 46 signatures from members of the public. If abolition is impossible, we recommend repatriation to the 1850s.",
