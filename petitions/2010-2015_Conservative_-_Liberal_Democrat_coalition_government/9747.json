However, every time they get excluded from school, do not attend school regularly, or commit any crime, money is taken off their final amount. If they are not in full time education or employment when the payout date arrives, they would not be entitled to it\r\n.\r\nI believe that this process  would  make the parents take more interest in their children's whereabouts. The cost of such crime is obviously enormous and it is money down the drain.  The cost to the victim of crime and the cost of the punishment to the community could become overwhelming, not to mention the fact that we don't have enough prison space to cope with the growing problem\r\n\r\n",
