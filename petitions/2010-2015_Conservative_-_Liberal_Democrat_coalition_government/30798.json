        "action": "Have no legal definition of  or reference to 'marriage'; allow any couple a civil partnership",
        "additional_details": "This petition would see the government remove all references to 'marriage' from all legal statutes. Any two people (without reference to their gender[s]) should be allowed to form a 'civil partnership'.\r\n\r\nCivil partnerships should be formed only upon signing a civil partnership document in the presence of a registrar and two witnesses. Any religious ceremony should not constitute the formation of a 'civil partnership'.\r\n\r\nThere should be no legal definition of 'marriage', but only of 'civil partnerships'. Such changes will end confusion between groups with varying definitions of 'marriage' and promote equality for all couples.",
