        "additional_details": "The minority of irresponsible caravan drivers cause accidents on some on the UK's busiest roads resulting in huge financial and operational penalties to road haulage companies and car users in delays.\r\n\r\nI propose we restrict Caravans usage of major roads during summer months to after business hours to reduce the amount of people and businesses affected.\r\n\r\nA great example of this is the M5 between Junctions 27 and 29 where almost all motorway closures in the last year have been caused by Caravan towing vehicles",
