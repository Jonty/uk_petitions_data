In this way referees are independently appointed and assessed. In addition, the football authorities, working alongside the Gambling Commission, undertake a huge amount of work to ensure the integrity of the game is upheld, and it remains free from corruption.\r\n\r\nProfessional sport is run autonomous from government. It will, therefore, be for the FA to decide what action is taken."
