        "additional_details": "Keratoconus (KC) is an eye condition, where the cornea, the front surface of the eye, thins and becomes distorted, often forming a cone shape. When you cannot see properly you miss out on the visual cues that sighted people take for granted; facial expression, body language, gestures. Simple activities like crossing a road, making a hot drink or inserting an electrical plug require concentration and take much longer. Keratonconus is very hard to treat, therefore keep paying for new contact lenses and solutions can get very expensive and we do not get a grant of any sort. We do not wear contact lenses for vanity reasons, we need them to see. It is easy to feel excluded and to turn in on oneself. Some people with KC get depressed with the constant daily struggle.\r\n",
