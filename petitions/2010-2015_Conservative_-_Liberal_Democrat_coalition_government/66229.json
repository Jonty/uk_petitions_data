        "action": "Radical modification of the Hospital Function and Role in Society",
        "additional_details": "Hospitals are having departments closed down to provide  rationalised services at larger units e.g. A&E units. Consider the Hospital role. Basically they either TREAT a patient or CARE for a patient in need of that CARE\r\n Staff are excellent but many prefer to TREAT rather than CARE and as many want to CARE rather than TREAT. Staff can be told they are spending too much time using the \"bed side manner\" while others are told they neglect some patients in preference to treatment.\r\nSo modify and change the Hospital role. Have CARE centers or TREATMENT centers to maximise the skill sets and preference sets of staff. I would suggest this may reduce waiting times for operations etc as beds are not clogged with people just needing some care for a while.\r\nLETS FACE IT THE FUTURE DEMOGRAPHY OF THE COUNTRY WILL SEE A LEVEL PERCENTAGE OF RELATED TREATMENT BUT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF RELATED CARE. This goes some way to FIXING THAT ISSUE.",
