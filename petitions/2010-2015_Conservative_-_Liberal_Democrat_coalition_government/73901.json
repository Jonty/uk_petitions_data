Possibly millions of pounds has been lost by Self employed staff most of whom are owner drivers or small outfits who are unable to survive this crash.\r\nWe believe the Self employed staff were tricked into working December 2014 as the company knew they were going under and had no intention of paying them. This needs to be identified and debated in the commons and if necessary new laws be proposed/drafted. ",
