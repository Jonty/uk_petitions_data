This is on the grounds it should be a political not a military decision as its affects a regiment that belongs to the Welsh nation. As it is Wales only armoured regiment its termination will mean that Welshmen will be discriminated against in that, unlike the English with eight armoured regiments and the Scots with two, they will no longer have the choice to fight in their national regiment alongside their compatriots in tanks/recce vehicles.",
