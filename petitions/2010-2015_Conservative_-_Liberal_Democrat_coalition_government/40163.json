There is no need to be spending money on lighting these roads.\r\n\r\nIf there are particular accident black spots then fine have some lights.  But we dont need to light every motorway or duel carriageway in the county.\r\n\r\nIf this is deemed too extreme, then at least turn them off from 11pm to 5am when there is only light use.",
