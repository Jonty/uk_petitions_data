If they conform at set target dates then they can be recruited into the  regular army where their aggression can be put to use serving their country.\r\nIf they don't conform then drills continue forcibly and indefinitely until they do conform.\r\nThey can expect bed and meals but no salary and no leave.  This would eliminate asbos, fines, jail, community service and benefit payments.",
