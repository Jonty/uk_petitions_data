        "additional_details": "At present, the UK IT curriculum teaches students to use software such as word processors but offers no instruction in how to create programs themselves. This is a massive oversight given the importance of programming in the digital age, and makes us less competitive in the global technology market.\r\nThe aim of this petition is to make computer programming a large part of the IT curriculum and to make IT compulsory to GCSE level.",
