Their bravery and commitment is beyond reproach.\r\n\r\nYet the Police were strectched to full capacity. They will not be able to do the same job with less numbers.\r\n\r\nFor this reason police budgets must be completely ring fenced, to ensure the safety of every one of us.\r\n\r\nDo not cut Police budgets!",
