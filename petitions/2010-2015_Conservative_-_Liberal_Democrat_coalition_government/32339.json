        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that the current penalties for animal cruelty do little to deter offenders from committing such offences. The maximum sentences are never given and therefore are no deterrent from those who choose to commit such offences.\r\n\r\nWe petition that a minimum fine of \u00a35000 be imposed, with a minimum custodial sentence of 6 months rising to 3 years based on the seriousness of each case. Those found guilty of animal cruelty and or neglect should be banned from keeping animals for life.\r\n\r\nResearch has proven a strong link between animal cruelty and those who commit violent offences against humans. We urge you to review the current sentencing structure and ensure that those who commit cruelty to animals receive a penalty that will be effective, deter future offences and is in line with the severity of the offence committed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
