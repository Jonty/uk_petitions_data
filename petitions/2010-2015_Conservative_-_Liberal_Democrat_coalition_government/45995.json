Extend the transferability of BPTA to include a nominated career of a registered blind person, if the later has no partner.\r\nThese two changes would encourage Blind Persons to seek employment opportunities, whilst recognising the increased costs involved or support a career that may be in part time employment due to their caring responsibilities to the blind persons.\r\nReference;\r\nhttp://www.hmrc.gov.uk/incometax/blind-person-allow.htm\r\n",
