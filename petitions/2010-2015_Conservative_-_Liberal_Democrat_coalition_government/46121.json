        "additional_details": "The government must implement regulations to force rail companies to offer part-time season tickets.\r\n\r\nThere are about 8 million part-time workers in the UK including 5m women and over 1m who would like to work full-time but cannot.\r\n\r\nPart-time workers commuting by rail are at a financial disadvantage vs. full-time counterparts, who receive a discount on ordinary rail fares by purchasing an annual season ticket. \u00a0\r\n\r\nAn average 3 day week worker could save over \u00a3500 a year if they were charged 3/5ths the price of a standard annual season ticket for an equivalent part-time season ticket.\r\n\r\nRail companies have the ability to offer part-time season tickets but have not due to the failure of competition on the rail network.\r\n\r\nKey benefits of proposed regulation:\r\n\r\n- not discriminating against those who can only work part-time or who choose to work part-time: e.g mothers, students, self employed\r\n- incentivising more people to work from home, thereby reducing over-crowding on trains",
