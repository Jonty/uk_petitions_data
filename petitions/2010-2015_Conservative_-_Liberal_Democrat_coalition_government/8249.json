        "additional_details": "Lorries are all limited to the same speed, yet attempt to overtake each other and can seriously impede natural traffic flow as they creep past one another.\r\n\r\nOn sections of the motorway network where combinations of geography and traffic levels mean this is a large problem, there should be set times where lorries are prevented from using the outer lane or lanes.\r\n\r\nAs trucks are all limited to the same speed, the overall impact to their journey times will be relatively small, but journeys by car or van will be significantly smoother and CO2 outputs reduced as there will be less bunching and unnecessary slowing down/speeding up.\r\n\r\nA trial on the M11 where lorries are restricted to the inside lane 7am-7pm shows this has been trialled and subjectively the traffic flows much more freely on this part of the motorway compared to just before or after.  Also, other European nations have similar schemes which work well.",
