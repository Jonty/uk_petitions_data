        "additional_details": "This year saw the first drop in GCSE results in 24 years due to the exams regulators ordering exam boards to curb grade inflation by forcing them to justify any increase on results statistics from previous years. One of the worst affected subject was the GCSE English award, which saw increases of mark boundaries for a C rise by 10 marks in one year, causing many borderline C/D candidates to miss the required grade to continue with popular programmes of education. Now is the time to act against the government to push for an investigation into the results of this life changing GCSE",
