        "additional_details": "South African born former England Rugby player, Henre Fourie faces deportation after being forced to retire from rugby due to injuries sustained while putting his body on the line for England.\r\n\r\nHis forced retirement naturally terminates his contract with Sale Sharks, causing his Sports Person visa to expire.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe that the UK has a moral obligation to allow Henre Fourie to settle in the UK. We draw parallels between the injuries Henre Fourie sustained on the rugby field and that of a South African serving in the British Army having been injured and disabled, whilst distinguishing himself on the battlefield.",
