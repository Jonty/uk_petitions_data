        "additional_details": "We believe that British tourism industry is vital to the health of the UK economy, never more so than in the present economic climate, and the amusement industry plays a highly significant role within this. We are seriously concerned that hundreds of small and family-run businesses right across the country will be damaged by the governments proposals for a new tax on gaming machines which will lead to increased costs and complexity. We call on the Government to ensure that any change to the tax regime is fully consulted on and its consequences do not damage the revenues of local amusement businesses which will threaten jobs, businesses and communities in the British amusement sector and tourism industry.\r\n\r\n",
