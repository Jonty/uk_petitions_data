        "additional_details": "The UK does not seem to have a dedicated Emergency Disaster Fund to fund national disasters such as Floods, Hurricane, Snow Storms etc. The fact that this wonderful island is spared the ravages that nature is capable of such as Typhoons Sunamis and Tornados is no excuse to be complacent. We are a generous nation when disaster affects third world countries but not when it affect us being that we are the 6th richest in the world. The consensus is that the weather pattern will get progressively worse. It would be an extremely valuable asset to the government that establishes such a fund.",
