        "additional_details": "- How can a kitchen fitter do a 2 week course and pay \u00a3500 to a registration body and then carry out the work that a REAL electrician has spent 3-4 years training to do?\r\n\r\n- Why does the qualified electrician that spent 3-4 years training need to pay the same \u00a3500 to join a registration body or apply to the council for building regs to have someone with less knowledge in their field inspect their work\r\n\r\nI would like to call for the government to make it so that a REAL electrician can join a body NICEIC, NAPIT, ELECSA (or Possibly a new one) for just a minimal administration fee and because they have had extensive training and to save on costs make it so the Qualified Electricians have fewer inspections than someone on a 2 week course at the local college.  This will mean that those trained in their field arent penalised by Part P or prevent Qualified Electricians doing their own work or starting their own business.",
