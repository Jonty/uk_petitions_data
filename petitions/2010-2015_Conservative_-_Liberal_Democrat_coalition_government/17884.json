        "additional_details": "Presently the number of bycyles, carried on passenger trains (in the guards van) is limited to a total of 3 or 5, depending on the type of locomotive. This  severely restricts the use of bikes in our cities, as passengers cannot book their bikes (and themselves) onto the trains they need to travel on,  when the capacity is so small. In my experiences, the rest of the (large) guards van is empty.\r\nThis narrow minded practice is discouraging the use of more bikes in our crowded cities, harming our environment and increasing sales of folding bikes (average price \u00a3700!) which can travel in the passenger compartment.\r\nI petition the Government to require all train operators to carry as many bycyles as are needed by fare paying passengers up to a maximum of  30 (which is about what most empty guards vans are capable of carrying)",
