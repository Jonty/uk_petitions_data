Despite the protection supposedly given by the Equalities' Act and Equal Opportunities legislation, vulnerable groups and individuals are still being victimised. There needs to be a public inquiry in order to show the racism and low expectations that exist. Then real solutions can be found - such as a national whistle-blowing helpline whereby one central body handles racism in schools as it is a crime and should not be left to the victims to manage.",
