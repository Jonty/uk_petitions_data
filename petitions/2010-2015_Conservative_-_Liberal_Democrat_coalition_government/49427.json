        "additional_details": "After watching the documentary on Monday 29th April 2013 about the appalling way some private companies treat all the mail going through its depot by the workforce, who have the most disgusting disregard for taking any pride in their work, by deliberatley throwing all the mail up and down the depot.\r\nIs this what will happen with the Royal Mail when sold off to the highest bidder for the government.\r\nThere once was a time that there was a certain pride in the very mention of The Royal Mail.\r\nBut I feel sure that if it were to go private, things would deteriorate and be just the same as any other private company.  Lets be proud of the Royal Mail and leave things as they are, its part of us, why do we need to sell everything off.",
