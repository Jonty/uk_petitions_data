        "additional_details": "When air rifles are tested by the police in case of an incident they make sure the air weapon isn't capable of a muzzle energy of over 12fpe, the problem is many weapons operate differently with different pellet weights, a Co2 or PCP air weapon can be over the limit with heavy pellet that the user wouldn't usually use such as FAC rated pellets that are extremley heavy, this is unfair and can make a law abiding shooter a criminal.\r\n\r\nWe want a system introduced for non FAC legal air weapons to be tested with a 16 grain pellet as standard, this will greatly improve our current system and make it far more easier for us law abiding shooters to keep our guns safely within the legal limit of 12 foot pounds.",
