        "additional_details": "To counteract the crippling and (seemingly) unchecked cost of motor insurance, I propose to make insurance a state run initiative whereby any persons with a driving licence would automatically pay a contribution, by way of taxation, into an insurance \"pot\".  The price would be kept low and in accordance with age and would come with the secondary benefits of reducing the crime of not having an insured vehicle and saving upon the policing involved therein, as well as generating direct revenue for the economy and not for the individual directors or shareholders.  An addition could also be made to the price to include vehicle tax.\r\n\r\n",
