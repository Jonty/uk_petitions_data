        "additional_details": "During the current Fibre \"superfast\" broadband rollout many properties are being excluded because they are not connected to a roadside cabinet. When these properties were originally connected to their local telephone exchange, cabinets were not in standard use. So while some properties are physically metres away from an exchange they cannot receive the superfast broadband of their neighbours properties connected to a later installed cabinet.\r\n\r\nCurrent regulations say that the new superfast technology must be installed outside exchanges in cabinets. Therefore new cabinets should be installed outside existing exchanges (to comply with current regs.). Or the regulations changed.\r\n\r\nCurrently the public money being spent on these projects is done so without public consultation. Homeowners and businesses cannot interact with the organisers implementing the projects to ensure fair distribution.",
