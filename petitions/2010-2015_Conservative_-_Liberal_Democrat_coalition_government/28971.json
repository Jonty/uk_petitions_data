        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask the government not to cut funding to Music Services and Music Hubs as proposed in the National Plan for Music.  We ask the government to maintain the 2011/2012 funding levels to all County Councils for Music Service provision.  Currently thousands of children benefit from Music and Arts Service activities across the country including many families from low income backgrounds who access subsidies provided through the services. We believe that the Music and Arts Services, many of whom have been judged \"Outstanding\" are an integral part of a comprehensive education for all children in our Country. We urge the Government to reverse this proposed cut that will directly impact on children and young people across the country from all schools.",
