        "additional_details": "The current system of sentencing and rehabilitating offenders is ineffective and our prisons are overcrowded so an urgent  rethink is required. The danger is that we have a whole generation of offenders who have no discipliine or respect at any level and very little likelyhood of learning any. The debate should consider the cost and social effectiveness of prison sentencing against the potential social gains of putting them into the Army to learn discipline, respect and hopefully a trade.",
