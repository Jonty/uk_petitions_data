        "action": "Religious Law tribunals may be part of negotiation stage of Civil Law, provided the parties involved do not feel culturally obliged to conform",
        "additional_details": "Sharia & Jewish Law tribunals can be used as the mandatory negotiation & arbitration stage of Civil Procedure provided the parties involve do not feel the pressure to conform to cultural values - prior to taking formal Civil Court proceedings (in divorce, civil litigation, financial, employment issues, etc). Agreement amongst the parties involved in the negotiation & arbitration stage are not court judgments but they are part of the statutory Civil Procedure. There are over 85 Islamic Sharia tribunals/courts in Britain, settling disputes according to Islamic religious principles which can be regarded as agreement in the mandatory Civil Procedure of Civil Law. The reservations in this petition are that religious tribunals are not court of record and may be consistent in their judgements & may approve of issues that are contrary to British law (like in extra marital affairs, the best & paramount interest of children, duties of the wife, duty of care, breach of contract, etc).",
