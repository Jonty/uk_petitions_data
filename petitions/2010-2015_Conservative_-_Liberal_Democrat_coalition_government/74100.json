        "additional_details": "We attend Marlborough College, a coeducational boarding school for 13-18 year olds. Recently, \"super lessons\" have been introduced. Bearing in mind that the teenage mind can not sustain full concentration for more than 30 minutes, these super lessons force us to try and concentrate for 1hr 20m. Apart from not being able to concentrate for the majority of the lesson, concentration dips even further due to both teacher and student alike losing motivation to learn/teach due to the length of time they are expected to concentrate for. We thus \"cover\" the course quicker, but have not actually learnt it, reducing effectiveness of the teaching process.Please help us change this, sign our e-petition.",
