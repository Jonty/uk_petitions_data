        "additional_details": "I would like to see equality in the rental market so that all have equal rights irrespective of whether you rent from the charitable, private or public sector.  I have to ask to put up pictures, decorate, have pets, etc., but friends who live in Housing Association or Council stock can basically do as they wish.  I also have to put up with strangers visiting me on the pretence that they are obliged to do so yet others in other sectors do not.  Why do we have a two tier system - ironic when I pay more than they do and I have less freedom to treat a house as if it where mine.",
