        "additional_details": "Many people have broadband nowadays, 99% of these people will also be paying the TV licence. Content access is moving online and the old licence fee arrangements feel like they are getting out of date.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to collect the licence fee through broadband fees and to require broadband operators to apply the new 'Broadband Licence Fee (tax)' thus allowing people to pay monthly and for the BBC to address the gradual convergence of computing and TV content that we are undergoing.\r\n\r\n",
