        "additional_details": "Recent comments by Lord Patten have suggested the licence fee payer will have to bear the cost of the inquiries into the Jimmy Saville affair and cover up.   The licence fee is unjust and unfair as it is - we are forced to pay it regardless of if we watch the BBC's content or not. To expect us to pay for inquiries into years of sordid activities by one of their flagship presenters is too much. I wish to start this petition to ensure that the licence fee payer does not bear the brunt of this cost.",
