        "additional_details": "There are those who claim that drink spiking does not exist.\r\n\r\nMany senior officials and government departments would seem to prefer to believe that some people simply drink too much and find themselves in unwanted sexual situations, then create a spiking story to cover their embarrassment. Apparently this is more acceptable than addressing the fact that there are thousands of women and men who have been drugged and then robbed or sexually assaulted. And thousands more who have experienced a near miss.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to take drink spiking as seriously as any other form of assault, forcing licensees and councils to take preventative action and commit funds for a national public awareness campaign.\r\n",
