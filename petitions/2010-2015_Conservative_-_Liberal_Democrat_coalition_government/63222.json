        "additional_details": "\r\nAnyone who uses their own car for work and has to cover the cost of fuel themself can claim a tax rebate. Details can be found at www.mileageallowanceclaims.co.uk.\r\n\r\nHMRC has paid tax relief at 45p per mile since 2011, but this rate does not usually extend to cover the cost of travel to and from a place of study. Despite typically being on low wages, apprentices have to cover the cost of travel to their place of study out of taxed income.\r\n\r\nSign this petition for the extension of mileage allowance to be available universally for those in work-based apprenticeship training programmes for the cost of travel to and from their courses.",
