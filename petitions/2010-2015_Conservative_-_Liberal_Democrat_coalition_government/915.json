        "action": "Don't let disabled children pay the price for welfare reform: reverse unfair plans to cut support by up to \u00a327 per week for 100,000 disabled children",
        "additional_details": "Following the introduction of the government's new \"Universal Credit\" welfare system, many families with disabled children will face a cut to the financial support they receive. The new system will result in these children losing up to \u00a31400 per year (\u00a327 per week) compared to the current system - by the time a disabled child reaches 16, this could cost the family \u00a322,000.\r\n\r\nBecause the support is means tested the poorest families could stand to lose the most.\r\n\r\nThe Government estimates that 100,000 disabled children would lose out under this change - other estimates suggest the number could be considerably higher.\r\n\r\nFinancial support is crucial to help these families with the costs of raising a disabled child and manage their extra caring responsibilities; now is the time to makes some noise and ensure that these damaging proposals do not get approved.\r\n\r\nDisabled children should not pay the price for welfare reform - sign this petition to stop this cut.\r\n",
