        "additional_details": "Amend the Communications Act 2003 to make the BBC directly accountable to Ofcom.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the largest broadcasting organisation in the world enjoys an exception to the laws that govern regular media organisations, and answers only to the BBC Trust. This form of self regulation has failed both licence fee payers and the wider public as a whole. As a result, the BBC should now be answerable to the same body (Ofcom) that regulates every other media organisation in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe impending Charter Review in 2016 would be an ideal time for Government to consider this option for much needed reform.",
