        "additional_details": "Earlier this year, in a vote in the House of Commons, Parliament voted overwhelmingly to retain the practice of witholding votes from inmates in British Prisons. Despite that overwhelming vote, it seems the Government will be compelled to pay compensation to prisoners who have appealed against the practice, and the Government (i.e. - the Taxpayer) will also be fined for alleged contempt of the ECHR ruling. Due to the overwhelming nature of the parliamentary vote, the Government should consider itself of being possessed of a mandate to pay such compensation\\fines, and must refuse to do so unambiguously and permanently.",
