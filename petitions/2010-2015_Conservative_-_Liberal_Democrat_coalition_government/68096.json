        "additional_details": "We the hereby undersigned want objective inspection of parish and local councils.\r\nCurrently Parish and Town councils have millions of pounds to spend locally, but much goes on salaries and upkeep of buildings with as little as 10% going towards the services they should be providing. Secondly under equality reforms they should work harder to ensure they have enough candidates at elections to reflect the electorate that they are working on behalf of.\r\nOver the past five years, if you total up what your town or parish has had to spend, then look around at the services it provided and the accounts of what it has spent, is it good value for money? For many of us the answer is no.\r\nWe want an unbiased inspection team that is not just another layer of government, but works to ensure services are provided efficiently and scrutinise detailed accounts (including sundry accounts) to ensure good value for money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
