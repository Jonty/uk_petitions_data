        "additional_details": "We petition that the 2015 trial of light railway (tram-train) between Rotherham and Sheffield in South Yorkshire includes trialling of the carriage of standard bicycles.\r\nThis is a national trial of light-rail intended to inform similar UK schemes.  Its evaluation should include evidence about the carriage of bicycles to inform such transport developments.  We believe that a major opportunity to develop the integration of mass transport with the use of bicycles will be ignored and lost to the detriment of sustainable transport.\r\nHeavy rail is integrated with cycling and light rail and metro systems in other countries carry bicycles with no safety problems or conflicts of interests with wheelchairs, pushchairs or mobility scooters.\r\nWe ask the DfT and the Minister for Transport to request that the operating company, Stagecoach, and the project sponsors, South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive, change their decision not to allow the carriage of standard bicycles for these trials.",
