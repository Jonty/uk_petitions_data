Only people who can produce the card should be allowed to pay for luxury items such as sky television, plasma TV's, mobile phones and holidays abroad.  There is currently no incentive for people to work for these items whilst benefits are so high and no advantages whatsoever given to people who have worked for what they have.  If people on benefits were not allowed to do things people who worked could, perhaps more would want a job. There are too many people purchasing these items out of money that other people have worked for and can't afford themselves.",
