        "additional_details": "Nick Clegg has recused himself from involvement in the plan to reform Lobbying because his wife is employed as a major lobbyist for her employer.  Nick Clegg has, prior to his wife's appointment, postured as a Lobbying Reformer.  This is confirmation that the man is disingenous and in politics only for person gain.  He needs to be removed from ANY responsbility in government BECAUSE HE HAS PROVED HE CANNOT BE RELIED UPON TO BE, PLAINLY, BASICALLY HONEST in his dealings with the electorate.",
