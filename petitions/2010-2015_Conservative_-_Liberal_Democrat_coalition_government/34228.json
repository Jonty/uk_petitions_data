It is an abomination and kick in the teeth to genuine athletes and members of society that would have respected and upheld this momentous occasion with utmost dignity.\r\n\r\nSIGN THIS PETITION NOW AND GET OUR GOVERNMENT TO PUT THINGS RIGHT!!!!\r\n\r\nSEND YOUR COMMENTS AND JOIN ME AT JUSTICEBRITAIN@HOTMAIL.CO.UK",
