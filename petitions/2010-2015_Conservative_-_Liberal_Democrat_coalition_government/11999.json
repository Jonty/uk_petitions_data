        "action": "Petition against the abolition of GCSE modular examinations",
        "additional_details": "We want the government to keep the education system modular.\r\n\r\nModular; It is less stressful because you learn how to cope with the stress rather having it all in one month. Students can be lazy for two years. It is not an accurate representation of their knowledge as you cannot resit, if they have a bad day it is not their fault, and it becomes a lottery of what content appears on the paper as there is such a vast amount to cover. Students get a deep and rounded knowledge of the subject as it is in manageable pieces, they don't just get an overview. Modular was widely introduced in 2009, it has not been given a fair chance.\r\n\r\nThis petition will be launched on the internet and by e-mail. This joins with the Facebook petition under the same name. It also joins with the paper petition which will be sent out. By combining all three petitions, we hope that the signatures will amount to 100,000 so that this issue is eligible for debate at the House of Commons.",
