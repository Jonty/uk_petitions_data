Why should people give up their homes, the homes they worked hard to get and work long hours to keep and due to the economy they loose their jobs then their home after \u00a365.\r\nWe hear all the time that first time buyers cant buy their homes,yet you are willing to let people give up those homes for the sake of \u00a365 a week.\r\nStop the buy back scheme and help those in hardship",
