Alteration of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2004 should extend the existing protection of individuals to companies and remove their responsibility to expressly state their wish not to receive such unsolicited telesales/marketing calls and make it illegal to send or allow such calls to be transmitted by their equipment, where the sender can be identified.",
