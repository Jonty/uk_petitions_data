Nor did they vote to be a \"member state\" of something that has changed in all recognition and in which a single currency proposed.\r\n\r\nRevert back to the relationship voted for in 1975, regardless of whether The EU like it or not.  We are members of The Commonwealth which our monarch is the head of, and with whom we have more in common, and can trade with. We have more in common with Canada, India,  Australia, and New Zealand with whom we trade without shared laws etc. Focus on these relationships instead.",
