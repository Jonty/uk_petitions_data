        "additional_details": "I want the government to contact Infinity Ward and tell Robert Bowling and his Yankee friends that the radar on MW3 Infected games when there's only one man left is really annoying because I find 1337 spots and nobody can find me but the radar comes on and fucks it all up. It ruins the game and I think you will benefit from this as it will make the public happier! :)",
