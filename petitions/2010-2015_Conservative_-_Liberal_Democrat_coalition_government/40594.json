        "additional_details": "There is plenty of evidence now that Hemp oil cures aggressive malignant tumours in many cases. This is being ignored for two reasons. Companies that make cancer drugs make \u00a3billions selling drugs that have massive side effects as well as financial effects on families all over the country. Hemp as a plant cannot be patented by said companies. As companies make \u00a3billions selling these drugs they have a vested interest in keeping hemp illegal. THERE IS TONNES OF EVIDENCE showing the benefits. We need a proper and fit discussion regarding this. Please sign this petition. ",
