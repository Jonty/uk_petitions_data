        "additional_details": "Since the demise of the Crowtree Leisure Centre there is a massive lack of things to do in Sunderland. We miss the ice rink and fun pool and want our kids to have the fun and memories we had as children. An Olympic pool is no match for what we once had.\r\n\r\nSunderland needs a new 'Super' leisure centre for the health and well being of our next generation. We want back our ice rink, we want back our fun pool areas with slides. We want back the fun factor!!",
