The road between the school and the sports field is hazardous. Little Rissington, on a bigger road with no school, has a 30 mph limit.\r\n\r\nOur village, on a smaller road, with a pub, and scores of children coming and going, surely requires a lower limit.\r\n\r\nThe Highways Department has said \u201cNo\u201d.\r\nIf you want them to think again and agree that\r\n\u201c20 IS PLENTY\u201d\r\nplease sign here\r\n",
