        "additional_details": "I am a foster carer and look after young people with learning disabilities. I have recently identified a floor in the higher education system that closes the door to progress in a particular course if the student does not obtain a high enough pass mark.\r\nI would like the government to make it mandatory that students with learning difficulties in higher education are allowed to resit courses a second time without having to pay . This will aid the students considerably in the second year as their anxieties will be greatly reduced as they will be familiar with their surroundings, staff, and course content. The grade must only improve once anxieties have been reduced. Lets reward these students for trying not close the door to them.\r\nThank you",
