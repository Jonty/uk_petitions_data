We conducted further research on roads out of town with duck crossing signs in place. Our results were overwhelming, showing 0 dead ducks on these roads.\r\n\r\nWe know that this evidence is incredible and proves just how obvious it is that a duck crossing sign should be put up in Boroughbridge.\r\n\r\nAll we want to do is save the ducks of Boroughbridge from getting murdered and feel the government are the ones that can help by putting up at least one duck crossing sign.\r\n\r\nSo please sign the petition to show you are more passionate about saving ducks than the murderers are killing them, we can't let them win.\r\n\r\nThank you",
