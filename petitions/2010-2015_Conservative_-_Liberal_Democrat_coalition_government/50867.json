        "additional_details": "During the last two years there have been many high profile reports of childhood sexual abuse, kidnapping and child murder. These have been hard to avoid due to rolling news coverage and regular updates on daytime TV and radio, often playing in public areas such as cafes and recreation centres where switching off is not an option.\r\n\r\nWhile the reporting shows that child abuse is being taken seriously, its unneccessary detail may be causing further harm as introducing children to such material is itself a form of abuse. It is proposed that a 9pm watershed be introduced to prevent the unnecessary exposure of children to detailed news reports about other children experiencing significant harm.",
