All cash savings for individuals should be completely tax free.   Cash ISA's are an unnecessary beaureaucracy and scrapping them combined with tax free limitless cash savings will probably result in greater net revenue to the Exchequer due to larger revenues from VAT due to increased spending on items attracting VAT.
