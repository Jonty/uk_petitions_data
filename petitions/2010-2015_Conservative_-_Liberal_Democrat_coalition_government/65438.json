I and many others do not answer calls that are 'number withheld' or 'Private number' and have consequently missed important calls. This must be costing the NHS a lot of money in wasted time by clerical staff, as well as annoying many patients.  I believe that BT is starting a system to block number withheld calls, which will not be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
