        "additional_details": "Inheritance tax is biased against those of modest wealth because they cannot afford to relinquish control of assets to be protected from the tax.\r\n\r\nSolution: make inheritance tax unavoidable. Abolish the seven year gift tax exemption rule immediately for all living persons. Instead give everybody a life-time gifting allowance. Said allowance would be affordable to the Treasury at a much higher level than the current exemption ceiling for inheritance tax.\r\n\r\nGiven the government's determination to clamp down on aggressive tax avoidance it would inconsistent to ignore inheritance tax.",
