        "additional_details": "Every year the clocks change as we go into the winter and the days are shorter and evening and nights are longer\r\n\r\nThis change of clock is always detrimental to all businesses and in particular the spirit and motivation of all citizens is affected by this change of time where is gets progressively darker as you enter the winter months\r\n\r\nThis petition is to keep the same time summer and winter. This would benefit farmers and many other communities. Schools would have more daylight when leaving at the end of the day and it would lift the community     ",
