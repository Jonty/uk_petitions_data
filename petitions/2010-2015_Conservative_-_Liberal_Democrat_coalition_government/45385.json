        "additional_details": "While hutches/cages are for sale in pet shops etc at 2ft and 3ft rabbits/Guinea pigs will always be kept in them. rabbits are not designed to live in such a confined space. It is cruel some can not turn round stand up.  which in turn means silent suffering for them, causing them serious health problems., even death. Rabbits are not designed to live in a confined space. Domestic rabbits are not fundamentally far removed from their wild cousins. so their accommodation must allow them to display these natural behaviours.The RWAF recommends a minimum hutch size of 6' x 2' x 2' The RWAF's A Hutch is Not Enough Campaign, they are encouraging retailers to consider the welfare of rabbits in all their dealings with their customers. But while 3ft and 2ft even smaller continue to be sold then rabbits welfare will always be affected and many 1,000s WILL continue to suffer... as they are today..",
