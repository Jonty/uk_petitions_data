This will give them valuable life skills it will also make them more employable.\r\nLimits set on having children while on full income support/benefits and how much more you can claim.\r\nTighter controls in place so immigrants cannot claim when moving to the UK.\r\nEvaluations on those that are on benefits longer than 6 months; do they deserve this money? Are they seeking work? Is it being falsely claimed?\r\n\r\n",
