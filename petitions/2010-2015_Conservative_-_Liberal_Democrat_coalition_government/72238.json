        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition if you believe all buses should have seatbelts. I have created this petition after my little girl was thrown from her seat into a metal bar today, due to the driver having to brake suddenly. I am in no way blaming the bus driver, as i know sometimes it is necessary to brake with urgency. But had there been seatbelts on the bus, my three year old would have been unharmed.",
