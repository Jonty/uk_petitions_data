This tax is just and fair for the vast majority of hard working families in Britain who are finding it hard to make financial ends meet. The conservative leader and coalition government should implement this tax without undue delay. The Mansion tax should be in place, instead of raising tax on income or further increases in VAT and fuel duty for millions of hard working Britons and will further help lift the economy.",
