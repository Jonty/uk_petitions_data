        "additional_details": "This online petition continues from one carried out in the Sidcup High Street area in 2011. Those who signed it (over 1200 people) wished to express their concern over proposals to drastically further reduce the number of Police Stations open to the Public as reported recently in the media.\r\n\r\nThey wish to call on the Government to review the proposed closures not only of Sidcup and Belvedere (Bexley and Greater London) but also the cuts across the country in general. In the present economic climate they feel crime is likely to increase and are also more concerned in the aftermath of the recent riots.\r\n",
