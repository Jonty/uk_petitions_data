        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the removal from office of Dr. Mark Drakeford, the current Minister for Health and Social Services in the Welsh Assembly, with immediate effect.Dr. Drakeford clearly does not have a clue about Health and Social Services in Wales, so is therefore unfit for purpose.  This man wants to close a good hospital in Royal Glamorgan and force people to be treated at the already overcrowded and struggling University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.  People from the Rhondda Valley will be forced to have emergency surgery over 30 miles away in a struggling hospital where ambulances regularly queue for five hours or more outside.  Dr. Drakeford is obviously oblivious to the fact that \u2018The Golden Hour\u2019 counts and that people stand a greater risk of dying from life-threatening injuries if they cannot be seen and treated as soon as possible.   Dr. Drakeford must be removed from office immediately!",
