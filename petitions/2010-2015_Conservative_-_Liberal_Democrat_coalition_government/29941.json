Therefore the more affordable time is during term time.\r\n\r\nEducation is important and an excellent school attendance record is critical. However, two weeks per annum out of school to enhance a childs life experience and promote aspirations seems reasonable to enhance their whole eduction and not just english, maths etc. Indeed we educate our children to be functional and responsible adults so that they can contribute to society and be rewarded for their hard work, incuding holidays.",
