This added to sick chants about Munich, Hillsborough, Dave Jones and Jimmy Saville, missiles being thrown and fights outside thr ground proved once again how a huge portion of Leeds fans go to city and wreck it. This isn't the first incident they've been involved in, and it won't be the last. Leeds fans should have tough sanctions placed upon, with small allocations and should they cause trouble they are not allowe dtickets to the next away match.  This will reduce policing costs, which are bumped up when these go to any club.",
