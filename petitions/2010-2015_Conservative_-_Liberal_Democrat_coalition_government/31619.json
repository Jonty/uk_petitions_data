        "additional_details": "Less hassle for victims of crime. Courts should hold separate sentencing for offenders to reward damages to the victims, & at no additional cost or to the victim.\r\n\r\nAn example of how this works:\r\n1) Individual is found guilty of a crime.\r\n2) Standard criminal proceeds & sentencing.\r\n3) Offender is then sentenced again; regarding compensation for victims.\r\nN.B.\r\n- Compensation should consider direct financial loss, loss of earnings & inconvenience payments to victims.\r\n\r\n- Government should pay victims the awarded amount immediately, preventing financial problems arising for victims,. This means that it is the governments job to reclaim the often low repayments that offenders pay. Victims typically find \u00a33 a week from the offender useless when they have to pay \u00a3400 (as an example) replacing a stolen/damaged phone.\r\n\r\n- Victims should be able to appeal after the initial sentencing to account for long-term issues arising from the crime (eg. mental/physical long-term effects).",
