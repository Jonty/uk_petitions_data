        "additional_details": "The 2015 Fire Service Pension Scheme is due to be introduced in April this year, completely against the wishes of the 50,000 Firefighters in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis bitter dispute between the FBU and the Government has raged on for 3 years, yet the government have refused to listen to factual arguments opposing these devastating reforms which will see thousands of Firefighters forced out of their job without a pension, simply for getting too old carry on.\r\n\r\nThese firefighters now face a stark decision. Enter into the new scheme in April despite having very little knowledge of the proposed changes, or withdraw from the scheme & risk retiring in the future without enough money to survive.\r\n\r\nThis is simply unacceptable. Therefore we ask that the introduction of the new 'rushed through' scheme is postponed for 12 months to allow Firefighters enough time to seek the advice they need to understand what they are signing up for, and to allow the FBU more time to negotiate with the government.",
