Personally I feel this is a little unreasonable, especially in consideration over the fact there is no age of consent for piercings. Due to the permanent nature of the tattoo I'd hope for parental consent to be required for under 18's, as no doubt they will have better judgement over the choice of tattoo, and the artist.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.",
