        "additional_details": "We would like to bring to the Governments attention  how \"archaic \" & in some cases \"biased \" the Law & Judiciary systems` approach is regarding victims of rape & sexual abuse.\r\nIn particular the Learning Disabled who face prejudice at their level of capabilities & understanding making it almost impossible for them to get recognition or be believed.\r\nWhilst it should be innocent until proven guilty \"the accused\" has rights far outweighing that of \"the victim\"\r\nWe  ask the Government to completely overhaul the laws for rape & sexual abuse & how victims are treated from \"reporting to trial\" . An updated & sympathetic approach is required with a level playing field for all.\r\nWith so many reports on this subject in the public domain \"now is the time for change\".",
