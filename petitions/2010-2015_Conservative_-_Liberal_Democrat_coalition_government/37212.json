The recent decision to replace this service is flawed and a very bad idea.\r\n\r\nThis new decision is unfair and revolves yet again around money and not quality.\r\n(This is not a personal opinion, this is genuinely what people think! look through any article on the decision and almost all the comments agree with this)\r\n\r\nSo what do we want?\r\nWe request that Virgin continues the amazing performance on the WCML and that they pay what they offered in the first place.\r\n",
