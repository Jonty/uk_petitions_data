Symptoms include everything from acne and weight gain to infertility, diabetes and cancer.\r\n This petition is to have more information and advice made available for women with PCOS.\r\nThere is very little professional information available and many women seek the comfort of online forums to speak with others battling with this frustrating and life changing syndrome.\r\n More needs to be done to make other women aware of this syndrome and to help those living with it on a daily basis.",
