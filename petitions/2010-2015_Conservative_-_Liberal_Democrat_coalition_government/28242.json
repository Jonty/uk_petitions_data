        "additional_details": "Theresa May has been appointed by David Cameron as Equalities minister - her resumee is as follows:\r\n\r\nShe voted against lowering age of consent for gay sex.\r\nWanted to keep section 28 and not teach about sexuality in schools.\r\nVoted against gay adoption.\r\nVoted against Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill which gives lesbians the right to fertility treatment.\r\n\r\nThe above clearly displays that Theresa May is not the Minister to represent or deal with issues affecting the LGBT community in the UK and clearly signals the disasterous way ahead if she is not removed from this post.\r\n\r\nThis appointment is like putting Hitler in charge of world peace and shows a lack of clear judgement by the Government and the Prime Minister in particular.\r\n\r\nDONT DELAY VOTE TODAY  - Remove Theresa May from this post immediately.\r\n",
