        "additional_details": "The sun has and its associated companies (News International) have caused many problems in this country. They have illegally hacked into the phones of innocent victims of crime such as Milly Dowler, as well as criminals such as Robert Thomson (killer of James Bulger) in order for them to publish 'exclusive' stories.  They have published stories of outright lies against many people including the 96 victims of the Hillsborough Disaster and I cannot believe they have been granted the licence to publish a new paper when all their existing titles have been brought down in to such disrepute.\r\n\r\nThe 'News of the World' rightly closed down after all the disgraceful allegations against them causing many job losses.\r\n\r\nWhy should Mr Murdoch be allowed to launch basically the same paper as the 'News of the World' with a new name without investigation? I think the licence for this paper should be revoked until investigations against all 'News International' companies is completed.",
