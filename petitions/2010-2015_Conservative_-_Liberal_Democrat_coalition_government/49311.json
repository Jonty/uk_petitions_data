        "additional_details": "It is time that the remit of the Local Government Ombudsman is increased to include  all Parish and Town Councils (8,350 public authorities in England fall into these categories). The current system means that these bodies are totally unaccountable for there actions resulting in discrimination, maladministration , abuses etc. There is currently no practical redress available to those affected by the decisions of these bodies other than the courts which is financial restrictive. This change would simply bring these types of authorities in line with other local authorities - County and District Councils.\r\n\r\n",
