The citizens of this country have given up too many rights in the name of safety and all it has done is stripped the hard working and honest citizens the means to defend their life and property, meanwhile criminals are able to run amok unhindered and free of any danger while the innocent cower in fear with nothing to defend themselves as these animals roam the streets in packs with ranks that outnumber the Police .\r\n\r\nHM Government should review and make amendments to the firearms act so that law abiding and hard working citizens have the right to own a suitable firearm to protect their homes, lively hoods and lives of the innocent .\r\n\r\nWE MAY LIVE IN A CIVILIZED WORLD BUT IT STILL A VERY DANGEROUS WORLD !\r\n ",
