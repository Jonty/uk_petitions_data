        "additional_details": "With the current economic climate anything that generates money for the country has GOT to be a good thing. There is no reason why old registration plates on vehicles that have been scrapped for more than 5 years, or plates that have NEVER been issued should not be re-issued.\r\nI propose that ANY old plate should be made available for the public to buy.\r\nThis would generate literally MILLIONS for the treasury and would also help spin-off businesses.",
