Local children are unable to play outside as the smell makes them feel sick, and people have reported not being able to use their gardens due to the smell.\r\n\r\nAnyone looking to sell their house is going to have problems as no one viewing a house in an area that smells like this is going to want to buy in Glossop, and tourism and the High Street shops will suffer because of it too.\r\n\r\n",
