        "additional_details": "Harriot Harman should step down as an Member of Parliament for her failure to respond adequately to her connections to PIE.  She has failed to give a full and correct account of her activities and has had the contempt to ignore the seriousness of the allegations relating to the ongoing issues surrounding the NCCL.  How anyone could work for or support a group such as the NCCL  when it has affiliations with a paedophile organisation is itself questionable.  Either she chose to ignore its affiliation within the NCCL in order to \"get on\" or just didn't care.  Either or its outrageous and she needs to go.  Any politician that claims to represent the average person in the street having had a dubious past and or links to unreasonable civilised groups do not and can not represent the view of the general electorate.I seek the removal by the way of resignation of and or a vote of no confidence in Harriot Harman and her ultimate removal from Parliament.",
