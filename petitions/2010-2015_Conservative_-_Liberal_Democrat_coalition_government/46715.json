        "additional_details": "Prosopagnosia (or face blindness) is characterized by the inability to recognize others from their face.  The condition can be acquired or developmental (i.e. lifelong) in origin, and is thought to affect one person in fifty.  Yet, public and professional awareness of the condition is low.  According to the Equality Act 2010, you are disabled if you have a physical or mental impairment that has a \u2018substantial\u2019 and \u2018long-term\u2019 negative effect on your ability to carry out normal daily activities.  Although prosopagnosia clearly meets these criteria, many people feel unable to disclose their condition at their place of work.  Further, the current lack of awareness also means the condition goes undetected in many children.  Public discussion and formal recognition of prosopagnosia is essential in order to afford equal rights to individuals of all ages who are affected by the condition.",
