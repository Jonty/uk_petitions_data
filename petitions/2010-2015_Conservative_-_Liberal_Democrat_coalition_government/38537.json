        "additional_details": "Children receive the following feeble amounts of mandatory physical education (PE) in schools:\r\n\r\nKey Stage 3: 1 Hour\r\nKey Stage 4: 1 Hour\r\nKey Stage 5: No hours\r\n\r\nThis e-petition's purpose is to increase these times.\r\n\r\nFrom teaching experience, the actual time that pupils spend partaking in PE is nearer 30 minutes - once they have arrived from lunch/prior lesson, changed, been registered and sent to their next class.\r\n\r\nWe've all seen the impact sport has had on the nation thanks to the Olympic and Paralympic games. The games aimed to leave a legacy - to inspire a generation.\r\n\r\nSchools are vital for this goal to be achieved. They'll be providing us with our future Olympians and Paralympians \u2013 which will boost our economy and they also have a huge impact on children\u2019s views of health which could help the strain on the NHS regarding such issues as obesity.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this e-petition if you wish to see a change in the national curriculum \u2013 from 1 hour\u2019s PE to 2 hours.",
