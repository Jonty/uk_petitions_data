        "additional_details": "  Every individual in the United Kingdom should be entitled to the same reasonable choice when it comes to goods and services provisions. When being asked to sign up for terms upwards of 12 months, it is necessary and fair that choices are available in order to generate a competitive market.\r\n The choices currently available to those living in Kingston-Upon-Hull and the surrounding areas are limited to just one provider. Individuals are not entitled to a choice, and this has the ability to affect their workplaces and educational needs as well as their usage at home.\r\n It is not necessary to dispute or debate the reasoning behind this, only to make clear that in the interests of equality we demand an equally competitive market to the rest of the UK. Whether this requires action from Kingston Communications, OFCOM, or other providers to actively pursue a deal in Hull, the outcome has to be in the interests of the public. ",
