        "additional_details": "The whole point of traffic planning is traffic FLOW and safety. So why on earth would the planners prefer the traffic light to the roundabout? (or even the most ridiculous idea of traffic lights ON roundabouts) Simply put it's because traffic stop / stationery / start at traffic lights increases fuel use, of which we know the Government makes a mint out of by way of duty, tax, and VAT. The other reason is because a traffic light takes away your choice. The Government will state safety, however, it's proven that the injury rate is comparable. At a roundabout, traffic flows and you have the choice to when go. No sitting at an empty junction waiting for a red light to tell you. So please, sign this petition and lets force the removal of traffic lights at junctions and put more roundabouts in. (Canada and the USA are doing it as we speak! They see the benefits)",
