If we are to survive we must prepare for the future and tackle global warming now by reducing our carbon emissions. Despite what sceptics claim, the UK is ideally situated to exploit renewables; we have the biggest coastline in Europe, being an island, and experience winds across the whole country. Offshore and onshore windfarms should be built as a matter of urgency. Solar, despite, again, what sceptics [the ignorant] claim, can be usefully exploited, and a national solar roof campaign to convert existing properties along with a law making new builds energy neutral with solar panels should be introduced, and river generation should be revived as a usefgul and constant source of power [water mills helped power the industrial revolution]. Alongside this should be a serious development of storage methods to even out fluctuations in supply and demand. ",
