I propose that any unused land, large field/area of public land and even parks should have fruit trees and bushes, vegetables and nuts planted. This would not only make healthy food more available to those who can't afford it normally but would provide food for the homeless, encourage children to eat healthily and even provide maintanence jobs for the planted areas.",
