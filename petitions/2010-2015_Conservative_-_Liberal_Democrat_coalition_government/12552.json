There are an estimated 5.1 million asthma sufferers in the U.K. and it is unfortunately becoming more common. Asthma is now one of the main reasons children are admitted to hospital and also one of the leading causes of hospital admissions for adults. Every year there are over 2000 asthma fatalities. However, most people with asthma can and do lead normal active lives.\r\nSource - Asthma Information\r\nhttp://www.homehealth-uk.com/medical/asthma.htm\r\n\r\nSmokers get free 'quitting' classes, and they choose to smoke.\r\nWhy should ASTHMA sufferers have to pay through no fault of their own, simply to stay alive!",
