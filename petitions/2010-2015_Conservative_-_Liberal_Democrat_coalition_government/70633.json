        "additional_details": "While e-cigarette can and do help people stop smoking, there is insufficient research or data to evidence what potential harm may also be caused. The vapourisers and liquids are not currently subject to licencing and so there is no quality control over these products. Inhaling vapours that are not evidenced as having a therapeutic benefit should not be promoted. TV advertising of these products gives the message that they are safe and may also encourage people who have never smoked to try them. There is no research to show that they are safe and so the government should be more responsible in allowing their marketing. Stopping smoking cigarettes is always a good idea and if it is proved that e-cigs or vapourisers are a safe and effective cessation tool then wonderful but until then caution must be exercised. Therefore, TV advertising and overt promotion of these products should be banned.",
