        "additional_details": "The local council are attempting to stunt the growth, education, opportunities and talents of everyone especially our young people and elders by wanting to close down Centerprise Trust Ltd the Dalston-based, Community and Arts Centre.\r\n\r\nThe Centre is in imminent danger of closure, after Hackney Council gave the 41-year old centre two weeks to cease operations and hand over the keys to the property. Although involved in lease negotiations the Council have disingenuously resorted to legal action to close the Centre.\r\n\r\nThe Trust\u2019s clientele are mainly, minorities such as women, children and black and other ethnic minority communities\u2019.\r\n\r\nAs the only book shop in Hackney dedicated to radical thought there will be a democratic deficit should the Centre close, coupled with the loss of vital services to the most vulnerable in the community.\r\n\r\nTHE CENTRE NEEDS TO REMAIN OPEN",
