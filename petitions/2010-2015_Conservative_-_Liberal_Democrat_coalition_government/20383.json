The majority of   parents under the age of 18, do not remain with the father, have a huge burden on the benefit system and most fall pregnant due to the appealing \"easy way out\" route, which usually involves gaining a public owned flat/house. Put a stop to under 18's receiving these benefits and this will reduce many NHS costs and a growing nation of children having children. ",
