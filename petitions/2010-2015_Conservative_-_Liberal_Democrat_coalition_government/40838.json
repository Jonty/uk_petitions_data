        "additional_details": "This petition is to stop the the motorcycle driving licence changes that are scheduled to take effect on January 13th 2013. (Click this link to find out what the changes are: http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/new-driving-licence-rules-for-mopeds-motorcycles-and-tricycles )\r\nThe government should reconsider the radical changes they are making to the motorcycle laws. Changing the age restrictions by the amount they are is ridiculous. Motorcycle are thought to be dangerous, but it's not the bike, it's the way its ridden. I suggest the age restrictions are kept the same, but the training and tests that is needed to get you licence is made more in-depth.\r\nI urge you to sign this petition. We need to get our voices heard,\r\nThank-You.",
