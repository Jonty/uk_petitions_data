If the average person was to leave a job, they would be unable to claim rewards for work they did over 10 years ago, as Baroness Thatcher has.\r\nThis is an unfair system which is costing the country money which we cannot afford.\r\nPM's get paid a high wage when in office, why should they be able to claim money when out? They make enough through charging for speeches/books. ",
