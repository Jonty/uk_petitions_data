        "additional_details": "We ask that this racist and fascist television channel should be closed down immediately. It tries to pretend that it is about British culture but we all know that it is promoting the racist and fascist agenda of the British National Party, or more accurately the British Nazi Party. It seeks to promote and stir up hatred of a large proportion of the population of this country. We should be seeking peaceful co-existence between our many different and varied cultures.",
