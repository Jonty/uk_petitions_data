Who are further disadvantaged with these outrageous costs, which can result in attachment of earnings orders, bailiffs, deductions against benefits, repossession, eviction & homelessness.\r\n\r\nCouncils claim that these costs to pay for the expense of collection of council tax against all residents. This is just nonsense.\r\n\r\nCosts in civil legal proceedings have to be justified with a statement that; \"The costs claimed do not exceed the actual costs incurred\".\r\n\r\nThese Costs are perpetuated by the councils, and supported by the magistrate\u2019s courts. It is illegal, a fraud, and it must be stopped.",
