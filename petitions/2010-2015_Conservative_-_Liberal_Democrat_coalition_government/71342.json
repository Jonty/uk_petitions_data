I believe that all taxi drivers should have to undergo a full CRB check. Which would hopefully eliminate the above risk and also weed out illegally working immigrants.\r\nPlease sign and safeguard  vulnerable people  of all ages. Thank you for viewing  and hopefully signing this petition and hopefully make a difference. ",
