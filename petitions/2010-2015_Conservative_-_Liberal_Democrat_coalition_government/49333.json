It is important for us to have a pool because the local community needs a place to keep fit. A pool would give us somewhere fun to play and enjoy ourselves. It could also keep young people out of trouble. We hope this pool will form part of the Government's Olympic Legacy and give our young athletes a place to discover their dreams.",
