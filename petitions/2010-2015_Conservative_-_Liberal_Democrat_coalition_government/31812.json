        "additional_details": "To ask the government to intercept North Lincolnshire Council from harrassing and trying to close down Kieradan Park Motocross Track, allowing them to remain open, in turn allowing the motocross community to build upon there already growing industry and to allow all Motocross riders to ride in a very well organised, very well maintained safe place which in turn will considerably reduce illegal off road riding in ALL areas of the country. Also helping our local businesses to gain from the extra custom as well as providing jobs for our younger generation.",
