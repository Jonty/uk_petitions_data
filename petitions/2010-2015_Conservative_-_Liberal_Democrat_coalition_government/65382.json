        "additional_details": "On 19th May Wandle Housing Association contacted its buyers of Shared Ownership properties in the new Streatham Hub development and informed them that despite agreeing to a price and taking \u00a3500 deposit they would be increasing the prices for the properties. In some cases the increase was over 50%. In the 6 months since the agreement Wandle had avoided all attempts to start contractual proceedings this meant that this increase was completely legal despite being extremely unethical.\r\nThese were \u2018affordable housing\u2019 and most of the people affected can no longer afford to buy these properties. This issue was covered by BBC London Drive Time with Eddie Nestor on 21st May and a campaign has begun to hold the Wandle Housing Association to account for profiteering from the very people it is supposed to be helping.\r\nThe \u2018would be\u2019 residents of Derry Court, ask that you sign this petition to stop this unethical behaviour.\r\n",
