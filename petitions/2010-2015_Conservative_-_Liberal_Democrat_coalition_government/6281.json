        "additional_details": "Ensure any rises in UK energy costs is linked to the price other European country are charging. We currently have a system that is worse than a monopoly as there seems to be a form of price fixing in the industry. Coupled with so many energy companies having to make a profit, means that this country is being fleeced. Any company that can't keep to European prices will just have to fail, like in the real world.",
