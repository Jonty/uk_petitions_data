        "additional_details": "In September 2012, my sister had to be admitted to hospital for mastoid surgery. As she had turned 16, she was admitted onto the adult ward. This meant she was allowed no visitors except in visiting hours.\r\n\r\nA 16 year old girl should not have to face being in hospital alone, and potentially having to go for her op alone.\r\n\r\nI think that a teen ward should be introduced in NHS hospitals, for 13-18year olds, with the same visiting rules as a children ward has. This will keep teens separate from children but also give them the comfort they need before going for a major operation.",
