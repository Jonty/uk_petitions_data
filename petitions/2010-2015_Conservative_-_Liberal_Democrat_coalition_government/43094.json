        "additional_details": "We call on the government to take action over the M62 managed motorway roadworks which have caused untold misery for thousands of commuters in the West Yorkshire area.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that such a significant engineering project will take time and inevitably encounter difficulties but we question the efficiency and safety of the current plan.\r\n\r\nComments from the Highways Agency's David Pilsworth, which basically amounted to 'people should drive more carefully and crash less' seems a totally unsatisfactory response to concerns about a stretch of motorway which has seen 33 accidents in the last month.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the hard shoulder, the apparent lack of employees actually working on the project and the narrowness of the lanes seem to make the glacial pace and frequent accidents all but unavoidable.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned urge the Department and House to reconsider the scheduled managed motorway project and take action to alleviate the long and regular delays on the M62.\r\n",
