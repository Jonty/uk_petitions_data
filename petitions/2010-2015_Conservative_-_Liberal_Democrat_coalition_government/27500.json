The conduct and rhetoric is an embarrassment not just to parliament, but to Britain.\r\nWe hear the previous government did this, and then a retort no they didn\u2019t, which decays to the kind of exchange worthy of a primary school playground. We need adult behaviour in parliament at all times and any member  who engages in such rhetoric should be removed from the house whatever his position.\r\nMPs may bring fact to a private meeting outside parliament before a referee if necessary, but to reduce parliamentary debate to that of a children\u2019s playground is contemptible. Even reporters sometimes  state\u2019oh please\u2019 when childish remarks are made.\r\nit is small wonder that those mp\u2019s are unable to resolve political differences internationally with such behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
