We are for the idea of Euthanasia because as a group we believe that the individual, who has no quality of life, should have the right to decide whether they want to live suffering or die with dignity. We are a group of GCSE citizenship students and having looked at all sides of the argument we think you should take our opinions into account and take action on this issue",
