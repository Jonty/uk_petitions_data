On Friday 12th April 2013, the BBC decided it would not play this song on the weekly chart show. This goes against all that the BBC promises it stands for. The British people are forced to pay the BBC with the licence fee or a threat of prison is held over our heads and in return, the BBC promises to serve the public and give us a voice! Well this proves that is a load of rubbish and for this, we don't feel the BBC is living up to it's responsibilities and we no longer have that voice. Even if you disagree with the song being in the charts, I'm sure everyone will agree that a company that is funded by the people should stand for the people and a large portion of the British people want their voices heard. If the BBC wants to continue being funded by the tax payer, they should answer to us! If the BBC want control of their own product, they should damn well fund themselves!",
