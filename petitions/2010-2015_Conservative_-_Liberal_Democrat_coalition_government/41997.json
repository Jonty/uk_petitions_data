How is a person supposed to get experience if no one is willing to give a young person a chance? This is forcing them to work in a dead end, hard labour job with no development.\r\n\r\nThere has to be a government scheme set up to financially back up businesses and company's to allow them to make apprenticeships and job vacancy's, which are then in turn took to schools and given to young adults 16 to 25.",
