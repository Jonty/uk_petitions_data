Tribunals accepting ill-health should have to accept cause of ill-health and not accept one part without the other.  In accepting ill-health they are agreeing to the disability but then rejecting the diagnosis on the other hand.  Play fair for disabled, this is outright disability discrimination by the very law we expect to safeguard us.",
