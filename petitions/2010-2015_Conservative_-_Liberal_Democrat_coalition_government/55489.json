        "action": "Petition For Better Bus Routes In Cornwall And Cheaper Fares",
        "additional_details": "I feel buses in Cornwall are some of the worst in the country. They are often late with no bus shelters to wait under and when they eventually turn up the fares are over-priced, with limited seats. The routes are very limited and the routes that do exist often take at least three times longer than if you were driving a car. Too many people in Cornwall feel they are forced into having to own a car due to inaccessibility and limited times of buses in the County. I feel that the buses need an upgrade and more routes should be introduced. Fares and day tickets should be more affordable for local Cornish residents and should allow you to hop on and off buses easier, this would reduce the amount of traffic on the roads therefore buses will likely be more on time and CO2 emissions will be reduced. Please sign this petition if you are fed up of the limited public transport in Cornwall and demand a change. ",
