        "additional_details": "When a person dies because of negligence by a corporation, normally a charge of Corporate Manslaughter can apply. Every year in the UK, people die because they cannot afford to both heat their homes and eat. Energy companies should have a duty of care to their clients so that when one freezes to death because they cannot afford to heat their home, the respective energy company should face charges of corporate manslaughter. In the 21st century, people should not be dying of cold in their own homes.",
