It has been called 'a fair tax',  when in fact in it is an 'unfair tax' on single income families on the threshold between the two tax brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple earning just under the threshold with a total income of between \u00a360-\u00a380K will keep their benefit, while a family with a sole provider earning just over the limit at \u00a342,500 loses it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is simply not a fair tax.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe government must rethink their plans a find a new way to improve the system.
