        "additional_details": "We have no mother and baby unit in the whole of Wales, which helps women with perinatal mental health problems. There is only NHS Prams in Bridgend which has a limit and no organisation to help families and support them. We need funding to be given to people who are campaigning for better services and have the experience to not waste money. We need an advocacy and drop in centre to stop families from breaking up and using negative coping skills. Young dads and mums need to know that social services will not take their children away if they have postnatal depression. All organisations are run voluntary and need funding to make this a full time service which will save people and stop other mental health issues developing in their lives.. Simple PREVENTION BEFORE CRISIS.",
