        "additional_details": "The high rise building I live in has no kind of insulation, I'm sure this is the same in a lot of high rises. Wolverhampton council are spending money insulating whilst renovating some of their high rises. The high rise buildings in Lincoln are a big waste of energy due to none existent insulation which should be looked into, the carbon footprint of these none insulated buildings on their own is making a big impact on the environment and always will until the issue is addressed.\r\n\r\nIf the high rises in Lincoln were insulated energy bills for tenants and the region would be reduced, which in the long run would be beneficial for the environment.\r\n\r\nHouseholds are told that a minimum of 100mm insulation in the loft is recommended, high rise flats have no loft space, so the insulation should be applied to the walls. This is something that the government/council should be doing.",
