        "additional_details": "We are often bombarded with buy one get one free (BOGOF) offers at our supermarkets, recently deodorant was at a well known supermarket at \u00a33 each or buy 2 get 2 free, meaning that you had to buy 4 and spend \u00a36 to get any savings.\r\nWith falling wages and low incomes many people don't have \u00a36 to spend on deodorant in one go.\r\nAlso, not everyone has a car so have to carry their shopping home. Someone elderly, disabled or with young children would struggle to carry the extra items.\r\nWhen these offers are applied to perishable items of food they also create waste, with the free one often thrown away.\r\nThese offers are therefore discriminating against people on low incomes or without their own transport and encourage unnecessary waste.\r\nIt would be far fairer and more environmentally friendly for the items (particularly heavy, bulky or perishable items) to be offered at half price.\r\nI would like to see these offers restricted to half price so they are accessible to all and reduce waste.\r\n\r\n",
