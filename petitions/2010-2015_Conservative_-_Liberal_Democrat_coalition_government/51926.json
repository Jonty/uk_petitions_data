        "additional_details": "During the high summer months the sun rises well before 6 a.m. when most of the population are asleep. This extra daylight could be put to greater use in the evenings. If we adopted Double Summer Time we would be on the same time zone as most of western Europe, including Spain, which is geographically further west than the UK. This would be good for business, since working hours would be synchronised. Double Summer Time was used effectively for 5 years during World War 2. If brought in, it would be good for the economy, because it would enhance and increase outdoor leisure possibilities, which would benefit the general health and well-being of the nation. It would be advantageous for both road and personal safety, and of course it would save on energy consumption, in terms of domestic lighting and heating.",
