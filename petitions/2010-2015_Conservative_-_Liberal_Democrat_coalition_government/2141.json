        "additional_details": "Government to please change the law that says all job vacancies have to be advertised. Currently companies have to advertise all vacancies, even when the role has already been promised to someone already employed by them (internally). This creates false hope for those who are out of work and are contacted by recruitment agencies with the role, only to discover it doesn't really exist! They spend time and effort on their CV and covering letter, only to hear nothing, or be told weeks later that the role has gone to an 'internal candidate'. It's heartbreaking when you are long-term unemployed and keep having your hopes dashed.\r\n",
