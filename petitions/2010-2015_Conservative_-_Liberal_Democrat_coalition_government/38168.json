        "additional_details": "Online Marketplace such as eBay and amazon are wonderful platforms for someone to start a business without much investment. They are also very helpful to people in low income as they can trade part time on these websites.\r\nWhen the business grows, sometimes both eBay and amazon can destroy someone's livelihood by simply removing selling privileges for unjustifiable reasons.  The seller is stuck with thousands of pounds worth of stock as well as nowhere to go for help.\r\nThere has been a significant increase in number of home based sellers starting on eBay and amazon over the recession period and to support them I believe eBay and amazon must be accountable for destroying anyone\u2019s livelihood for unjustifiable reasons.\r\n",
