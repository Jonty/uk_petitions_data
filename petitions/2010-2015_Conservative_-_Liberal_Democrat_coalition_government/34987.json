        "additional_details": "The number of incidents involving foxes has increased in Worcester Park, Surrey, aptly named 'The Fox Capital of the UK' for its large fox population. Local residents are now fed up with the damage caused to their properties on a daily basis by the unwanted pests and intruders in their home.   Large packs of foxes roam the streets looking for food at night, and now during the day, leaving excrement and distruction in their path as they visit homes up rooting plants and pots, chewing hose pipes, leaving dirty nappies from bins in gardens etc... We are asking the Government to take action by putting a programme together to reduce the number of foxes in urban areas especially in Worcester Park, Surrey and put an end NOW to the growing misery that has plagued its residents for so long.\r\n",
