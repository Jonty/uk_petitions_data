        "additional_details": "Why should we put the clocks back in October?  This does not help anyone in the 21st Century.  It gets dark at about 4.30pm, yet it is light by 8am.  It is light enough for the children to go to school, and light for them after school to go out and play, they have the best of both worlds; would cause less accident by cars, so please sign this petition to have an extra hour in the evening.  It\u2019s time for a change NOW!!!  When the clocks go forward in March for British Summertime, let\u2019s leave it like this throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe politician-speak is a bit confusing, but it translates roughly as follows: the government are saying they will back the Daylight Saving Bill as long as it\u2019s tweaked to give the governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the final say.   Why should we give them the final say?  They have always said they want to be independent, and have their own government.  This is to do with what the people in the UK want, so it\u2019s them that must have the final say.",
