This is in the hope that most major car parks would recognise these and can then ticket cars parked in these spaces without a permit, like te current situation with disabled parking bays. This is in order to enable parents to get their children in and out of cars and buggys out of cars with ease and prevent people without children taking up these spaces which are limited as it is.",
