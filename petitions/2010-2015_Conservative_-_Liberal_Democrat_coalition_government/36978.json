        "additional_details": "Current measures to curb speeding include speed cameras and occasional patrols. These are NOT targeting areas where road safety is most needed. Many of the measures are aimed at catching drivers out; in areas that often have few or no records of being a road safety issue. This is at the expense of people' lives in areas where road safety is important - outside of schools, in our towns, our housing estates, known black spots, etc.\r\nThere is a distinct lack of clear and unambiguous signage in many areas that are being currently monitored. If it is important to keep within a speed limit, adequate signage MUST be provided. Relying on archaic rules, which include checking if street lighting is within 200 yards apart, is helping to catch the unsuspecting driver and raise revenues, but doing very little for road safety.  Let\u2019s make it obvious what the limit is all of the time; remove the element of doubt.\r\nSign this petition if you care about road safety rather than catching motorists.\r\n",
