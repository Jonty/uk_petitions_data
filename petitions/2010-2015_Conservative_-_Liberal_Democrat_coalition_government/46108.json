        "additional_details": "90% of application for removal of a child from UK jurisdiction, are granted. Some parents primary motive for requesting permission to remove a child abroad, is based on frivolous and often unsubstantiated lifestyle claims. With applications being granted so freely, and with such little investigation, it is impossible to know how many parents have lost their children, on the whim of a mother (or father), whose motives for emigrating, are not in the best interest of the children. I want the government to debate the current legislation surrounding leave to remove. I also want them to review the role of Cafcass (the body employed by the government to interview the children caught up in these tragic cases), because they are not trained child psychologists, and may miss essential clues that a child may not feel able to speak their true wishes and feelings.
