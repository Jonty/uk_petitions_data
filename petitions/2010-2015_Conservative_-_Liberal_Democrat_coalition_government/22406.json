        "additional_details": "I think that, as a Athiest, having a broad mind is essential in life, as you're ready for new ideas. but at school I can see that even in science, we do not do enough about the evolution theory and your just left to look it up in a book if you wish to find out more. i think that this knowledge is compulsory to understand many other things in your life. As a Athiest, I'm not against any religon at all, but sometimes you see that many religous groups, families and people are very closed minded. I know that you can't change that because that is their choice in life to stick to their religon but maybe we can help the willing to open their minds. I don't want to abolish Religous Education from the cirriculum, i still want to keep it in , but i would like to just make it a non complusory lesson for GCSE, A levels etc...",
