They have their homes in their constituency which they can not claim for on expenses and if they are sitting in the Houses of Parliament then they can stay in a hotel with a maximum expense limit.\r\nThe expense limit would be there to protect HM Treasury and the public from abuse.\r\nThis would make the government run more like a normal business. It will also stop the ongoing abuse of the expense system.",
