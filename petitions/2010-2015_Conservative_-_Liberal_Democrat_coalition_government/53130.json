        "additional_details": "We petition the Prime Minister and his government to declare the military overthrow of Egypt's first democratically elected President as a coup and denounce it and not recognise the current Egyptian government.\r\n\r\nEgypt's military forcibly removed President Morsi from his position and established themselves as the main power in Egypt. This is the precise definition of a Military coup.\r\n\r\nMilitary coups are illegal and to accept or ignore one will create a legal precedent for the future.\r\n\r\nWe ask for the return of democracy in Egypt by reinstating the legitimate President, Dr. Mohamed Morsi.",
