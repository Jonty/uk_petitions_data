        "additional_details": "Citizens of the UK are charged so called \"adult\" fares on public transport all over the country from the age of 16 and upwards.\r\n\r\nThis seems wholly unjustified; 16 and 17 year olds are denied the right to vote, purchase alcohol and tobacco and even have a lower minimum wage rate than over 18s, and are still forced to pay adult fare on public transport.\r\n\r\nMany 16 and 17 year olds depend on public transport heavily, and unlike other age groups, nearly all of them are on low income jobs or unemployed and simply cannot afford the exorbitant price of full fares.\r\n\r\nThere is something fundamentally wrong with this. Adult should mean 18. Sign this petition if you believe that nobody under the age of 18 should have to pay the same as an adult for public transport in the UK.",
