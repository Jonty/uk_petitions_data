        "additional_details": "New legislation brought in by the government has dictated that motorists who fail to display their car registration plates correctly can now be punished more severely than ever. If you own a private registration plate, some of which have been sold in excess of \u00a3300,000, it is now possible that you will lose your plate on the FIRST OFFENCE.\r\n\r\nThis could be for misrepresentation (moving letters/numbers slightly), incorrectly sized plates (some plates need to be trimmed in order to fit the cars they adourn), or simply for not having an official BS AU 145d stamp or postcode on the plate.\r\n\r\nThe plates need to be legible in order for ANPR cameras to function properly, and to allow police units to qucikly identify the cars, however I should imagine that there are just as many legal plates being misread for many reasons, as there are plates that have been slightly modified.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for the law to be relaxed, and not to jeopardise our investments over a very minor matter.",
