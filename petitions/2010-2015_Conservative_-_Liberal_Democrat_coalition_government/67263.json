        "additional_details": "This is a petition to ensure that the 2 inquiries launched by Theresa May (Home Secretary) relating to child abuse and an alleged cover up are not allowed to be influenced by any party political agenda and/or have the publication of their findings delayed to suit the political parties who may be involved in the scandal. As a result, if the findings are ready before the 2015 General Election they MUST be published for the victims and British people to review.  Theresa May announced that 'no findings would be published before the General Election in 2015'.  This is unacceptable and is open to criticisms of protecting political parties from the findings of the inquiries so that the findings do not affect the performance of those parties in the General Election. Pressure must be put on the Home Secretary and the Government to dutifully publish findings as soon as they are ready.",
