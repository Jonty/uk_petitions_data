        "additional_details": "The zero hour contract is a good thing for those who wish to work more flexible hours but at present it is being abused by business owners who do not know their own market or lack the skills to forecast and deal with market trends. It has succeeded in devaluing the subcontract market and rewards mediocre companies who's only achievement was to pay an accountant to open a Ltd. company. I ask that the government considers a new minimum wage bracket for the zero hour contract starting at \u00a315.00 per hour to create a fair market and no longer reward those who think business should be risk free.
