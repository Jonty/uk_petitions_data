Ban them from holding passports and deprive them of the pleasures of holidays abroad for 10 years.\r\n If under-age consider taking away their parents passports as a punishment that they can blame their offspring for. Financial penalties do not hurt many, but freedom of movement will. If we commit driving offences we lose our licence so do the same with passports.",
