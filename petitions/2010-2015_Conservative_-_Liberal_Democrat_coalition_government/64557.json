        "additional_details": "There is a huge increase of animal abuse cases in the UK with animals being tortured, abandoned and killed every day.\r\n\r\nI believe that we need to have stricter laws in place for people being able to own an animal.  I urge the Government to legislate so that:\r\n\r\n- Animal Owners are held in a database with animals being regularly checked for their welfare by Government officials.  Like we currently have with social services for children.\r\n\r\n- People have to go through a process before owning a pet to ensure they are suitable for looking after the animal.\r\n\r\n- Harsher punishments for those guilty of abuse.  A lifetime ban and a fine is not enough.  Animal abuse should be treated the same as abuse towards humans.  Jail time - minimum 5 years.\r\n\r\nFar too many dogs, cats, rabbits, birds etc are being let down by our system because we as humans can't be bothered to take proper care of them.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and support a society that treats animals with respect.",
