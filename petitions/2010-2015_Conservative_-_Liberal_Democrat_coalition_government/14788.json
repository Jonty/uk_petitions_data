        "additional_details": "Steve Jobs - the Chairman (Former CEO) and founder of Apple has yet to be recognised by our Government and Monarch for his outstanding contributions to modern day technology. Apple continues to innovate and expand with such products like the Mac, iPhone and iPod. With Steve at the head of the company's leadership for many years, I think it is time to show that his hard work can finally pay off with a recognition of achievement via our Monarch and State.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs was denied the chance to be given a Knighthood by a former Labour government - I, as well as a huge majority, think that the time has come to grant him the recognition he truly deserves!",
