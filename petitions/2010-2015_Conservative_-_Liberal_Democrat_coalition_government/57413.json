        "additional_details": "The minimum wage no longer allows people to survive with out benefits or working your bodies to the brink.\r\n\r\nThe living wage rates for London are \u00a38.85 and \u00a37.65 outside of London. So how can the minimum wage be fair. \u00a39 per hour will help so many families and individual people, it will also lower the unemployment rate.\r\n\r\nCosts continue to go up every year and if we are not carefull the entire country could split, the rich and the poor. Even though this does currently exist it could be much worse and will only get worse.. So change it before its to late and allow every UK resident have a good wage that makes it worth working.",
