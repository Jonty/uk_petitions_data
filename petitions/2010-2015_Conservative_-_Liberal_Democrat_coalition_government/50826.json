Therefore all British citizens wishing to bring their partners to the UK must have a minimum income of \u00a318,600. This requirement is far too high for working class citizens and has left many British citizens questioning their human rights, broken families living thousands of miles apart unable to really do anything about it and for many like myself have had no choice but to leave the UK just so they can live with the ones they love. Where are our rights Britain ??!!",
