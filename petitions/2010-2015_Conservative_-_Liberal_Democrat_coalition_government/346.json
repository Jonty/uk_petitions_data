        "additional_details": "With 47% of the UK populace voting in a recent YouGov poll to leave the EU and only 33% voting to remain in the EU it's time for another referendum like the one in 1975 on whether the UK should remain in the EU. The 1975 referendum was before our sovereignty was continuously being eroded by the unelected EU Commission. Not a single person below the age of 55 has had a chance to vote on whether we should be part of the EU. The excuse that referendums are no longer used in this country is no longer applicable, the Government was willing to call one in May 2011 despite lack of public demand for the particular issue of voting reform. What differs with this proposed referendum is that people expressively seek the opportunity to vote us out of an institution which we no longer want to be a part of. The argument our nation would suffer from lack of trade is invalid, Norway and Switzerland are countries that trade with the EU and are part of the EEA, which doesn't affect their sovereignty. ",
