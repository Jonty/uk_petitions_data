        "additional_details": "\r\nOn 31 July 1972, the small village of Claudy was left devastated when three no warning car bombs exploded killing 9 innocent men, women, and children.  To date no one has ever been charged with causing this atrocity.\r\n\r\nThe sorrow of the families who lost loved ones is compounded by the fact that they do not know who murdered them. The Ombudsman\u2019s report did nothing to end the speculation that the State, Police and Catholic Church collaborated to cover up who caused this evil crime\r\n\r\nPrime Minister, we urge you to give this matter your most urgent attention, and authorise a public inquiry in to this most heinous crime. The families of those murdered in Claudy, know that an inquiry will not bring back their loved ones, but the pain of not knowing who was responsible is preventing the families having closure to their grieving.\r\n",
