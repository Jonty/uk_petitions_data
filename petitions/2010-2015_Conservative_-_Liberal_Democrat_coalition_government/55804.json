The word used in conjunction with this, is the pronoun \"he\".\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the law be changed to replace \"he\", with \"the perpetrator\", or some similar language and \"penetration with a penis\", to some agreed, gender-neutral term, perhaps \"forced-intercourse of any description\", would do.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic right of male victims of rape. Currently they're not legally recognised as victims of rape, but of \"forced penetration\", which is degrading and disgusting, and wholly ridiculous.\r\n\r\nWe must remember we need to protect both our men, and our women.",
