Ultimately, this would help to counteract the negative impact of prevalant tabloid attitudes and sensationalist reaction to topical issues, and the divisions and ramifications this creates in society.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should significantly invest in the UK-wide promotion of understanding between and about the differing faiths in the UK.",
