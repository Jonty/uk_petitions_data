        "additional_details": "Train fares in Britain have increased 36.9% over the past 6 years*. 79%* of rail users surveyed believe that train fares in the UK represent 'bad value'.\r\n\r\nManipulation of 'peak' rail times can see fares triple. Peak time on some lines now extends to 11.24am for the morning 'rush hour' and starts at 14.39pm for  'evening' journeys. A return from Telford to London in peak times is \u00a3158, compared to the 'standard' \u00a345.\r\n\r\nDespite the surge in ticket prices, surveys show that we do not believe the increase is reflected by better service. On some peak South East commuter lines, almost 20% of passengers are forced to stand with overcrowding set to worsen.\r\n\r\nAs fuel prices increase and more people come to feel the effects of prolonged, wider economic problems, we deserve a fair and affordable system of ticket pricing, concisely stating peak times and forcing rail companies to set ticket prices accordingly.\r\n\r\n*Office of Rail Regulation\r\n* YouGov survey",
