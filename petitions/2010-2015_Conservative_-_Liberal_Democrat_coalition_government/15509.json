        "additional_details": "It has recently been established in proposed amendments to the health care bill that organisations that are paid to conduct procedures are apparently not independent enough to advise on procedures.\r\n\r\nTherefore I propose that all patients of NHS dentists  have a legal right to receive counselling and advice independent of the dentist who performs the treatment.\r\n\r\nIndeed there is currently nothing to stop dentists proposing unnecessary treatment for patients as they receive money for each piece of dental work completed.\r\n\r\nThis makes sense and is consistent with other pieces of legislation that are currently being proposed.",
