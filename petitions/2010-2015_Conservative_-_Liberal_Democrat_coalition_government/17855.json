A working group should be tasked with looking where other countries have adopted demonstrably better ways of managing traffic (and the entire transport system) and find ways where we can simply (and shamelessly) follow their lead.  They can have 6 months.  Publish a report and get the best ideas fast tracked into effect.  Let's get this county moving.  One to start off with is allowing filter give way left turns at most traffic lights. A massive improvement so easily achievable.  Another is to position the vehicle sensors controlling traffic lights sufficiently far back from the junction that cars travelling at the speed limit should trigger a red to green change before having to slow down and stop.  Currently, we always end up stopping just as the lights then turn green.  Who thought that one up?  Crazy isn't it.  I can think of dozens more.",
