This is not only a step backwards, but also an idiotic move. How can the students of tomorrow expect to get by on an education system that is more than 30 years outdated? It's not new (old) exams returning that would 'fix' the education system. I'm no politician or education expert, but I know this would not end well for students across the country.",
