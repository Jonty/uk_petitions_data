        "additional_details": "Current English language tests that visa applicants sit in order to settle in the UK are too basic and insufficient. They are simple oral and written examinations and still permit those with a little knowledge of English to settle in the UK. This is unacceptable especially if the applicant is settling for the purpose of marriage where it is essential that the couple can communicate with each other effectively and in cases of forced marriage this is not always the case. A grade C in GCE O Level or IGCSEs English which are offered in most countries via the British council would only allow those applicants who are educated and who have the potential to contribute towards the economy to settle here in the UK\r\n",
