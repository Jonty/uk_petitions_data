        "additional_details": "Richard Dawkins is an acclaimed author, speaker, educater, scientist and TV presenter. He is one of the most famous people on the planet and has influenced millions of people's thinking about science evolution and religion. He is greatly admired by other celebrities, such as Sir David Attenborough and ranks alongside other great scientists such as Charles Darwin and Steven Hawkins. It is obvious that Richard Dawkins should be Knighted for his contribution to knowledge about the world and our place in it. I therefore urge the government to recommend this to Her Majesty the Queen as soon as it is convenient.",
