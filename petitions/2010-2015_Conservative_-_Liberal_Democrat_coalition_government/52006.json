        "additional_details": "We call on a national health Truth and Reconciliation Commission  to be established to hear evidence in public about the NHS, as well as twin regulation in England.\r\nThere is a compelling desire to understand recent & past events so that we develop learning & take action to help us work together to build a stronger, healthier NHS.A great deal of hurt & suffering has been felt by many.  This hurt & suffering should not go unheard. If we are not open we risk diminishing the work & future of our NHS.  We need to hear the truth, so that we can ensure justice for those who have been hurt & harmed.  However we also need the opportunity to see restorative practice and reconciliation is put into action in the NHS. We know that in criminal justice, restorative processes give victims the chance to tell offenders the real impact of their crime, to get answers to their questions, and an apology [Restorative Justice Council]. We now need to see this approach being used in the NHS.\r\n\r\n",
