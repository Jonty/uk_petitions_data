        "additional_details": "UKIP in Dudley Borough call on Dudley MBC to prevent the towns of Dudley, Stourbridge, Halesowen & Brierley Hill from declining further,by being  inventive with car parking charges ie:- (cutting a deal with Businesses to refund 50% of a shoppers parking fee against a purchase on production of a ticket stub.) Increased footfall will inevitably lead to subsequent further investment from new businesses in thriving not dying towns. We implore the Secretary of State for Communities & Local Government to intervene when the petition reaches its target.",
