        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to put a stop to animal circuses in northern ireland. Elephants, lions, zebras and other exotic animals are taken from their natural habitats and subjected to a life of suffering and misery. It has been well documented that animals are forced to perform using bull hooks and other cruel methods. Their lives are spent in lorries on the road and the only time they see outside world is to perform in the bigtop. As well as animal welfare issues circuses in ireland have had high profile public safety issues, for example in Cork 2012, an elephant was drugged and escaped into a nearby shopping area. Animal circuses belong in the history books, it is a cruel outdated form of 'entertainment.'",
