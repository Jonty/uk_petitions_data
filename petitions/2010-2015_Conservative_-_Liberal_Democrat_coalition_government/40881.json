        "additional_details": "Employee Sickness Policies should be reviewed regarding people diagnosed with cancer. It is bad enough dealing with cancer and the unpleasant treatment you have to undergo without having to worry about paying your bills when you get put on half pay and then no pay. If you have savings you have to live off them when your pay is cut or stopped because all the benefits available are mesne tested, other than the ESA which is a really small amount that would not cover your bills and the DLA. The DLA is only really available to people who are nearly immobile and need a carer. The Equality Act was changed in 2010 regarding the Disability Discrimination Act which covers cancer sufferers, but sick leave is not covered by the Act. I feel this Act needs reviewing.",
