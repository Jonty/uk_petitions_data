Network Rail must agree to begin a proper process of public consultation, considering all scientific evidence, being transparent about and releasing all the results.\r\n\r\nNetwork Rail's tree clearance programme must be brought under proper control, regulation and review before excessive and irreversible damage is done to the natural environment. Communities must no longer be subject to the uncontrolled environmental vandalism which Network Rail has been getting away with for the last nine years.\r\n",
