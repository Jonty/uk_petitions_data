Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991. Yet the United Kingdom will not recognise its former colony's right to independence (note: Somaliland was a British colony, the rest of Somalia was not). Somalilanders do not deserve to have their democratic project threatened due to lack of recognition by foreign governments.\r\n\r\n\r\n-We demand that the British Government recognise Somaliland as an independent state.",
