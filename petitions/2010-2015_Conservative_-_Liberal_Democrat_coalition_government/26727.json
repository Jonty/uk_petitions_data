The proof has now been published that one person in four in the UK is obese, and there are 3 million type 2 diabetic people. The two sets of figures are connected.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to now act with the powers they have to force manufacturers by law, to stop adding Salt Sugar and fat to food.",
