        "additional_details": "Ever wondered why England does not have it's own cultural language like Wales? Well it does, it's called Anglo-Saxon. If you would like to see Anglo-Saxon reintroduced back into our culture in the same way that the welsh language has been reintroduced into Wales then add you're signature to this petition. Anglo-Saxon is a beautifull language and it is a shame to see such a cultural asset to England, locked away in dusty libraries. It would be great to have place names and programmes on TV in Anglo-Saxon. By adding you're signature to this petition, you will be helping to reinstate Anglo-Saxon as a cultural asset to England.",
