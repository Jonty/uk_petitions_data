It takes 100,000 signatures to get something into the house of commons, but if there aren't even 100,000 people using the site, does that mean that nothing will actually make it into a governments debate from here?\r\n\r\nI think there should be a simpler way to use the site, firstly, if an e-petition gets so many signatures then have a way so it can be easily recognised. A bit like this...\r\n\r\n0-100 signatures - No interest/Little interest category.\r\n101-500 signatures - Some interest\r\n501-3000 signatures -  getting interesting\r\n3001 - 10,000 signatures - highly interesting\r\n10,001- 30,000 signatures- Potentially debatable in the House of commons\r\n30,001-70,000 signatures - Hot Topic\r\n70,001+ signatures - Off to the house of commons.\r\n\r\nA layout similar to this would give someone's e-petition an actual chance.",
