        "additional_details": "Twenty years ago Parliament voted to allow all shops to open for a limited time of Sundays.\r\n\r\nNow, it is time Sunday trading laws were reformed again.\r\n\r\nAll shops, of whatever size, should be free to open whenever they want.\r\n\r\nThe state has no right to tell people when they can go shopping. If people want to go to church, they can go to church. If they want to go shopping, they can go shopping.\r\n\r\nFull deregulation will boost trade and competition in the retail sector. This will be good for consumers. The anomaly that allows a supermarket internet delivery on a Sunday evening but won\u2019t let the public set foot in a supermarket will end.\r\n\r\nScotland has always allowed Sunday shopping, so why not in England and Wales?\r\n",
