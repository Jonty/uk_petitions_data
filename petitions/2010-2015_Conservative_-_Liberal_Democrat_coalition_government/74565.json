We believe that an Ageing Population brings huge opportunities and challenges for change in how older people are seen as active members of every community across the UK.\r\nWe believe that this requires a Ministerial Focus to ensure that all parts of the government together with the private sector hear the voices of older people\r\nThe Champions Network has been lobbying the Prime Minister and would welcome your support.\r\nPlease add your signature to this petition and help create a focus that could change the lives of today's older people and tomorrow's older people.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that you don't have to be old to sign this petition.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the Network Members\r\n\r\nCouncillor Margaret Sidebottom Network Chair\r\n\r\nOlder People's Champion Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council",
