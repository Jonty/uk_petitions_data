        "additional_details": "The closure of Waterfall Kennels (the local dog pound, Guisborough) will take effect on 1st April this year. Agents acting on behalf of The Guisborough Estate have served a three month notice on Redcar and Middlesbrough Councils stating that the stray dog contract will not be renewed as the kennels and land are required for re-development.\r\n\r\nThe implications of the closure of the dog pound are many and varied. To give just a few examples:- (1) if your dog strays and there is no local pound, you may have to travel miles to re-claim your dog, (2) Waterfall Kennels have operated a non-destruction policy as far as possible; this means they keep dogs for longer than 7 days when their Council funding expires. Will a new contract agree with this policy? If not, dogs will be put to sleep after 7 days.",
