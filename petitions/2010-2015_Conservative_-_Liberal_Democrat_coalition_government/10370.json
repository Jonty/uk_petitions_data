This would be on a salary equivilent to their benefits.\r\n\r\nRefusal of National Service would prevent those individuals from claiming benefits.\r\n\r\nThis would not only introduce discipline into their lives, but will also teach them new skills, which could lead to a career either within the Armed Forces or in civilian life.\r\n\r\nThis would also enable the UK to bolster it's armed forces at a reasonably low cost.\r\n",
