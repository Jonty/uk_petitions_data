A pensioner suffers a similar life ending experience in her garden from an individual who may have got his motivation from the same people.\r\n I ask you, how do you reason with people who think it is acceptable to decapitate  innocent people and post the video to be watched by millions around the world?\r\nCondemning actions in parliament won't bring people back, it won't prevent more incident people being murdered abroad or here at home in the uk.\r\n\r\nEnd the public horror being brought to the families and individuals. Protect our interests at home and abroad. Air strikes are not specific enough.The threat needs to be removed. Action needs to be swift, direct, purposeful and soon to avoid more barbaric acts.\r\nSend in special forces to remove the threat. ",
