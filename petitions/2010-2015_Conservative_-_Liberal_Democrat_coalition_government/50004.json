(THIS INCLUDES THE PENSION STAMP ) BECAUSE THEY OWN A PROPERTY THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO HOUSING BENEFIT!!\r\n\r\nHARD WORKING FAMILIES WHO DO NOT CLAIM HOUSING BENEFIT WILL LOSE THE ABOVE AND ANY HOPE OF SAVING FOR A DEPOSIT AS THE NEW THRESHOLD IS 16,000 - THIS INCLUDES ANY VALUE IN THE PROPERTY. ANYTHING ABOVE THIS AND YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY HELP\r\n\r\nTHIS WILL FORCE THE FAMILY TO SELL THEIR HOME AND GIVE NOTICE TO TENANTS.  THEY WILL THEN BE FORCED TO CLAIM HOUSING BENEFIT!!  I WOULD LIKE THE GOVERNMENT TO DEBATE THE IMPACT AND COST AND RECONSIDER  THE HIDDEN IMPLICATIONS FOR THOUSANDS OF HOMEOWNERS.",
