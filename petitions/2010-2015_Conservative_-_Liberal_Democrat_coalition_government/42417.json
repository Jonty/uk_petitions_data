        "additional_details": "The recent pre-pack administration of Harley Medical Centres and establishing of a new holding company Aesthetic and Cosmetic Surgery Ltd allowing Harley Medical Group to continue trading under the same name, from the same address and website sends out the wrong message to companies that when things go wrong, you can go bust and re-establish with no liabilities. The government should insist that the CQC remove the license from the group / holding company as they are clearly not fit to trade in an industry that is responsible for patient care both pre and post-op.",
