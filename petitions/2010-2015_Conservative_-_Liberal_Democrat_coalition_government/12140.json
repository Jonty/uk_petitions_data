        "additional_details": "I would like to propose that the government take action to abolish the practice known as factory farming. The conditions and quality of life that farm animals endure are horrendously cruel- leaving many deformed and in constant pain. Additionally the health of humans is being threatened by virulent new forms of food poisoning due to  feeding animals antibiotics and other drugs (not for health always but to increase size).\r\nAnimals should NOT be farmed in this manner and steps should be taken to phase these practices out.",
