These assessments are NOT medically based as has been indicated in the media.\r\n\r\nOne example as to how bad ATOS are is the way they test the grip.  If a claimant can hold a piece of paper in both hands then a claimant's grip is fine.  What ATOS don't take into account is that if, for example, a claimant has severe arthritis in their hands, they would struggle to hold things like a cup, a jar or tin.\r\n\r\nIf people have difficulty walking, standing or sitting for any length of time, this should also be taken into account.",
