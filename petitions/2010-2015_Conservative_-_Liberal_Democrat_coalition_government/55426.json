The Government need to regulate the Travel Industry to stop the discrimination of parents and those who work in education, so to allow people to go on holiday in school holidays without financial penalty.  Parents do not want to take their children out of school, but are being forced to do so, so as not to deprive them of the cultural experiences and quality family time that a holiday together can provide.",
