We are living in the 21st century now:\r\n\r\nControversial plans to breed beagles in East Yorkshire for use in animal experiments have been resubmitted two years after they were thrown out by the government.\r\n\r\nA US-backed firm wants to breed up to 2,000 dogs a year in the village of Grimston, near Hull, and sell them for use in tests in UK laboratories.\r\n\r\nIf permission for the new building is granted it would become the second beagle breeding site in Britain, competing with Harlan in Cambridgeshire to supply the more than 3,000 dogs used in UK laboratories each year.\r\n\r\nThe Grimston site is owned by B&K Universal, part of US firm Marshall BioResources, and is currently used for breeding genetically modified mice and housing imported beagles before they go to British laboratories.\r\n",
