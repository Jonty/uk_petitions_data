        "additional_details": "In uk there seems to be an issue with wheelchair access on buses, as although wheelchair users have priority use of the wheelchair space currently if a wheelchair space is occupied with a buggy/pushchair the driver has no power to compel passengers to move and at the moment, it is reliant upon the goodwill of the passengers concern\u2019s, I my self have issues with this on a daily basis and see many other wheelchair users in the same boat and like my self missing several buses in a row each day as of this and would like to see change, I feel bus drivers should be given the power to have a buggy/push chair folded up, and there for making travelling fare for everyone disabled included! as then everyone can travel equally.",
