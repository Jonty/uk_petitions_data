        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the Government to at least give consideration to reforming the current system of employment for Teachers in England and Wales. In France, there are competitive exams where each year there are a set number of posts in each \"\u00e0cad\u00e9mie\" and those who pass are allocated schools based on the number of points they have acquired. In Germany, you can only apply to schools in the region you trained in which means that in places like Berlin, only those who trained in the Berlin region can apply to work in those schools. At the moment, despite London schools being significantly different, most trained teachers apply to London schools, leading to the possibility of 80 to 100 people applying for 1 post.\r\n\r\n",
