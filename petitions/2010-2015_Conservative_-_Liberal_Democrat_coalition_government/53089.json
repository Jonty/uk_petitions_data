        "additional_details": "\u00a32.65 PH is the national minimum for an apprentice of any age and to be raised in October 2013 by 3p (a pathetic ammount). Like many other people I am past the age of 18 and doing an apprenticeship to gain more skills in the work place to lead on to better things. Many employers do not understand the apprenticeship scheme and do not think of their apprentices as employees and some dont even pay the minimum. The minimum needs to change as it is not enough and is the downfall to why apprenticeships do not have a 100% success rate. For a person even 16-18 but especially 18+ with work experience it is very hard to stretch a months worth of work for a weeks worth of pay.",
