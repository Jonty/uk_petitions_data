        "additional_details": "Firstly may I say that I am not anti charity but I do believe that an unfair advantage is given to charities by the Treasury by way of business rates relief.\r\nI propose that The Treasury Remove or reduce the amount of rates relief given to charities for high street shops. At the moment there is an imbalance between small businesses paying high business rates and charities often paying none at all (this was created in the 1950's with a 10% discount when the high street was a very different place) and occupying premises that are given to them often on a peppercorn rent to avoid the landlord having to pay rates on the property. The change in the law requiring business rates to be paid on all premises even empty ones was intended to stop empty shops on the high street but has resulted in a massive increase of charity shops at the expense of traditional businesses.\r\nYou should vote for this if you really believe in saving the High Streets throughout the UK.",
