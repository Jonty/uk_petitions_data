        "additional_details": "I'm going to get straight to the point and not bust out some googled Marijuana facts.\r\n\r\nI personally think Marijuana  should be legal. 3 reasons and how we could introduce it:\r\n\r\n1. Shops around the UK could sell it, big supermarket chains such as Tescos are showing massive losses at the moment, I think with Marijuana being legal it could potentially boost profits\r\n\r\n2. Just a more positive and calm vibe around the UK, just think; less crimes and violence in my personal opinion, less stress also.\r\n\r\n3. We could introduce this by selling \"Marijuana Cards\" You need legitimate proof that you're 18+ to purchase them [just like oyster cards] and you have a max limit on how much Marijuana you can buy per day. [Deposit a certain amount of money on the card per day etc etc]\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n\r\nLegalize it! Don't Penalize it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
