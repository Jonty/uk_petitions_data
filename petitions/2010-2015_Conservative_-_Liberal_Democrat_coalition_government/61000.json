        "additional_details": "\"Gleeks\" of the UK will have most probably heard the news that a man in Northern Ireland claims to have created the name \"Glee Club\" as a chain of comedy clubs throughout the UK. He has recently (after 5 and a half seasons/years of the show) won a court case against the show. This means that he could have Glee banned on UK television, as well as have its merchandise and DVD's banned from UK stores. As someone that has felt Glee has entirely reshaped my life, I can't see Glee being banned from my country. It is a disgrace. Taking 5 and a half years to decide to take action is too long. Glee has changed not just mine, but many people\u2019s lives; gay, straight, fat, thin, black, white, it accepts everybody and everybody that loves Glee feels a connection with the show. This isn't a simple case of cancelling a popular TV show; it is a case of changing lives and continuing to help teenagers and other fans of the show in times of need.",
