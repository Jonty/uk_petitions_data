        "additional_details": "Current legislation states that '...will give lone parents who are responsible for...a child of 12 or under, the right to restrict their availability for work to the childs school hours' (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/837/pdfs/uksiem_20100837_en.pdf)\r\n\r\nHowever, Job Centre staff tell you that you must be available for work 40 hours per week + 1 hour travel each way.  They are bullying and threatening, telling you that if you decline a job for these hours your benefits can be withdrawn.  At no time do they tell you what you are entitled to by law.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that children spend time with their parent for emotional support and help with homework etc, as well as allowing parents time to cook healthy food for their children.  If the Job Centre have their way, children will be in childcare from 8 am - 7 pm!\r\n\r\nStop this illegal bullying now!",
