        "additional_details": "I would like to see it made illegal for fish to be given away as prizes. Fish used as prizes are hung up for hours in tiny plastic bags with inadequate water and oxygen. They are in loud, bright surroundings and moved around roughly when the stalls are set up and put away.\r\n\r\nMost fish kept in this way are often barley alive and others die in the bags. The people who win them didn't plan to take a fish home, so what happens to the fish after they are won is also a worry. Seeing fish treated in this way is also upsetting and spoils the fun of many visitors to the attraction.\r\n\r\nFish should not be treated inhumanly and given away casually.\r\n",
