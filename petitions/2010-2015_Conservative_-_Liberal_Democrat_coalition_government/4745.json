        "additional_details": "Multiculturalism is a failed creed which has created friction between immigrants and natives by encouraging the setting up of ethnic enclaves; in racist South Africa this was called Apartheid. In the UK and the rest of Europe, multiculturalism has been touted by the political class as an answer to racism, yet it encourages immigrants to reject our culture and even to refuse to learn English and by so doing encourages racism. The openly racist, such as the BNP and other far-right parties across Europe, are the only ones who dare mention it, and they are thus gaining support from people who would not ordinarily support them, as the major parties are still caught in the multicultural con and few will risk being labeled racists by the 'multicultural lobby'. Immigrants should be encouraged to become British, that is surely why they came here after all. ",
