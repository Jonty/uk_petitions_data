        "additional_details": "Due to the uproar in the local BBC news, Katie Sutton has drafted a petition to ban the well known and reputable Halloween event held each year at Thorpe Park (formally known as The Asylum). Not only will this be depriving the majority of adult members who annually pay out of choice to go to this event but it also deprives the purpose of celebrating the traditionalised festivities of Halloween within the western world. Katie has taken something so insignificant out of context. This has opened up to a huge controversial debate within the social media construct I.e twitter and Facebook. If it is found that more signatures are collected in opposition to Katie's petition it would be ideal that the government can ensure this annual event is not prohibited in further years to come.",
