        "additional_details": "We see no reason why cannabis remains an illegal substance. The 'War on drugs' approach has clearly failed to keep cannabis off the streets (cannabis is easy to cultivate and in constant demand). There has never been a single recorded death directly attributed to cannabis use (unlike alcohol, tobacco and many prescription drugs which are all legal). Cannabis is impossible to overdose on (very low toxicity level). Controlling the substance with licenses would protect children more effectively (no sale to under 18s). Cannabis is not an addictive substance. The reason why cannabis has become 'stronger' is because it is illegal and it is more profitable for criminals to cultivate high THC strains. In a regulated market, this would not be the case as the variety of strains available would increase substantially. Taxing cannabis would bring in huge revenue for HMRC. It is grossly unfair to give cannabis users a criminal record/jail sentence as it is essentially a victimless crime.",
