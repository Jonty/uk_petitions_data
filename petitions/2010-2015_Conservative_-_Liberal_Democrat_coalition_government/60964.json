However no checks are made to ensure that Landlords are viable home owners who have the resources to ensure Tenant security for the length of the agreement.\r\nI therefore propose this e-petition for the government to introduce new legislation that requires Landlords to be subject to numerous vetting procedures prior to any tenancy being agreed.\r\nIts is the proposition that al Private Landlords be required to:\r\n\r\nEvidence that Mortgage payments are up to date and Landlord in not subject to arrears.\r\nCredit Checks to be performed and evidenced to the Tenant to prove that the Landlord is not declared bankrupt, or is financially unable to support the property.\r\nLaw that all Rental properties deposits be paid directly via Third Party, and never directly to a Landlord in any instance.\r\n\r\nProtect the Tenant",
