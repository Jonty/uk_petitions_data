        "additional_details": "In Britain we have one of the worst rape convictions which shown in study which was done amongst 33 countries. This is due to police not treating the cases as highest priority as they tend to sometimes not believe the woman which is no wonder that 95 per cent of rapes are not reported as they fear that nothing will be done to put away the rapist.\r\n\r\nThe CPS and police are throwing out rape cases on basis on either how much they had to drink or if they had a history of mental illness which shouldn\u2019t be a reason of throwing the case as they are letting a rapist get away with the crime they\u2019ve done.\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m calling the government to improve the number of rape convictions and give rape victims the justice they deserve by the police and CPS having a complete overhaul when it comes to dealing with rape cases as this situation is similar to the Stephen Lawrence enquiry when embedded racism was found amongst the police force.\r\n",
