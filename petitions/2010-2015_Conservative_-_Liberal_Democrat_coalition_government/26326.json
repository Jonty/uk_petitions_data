There's a name for these wars, they're called 'vietnams', meaning they NEVER END! they are produced from poor, distorted and flawed foreign policy, they are created from over-reaction, lies and corruption, this war in Afghanistan has no clear objective and we have no reason to be there either.  The national security of the United Kingdom is not in anyway enhanced by our presence out there, all we are doing is inciting more hatred into the region, we must quickly realize that terrorism against us is a predictable consequence of meddling in the affairs of other nations.  Pulling out in the next 3-4 years is totally irrelevant and not good enough, we need to bring our troops home immediately! We need a new foreign policy of peace, being friendly with all nations and minding our own business! The sad truth is we are only promoting more terrorist attacks against the United Kingdom! ",
