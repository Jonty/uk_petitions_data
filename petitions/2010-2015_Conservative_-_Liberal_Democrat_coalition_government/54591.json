        "additional_details": "Every year from September to March in a small fishing village in Japan called Taiji over 20,000 dolphins and small whales are brutally slaughtered or taken away from the families for a life of captivity. The dolphins are hunted and driven into the Killing Cove, using banger boats to steer them, once they have been trapped and nets have been lowered into the cove, the exhausted and scared dolphins continue to keep fighting, some dolphins drown in the nets while searching for a way to escape. Firstly the babies are separated from their mothers, then dolphin trainers examine and choose the prettiest, unblemished dolphins to sell into a life of captivity. The dolphins that are not chosen are then brutally slaughtered by the hands of the fishermen and taken to the butcherhouse were the toxic meat is stored in freezers to hide there crime. Dolphin meat is highly toxic and not suitable human consumption.\r\n\r\nITS AN INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO STOP THIS NOW\r\n\r\n",
