        "additional_details": "Using racial terms can severely distress/persecute/depress the victim in the receiving end of such verbal & psychological abuse/insult. What is regarded as racism depends on the context, intention, frequency & manner it was said. Racist terms used can range from banter, carelessness, a form of swearing to ACTUALLY ridiculing/insulting person's racial origins, degrading prejudice, as well as bullying, hatred, disgust, etc. Even if racial remarks are said as a form of swearing & thus \u2018letting off steam\u2019, it should be discouraged. Many racial prejudices are disguised as \u2018jest\u2019. Attribution of fault on another person can range from looking sympathetically at the other person\u2019s unique situation/social circumstances (e.g. living environment) to the other person's personal (racial) attributes. Perhaps a racist will refer to a person's colour of skin constantly, whilst a non-racist may refer to a person\u2019s race only when angry, upset, in jest, etc.",
