Therefore I believe the following should be applied.\r\n\r\n1) any maintenance payments taken from an absent parent should be considered before tax and NI.\r\n\r\n2) any case where the parents where NEVER married should be subject to a DNA test to determine parentage unless the absent parent consents 1st.\r\n\r\n3) all cases by default should assume that the NRP or paying parent has 1/7 shared cared.\r\n\r\n4) in cases with arrears the agency should be apply the same methods and amounts of collection used by a court instead of the draconian  40% of the take home pay.\r\n\r\n5) maintenance should affect state benefits claimed.\r\n\r\n6) where property issues are unresolved, 50% of maintenance assessed should be paid.\r\n\r\nThese simple steps will provide a fairer system and not promote greed by parents with care.\r\n",
