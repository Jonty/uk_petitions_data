        "additional_details": "Once a cancer patient has successfully finished treatment they are given scans to check the cancer hasn't returned. However, these scans are only carried out in the primary area of cancer. There are no scans carried out on the rest of the body to check for secondary cancer, even though secondary cancer can be common, unless symptoms are being presented.\r\n\r\nWe are asking for full body scans to be given as part of the routine checks for cancer patients after finishing treatment.\r\n\r\nWe want a more proactive approach to finding secondary cancer before it's too late.",
