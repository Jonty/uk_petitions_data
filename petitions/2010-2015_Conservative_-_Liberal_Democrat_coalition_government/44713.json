We joined in 1973.\r\n\r\n40 years on\r\n-\t2007 Briton was the 7th highest aider to the EU\r\n-\t2008 it was roughly costing \u00a31k for every UK man, woman and child to be in the EU\r\n-\tSummer 2012 estimated that Briton had since 1979 paid the EU roughly \u00a3228b and received back in benefits roughly \u00a3143\u2009billion. The difference  of roughly \u00a385\u2009billion\r\n-\tPayments will increase roughly by 2.79% meaning that the UKs contribution to the EU will rise by around \u00a3350m in 2013\r\n\r\n\u00a3350m would be welcomed to improve the British educational system, the health care system, the emergency services, crime, the recession and so on.\r\n\r\nIt's time WE take control of those private schooled, controlling, wealthy, grotesque men and women that 'lead' this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
