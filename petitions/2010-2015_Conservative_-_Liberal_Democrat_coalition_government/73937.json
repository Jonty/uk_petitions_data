Cars and cameras may be accurate but what if you look at your Speedo from the wrong angle -paralax exists for such a small difference in speed.\r\nHaving to watch your Speedo so accurately will mean less time watching the road!\r\n\r\nIf road safety is the priority over traffic flow, how can you justify putting lives at risk to help ensure the motorway flows better. Doing this will reduce flow due to accidents.\r\n\r\nStop this money making move and ensure safety on our roads!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/motorists-face-strict-70mph-speed-8464386",
