        "additional_details": "The Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977 made Pagan weddings and handfastings legal in Scotland, allowing Norse, Druids and other Pagans to obtain legally recognised marriage ceremonies in accordance with their faith, but at present Pagans in England and Wales do not have that right.\r\n\r\nOther faiths have their marriages recognised by law and there is no good reason - no reason not influenced by bigotry, superstition or a misunderstanding of what Pagan faiths are, why this same right should not be extended to include Pagan faiths.\r\n\r\nWe request that the government recognise how important it is for people to be able to be joined in matrimony in accordance with their religious beliefs, and give Pagan handfastings and weddng ceremonies legal recognition in England and Wales.",
