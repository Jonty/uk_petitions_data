        "additional_details": "National Service should be made compulsory for all 18 year olds. 6 months basic training should be given to teach proper discipline and respect for others. It would also be a great standing for a young persons future. There currently appears to be a complete lack of respect for people, posessions & our country overall. Not all youngsters are the same, but they should all be made (as in some other countries) to complete \"boot camp\" when they reach 18. Maybe if it had never been stopped in the first place, the complete lack of regard for others and the respect for authority would never have been lost. ",
