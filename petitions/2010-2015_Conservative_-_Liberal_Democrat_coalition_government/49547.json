        "additional_details": "Many drinking water fountains built by civic-minded Victorians have fallen into disrepair. This is mostly due to bottled water which, although convenient, is costly to purse and planet. In the UK four billion water bottles are discarded every year. Recycling or disposing of these bottles costs our councils millions.\r\n\r\nFind-a-Fountain (www.findafountain.org) is campaigning for the building of new fountains and the restoration of those in disrepair. To make the endeavour cost-neutral, we propose a scheme to facilitate individuals and organisations to build fountains as legacies or dedications.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned request that the Department of Communities & Local Government take steps to increase the availability of public drinking fountains with a Fund-a-Fountain scheme.\r\n",
