        "additional_details": "Parents convicted of serious crimes against a child (such as sex abuse) still retain Parental Responsibility rights, leaving many of them free to continue to shackle, control and adversely affect the lives of their victim\u2019s family.\r\n\r\nThe non-abusing parent is asked to foresee all future actions of the abuser and to apply to the courts for specific orders to protect the children.\r\n\r\nOffenders can contest such orders and apply for their own. Proceedings can be costly, traumatic and unpredictable \u2013 potentially placing the innocent family in further danger.\r\n\r\nMosac asks that the Family courts be allowed to issue a protective certificate giving the non-abusing parent or guardian the sole authority to action all the safeguarding measures needed to protect the children. This certificate should carry an automatic order of no direct/indirect contact, with the power of arrest if violated. The offender would need to show he/she isn\u2019t a risk if wishing to apply to have the certificate removed.",
