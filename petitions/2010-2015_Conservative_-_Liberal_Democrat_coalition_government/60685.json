We need food and heating for our pensioners & our young families.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't be giving away billions of pounds abroad in aid, when we have families in severe crisis over here, relying on food/clothing banks just to live - children also being taken by boat, through sewage infected waters, to go to school!\r\n\r\n We are like a third world country and the food supply/crop situation is just going to get worse!  We can't be giving money away, when we are in the same situation!\r\n\r\nWe need help & we need it now!  Right across the UK!\r\n",
