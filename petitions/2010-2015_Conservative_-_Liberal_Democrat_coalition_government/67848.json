        "additional_details": "We ask all those with conscience to immediately preserve and provide protection to the remaining indigenous Iraqis who have inhabited Mesopotamia since the beginning of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Iraq has allowed ISIS to establish an extremist Islamic State in parts of Iraq, including Mosel where forceful eviction of this population has started. A decade of harassment has culminated this week with the marking of Christian owned houses with the letter (\u0646) (N) meaning \u201cNazareen\u201d as they refer to Christians prior to their eviction.\r\n\r\nThe world is silent, the Iraqi government is weak and the innocent, unarmed Christians are without protection. We need the government, as a vital member of the UN Security Council and the G8, to take note of this persecution and help save this community by providing a safe haven.\r\n\r\nPlease support the above minority who are currently facing systematic destruction.\r\n",
