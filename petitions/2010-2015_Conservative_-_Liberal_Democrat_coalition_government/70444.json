Alcohol is a deadly and very dangerous suppresant which is very easy to access by underaged and vulnerable. Although its \"legal\" it has well infact caused millions of deaths. Unfortunately local shops are not strict on id and will carelessly sell to the vulnerable alcoholics in which our government spend thousands on trying to rehabilitate. also a drunk person cannot walk into a superstore and buy alcohol unlike a local corner shop.\r\nIt is unlikely that in superstores underaged/alcoholics will be able to purchase alcohol without legitimate identification...\r\nStreet corner shops are growing by organised gangs putting many lives at risk, selling their counterfeit alcohol - which is fatal.
