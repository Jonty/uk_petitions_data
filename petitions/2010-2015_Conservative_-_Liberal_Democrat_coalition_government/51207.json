To make it legal (and to make sure the taxi companies KNOW that it is legal for every taxi company to make every black cab in all areas of the country disabled friendly, and to make sure that if complaints are made, to act apon them, and not just let them get away with it!  Also, for him to force British Rail to make a stand also for disabled passangers! So, that when a disabled person rings and takes the time and effort to make arrangements, for the assistance to be there!",
