For houses with a third bedroom deemed unnecessary under the afore mentioned criteria, the Council Tax for that property should increase by 25%.\r\n\r\nThe increased revenue from the additional Council Tax should be used to fund level 1, 2, and 3 courses with The Open University for Housing Benefit claimants in order to increase people\u2019s chance of gaining employment as the government claim that they want people to do.",
