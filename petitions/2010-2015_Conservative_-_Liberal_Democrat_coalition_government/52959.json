At the same time, news media are obsessing about a woman in childbirth. They've previously stalked this woman, taken naked photographs of her, and were directly responsible for the death of her mother in law.\r\n\r\nForget porn, the really offensive stuff that we're being subjected to is celebrity gossip. The vast majority of the population don't want to invade the privacy of the Royal Family and find it offensive to have the information forced upon them by organisations by the BBC.\r\n\r\nWe call on the prime minister to block all celebrity gossip from the internet, unless users specifically opt in.",
