        "additional_details": "From April 2013 housing benefit for those in social housing will be restricted to allow for one bedroom for each person or couple for tenants of working age, with some exceptions:\r\n\r\nThe National Housing Federation estimate 660,000 people will lose an average of  \u00a314 a week. Housing association tenants are expected to lose \u00a316 a week on average. Google the NHF site for more information.\r\n\r\nWe oppose this measure because:\r\n\r\n1) It will fracture communities and families as people are forced to move away in search of smaller housing\r\n2) It will force people to move into smaller expensive private rented accomodation and so is unlikely to save money.\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask the government to reverse this decision.",
