        "additional_details": "I feel the proposed punishment of rioters removing benefits from rioters fails to go far enough. Clearly everyone receiving benefits are all potential rioters, who may break into Curries at the drop of a hat in order to upscale their TVs which they probably use to watch Jeremy Kyle on and whatnot. I think singling out the non-working classes was a great idea though, so i reckon we should not pay any dole, and spend the money on riot police to keep them in their place. Like the previous petition I also believe this could be applied retroactively, so anyone claiming benefits in the last year, say, would have to return them, and the money received used to make life better for all people.\r\n\r\nWell, all those worth speaking of.",
