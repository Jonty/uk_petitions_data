        "additional_details": "I oppose the changes to WPA proposed recently by Lord Freud. This would increase the amount paid to widows with children during the first year to \u00a39,800, and thereafter all payments would cease.  At the moment, widows with children receive a one-off payment of \u00a32,000 and subsequently around \u00a35,000 every year while their children grow up.  These changes  mean that a widow who loses their husband/wife when their child is only a year old will ultimately lose up to \u00a380,000 while their child is growing up.\r\nThis will place an enormous additional burden on widowed parents and subsequently disadvantage their children.
