        "additional_details": "Due to the inhumane methods of killing animals in halal slaughterhouses that have been leaked into the media recently, I request the compulsory sale of non-halal food in all British businesses selling food. They should still be able to sell halal food if they want to, but the option for non-halal food should be available. Britain is a free and democratic country, and we should not be forced to eat the inhumanely killed halal food simply because a minority wishes to do so. ",
