        "additional_details": "I propose that in all elections that take place in the United Kingdom each citizen should have two votes: one with which to vote for their preferred candidate and another with which to vote against an undesirable candidate.\r\n\r\nUnder First-Past-The-Post candidates are usually elected with a minority of the votes. This raises the possibility that a large number of people were voting for one candidate specifically to prevent another from gaining power. If more people were actually voting against a candidate than for them this brings the legitimacy of their election into question.\r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission should therefore allow each citizen both a positive and a negative vote. A candidate's popularity will be calculated through the sum of their positive and negative votes and the candidate with the largest net total will win the election.",
