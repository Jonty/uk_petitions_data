        "additional_details": "The polarization of men and women in Yemen is one of the most disgusting I've ever heard about! During weddings the bride isn't even seen, she is locked away, sometimes not even knowing that she is being married. All the attention is entirely focused on the man. What makes this even more horrific is, that these are girls are generally as young as eight and being forced to marry. This leaves devastating emotional and physical effects, many young girls take their own lives and throw themselves into the sea due to being completely terrified. There is not any legislation for age of marriage or marital rape, this needs to end now. The government need to look at putting pressure on the Yemen government to change legislation in regards to stopping child marriage and rape within marriage.",
