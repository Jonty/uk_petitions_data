        "additional_details": "In a direct response to the tough economic climate faced by consumers and businesses alike, the introduction of a 'Super Society Raffle' will generate much needed disposable income back into our LOCAL economies. The SSR aims to be established as a non-profit regional based organisation designed to award multiple \u00a35000 cash prizes, it will also donate substantial funds to good causes in each region in line with commission guidelines. Rules regarding 'large society lotteries' would currently not support the operation of such a scheme, this petition will endeavour to convince our Government to enact 'unique' legislation authorising its existence. It is worth remembering the 'UK National Lottery' was established in this manner.",
