My e-petition intends to make receiving at least a brief education in politics a part of the national curriculum. I feel that this would cause an exponential increase in voter turnout among young people and force political parties to cater to the needs of younger voters. As we all know this is something that they have refrained from doing in the past along with lacking intent to do so in the future. ",
