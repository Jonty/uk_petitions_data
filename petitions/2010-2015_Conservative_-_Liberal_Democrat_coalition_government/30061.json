        "additional_details": "Roads Minister Mike Penning intends to change the current laws governing learner drivers to allow them to use the UK's motorways before they have passed their test.\r\n\r\nThe UK's motorways are already congested and dangerous enough without the additional high risks that large numbers of inexperienced drivers would bring.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to reject this patently risky idea and prevent the minister from misusing delegated legislation to force through laws that affect and potentially may harm existing drivers without full debate in the House of Commons.",
