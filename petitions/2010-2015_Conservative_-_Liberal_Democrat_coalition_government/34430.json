        "additional_details": "The general public are disgruntled and dejected at being represented in the Eurovision Song Contest by outdated acts that do not reflect the modern multicultural society we live in, nor the vibrant and diverse music we listen to.  Due to decisions to use either unknown or now largely obselete artists as representatives, we have continuously come in the last four, the bottom ten, and only twice in the top ten, in the last twelve years. This is a petition to request that modern bands, artists, singers and musicians are approached first to be the UK entrants, and that the public are given a larger say in who represents us.  A modern songwriter who understands not only the UK music scene but also that of Europe would also be beneficial.",
