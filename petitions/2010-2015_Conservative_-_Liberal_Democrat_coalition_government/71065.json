        "additional_details": "The LTTE has been delisted as a terrorist organisation It is a debatable in the view of the UNHRC of the point of the supposed actions of the Government forces in the final days of the thirty plus years of conflict, however, delisting an organisation that carried out infamous massacres against civilians through bombings, armed attacks, the assassination of an Indian President, attempted assassination of a Sri Lankan President, various government ministers and interests. An organisation which still has support overseas, funding through various methods and support through means of elected MPs in various countries should not be delisted as a terrorist organisation by the European Union on a technicality. After the defeat of the organisation in 2009, the funding and support overseas continues, this would allow for a reestablishment of the foundation of the group. It is the responsibility of the UK as a member state of EU to ensure the LTTE remains a terrorist organisation. ",
