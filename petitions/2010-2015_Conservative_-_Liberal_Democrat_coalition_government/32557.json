        "additional_details": "I'm a 14 year old student in Norfolk. Michael Gove is making unnecessary changes to GCSE's throughout the country, stating that they're too easy. Does he know how stressful these such examinations are? Many of my teachers aren't happy with his actions. I'm dreading the next two years, and i'm worried that Michael Gove will introduce other initiatives that'll damage education. Please, I need your help, lets get this in parliament. Thank you. ",
