        "additional_details": "The Hunting Act bans hunting with dogs in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nHowever hunting is an important part of British culture and is helpful in reducing the population of foxes.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the Hunting Act to be amended not repealed, so that hunting with dogs may take place to hunt foxes only and only on certain specified days of the years (e.g. Boxing Day).\r\n\r\nThis will provide for hunting with dogs to continue to an extent but not totally repealed which is a situation which many are opposed to. Hunting deer and other larger animals with dogs is a different scenario as these animals are larger than foxes and this would be a separate argument.",
