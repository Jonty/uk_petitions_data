        "additional_details": "Colchester Fire Station is facing dangerous cuts in 2015. Essex County Fire and Rescue service are planning to remove the Rescue Tender vehicle and all its equipment and 12 frontline firefighter posts.\r\n\r\nWHAT THIS MEANS FOR RESIDENTS OF THE COLCHESTER AREA : Colchester Fire station will lose its boat/swift water rescue capabilities, mud/ice rescue, train/heavy rescue capabilities and the years of knowledge and experience gained by firefighters using the equipment.There will be 12 less firefighters serving you in Colchester and the Aerial ladder platform(Simon snorkel) will only be available if both frontline vehicles are not on other calls due to new switch crewing plans.\r\n    These are extremely dangerous plans for the Colchester public and need to be stopped. Please sign our petition to stop these cuts and feel free to share the link on social media.\r\n  Thank you from all at Colchester fire station!!",
