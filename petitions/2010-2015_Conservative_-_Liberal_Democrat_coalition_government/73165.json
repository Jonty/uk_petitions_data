(source: Uswitch)\r\n\r\nThe average UK property is valued at around \u00a3250.000. (source: The office of national statistics)\r\n\r\nJust over half (52%) of all households in England and Wales have their water rates based on the \"rateable value\" of their property (source: Ofwat). So essentially if you happen to live in a property valued around or under the average rate and you pay more than \u00a3400 per year then there is a very good chance that you are being overcharged.\r\n\r\nEven if you are one of the 48% living in England and Wales using a water meter there is a very good chance that you will be forced into paying above average water rate in a average or below average valued property.\r\n\r\nThe government must do something about this widespread draconian overcharging on a simple and abundant human need. If you agree then sign up here. ",
