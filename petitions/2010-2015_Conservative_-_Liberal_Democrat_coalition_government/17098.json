It is becoming an increasing issue where the public are not pleased with the many who are merely bailed and disapear into the system while the immigration authority lack any power to do anything else when passports for example are not found. Immigration can be good for a country and therefore should not be stopped but it certainly requires a much better control otherwise the country will deteriorate and those who trully deserve access to this country will struggle.
