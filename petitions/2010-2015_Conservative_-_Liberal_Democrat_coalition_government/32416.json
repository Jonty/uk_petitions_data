        "action": "No to powers to monitor e-mails, internet use or telephone calls without a warrant",
        "additional_details": "The Government announced proposals to allow the monitoring of all e-mails, internet use and telephone calls without necessarily obtaining a warrant from a Judge. A warrant would be needed to view the contents of messages but that would not be the case for monitoring. Such an extension of powers is a breach of civil liberties.\r\n\r\nWithout the effective safeguard of having to show reasonable suspicion in order to get a warrant from a Judge, it would be a very serious threat to our civil liberties and could permit the monitoring of perfectly innocent people.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the Government must not be allowed in any way to monitor or view the content of e-mails & internet use or listen to telephone calls without the permission of a Judge, and that permission can only be granted where there is reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.",
