There have been countless stories of disabled claimants being passed fit to work, only to die a few weeks or months later, there have been instances when people who are bedridden or housebound have had their benefit removed or threatened with removal if they don't attend an Atos interview. The switch between the old DLA over to PIP as also been a farce whereby the official processing time of no more than 8 weeks is now a standard 26 weeks, causing more distress for the disabled as they struggle to survive day to day. This farce should stop immediately until the Government are ready to put in place a system that does not discriminate this group of vulnerable people  ",
