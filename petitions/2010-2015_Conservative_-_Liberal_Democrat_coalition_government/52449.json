        "additional_details": "Ban cyclists from all UK roads unless on dedicated cycle lanes. They are an absolute danger to themselves and other road users. I have to sit a road test to use these roads and yet a cyclist can use the same roads free of charge and have no clue about the highway code. When collisions do occur it always seems to be the motorist who gets the blame. This government preaches about road safety and yet allows a vehicle that can be doing as little as 5mph on a road with vehicles doing 60/70mph. This would also eliminate cyclist deaths overnight. ",
