As part of our citizenship GCSE campaign we would like you to sign this e-pitition to support us in urging the UK government to tackle climate change by cleaning the British energy supplies as quickly as possible.\r\nGetting off fossil fuels will cut the carbon out of the british power system and create thousands of jobs, and give the UK the chance to become a world leader in renewable energy technologies!",
