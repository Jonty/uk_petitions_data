        "additional_details": "Recent revelations that MI6 have been working closely with the former Gaddafi regime in Libya reveal extraordinary rendition leading to torture.  Given that David Cameron has vowed to address British involvement in torture during the Iraq War via the Chilcot Inquiry, it seems incumbent upon him to also address this potentially far more engrained condoning of torture.  We can hardly vow to oppose brutal dictatorships and condemn their abuse of human rights, while we secretly work with them to enable these violations.  Policy must be introduced to outlaw this kind of clandestine cooperation.",
