        "additional_details": "Your State Pension is the only thing that you have to look forward to after 30 years of hard work. They affect everybody, eventually. If you are 21 years old today, your government is now making sure that you will have to keep on working until you are 75 years old. If you are 33 years old today, you will have to work until you are 70 years old. (man or woman). Then, and only then, will you qualify for your well earned state pension. You can do something about this now. By signing this petition, which is against all State Pension cuts of any kind. Don\u2019t be fooled by the planned \u00a3140 minimum guarantee either, because in effect, the plan is to merge the two state pensions into one much lower pension and maybe end pension credits.(Most current pensioners need extra Pension Credit, to lift them above the poverty level). Single State Pension today is approx \u00a3102 per week.  Please don\u2019t sign this if you are a Millionaire. You\u2019ve just got an extra \u00a340.000 in tax benefits from the 2012 Budget.",
