        "additional_details": "The Bank of England has printed money to support banks and lending to stimulate the economy. This has benefited noone other than the banks. It amounts to some 25 thousand pounds per household. The next round of QE should be to give money to households (it's been done in other countries with excellent results) to stimulate consumer spending and growth in the economy. The 'honest, hardworking families' of this country will benefit, not the financial experts or those with shares in banks.",
