        "additional_details": "I want a vote of no confidence in David Cameron due to his inability to realise that the United Kingdom needs to financially support the Police and Prison Service to maintain a safe and successful society. Crime and civil unrest is a major obstacle to economic stability and the whole fabric of UK society. Justice needs prisons and sentences to deter criminal behavior, with a strong forensics and police service to protect society and bring criminals to justice.",
