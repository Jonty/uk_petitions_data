        "additional_details": "There seems to be a continuing trend of people refusing to vaccinate children due to unfounded links to autism.\r\n\r\nNot vaccinating your own child can cause serious harm to him/her but can also cause harm to infants that haven't had the vaccination. Measles, mumps and rubella are horrible diseases that had been kept under control due to these vaccines.\r\n\r\nPeople are refusing vaccines because they work so well, No one has experience of these horrible diseases so can afford to ignore the very thing that protects them.\r\n\r\nIt is the equivalent of child abuse knowingly risking your child's life without vaccines. There is absolutely no credible scientific evidence to link vaccines and autism, and until there is they should be compulsory. ",
