        "additional_details": "The government should be held accountable for the massive amount of money they take from Taxpayers and refund it when they get their \"schemes\" wrong.  Take for example the cost of the aborted West Coast Line Rail tender which could cost us over \u00a3100m, or the \u00a350m wasted on the NHS \"Health\" computer.  Just in those two alone we are owed \u00a3150m and there will be plenty more!  Why should the government be free to tax us for their mistakes?  I have no problem with viable projects that have a benefit to us all or the majority but not such profligate waste!  I am asking the government to refund taxpayers wasted money.  ",
