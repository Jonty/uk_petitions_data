        "additional_details": "I wish to move one of the May Bank Holiday's to the Monday after Remembrance Sunday, this is for 2 reasons. Firstly the act of remembrance needs to highlighted to the younger generations & to show what those people gave for what we have today, with the Monday off there is no reason why big events couldn't be held nationwide (like London Poppy Day). Secondly after August there is a long gap to December with no Bank Holiday's.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to move a May Bank Holiday (or create new one) to become the Bank Holiday of Remembrance in November.",
