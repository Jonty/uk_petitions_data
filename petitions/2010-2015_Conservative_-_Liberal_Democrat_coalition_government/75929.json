        "additional_details": "Nowadays, women claim their freedom. Some of them have chosen stop shaving for a variety of reasons : it may be because they only don't want to shave; it also includes women that have decided to raise their voices for equality beyond men and women; or for condemning the systematic pressure to wich they are exposed. However, they are often humiliated. This must stop ! It is evidently necessary to introduce a law that could punish people who would not respect this liberty of every woman to decide what happens to her own body.",
