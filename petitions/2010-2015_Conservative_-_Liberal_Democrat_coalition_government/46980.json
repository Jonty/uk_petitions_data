All vehicles using British motoways are to be required to have a vignette, including foreign-registered cars, vans, and large goods vehicles.\r\n\r\nRoad tax will be reduced for all UK vehicles by \u00a340, with tax free vehicles able to apply for a vignette free of charge.\r\n\r\nThe vignette will ensure that all foreign cars, vans, and large goods vehicles pay their fair share for using our roads.  It will also increase the amount of money availible for road maintenance.",
