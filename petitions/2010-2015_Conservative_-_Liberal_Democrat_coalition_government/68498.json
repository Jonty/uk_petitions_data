        "additional_details": "This petition is to urge the government to make it a criminal act for a company or individual to alter any terms and conditions after the date the contract was signed or to allow companies or individuals to state in the contract that they reserve the right to alter terms and conditions. The law would penalise companies and deem the changing of terms and conditions as miss selling with the company being forced to compensate anyone whose contract was altered. The law would also hold the directors of the company or the individual as criminally responsible for the act of trying to change a contract unilaterally. This law would protect consumers from bad business practise.",
