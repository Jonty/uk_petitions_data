        "action": "Instead of minimum pricing for alcohol, increase penalties for drunken behaviour",
        "additional_details": "The government should increase penalties and sentencing for people found guilty of drunken behaviour. Minimum pricing serves only to penalise the vast majority of social drinkers in the country. Anyone found guilty of any alcohol related crime, violence etc, should be fined up to \u00a31000, a weekend curfew imposed for 3 months and 100 hrs of community service. People using the NHS for alcohol related abuse should be charged for the NHS time etc the same way victims of RTA's are charged. Do not penalise innocent social drinkers, by introducing minimum pricing.",
