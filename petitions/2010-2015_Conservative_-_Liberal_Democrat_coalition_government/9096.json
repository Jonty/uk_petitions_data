I am lucky enough to have witnessed such greatness and true courage in my Grandfather and been brought up with some key principles - the difference between right and wrong.\r\n\r\nI find it hard to contain my anger regarding the nanny state the UK has become. A soft touch with easy access to welfare, a home to ungrateful, hateful and disaffected youths.. This is one of the many unfortunate outcomes of giving too much too easily and then trying to cut back.\r\n\r\nNational service should be brought back to teach young kids a lesson in disciple and self restraint.
