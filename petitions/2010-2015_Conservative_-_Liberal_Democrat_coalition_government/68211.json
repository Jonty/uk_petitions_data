        "additional_details": "Here the undersigned would like the Government to stop supplying grants to employers for employing young people.\r\n\r\nAt present employers are given a sizable grant for employing a young person. However a worrying trend has appeared of young people being laid off or unfairly dismissed after only three months.\r\n\r\nThis encourages employers to take on as many young people as possible with no intention of keeping them on after the three months.\r\n\r\nThis is devastating for many intelligent, hard working young people looking for work. It makes them feel like they cant hold down a job when all they want is a permanent job. This doesn't help young people and instead is a big knock to their confidence.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to many young people that have experienced this, and have had more three month jobs in the last couple of years than I have had in a life time.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to come up with something more supportive of our young people and less open to abuse.\r\n\r\n",
