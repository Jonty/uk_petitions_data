        "additional_details": "I would like to suggest that the change to housing rebate and benefit cap should be applied to MP's expenses. If the government feels that no one should be claiming more than \u00a3500 per week from tax payers money then their expenses surely should be capped to that limit too, including LHA rates, the maximum amount of housing benefit you can claim according to your post code and family unit.\r\n\r\n For example if a MP decides to rent in Chelsea, they could claim up to \u00a3995.02 per month for a one bedroom flat. If they decide to rent a two bedroom property and have an empty room, their allowance would be reduced to \u00a3855.72 per month (bedroom tax). Anything bigger and it would be reduced further to \u00a3746.27. They would then have to pay the shortfall from their own pocket!\r\n\r\n Also the LHA would be removed from their capped allowance meaning they could then  claim no more than \u00a314059.76\r\n\r\nWe all know the outcome, but lets have some fun while showing the MP's how out of touch they really are!!!!",
