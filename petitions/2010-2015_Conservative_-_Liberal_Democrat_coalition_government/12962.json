        "action": "Animal cruelty convictions should have higher penalties",
        "additional_details": "Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, the maximum fine for animal cruelty & welfare offences is \u00a320,000. The maximum term of imprisonment is 6months (3months). In the majority of cases where convicted - the person rarely even gets a noticeable fine due to an ingrained attitude by the courts towards either those on low income or animal crime itself. All animal cruelty cases - even the most serious are only heard at Magistrate level, hence the limit on sentencing handed down - should this barrier exist? Magistrates knowledge is normally limited to experiences brought before them. The use & enforcement of animal bans is weak & rarely for life.\r\n\r\nI propose the following to HM government:\r\n\r\n1. Raise the maximum fine to \u00a350,000.\r\n2. Raise the maximum imprisonment to 10yrs (5yrs).\r\n3. Magistrates to complete a one day course given by an organisation such as the RSPCA to aid them.\r\n4. Enforcement is difficult, none the less, life bans should increase.\r\n\r\nThank you for supporting this petition.",
