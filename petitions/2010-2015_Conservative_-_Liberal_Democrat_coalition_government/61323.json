Also so people are allergic to onions and could be spared much distress if onions were prohibited.\r\n\r\nHenceforth we suggest;\r\n\r\nAll imports of onion to be stopped immediately\r\n\r\nAny person attempting to cultivate onions to be charged with manufacture of a controlled vegetable\r\n\r\nAnyone who knowingly serves onion to another person to be charged with attempted murder\r\n\r\nThese laws will also cover the strest versions known as 'shallots' and 'spring' onions as well as the genetically altered 'red onion' which has been engineered to be super disgusting.\r\n\r\nPlease, think of the children",
