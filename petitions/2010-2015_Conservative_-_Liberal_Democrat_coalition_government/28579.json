        "additional_details": "This petition aims to affect a change in the law, which currently gives too much power to local authorities over car parking:  The charges, the enforcement of, and the lack of redress.\r\n\r\n1) Car parking charges should be capped, at no more than \u00a330, whilst retaining the early pay discount of 50%.\r\n2) When going to a parking appeal, if the motorist wins, the charging authority must have to pay a fine, to the motorist.  A sum equivalent to the amount in question, or \u00a3100, whichever is greater.\r\n3) Challenging a parking fine should be made easier.  Is a particular enforcement in the \u2018public interest\u2019 should be allowed in appeals.\r\n4) Parking appeals should be allowed to censure local authorities if it is deemed they are issuing fines over zealously, are ignoring legitimate representations, or are seen to just be making money.",
