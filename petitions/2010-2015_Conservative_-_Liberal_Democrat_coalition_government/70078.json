        "additional_details": "it is outstandingly \"ridonkulous\" that the general public are even thinking about introducing road tax on cyclists. Imagine a young boy just learnt to cycle the week before. The first time he goes out on the road he has to pay tax?!! Is that serious? He doesnt even fully understand what it is, nevermind actually paying it!  So join me and vote 'NO' to cyclists paying road tax.\r\nTo conclude I urge the governement to keep with their initiall processes including cyclists, i believe that if you have to use muscle to push the thing your riding and it doesnt pollute the environment by uisng petrol (or diesel) then they shouldnt be taxed.",
