        "additional_details": "FAO Jeremy Hunt MP: All about the Cause alerted me to the increase in male suicide.  Campaign Against Living Miserably says suicide is the No 1 killer of young men in the UK, with 4639 male suicides in 2012, the highest annual figure in the UK this century. ONS data shows male suicide rates climbing among older men and a death toll 3-4 times higher in men than women.\r\nThe Dept of Health\u2019s latest suicide prevention strategy announced \u00a31.5 million for suicide prevention research, yet their Impact Assessment put the economic cost of one suicide as \u00a31.7 mill. This issue deserves serious investment. Can you explain:\r\n1. Will you take action to reduce male suicide specifically?\r\n2. Will you fund research to address male suicide?\r\n3. Research shows those impacted by bereavement far more likely to take their own life. Victim Support contacts crime victims but no such support exists for the bereaved. Will you implement a mechanism for those impacted by suicide?",
