        "additional_details": "You must bring down car insurance premiums. The young work force of the UK can't afford to even run a car, to go to work. This in return makes the young, lively, hard-working population of the country very miserable! Where has that true British spirit gone too over the years? Where is our freedom and modern basic rights. Driving a car is something everyone should be entitled to in the United Kingdom. Bring the premiums down sub 500 pounds. Put the excess up over 2000 pounds if you must. This will ensure drivers are sensible.",
