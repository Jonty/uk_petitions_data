        "additional_details": "We are deeply concerned about the news that UKBA have revoked London Metropolitan University\u2019s highly trusted sponsor (HTS) status. 2000 international students studying there will have to find a new institution within the next 60 days, or face having to leave the country.\r\n\r\nInternational students are being treated as a political football, the negative impacts of which could have implications for the UK economy \u2013 further emphasising the need for international students to be removed from immigration statistics, as has been recommended by the Home affairs Select Committee.\r\n\r\nInternational students constitute an industry worth \u00a312.5 billion a year to the British economy, and contribute a great deal to our education system and society.  It would be extremely misguided to take this for granted. We call on the Government to support this call for international students to be taken out of migration statistics.\r\n",
