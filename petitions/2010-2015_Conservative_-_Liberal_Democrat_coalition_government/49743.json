        "additional_details": "Although i am no longer a resident in Windsor, i class Windsor as my hometown, and have relatives who live there, in view of the fact that 2012 was the 20th anniversary of the Windsor Castle fire which i remember well and tonight (7/5/2103) a very desirable area neighbouring the castle has had a major fire, the proposed closure of Windsor Fire Station seems to be absurd. Tonights fire did not by the grace of God take any lives mainly due to the fact that the time the fire occurred engines were able to get to the location fairly easily but had this been at another time of day when the traffic was bad fire vehicles would have taken longer to get there and even longer if they had to come from further afield. Does the potential loss of life not mean anything to those in politics making such crazy decisions?",
