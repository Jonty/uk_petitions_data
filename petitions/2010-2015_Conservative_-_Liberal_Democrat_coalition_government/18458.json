        "additional_details": "An excessive dairy intake is one of the main causes of obesity and heart disease, and consequently puts a substantial strain on NHS resources. Whilst I don't agree with the idea of a nanny state, there are unfortunately many people who cannot make informed choices for the benefit of their health and one of the main habits is the consumption of full-fat milk, when healthier options are available. The government should set a date after which semi skimmed (which contains half the fat of whole milk) would be the fattiest available. In the long term this could save many lives and take a huge burden off the NHS.",
