        "additional_details": "Under 25, particularly those who have just started to drive, don't normally have the money to pay for the through the roof insurance prices.\r\n\r\nDriving lessons and the test alone cost a lot of money, the government need to cap the amount that  younger people get charged for car insurance. Or work out a system that stops insurances companies taking the mick.\r\n\r\nI was once quoted \u00a38,000 for one years insurance on a small, old fiesta. This is out of line because the insurance companies are taking advantage.\r\n\r\nYoung drivers aren't as irresponsible as people sterotype them to be, there are just a few people who ruin it for the rest. There are poor drivers of all ages not just young.",
