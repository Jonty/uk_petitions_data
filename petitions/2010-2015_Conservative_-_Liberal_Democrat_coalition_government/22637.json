        "additional_details": "We the undersigned hereby demand the govt. makes Thames Water maintain its development of a supersewer for London. This supersewer would be greatly beneficial for the environment, and it should be completed. Thames Water has increased its charges to pay for the supersewer, and has presumably already raised millions of pounds this way, and yet this November, 2011, it has abandoned its plans for it. And this, when it, like other large companies, has made record profits. It should either return the money it raised for the supersewer, or preferably, it should continue to build the supersewer.",
