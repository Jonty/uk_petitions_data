The closure of libraries and fewer playing fields penalises the working person, while more middle-class arts receive disproportionate funding. The lottery should focus on the necessities of working people and not middle-class leisure pursuits.\r\nThe governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, signalled housing as the \"biggest risk\" to the UK economy and the crises is for all to see: spiralling rents, more homeless people, a lack of quality housing.\r\nThis, or any, government should direct lottery funding to local councils in order to provide new housing for those who have contributed most to the lottery project since its inception.\r\nTo date, lottery players have raised over \u00a333bn, it is time those who fund the lottery see a more direct benefit from playing instead of hoping to 'win' their way out of poverty.",
