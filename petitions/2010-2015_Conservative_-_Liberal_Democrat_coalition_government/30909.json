        "additional_details": "We ask that the government reforms the current student finance system of maintenance grants which are currently means tested by parental income, to instead consider every student as an equal.\r\nBy effectively providing a national allowance to each individual the inequality currently inflicted on students will be combated.\r\nWe believe the cut off point to receive a grant by parental income is too low, as many parents cannot afford to finance their children's university living fees as they have other children to provide for/ bills to pay, etc..\r\nWe feel students as adults should not be treated as still dependent on our parents income and should instead be free to experience the world by our own means.\r\nWe want to stop putting students in crippling debt before they have even entered the financial or property market.\r\nWe call for equal opportunities for students in an economy they have not yet had any influence upon.",
