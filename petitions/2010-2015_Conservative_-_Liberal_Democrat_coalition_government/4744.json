        "additional_details": "This Government is a sham,\r\nPeople\u2019s votes were wasted by going into a coalition.\r\nAll the Leaders that just take off at the same time for holidays it is not good enough when the country is turmoil.\r\nI call on HRH Queen Elizabeth to dissolve the Government or the Government to call a General Election.\r\nThis coalition has broken too many promises; it\u2019s time to tell them to go.  I for one am fed up with them blaming other governments for the mess; they should not have taken on the task if they were not up for it. We need to put money into this country not just move money to wealthy parts of the country. We need to get the pound working for us again\r\nWe then can have a referendum on the EU, Immigration etc with a government that will listen. We need this now that is why I have only put 6 months on collecting signatures.\r\n",
