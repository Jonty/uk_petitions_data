        "additional_details": "The Care Quality Commission (CQC) survey showed 33% of people spent more than four hours in A&E - up from 27% in 2008.\r\n\r\nGovernment targets say no more than 5% of patients should breach the four-hour limit.\r\n\r\nI am proposing that communities and A&E attenders should be made to pay a small fee upon entrance to our Accident and Emergency departments. I have seen far too often, people who use and abuse the system for a 'bed' or simply for a matter that could be dealt with their GP's.\r\n\r\nI blame the lack of communication about the services that are available to people. If people had to pay a small fee upon an A&E admission, they would think twice about whether they really needed that service. If your condition really does require secondary care services, I should imagine one will not hesitate in paying a small fee for their urgent matter.\r\n\r\nPlease help me with this petition, I think the abuse of our system has gone on far too long.\r\n\r\nThank you",
