Although we are different from our friends in many ways, we can learn from the positive effects cannabis legalisation has had.\r\n\r\nOur NHS is crippled and the revenue produced from legalisation will inject billions of pounds into the system, more than enough money to cover any negative effects that the NHS may have may have to deal with.\r\n\r\nEducation and benefits for non smokers is the way to make people stop, not by criminalising them\r\n\r\nSo many uses and so overdue\r\n\r\nGIVE CHOICE, REDUCE CRIME, GO GREEN!",
