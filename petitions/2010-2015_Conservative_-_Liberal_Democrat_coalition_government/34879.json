        "additional_details": "Our health is of vital importance to every one of us. If it is compromised in any way, we suffer. As a result, many people place immense faith in health professionals.\r\n\r\nSadly, medics are only human, and they get things WRONG. IATROGENIC SUFFERING is that which relates to medical disorders, symptoms, injuries, etc. caused inappropriately by any clinician through his/her (mis)diagnosis, manner or treatment. (Extract from S.I.N. website).\r\n\r\nFaith can be misplaced; medical errors can be denied, hidden, and investigations thwarted. If you, or a family member/friend, are suffering as a result of a medical blunder, you may know the additional agony of a complaints system that fails you.\r\n\r\nIatrogenic patients deserve rights and protection. They deserve a fair deal. Please, sign up!\r\n\r\n",
