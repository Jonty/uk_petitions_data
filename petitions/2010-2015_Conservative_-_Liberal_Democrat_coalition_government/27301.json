        "additional_details": "This house believes that: The UK can and should lead the world again with the most advanced railway and passenger shipping industries connected by electric trolleybuses to every community in the UK so that there can be full employment in the UK with high wages for everyone to be OK. We can leapfrog the Germans and lead the world again with British engineering excellence. Placing new HS2 lines alongside existing motorways would be cheap, natiowide and connect everyone to the railway. Lets work together to overtake the Germans in a single generation: we can do it !",
