        "additional_details": "Hundreds of thousands of taxpayer funded employees are paying much less tax than they should because of the preferential treatment afforded to them by our corrupt party political system of government.  It is time that taxpayers were able to find out who is paying less tax, and therefore contributing less to running the country, after being paid HUGE amounts of taxpayer pounds.  If the President of the US has to place his tax affairs into the public domain there is absolutely no reason why the political minnows driving this country into the gutter should not put their tax affairs up for scrutiny by the people who are bearing the cost.",
