Train operating companies should be kept on their toes with a single year contract, renewal dependent on meeting stringent customer service levels, including a requirement that >95% of trains run on time and the cleanliness of trains is maintained to an adequate level. I know I'm not the only person to be disgusted by the stench emanating from the toilets on board many services in this country.",
