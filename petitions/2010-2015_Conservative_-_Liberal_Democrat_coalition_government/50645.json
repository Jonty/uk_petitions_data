This is an infringement of choice for the racecourse punter in that it takes away the element of pool betting to the punter , previously given by the Tote.\r\nSuch a move is not well advertised by the racecourses in that the minus 10% proviso has not been given prominent advertising by the racecourses in question .\r\nThe introduction of such bets is taking advantage of novice punters who do not have a sophisticated knowledge of horse race betting and protestation must be given .",
