        "additional_details": "Lancashire County Council recently threatened the closure of all primary schools with less than 100 pupils across the county.  Primary schools are often the heart of the community and why families remain in villages and rural areas.  Education shouldn't be about numbers; it should be about what is best for the children and for the communities in which they live.  Funding formulas should therefore be changed to ensure small schools can stay open so that children can be educated locally and village communities aren't lost.",
