        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to change the law to allow for an opt-out organ transplant list, replacing the current 'opt-in' system.\r\n\r\nEvery day, 3 people in the UK die waiting for a transplant. They die because far more people are willing to accept a transplant than to donate themselves, and to make the choice to join the Organ Donation Register.\r\n\r\nUnder an opt-out system, those who have an objection to donating will be able to say as such- allowing those who don't mind, but haven't got round to joining the organ donation register, to donate their organs.\r\n\r\nNeedless deaths can be so easily prevented.",
