        "additional_details": "We petition for an end to parliamentary double standards.in our foreign policies we should always promote British standards.\r\nIn riots in UK parliament promotes stiffer penalties, cutting social benefits and allows police to shoot same. In the middle east they promote the provision of weapons to the rioters and military support and make strong complaint threatening sanctions of authorities shooting rioters stating police and military overeact.\r\nThis is justified by stating that it is promoting democracy.\r\nWe classify any attempt at promoting civic unrest in BRITAIN  as terrorism yet fund same in foreign countries calling it regime change.\r\nIf parliament promoted peace in its foreign policies assisting in the disarming of rioters, it would greatly increase foreign respect and foreign trade.\r\n",
