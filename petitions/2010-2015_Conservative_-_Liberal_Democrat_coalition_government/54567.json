        "additional_details": "The importance of organ donation NEEDS to have wide coverage via the media, particularly TV and in secondary schools.\r\n\r\n\"From the heart\" - (a TV campaign) A total close to 147,000 people signed the donor register throughout the week of the campaign. Imagine the number of potential registered donors with regular TV promotion. Organ donation needs constant advertisement and to be in the public eye!\r\n\r\nIn relation to schools - contact with the DOH discovered organ donation awareness may be carried out during PSHE to which schools may decided whether or not to raise awareness. Through contact with local secondary schools I performed a presentation, many leaflets were distributed with pupils stating they will discuss with parents. *SUCCESS* All schools should contribute to raising awareness as organ donation is a very important topic!
