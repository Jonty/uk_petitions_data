This is a problem that must be solved.\r\n\r\nInstead of decreasing job seekers allowance, plunging already poor families and communities into further poverty or increasing minimum wage and discouraging a much needed rise in employment another option must be considered.\r\n\r\nGreater financial incentives should be given to those in low paid jobs, be it as income boosts or tax exemption, so that the quality of life of people in work is raised above that of people living on job seekers allowance.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, demand that low paid workers should have their income boosted by the Treasury, in order that those in low paid jobs may be rewarded with better quality of life and those who are choosing to live on job-seekers allowance may be given a real incentive to find work.
