Young people work to help them better their lives, get a standard of living, and to be equal to their peers, how on earth can the government stamp out child poverty when they are the cause.\r\n\r\nBe fare to all, do not alienate your younger future generation, MAKE Britain finacially stable and pay the NMW to all that are on the low end bracket.\r\n\r\n",
