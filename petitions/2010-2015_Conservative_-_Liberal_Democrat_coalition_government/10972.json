        "additional_details": "There is a gap in care at the moment for when premature babies leave either SCBU/NICU.\r\nIf a Prem Baby is poorly shortly after discharge they have to go on a normal children's ward. For some children this could be too much as was little Katie's May Briscoe's case who sadly passed away in her mothers arms after contracting the RSV virus on a normal ward.\r\nKatie was born 12 weeks early on 30th November 2010 weighing just 2lb 4oz & sadly passed away on Wed 23rd March 2011.\r\nWe currently have a campaign up and running and ultimately want to get KATIES LEGACY heard & acted on to help save other premature babies. We would like the government to look at the care provided to discharged prem babies and safe place &  plan put into action if they need to be readmitted. Please sign this petition and show your support x",
