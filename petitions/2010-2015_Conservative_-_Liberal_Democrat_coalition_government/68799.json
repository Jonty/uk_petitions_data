        "additional_details": "The Police and Crime Commissioner role attracts little public interest. Further no one person, no matter how brilliant, could ever hope to engage effectively with such a large number of constituents. It has done nothing to increase democratic accountability for the Police so the costly experiment must be brought to an end.\r\nFuture management could be brought under the National Offender Management Service to bring together the key criminal justice agencies into one system, making the seamless management of offenders an achievable goal.\r\nThe Government should immediately announce that the Police and Crime Commissioner elections, scheduled for 2016, will not take place.",
