Many examples of legally shared, open source, out of copyright material exists and blocking The Pirate Bay would stop access to all this legitimate material too.\r\n\r\nThe record and film industry need to change their business model and adapt to new technologies, NOT force the court to censor the internet. Today it is The Pirate Bay, tomorrow it might be porn, the day after it may be all sites that the Government doesn't want you to know about.\r\n\r\nThe Internet is far too important to allow Government and Courts to censor it. Censorship of the Internet must be stopped, now.",
