        "additional_details": " The immunisations we received as infants weaken over time in the first quarter of 2012 the number of confirmed cases of Whooping Cough in the UK are already at levels we experienced in the whole of 2011, many cases go undiagnosed officially so the actual numbers are a lot higher than recorded by the Health Protection Agency.This disease is rarely fatal in older children and adults but it results in long periods (months) off school and work with the most unpleasant symptoms, but for babies this disease is often fatal. Please visit our Facebook Group (Stop Whooping Cough UK) to read of the devastating effects this disease has on families.\r\nA Booster Immunisation Programme for adults and school leavers will stop the increase in incidence in\r\nWhooping Cough/Pertussis, and maybe work towards eradicating it altogether.\r\nPlease sign this petition now to make a difference to the health of our nation. YOU KNOW IT MAKES SENSE!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
