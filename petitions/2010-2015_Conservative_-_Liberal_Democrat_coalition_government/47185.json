        "additional_details": "As the UK is in the EU, why is diesel fuel more expensive here than petrol? In every other EU country, diesel is 8 - 10 cents/litre cheaper than petrol, which costs much the same in most EU countries, including the UK. In the UK, however, diesel is 5 - 10p/litre dearer than petrol. I call upon the government to bring diesel prices in the UK into line with the rest of the EU, thus reducing the cost of transport, and benefitting everyone!",
