This must be reversed immediately. The banks no longer need savers' money as they have been given taxpayers' own money at give-away rates of interest.\r\nTime and again savers have been treated as mugs who are prepared to subsidise the loans of the very people who created the financial crisis - the overborrowed, but this latest measure is THE LAST STRAW.\r\nJust look at savings rates since the scheme was introduced in August - down by over 1% or a fall in income of 30%.\r\nOur own government has torpedoed the market.\r\nDon't suffer in silence, speak out for fair treatment of savers, instead of a give-away to people with existing mortgages and loans, or profit for banks.\r\nPlease speak out, there are millions of us, and we are all losing out. Don't be abused any more. Support the petition!\r\n",
