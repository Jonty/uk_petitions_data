This is unlike the majority of goods and services that are bought by internet which have a seven day cooling off period.\r\n\r\nSo if your circumstances change weeks before you booked a hotel \u2013 the hotel gets all the money for providing no service.\r\n\r\nThis legislation should be changed so that if you book by internet more than seven days then you have an automatic right to cancel and have a full refund.\r\n\r\nThere should be exemptions :\r\n\u2022\tsingle night accommodation providers who have less than a ten room business. This will exclude most \u201cBed and Breakfast\u201d providers.\r\n\u2022\tCost of transaction to refund which should be the same as the original cost of merchant services.\r\n\u2022\tRefunds are only to the same card that took the original transaction.\r\n\u2022\tApplies only to England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\r\n",
