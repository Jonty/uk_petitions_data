Furthermore, only highly skilled immigrants should ever be considered for citizenship. Any unskilled labour should be strictly temporary.\r\n\r\nThe takeover of vast swathes of our towns and cities by  third world nationals and their descendants is contrary to the wishes of the majority of the local British population, and it is only too clear that these people are not skilled immigrants needed to fill specialist jobs.",
