This petition is not against overseas aid, we need to help our families & friends and then supply other aid when & where  we can. Basically use the billions set a side for overseas aid,first on necessary Cancer treatments within the NHS and any surplus left over in the overseas aid budget can then be used as required in the next fiscal year.",
