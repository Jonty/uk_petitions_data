These:\r\n\r\n1.prevent surface run-off which cause floods\r\n2.prevent flood damage to homes in the event of a flood (even if they are in a flood plain)\r\n\r\nThe requirements are under threat from DCLG\u2019s Housing Standards Review, which is not yet complete.\r\n\r\nThe Environmental Audit Committee has also recommended that the Code (which includes Sur 1 and Sur 2 requirements) should be retained (Eighth Report of Session 2013-2014).\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, the Sur 1 and Sur 2 requirements must not be scrapped and to do so during the recent flooding in the UK is utterly short-sighted.\r\n",
