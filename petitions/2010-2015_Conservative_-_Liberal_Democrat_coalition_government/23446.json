        "additional_details": "Rob Andrew has now been in position at the RFU for over 5 years which has seen a continuing trend of decline in player performance on the pitch and their attitude and behaviour off it. He has been responsible for the disgraceful removal of Brian Ashton and the illogical appointment of Martin Johnson (no coaching experience) and then failed to back or support a man who is a legend in the rugby world. To allow this man to remain in situ at the RFU to continue his repeated errors and misjudgements is paramount to neglect and as he will not admit his errors and failings and resign then it should be taken out of his hands.",
