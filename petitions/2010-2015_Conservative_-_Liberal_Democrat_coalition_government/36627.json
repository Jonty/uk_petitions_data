        "additional_details": "Traffic Lights are an important piece of road furniture during the day that helps traffic flow and keep a balance of priority.\r\n\r\nHowever, at evenings, nights and occasionally over the weekend, they often cause traffic to wait for nothing coming the other way and during a time when fuel is at its peak, perhaps we ought to assist the motorist by keeping the vehicle moving.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is tried and tested in Europe, where at a set time period the traffic lights just flash amber. This means to watch out for pedestrians and to be aware that on an unmarked crossroads, anyone has priority.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that during traffic light failure the road seems to flow better, but there needs to be a consideration for safety, and that the traffic during off peak is considerably lighter than during rush hour.\r\n\r\nThis would assist those of us awaiting a green light and seeing nothing else on the road.",
