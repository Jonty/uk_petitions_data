        "additional_details": "On Wednesday  8th February 2012, it was announced Tower Hamlets Council had approved plans to tarmac over the cobbles in East London's iconic Brick Lane.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is to ''smarten'' the appearance of the area in anticipation of the rise in visitors expected during the summer 2012 Olympics.\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from being a questionable use of public spending, surely the 2012 Olympics is the biggest opportunity we have to present to the world a wholly authentic view of our capital city, and to celebrate the individuality of the East London area where the Games will be staged.\r\n\r\n\r\nTarmacking over the cobbles will strip this colourful neighbourhood that is brimming in local history, diverse culture intersections and character, and replace it with the look of an indistinct, homogenised shopping parade.\r\n\r\nThis is not the London it's residents support. It's time to show it.",
