        "additional_details": "The law introduced booster seats for child safety.  Parents invest money to comply & keep their child safe.  BUT for the sake of a concern with whose responsibility it is to provide & install a booster seat on a bus we have removed this requirement.  Allowing a child to wear a 3 point belt or worse on a school bus the bus companies are excused from providing a 3 point belt.  The risk is the same in a car or on a bus.  There is a 69% chance of spinal injury when using a 3 point belt without a booster cushion.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 things have moved on.  We must enforce all buses have 3 point belts.  As for booster seats, there are inventions on the market now including the boostapak & many compact booster cushions that can be inflated or rolled up into a bag.  These take no installation other than fastening the normal belt & no more organising than asking a parent to provide it.  This could simply be added to the uniform list.  It may be shared with siblings, it is cheap & easy to store.",
