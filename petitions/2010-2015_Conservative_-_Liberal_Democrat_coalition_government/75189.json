It is NOT fair that paramedics have to clean up after drunk people have urinated themselves or done sick every where, this is why there is a problem for the NHS. Paramedics and doctors should treat the ill and injured only and not those who cannot control their craving.\r\n\r\nThe government should raise taxes on alcohol and wines so that people have a controlled amount to drink and any surplus revenue raised from the taxes should be used to set up a separate service to treat drunks instead of the NHS.",
