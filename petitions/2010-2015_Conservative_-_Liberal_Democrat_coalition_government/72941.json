        "additional_details": "Why have the government pledged 50m of the tax payers money to make the England football team the best in the world? The FA are always saying how much they have sold TV rights for around the world. The sport is awash with money. Just look at the players wages. George Osborne should be made to reconsider his offer and make the FA sort out their own problem. Will he be offering the other home nations the same offer. Use the 50m to help the NHS or towards paying off the national debt. ",
