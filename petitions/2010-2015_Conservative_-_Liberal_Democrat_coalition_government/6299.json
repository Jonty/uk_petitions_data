        "additional_details": "During the 1800,s hard labour was introduced into jails in the UK as a form of restitution for a crime, this included the treadmill and other labouring tasks the prisoners where paid for what they achieved that week and charged for their meals with a small amount left over for themselves. I propose this should be reintroduced in a more 21th century style i.e.: A turbine can be made much like a treadmill to create electricity for the power grid or litter picking on uk beaches  ",
