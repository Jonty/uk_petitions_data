        "additional_details": "I want the government to take seriously the amount of crashes caused by car drivers that simply do not see cylces or motorcycles. The majority of accidents could be prevented had car drivers looked properly before manouvering. The term SMIDSY (sorry mate I didn't see you) is an all to common phrase heard after a crash. My aim is to improve road safety for all road users by re-educating car drivers to look and do proper safety checks when changing direction. Motorcycle riders are taught to do a 'lifesaver' shoulder check when changing lanes or direction and I would like car drivers to be taught the same. This simple check can save lives and prevent accidents. ",
