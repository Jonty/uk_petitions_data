        "additional_details": "There is currently an inadequate standard applied by Local Authorities to determine and thus abate nusience in these catergories. Tracing and abating noise sources must be prioritised, for too long people have been left in suffering, whether Town or Countryside dwellers. An analysis of SIXTY Councils across the country revealed that not ONE had ever issued an abatement order in these categories. Some Councils did not even recognise these as real issues for people.\r\n\r\nI call upon Government to set up and fund an Independant Agency to investigate and abate such complaints. To make it unlawful for any Business, L A or Individual to knowingly or unknowingly create a nusience in these categories.\r\n\r\nTo punish by heavy fine those who do not abate their nusience within 28 days. To recompence those who have suffered. ",
