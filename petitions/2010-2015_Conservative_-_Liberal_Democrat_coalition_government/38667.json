        "additional_details": "We ask the government to assess personal vaporizers (AKA electronic cigarettes) as legitimate devices in their own right. We ask that they be considered as a legitimate device used to satisfy a habit that is not necessarily directly related to nicotine content. We ask that they not be automatically deemed a \"tobacco substitute\" simply because they may contain nicotine, and we ask that no taxes or legislation be unduly or restrictively applied simply because the use of such devices may resemble smoking. We ask that our human right to maintain a nicotine habit be recognised as relatively harmless to others and that the activity is not unfairly or unduly restricted. We further ask that the government does not attempt to recoup lost tobacco revenue through punitive taxes on personal vaporizers,   related accessories and the \"fuel\" that they utilise.  We  ask that these devices and the use thereof be assessed without prejudice, undue influence or improper classification. ",
