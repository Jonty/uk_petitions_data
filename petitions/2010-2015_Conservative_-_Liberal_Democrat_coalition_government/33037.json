        "additional_details": "ANPR Cameras in Traffic Police vehicles are great, but they can't be everywhere at once!\r\n\r\nWhat we need, is an extension to Speed Safety Cameras. If each Safety Camera through the UK is fitted with an ANPR - illegal drivers will be flashed up to a local policing unit. A traffic car can be alerted just the same way as the mounted ANPR camera in their vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe reason why these cameras are so great, is that you're only ever in trouble, if you're breaking the law. ANYONE who has a fully insured, taxed and MOT'd car, with no outstanding warrants - should have no problem with Speed Safety Cameras being fitted with an extra device to make our roads A) Safer B) Less congested and C) safer from the risk of road accidents from unlicensed/uninsured drivers.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to get the ball rolling!",
