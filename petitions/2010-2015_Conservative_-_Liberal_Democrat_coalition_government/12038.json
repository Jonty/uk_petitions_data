        "additional_details": "Some benefit claimers claim unfairness in life, no job opportunities; no one will employ them etc!\r\n\r\nI propose that we make it compulsory for benefit claimers to fulfil 10 hours per week of community/voluntary work i.e. through litter picking, working at the local civic amenity sites, cleaning the streets from chewing gum, window cleaning, bus cleaning, I could go on.\r\n\r\nThis will increase their chance of employment through C.V. enhancement and new skills that potentially could be taught, whilst also giving tax payers some benefit of paying their hard earned salaries/wages\r\n\r\nFor benefit claimers who claim they are 'sick', then jobs should be found that they are able to do, for example the common 'bad back', well they could type documents, paper shredding.\r\n\r\nI think it's about time tax payers make a stand and push those who don't want to help themselves.\r\nSign this petition to finally gain some control of a society that see's continual increases in benefit claimers!!",
