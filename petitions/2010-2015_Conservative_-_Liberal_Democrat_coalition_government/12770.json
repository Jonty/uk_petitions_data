Unfortunately, what I do not see for the money I pay is proper maintenance of the roads I have to travel on regularly. I want to see roads being properly repaired and not to see my money being wasted on filling pot holes that need repairing again 12 months later. This would also reduce the repair bills for the steering and suspension gear on my car, that appears to be a regular occurence these days,",
