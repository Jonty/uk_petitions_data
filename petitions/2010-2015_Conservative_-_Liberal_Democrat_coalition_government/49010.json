This is misleading.\r\nWe believe that individuals accessing health care have a right to know that those looking after them and advising them about their health are suitably prepared, qualified professionals who are accountable for their practice and regulated by a professional body.\r\nThis is a matter of public safety, which post the \u201cFrancis report\u201d is supposed to be a health policy priority.\r\nMaking \u201cNurse\u201d a protected title is a right not a privilege, and would restore public confidence and professional pride.\r\nCall yourself a Nurse? Then protect it!\r\n",
