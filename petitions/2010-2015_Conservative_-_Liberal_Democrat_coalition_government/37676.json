        "additional_details": "After such a high profile and successful London 2012 Olympic Games why are overseas sporting stars penalised by tax regulations for competing in the UK. The government is advocating a sporting legacy for the UK and yet, people like Usain Bolt who would certainly support a legacy, will not compete in the UK. It is the fans who suffer and after London 2012 there must be a whole lot more fans.",
