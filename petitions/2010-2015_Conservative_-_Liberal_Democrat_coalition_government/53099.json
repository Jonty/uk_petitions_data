        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take a look at the lack of funding and social awareness regarding HIV/AIDS. We can't continue to be ignorant regarding the rapidly increasing numbers of infection not only in the UK but also worldwide. Which in turn will lead to more money being spent on medicine and leading to more people unable to work and reliance on the welfare state. Many current organizations have closed down through lack of funding and they don't advocate the long term consequence that if not dealt with will grow out of all proportion. When less money would be spent in advertising via various methods to prevent this decline from happening.",
