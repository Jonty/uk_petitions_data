Sadly some of these people are children and indeed there are millions of children around the world who do not receive any education preventing them from achieving their potential. Many of these impoverished children living communities infected by deadly diseases such as HIV AIDS. So I am petitioning the government to invest in projects like the wings of Hope the charity who provide free education the children in the developing world.",
