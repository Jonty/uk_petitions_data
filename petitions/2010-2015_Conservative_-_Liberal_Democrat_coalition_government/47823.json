        "additional_details": "Freeze the state pension age at 66 from October 2020 BUT, to pay for this, remove all additional pensioner universal benefits such as free bus travel, eye tests, medicines, winter fuel allowance etc. for those retiring from 1st January 2021. Allow a safety net for those pensioners whose total income is below the Personal Allowance Threshold to retain some or all of these perks. This allows the majority of the population to retire at 66 thus freeing employment opportunities for the young.",
