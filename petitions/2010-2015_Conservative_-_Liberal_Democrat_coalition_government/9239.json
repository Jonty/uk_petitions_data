The people of this country need to feel safe and protected and with the cuts that are in action this simply isnt possible. We need more funding for the police to extend their recruitment and go back to the style of policing that was the vision of Sir Robert Peel. Support your Police force so that they can help you. Government please increase funding for this ESSENTIAL service through recovery of funds from benefit cheats, tax avoidance recovery and non dom reforms. ",
