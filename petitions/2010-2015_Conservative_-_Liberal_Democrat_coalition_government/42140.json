        "additional_details": "Currently the male Archbishops and 24 Bishops of the Church of England have seats in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThere is now serious concern that an organisation that discriminates against women is given guaranteed votes for men in the House of Lords. In addition, representatives from any religious organisation can surely have no place in our Parliament. The bishops of the Church of England have no legitimacy as a group of men; they're not elected; they have no special expertise or experience and they represent only a very narrow section of society.\r\n\r\nThe Bishops can no longer claim to speak for anybody.\r\n\r\nFor a more legitimate House of Lords, it is time to throw the Bishops out.  Every day they are there and votes take place under this anti-democratic system, more damage is done to our democracy, women's status and this country\u2019s reputation.\r\n\r\nThe government must remove the bishops from the Lords, without delay.\r\n",
