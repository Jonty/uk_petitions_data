In some cases on unsubstantiated allegations alone. You may never have been cautioned, charged or even been to court, however ISA can find you guilty on grounds of probability. Even if you have been found NOT guilty by a Crown court, they have the power to find you GUILTY afterwards on grounds of probability.\r\nTo appeal against their decision you have to pay, unless you can get legal aid which is highly unlikely if you own a house or your partner works. It could cost you \u00a325,000 to over a \u00a3100, 0000 to appeal. There are thousands of innocent people with no hope at all of financing an appeal; they have lost their work, their wages and their pensions.\r\nThis government needs to look into and change the power they have given ISA and change the appeal system  so its not just for the rich.",
