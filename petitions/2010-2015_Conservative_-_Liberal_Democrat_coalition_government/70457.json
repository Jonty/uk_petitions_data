        "additional_details": "Why are the UK public still paying a TV license to the BBC? For popular and innovative programmes? Not seen anything worth watching on the BBC for years the only notable programme I have seen is Top Gear.\r\n\r\nThe UK has approximately 30 million homes paying \u00a312.50 a month which is \u00a3375 million a month which works out to be \u00a34.5 billion a year.  The Majority of the UK already pays for TV packages from Sky & Virgin Media (being the most notable providers) which works out to be nearly \u00a370 a month for a decent enough package.\r\n\r\nPlease join me in ending this ridiculous back door tax when the money is not used to good use other than to line the pockets of directors at a corrupt organisation.\r\n\r\nThis will save the average family \u00a3145 a year, I would rather spend the money on my children.\r\n",
