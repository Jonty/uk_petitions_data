Many cyclists do not observe the laws of the road, yet the motor driver is almost always blamed for any accident involving cyclists, and as the cyclists are not insured, even when an accident is their fault the driver pays the price and insurance companies find it difficult to recover costs from the guilty cyclist, even if they broke the law or did not follow the Highway Code.",
