The options should be university education; vocational or trade qualification; compulsory national service.\r\n\r\nAs well as ensuring that everybody has the opportunity to build their skill set and contribute to society this would enforce an understanding and respect on unwilling participants.\r\n\r\nIt may be a long term fix to our current problems but would at least ensure a plan is in place to restore respect in our society as one currently does not exist.",
