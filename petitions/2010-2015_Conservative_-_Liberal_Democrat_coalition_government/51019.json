        "additional_details": "STOP plans for building of a new town in Sussex for 10,000 homes. There isn\u2019t the infrastructure to sustain such an invasion. Hospitals are already unable to cope with present numbers; this would endanger the lives of the local population. They could be built north of London within the HS2 proposed railway line.  Sussex villages are being ruined and countryside eroded, wildlife destroyed, watertable unbalanced and amenities overstretched. Councils are unable to cope with road repairs, flooding and present demands yet alone accommodate huge population moving into the area.  There needs to be more balanced house building and development plans spread evenly across the country not predominantly in the South East, where vast areas of land have already been targeted and built upon and greenbelt land criminally ignored.  This proposed development should be stopped immediately on the above basis and any further developments of this size forced to seek building land elsewhere in England.",
