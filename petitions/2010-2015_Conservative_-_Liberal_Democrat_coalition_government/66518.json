        "additional_details": "Metro (Transport for Yorkshire) propose to completely withdraw the 531 bus service between Sowerby Bridge, Mill Bank, Cottonstones, Soyland and Ripponden. This is to be replaced by a mini-bus service between Sowerby Bridge Station and Ripponden, via Mill Bank, Cottonstones and Soyland.\r\n\r\nThe service currently operates hourly between 07:31 and 23:34 (from Mill Bank) on Monday to Saturday, and between 10:34 and 11:34 on Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe proposed service is to operate every 90 minutes between 09.30 and 15:30pm on Mondays to Fridays only. If the proposals go ahead there will be No Buses at all on Saturday and Sundays.\r\n\r\nThe proposed changes will severly disadvantage residents of Mill Bank, Cottonstones and Soyland particularly, many of whom are without any other means of transport and rely on the bus service. The 531 service should, therefore, remain unaltered.",
