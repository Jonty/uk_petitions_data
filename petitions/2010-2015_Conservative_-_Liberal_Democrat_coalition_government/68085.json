        "additional_details": "Devon County Council\u2019s proposals on the future of the library service will see closures, cuts in opening hours and job losses.  The Council wants to create 22 Devon Centres at the county\u2019s busiest libraries and is looking at how 28 smaller libraries could be sustained.  Alternatives to mobile libraries are also being explored \u2013 an essential service in Devon\u2019s rural areas.  The Council says the proposals are in response to the changing ways people are using libraries and budget reductions to save \u00a31.5 million over the next three years. UNISON says libraries are a vital public service. They help parents on low incomes get their kids into books, provide free access to computers and act as meeting places for the elderly, and mums and dads with young children.  Once our libraries are gone, they\u2019re gone for good.\r\n\r\nHelp us say to the Council:  \u2018Hands off our hardbacks!\u2019 by signing our e-petition to \u2018Save Devon Libraries\u2019.\r\n\r\nUNISON Devon County Branch\r\n",
