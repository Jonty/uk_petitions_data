With no clear reason apart from a watered down response via email, vague and clear indication to not reading my initial emails to them; I am  outraged by the marginalization of the Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Thus, I ask you all to support me in this ministry mission of faith.\r\n   I aim to organise a Damera event that commemorates a historical event and I have clearly stated in my emails the bonfire will be 3m high and that a park is required. If there were health and safety issues, I would understand but how can there be in a wide open space? So what is the underlying issue, fear of integration or discrimination? The celebration symbolizes our commitment to the faith and our commitment to the faith re-affirming our devotion to Christ.  So I ask where is the religious freedom and equality? Where is our freedom of Cultural expression?\r\n   ",
