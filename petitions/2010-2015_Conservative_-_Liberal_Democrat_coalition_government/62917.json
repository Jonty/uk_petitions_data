        "additional_details": "Due to the ever escalating nature of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis, a strong and united message must be sent to the expansionist Putin. Asset freezes and travel restrictions simply do not put enough pressure on the Russian Federation. I then propose that Parliament discusses the possibility of leading the way with explicit Military support and even intervention in Ukraine. If we take the first bold step, others will surely follow. We appeased Hitler in the 1930s and we reaped what we sowed. Let us learn from the mistakes of our past and put an end to Russian dominance in the East.",
