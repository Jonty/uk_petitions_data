WHY?\r\n\r\nIf Sunderland City Council are keen to help reduce air pollution & help the environment, then \"Why make other vehicles travel so much further?\"\r\n\r\nAre they only allowing buses through, so that they can then fine people who try to save the added travel distance & fuel costs?\r\n\r\nMy personal concern is, the environmental impact that my 2 young children could suffer thanks to the long term effects of not allowing traffic travel a shorter distance.\r\n\r\nSo please sign up & ban Bus links, which add so much to a journey (NOT Bus Routes or Lanes).",
