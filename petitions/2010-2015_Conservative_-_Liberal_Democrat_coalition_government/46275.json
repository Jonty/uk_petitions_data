        "additional_details": "Ringside Boxing Gym has been training local children and teenagers for the past 7 years and is still doing so (6 years with Docklands Outreach and the last year as Ringside Boxing Gym in 28 Mastmaker Court). We are not a registered charity so we have not been receiving any donations or help but wish to still continue with the services we provide for the local community. We are being forced to leave the premises in order for City Gateway to take over the properties in Mastmaker Court and Clipper House (because they will pay more money than us). All we are asking for is your support so please sign this petition and ask your friends and family to do the same.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks",
