        "additional_details": "i would like to petition for a change in the law regarding unlicenced drivers,joy riders under aged drivers in fact any person caught driving a vehicle whilst being unlicenced.I would like to see an end to drivers on our roads who should not be there,and if they persist with this behaviour they should be refused a licence for life,on the grounds that they are not a fit and proper person to hold a licence,one strike and your out. I feel that this would eventually rid our roads of thoroughly bad,problem drivers.In turn when these persistant offenders realise they will not ever hold a driving licence they will have to think very hard about their future as when they get older they will not be able to take their famillies out for day trips or holidays,this will also help with our public transport thus giving more employment",
