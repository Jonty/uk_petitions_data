        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the government to repeal the UK Digital Economy Act. The act was rushed through in the final days of an outgoing government with little to no consultation by people who have no expertise in the very field they are trying to limit.\r\n\r\nThe act removes any form of due process and allows corporations to treat people as if they are criminals, it undermines the very basis of the internet and threatens free speech and creativity. It supports a dying and outmoded business model which instead of adapting to new forms of technology seeks to excerpt it's political and financial power to protect itself in it's current form. This act does not benefit the people of the UK, it benefits the shareholders of stubborn and outdated businesses.",
