        "additional_details": "As in France, we should ban the Burka. It has no place in modern Britain. At a time where overt signs and demonstrations of Christianity and values are frowned upon by local authorities etc, it is contrary to allow the wearing of Burkas in public. We should treat all religious beliefs with an equal playing field. Whilst respecting everyone's religions and systems respectfully, we should insist that in our public institutions, schools and government that these belief systems integrate into a British society that is tolerant and works as a team rather than perpetuates isolationist practices. You cannnot walk into a bank wearing a crash helmet or a balaclava - why should some be allowed this anonymity. It fosters distrust and isolates communities when they should be working towards a common good - as British citizens.",
