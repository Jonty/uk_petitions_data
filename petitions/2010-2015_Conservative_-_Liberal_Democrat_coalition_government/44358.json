        "action": "The ORR Insurance Cap Regulation Change Proposal",
        "additional_details": "The regulation of insurance payout for charter trains in the UK is set to change. Currently the rail operators pay a max fine of \u00a35000 if a train is delayed to the point that it badly delays other services, and if the fine amount is more than \u00a35k, Network Rail pick up the excess. The ORR is looking to lift that cap, meaning charter trains would be a potential money grave for operators, and the heritage image of our railways would be left severely damaged.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to go to the DfT, to forward to the ORR in support of the cap on insurance payouts, and the continued operation of our many thousand mainline rail excursions per year.",
