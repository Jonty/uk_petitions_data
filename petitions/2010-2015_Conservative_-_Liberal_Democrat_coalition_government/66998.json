So the long distance tramper driver can eat more healthy and look after his long term health if he wishes to do so at a more affordable price. The services in the uk dont supplie great  food and as my facebook page the trucking chef has proved over the last 12 months there is a great deal of drivers who would like to eat more healthy. So i would like to see a law passed where all tramping/ sleeper cabs have proper cooking facilitys provied.",
