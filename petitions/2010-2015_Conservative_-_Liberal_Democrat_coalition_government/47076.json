        "additional_details": "For some time the citizens of the Falklands Islands have been subject to an intimidatory and hostile environment for trade, travel and tourism.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the British government to redirect a modest amount of the international aid budget to the Falkland Islands in order to support a tiny economy that, in the words of one of our own diplomatic staff, Argentina is \"seeking to strangle\". Further, the same diplomat proffered that \"We will take every necessary measure to support the Falkland Islanders\".\r\n\r\nGiven that it has been made clear that neither the U.S. nor the EU will be of assistance either in diplomatic or military terms, redirecting funds would present a genuinely appropriate use for the often controversial aid budget.  Given that it has already been proposed to review it and possibly redirect funds to the MoD, this would send not only a strong diplomatic signal but also encourage further investment in the islands.\r\n\r\n",
