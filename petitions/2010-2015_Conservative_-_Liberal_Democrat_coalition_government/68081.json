        "additional_details": "The proportion of children born to unmarried mothers equalled 47.5% in 2012 and due to social and economic reasons this number is on the rise. More and more couples are choosing to cohabit and have children rather than waste money on a costly wedding. The British courts need to recognise this and treat both married and unmarried mothers and their children in the same way should a relationship sadly break down. Whilst at present the British courts have the power to award a married mother the family home, this is not the case of an unmarried mother who will later be made to repay any home/ lump sum for housing loaned. This is a clear case of discrimination. I urge the British justice system to implement equal rights for unmarried mothers as they do married mothers when it comes to the case of child maintenance.",
