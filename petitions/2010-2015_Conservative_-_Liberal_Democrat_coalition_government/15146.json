        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, note the comments of Google chairman Eric Schmidt in his MacTaggart lecture in August 2011.\r\n\r\nWe note that in many schools, the teaching and assessment of ICT constitutes only the use and application of various software packages to miscellaneous simulated 'real world' problems.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this practice is sorely deficient, as software and user interfaces are fast-changing aspects of the industry. This means that the teaching of a software package today may be obsolete in five or ten years' time, when the student needs to apply this knowledge in the real world.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we believe students would be better prepared to adapt to new software, and solve their own problems, if they had a basic grasp of computational theory, algorithms, problem solving and data structures/representation.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we petition the Department to introduce a basic grounding in Computer Science as a compulsory component of the National Curriculum at Key Stage 3 or below.",
