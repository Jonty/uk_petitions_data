        "additional_details": "I undersign the following petition to the government to ask that funding for the free bus pass scheme for eligible disabled and the elderly is maintained. And exempt from local authority spending cuts.\r\n\r\nSpending cuts, or termination of the scheme from when the passes are due for renewal will, I believe, threaten many eligible people\u2019s ability to become independent and fail to assist them in times needed most in particular, when restrictions applicable to their mobility and getting around are rife and extra assistance is needed. For some, this may, have further underlying mental health implications; such a scheme has had a massive positive impact on many users\u2019 lives, and therefore should be kept.\r\n\r\nTherefore I kindly ask that the government considers keeping the funding for this scheme and continues to provide already eligible users with new bus passes at the time of their expiration as stated on each users pass and excludes such a scheme from cost saving measures.",
