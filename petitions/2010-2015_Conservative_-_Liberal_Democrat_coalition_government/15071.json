        "additional_details": "There are currently some 145,000 War Disablement Pensions and 6,700 Guaranteed Income Payments in force for those servicemen and servicewomen who have been injured as a direct result of their service to the extent that they will receive a monthly payment for the rest of their lives.  The practice of issuing an emblem to show a visible mark of gratitude from a grateful nation ended shortly after the end of World War 2.  We call upon the government to institute an emblem which these injured veterans can wear proudly to show that they received their injuries as a direct result of serving their Queen and Country",
