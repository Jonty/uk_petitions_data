        "additional_details": "Agency/temporary workers are not paid whilst off on sickness. This allows for an environment where by employees must consider finances before their health. People have to go to work when they are still too ill to work, or may pass on an illness, purely because they cannot afford to take the time off they need. When there is so much emphasis placed on health and wellbeing it seems surreal that people have to put their health at risk, or delay recovery, or risk others, simply due to money. The balance between health and financial concern may also cause distress to some and further endanger people's health. It should be passed into legislation that agency workers and temporary workers are paid sick pay in the same way a permanent worker would be. This would circumvent the above problems and many more, and create a more fair, safe and positive work environment around Britain.",
