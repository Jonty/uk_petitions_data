        "additional_details": "     The amount of disturbing imagery on billboards in increasing.\r\n     Images of crash victims, horror films, television programmes\r\n     that are after watershed etc. should not be viewed by children.\r\n      As we have no control over billboards we are subjecting the\r\n     nations children to these images which have a dramatic effect\r\n     on young minds who cannot distinguish reality from graphic\r\n     enhancement or fiction.  Parents are encouraged to obey\r\n     watersheds on Tv, film ratings at the cinema etc. but are\r\n     expected too accept this ,generally, much more graphic use of\r\n     media.  Our children hide their eyes, have nightmares and are\r\n     disturbed by images such as this and we have no power to\r\n     protect them.  The effects of this need to be researched if the\r\n     government support the continuation of this.  We the\r\n     undersigned would prefer that protocol for image approval is\r\n     sought before billboard advertising can go ahead.\r\n",
