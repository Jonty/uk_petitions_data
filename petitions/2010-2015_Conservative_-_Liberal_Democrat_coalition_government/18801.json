        "additional_details": "The Government is spending millions widening the M25 in order to reduce congestion. The biggest cause of congestion on the M25 is the Dartford Crossing toll system with daily queues miles long on both sides. Scrapping the toll charge will at a stroke remove this bottleneck. If the Goverment needs to replace the lost income I am sure there are many ways they can do this that support a desirable outcome and not the undesirable one, i.e. congestion,  that the current toll charge does.",
