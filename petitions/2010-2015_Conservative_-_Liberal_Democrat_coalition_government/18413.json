        "additional_details": "Some 30 years ago, Lord Barnett, then theTreasury Chief Secretary,drew up a formula for distribution, by Whitehall, of the Annual Public Money to England, Scotland, Wales & N. Ireland. This formula was supposed to be a solution to growing self-government  & facility demands, all since resolved. Last years (2010) Annual Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis shows that Scotland received \u00a310,212 per head of population, England received \u00a38,588 - in other words, Scotland received 10% of Whitehall money for just over 8% of the U.K. population. Wales received \u00a39,829. It also means that the free services enjoyed now in Scotland (university tuition, prescriptions, long-term care) are being subsidised by England, also in Wales. It also means that, financially, the Members of Parliement representing England, are failing to ensure England has it`s fair share of the financial cake & have been doing so for some time, I propose that the Government scraps this formula & gives equal shares from 2012.",
