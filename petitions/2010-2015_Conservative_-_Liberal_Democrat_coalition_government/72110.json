        "additional_details": "We want to see a ban all computer and console game launches that take place at late times such as midnight. The midnight launches are causing children to pester parents into letting them go to these launches, then missing school or college the next day with excuses of not feeling well. Often this is brough on by being tired from being out late or just because they want to play their new game. Also youngsters going to these game shops at midnight also is very dangerous especially in city centre.",
