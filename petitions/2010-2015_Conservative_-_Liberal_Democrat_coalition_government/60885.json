As this will cause an additional cost to the advertiser.\r\n\r\nI complained to the Royal Mail about their post men and women delivering advertisement to me with my actual post.  I was told that if I want it to stop, I will have to opt out of receiving door to door mail, which includes unaddressed mail from Royal Mail, including any important communication from local and or central government.  Obviously there is a difference between the adverts and important messages from our government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a nuisance to receive these taxi adverts, grocery suppliers and so on.  Even though I registered with the mail preference service and have a very clear sign on the door which states NO JUNK MAIL.\r\n",
