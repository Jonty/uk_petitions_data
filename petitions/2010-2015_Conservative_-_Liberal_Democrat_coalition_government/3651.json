        "additional_details": "Our tradition of representative parliamentary democracy is seriously undermined by the new e-petition scheme. Our MP's are not delegates. They are representatives and it is their judgement which we elect them for. One of the biggest dangers in a democracy is that of reactionary or populist measures, such as restoring the death penalty. This is a particular problem with the modern mass media culture. Instead we should focus on evidence based policy and the defence of our parliamentary traditions. The e-petition scheme should be abolished.",
