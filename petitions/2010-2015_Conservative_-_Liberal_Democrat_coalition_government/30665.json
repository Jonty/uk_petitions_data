        "additional_details": "Expecting teachers to work in a classroom teachers children until they are 68 is unrealistic. Employers will not recuit older people, as they can pay a younger person less money to do the same job. The government needs to rethink their expectations of teaching. Teachers should be allowed to opt for retirement at 60, which is a more realistic age to stop teaching. The age gap is too great between the students and the teacher.\r\nThe stress factor of having to stand infront of a class of children, maintain order and teach to OFSTED criterion at 68 is not going to happen!
