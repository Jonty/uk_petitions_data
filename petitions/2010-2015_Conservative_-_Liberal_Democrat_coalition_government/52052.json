        "additional_details": "With student fees tripling from \u00a33000 a year to \u00a39000 in some instances, it can be argued that this increase is unjustifiable in the UK's current economic climate. Socio-economic factors, such as the government spending cuts have caused much distress in some families. It is often the case that Middle class families are the worst off, as students miss out on vital grants and loans, presuming that their families can often financially aid student living costs, which is certainly correct at all! Therefore, for the benefit of Middle class families especially, I recommend a compromise at \u00a36000 a year. The chances of fees being nothing are remote, so the argument for that is pointless in my opinion. Sign this petition and help to try and reduce fees! ",
