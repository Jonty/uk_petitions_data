I don't want my taxes to pay to keep them in prision, I think they should be put to work cleaning up and rebuilding the community they destroyed without recieving any wages or benefits. They need to learn respect for themselves, others and property before they are allowed to enjoy any freedoms of life to express their opinions.",
