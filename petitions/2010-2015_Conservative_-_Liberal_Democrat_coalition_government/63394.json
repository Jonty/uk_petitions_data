(Quote from Deputy PM Nick Clegg Sept 2013 on the announcement of free school lunches for all infant school children from Sept 2014)\r\n\r\nBut what about junior school children?\r\n\r\nI am not proposing a 'hand out' and free school meals for all primary school children as the money required to do this will be potentially taken away from other areas of need in education.\r\n\r\nMost school lunches are approx \u00a32 per day. If the government were to subsidise this by 50% to \u00a31 per day I think there would be a huge amount of parents who would opt to move their children on to school lunches. This would help boost the government's ambitions for healthy eating and improved attainment for all primary school children right through to secondary school and at the same time remove the stigma that is attached to 'free' school meals.\r\n",
