        "additional_details": "Since the abolition of Copyhold Land rights Lord of the Manor Titles are legally entitled to carry on with, or without, land ownership. The title of Lord of the Manor is legally still extanct without a need for ownership of the original Manorial land that accompanied the title to which it was allocated. Without a register of Lord of the Manor Titles it is not possible for accurate records to be kept that are legally correct and true.\r\n\r\nI propose that a new Lord of the Manor , Manorial titles, register must be created by the Government and run by the Civil Service. In this way any future fraud in the illegal sale of Lord of the Manor Titles may be avoided. This new register would be of vital importance, and paramount, in protecting the public interest.The new register should be funded by private sector interests as a civil service controlled privatised initiative.\r\n",
