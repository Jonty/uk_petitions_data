        "additional_details": "I feel the current and newly proposed education system is short changing every student that walks in to a mainstream school.\r\n\r\nWe leave school with qualifications that reflects how well we can read, write and answer questions in exam conditions. However, I feel we need to broaden these means of testing to produce a more detailed picture of an individual's intelligence.\r\n\r\nI feel the education system could include more speaking and listening, and vocational measures to run along side the standard means of testing. This would give all students an opportunity to show what they understand, gain or improve their qualification, as well as improving the quality of lessons.\r\n\r\nIt will also give employers a more detailed account of what a candidates skills really are, giving a more accurate account of ability.\r\n\r\n",
