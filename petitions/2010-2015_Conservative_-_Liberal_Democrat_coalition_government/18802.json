Make it part of the ofstead inspection with a list/register of every bullying allegation in every school and check that it has been handled accordingly. Schools are more likely to sort out bullying if it is part of an ofstead inspection. Firmer punishment for bully's, for example, exclusion twice and then permenant exclusion if the bullying continues. Write to the parents via post not sent with the child, explaining that this WILL happen if their child continues to bully. Make this a law, stamp out bullying now.",
