Leaking breasts are both uncomfortable and embarrassing and we should be doing what we can to encourage breastfeeding, in line with World Health Organisation goals.\r\n\r\nBaby formula for under 6 month olds is zero rated for VAT, breast-feeding pads (which are essential for the more natural alternative), should also be zero rated.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to reduce the VAT rate on all breast pads, both disposable and reusable.\r\n\r\n",
