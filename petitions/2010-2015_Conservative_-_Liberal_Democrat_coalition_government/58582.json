        "additional_details": "We need to raise the issue that companies are exploiting the working time directive opt out by forcing employees to sign out. This is a all to common issue, far too many families are suffering due to working hours.\r\nMany of the key workers are mentioned in these types of debates but often large areas of employment like retail are often missed.\r\nWe need some protection from these greedy companies that want more and more from employee's. The affect on the health system is huge we need to act now before we grind the country into the ground. More research is needed.",
