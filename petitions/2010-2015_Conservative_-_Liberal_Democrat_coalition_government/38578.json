        "additional_details": "Sir Paul Beresford, MP has introduced a Bill in Parliament which would add to existing laws on indecent material concerning child sex abuse.  His proposal would make it illegal to possess written material featuring children which \"must reasonably be assumed to be have been produced solely or principally for the purpose of sexual arousal\".\r\n\r\nThe undersigned believe that this is a logical extension of the law as it stands with respect to images of child sex abuse; that written accounts of paedophilia are offensive to public decency and a threat to the protection of children and that possession of such must in itself be regarded as unlawful.  The undersigned urge the Government to provide Parliamentary time and support for this short and uncontroversial clause.",
