If a motorist wants one they should provide proof they have children (under 12 or in a cr seat) & they drive a car. The badge should have the license plate on it so it can't be fraudaulantly used be anyone else. The government should create such a badge, it should be renewed every year like car tax, & updated every time you get a new car.\r\n\r\n",
