        "additional_details": "Petition: change adult dependant visa rule.\r\n\r\nBritish immigrants' elderly parents are effectively banned from living in UK with their children since from the absurd UK adult dependant visa changes in July 2012. Please support a change in this visa category so that family values can be upheld and children can fulfil their filial duties!\r\nWe need 100,000 signatures. We do not need social support, nor health care support. This adult dependant visa can be restricted to \"no recourse to public funds and healthcare\". We just want to care and love our beloved parents and be fully responsible over them. Be human and support our call!\r\n\r\nRead this story by copying this URL:\r\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=elderly%20dependant%20visa%20uk&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CDEQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jcwi.org.uk%2Fblog%2F2012%2F11%2F06%2Felderly-dependent-relatives-more-misery-uk-citizens&ei=G49pUsSqKaSn0QXt7oGQCg&usg=AFQjCNH2qB54IL3NXARWbZ5kdislN-EFFw&bvm=bv.55123115,d.d2k",
