        "additional_details": "Some power companies are ripping off their customers that have Solar PV systems fitted. You have a date your system is connected to the grid and a meter reading at connection but they refuse to honour these instead using the date of paperwork signing some weeks potentially later. This means all electricity generated prior to this date goes into their coffers. This is abstraction of electricity. If the shoe was on the other foot they would pursue the matter to the full. The power company blames Ofgen for this state of affairs, but they are the ones pocketing the money it seems.\r\nI ask the Government to make the power companies honour the date of grid connection. This should be backdated to those that sought to invest in this technology and have been ripped off, and the power company should be fined for illegal activity.",
