The pain and suffering of many people being caused by the greed of one individual cannot be tolerated in a civil society. The laws on sale of land in the UK need to change to protect the many from the evil, dishonest, greedy people who regularly employ the tactic, legalised by poor legislation, of gazundering. Sign this petition if you think this hateful practice should be made illegal. ",
