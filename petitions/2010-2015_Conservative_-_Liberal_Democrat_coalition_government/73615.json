        "additional_details": "The city of Manchester rejected an elected mayor in a referendum two years ago. That was democracy.\r\nChancellor George Osborne's devolution deal for Greater Manchester insists on an elected mayor otherwise there will be no extra resources. That is NOT democracy.\r\nWe cannot allow this Government to ignore the people of Greater Manchester and over-rule their democratic decision.\r\nGreater Manchester\u2019s Association of Trades Union Councils and local MPs have put pressure on the government to consult the public. Senior Tory Graham Brady MP called for the mayoral question to be put to a vote. Bury North MP David Nuttall, whose constituency already rejected an elected mayor, also backed a referendum.\r\nBut George Osborne has said the \u2018talking is over\u2019 and intends to push ahead even if everyone doesn\u2019t agree on the issue of governance.\r\nSign this petition and show him that he HAS to listen to the people and HAS to accept their decision that they do NOT want an elected mayor.",
