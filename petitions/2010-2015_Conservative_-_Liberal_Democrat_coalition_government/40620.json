However a social worker or anyone with parental responsibility can prevent a child accessing services without a court order in some circumstances. It is also reliant on what contract is in place with the Local Authority.\r\nThe welfare of the child is paramount. So the law needs changing to ensure every child that is identified as in need, on protection plan, looked after or with a disability get automatic right to be heard. That no adult except the advocacy services themselves decide if it is viable and right for a child.\r\nThis to uphold the human rights articles for children to ensure their views are heard and promoted at every level.\r\n\r\n",
