        "additional_details": "after decades of criminals getting away with crimes and the justice system failing us at every opportunity I feel the time has come to re wright the law in Britain. we have lost faith in both the courts and probation service. there is no serious deterrent to crime anymore as every day you hear of criminals carrying out hideous acts but yet there victims families feeling let down by a justice system unfit for purpose. the death penalty needs to be brought back for terrorism, high treason and cold blooded murder. Other crimes should be dealt with as a warning not to break the law or face years in prison. the British people should be protected by the state and not expect the state to let us all down by laws that really have no affect in stopping criminals at all.",
