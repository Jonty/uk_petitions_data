It is currently more focused on the individual\u2019s relationship to society and less so on the political structures that govern that society. I personally spent 5 years of secondary school sitting in PSHE lessons that were an awkward mix of sex-ed, friendship advice and health and safety quizzes. Teach the various parties and their policies.\r\n\r\nHelp the future know what they are voting for, rather than just voting for a name or face on a screen.",
