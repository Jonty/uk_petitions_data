        "additional_details": "Many people have household waste that they do not have access to a van to dispose of it at a waste disposal site.  They enlist the help of a man with a van to take this waste to the recycling centres, however it has been noticed that van's have been turned away because they are classed as \"commercial\", even though this is local household waste.\r\n\r\nDue to the amount of \"fly tipping\" that goes on, I can only assume that the above is the reasoning behind it and the law needs to be changed to allow local people, who have too much household waste to take in their own car, to hire a man with a van to dispose of their household waste at recycling centres and not allocated commercial waste centres.\r\n\r\nI feel if this law is changed, that the amount of fly tipping will greatly decrease.\r\n\r\nPlease support the Man with Van to improve the environment by disposing peoples household waste at local recycling centres.",
