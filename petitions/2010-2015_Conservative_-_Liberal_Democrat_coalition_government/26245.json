        "additional_details": "Yet again, the tube drivers in London are showing themselves to be nothing more than greedy and selfish.  Currently, we are in a period of austerity, and the government needs to save money where it possibly can.  Tube drivers intend to strike on Boxing day because they have requested triple pay and a day in Lieu.  There are people in this country who have no choice but to work on Boxing Day, and do not receive enhanced pay, or bonuses for doing so.  Quite honestly, its shameful that the tube drivers are yet again getting away with striking over pay, and the country needs to unite against them to have these issues correctly debated.  At least a ban could be introduced to disallow striking on busy days or times of year.",
