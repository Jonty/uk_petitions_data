I have been ridiculed all my life for this and I think its time for a change, I would be very pleased if the government could broaden peoples knowledge about this disorder as it is not very well known. The focus should be aimed at young adults as they tend to be the ones who find it rather amusing. It is indeed a very hard disorder to live with and people should know more about it!",
