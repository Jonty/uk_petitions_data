We are hit by taxes from every direction. Those who work fund the lives of those who don't. More and more people are ending up out of work and we just hit those who do work harder. The government use Billions to fight wars around the globe which have no bearing on the security of the UK and send Billions away in foreign aid whilst we foot the bill and see our own suffering. Elderly who choose between heating or food in winter, The young brought up on run fown estates, brought up neglected and surrounded by drugs and crime. Lets get our own house in order before we provide for others. Our government, here to represent us, not the rest of the world!",
