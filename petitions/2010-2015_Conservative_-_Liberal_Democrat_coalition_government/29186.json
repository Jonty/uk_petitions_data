        "additional_details": "The freezing of the UK State Pension paid to Ex UK Residents living abroad, should be continued. These individuals are obviously wealthy enough to live outside the UK and do not contribute to the UK either through Taxes (in the form of personal taxation, VAT etc) or in being a Consumer and contributing to the UK economy whether it is to the Public Sector (the NHS for example) or the private sector (goods and services), by living in the UK. A rise to these individual's State Pension should not be awarded beyond which it was payable at, when they left the UK, which is the current rule, unless there is a \"Reciprocal Agreement\" in the Country where they have gone to to live. It is debateable in the current economic state of the UK if these Reciprocal Agreements should stand. ",
