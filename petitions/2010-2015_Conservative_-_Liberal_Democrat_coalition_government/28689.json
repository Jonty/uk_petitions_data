With the aim to deter and educate people about private and social responsibilities of reproducing whilst also raising awareness about over population.\r\nIn respect to our current society's economic, social and environmental problems this policy could have significant positive effects on the UK's well being.\r\nSimilar to the European Union's legal age for sexual activities and the UK age of consent at 16 years, the enforcement of the 'legal age of reproduction' could vary depending on the local authorities' social sensibilities;with considerations to cultural diversity.
