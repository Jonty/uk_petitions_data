        "additional_details": "We have a bad case of speeding cars and buses in our residential area, Fulbourne Road, E17. It's not just ordinary speeding , it's speeds in excess of 60 mph plus- it is being used like a racetrack . There are cars parked either side so should be 20 mph anyway but these cars drive so fast that residents are always getting their cars damaged , lots of hit and run cases, have to run off zebra crossings . People have witnessed loved ones almost run over and are worried for their children safety and pet owners concerned for their pets. The elderly in our road are also scared to go out as wouldn't stand a chance if crossing when one of these fast cars come along. ",
