        "additional_details": "I and many others like me have been stuck in a 1 bedroom housing association/council flat with 2 children and have been told by the local authority that I have absolutely no priority in being rehoused because I am not overcrowded by two bedrooms now I do not have a one bedroom HOUSE with a dining room which one could argue I could easily without a doubt change into a bedroom but, in a rather tiny 1 bedroom flat where the bedroom is barely 3m x 3.5m which you can imagine can barely fit 2 beds let alone the 3 I need for myself and my children, with absolutely no other storage or space solution. like many I was directed to house exchange, home swap & hit a brick wall with no hope for even being rehomed. I ask that the housing list be revised and that individual assessments be carried out as anyone would say that living with 2 children in a one bedroom flat should be given priority.",
