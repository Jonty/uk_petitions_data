Currently, someone has to help you, thereby it isn't a secret and your vote can be changed without you knowing. With a simple tactile/thermaform version made especially (but visually looking like the normal ballot paper) 250,000 blind people can vote as they please without relying on others to undertake it. This as it would look the same, the ballot paper would be understood at the count. All in all an exceedingly minor yet vital and necessary change.  It's 2014. Let's make a change! ",
