        "additional_details": "Government MUST Abolish 6mth Time Limit to Report DV under\"Common Assault\". NO Time Limit to Report Rape,one person's word against another's.DV Victims have Evidence.Takes 6mths to deal with Shock of being hit.Victims need time to gather Courage and Resources to Report Abusers to Police.When Victims finally do,they must NOT be told Offence is now Time Barred because Victim took too long,for reasons like:Fear; Young children;Financial dependence,etc.to Report their Abuser. Once Abusers KNOW he/she are not home free after 6mths,but Victims can come forward in Future, they will think HARD about striking them once, let alone establishing a History of Violence, causing Disability and Death.It's also ESSENTIAL DV has it's own Law,as Rape does.Rape has ALWAYS been called \"Rape\",not \"Common Assault\", DV must also always be called \"Domestic Abuse\",NOT \"Common Assault\".As Damage done by Rape is Equal to Damage done by DV, the Laws too MUST be Equal in EVERY way.\r\n",
