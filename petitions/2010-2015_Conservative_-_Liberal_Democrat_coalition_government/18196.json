As its to easy for them not to pay. They should be made to provide proof on a weekly/monthly  basis of their earnings and out goings. This would help prevent their tax returns being more in their favour. As they are basicly steeling from their child/children. To many owe thousands in arreas and get away with paying little or nothing. It has to change!!! ",
