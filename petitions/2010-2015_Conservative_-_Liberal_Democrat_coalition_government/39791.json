I ask the general public and others to please sign this petition which would enable the Government to bring back the Death Penalty for convicted child murderers. The law is too lenient for allowing these people to live, it should not be tolerated in any shape or form without the consequences of death for themselves. You the people know this is morally the correct option for such truly despicable crimes against our present and future generations of children.",
