You sign up, and the system allows you to pose questions that anyone else can answer, or answer questions coming from other users. It also allows you to post anonymous questions. But the format also lets users engage each other in running battles and arguments, and to gang up on each other. A user's account can quickly fill up with a stream of anonymous, hurtful messages that may or may not be coming from people you know.",
