        "additional_details": "this petition is  to make a law Ammendment  that if a person is medically disabled they should be  allowed to claim  the disability element of working tax credits because at the moment there are 2 types of disabled person one which is allowed  to claim  the disability element of the working tax credits   and the other type of disabled person is not  seen as a disabled person - and not allowed to claim this tax benefit  because they dont claim the DLA  benefit - even though other goverment departments  such as the health dept  and the DVLA  - see all disabled people as disabled people - but  in the  HMRC   dept   only see a person who claims   ( DLA )   as a valid disabled  person who  is allowed to claim financial help - through  the disability element of working tax credit\r\n\r\nso here is a clear case of disability discrimination where one disabled person get money and one doesnt  - its not fair and needs looking at by parliament  because this is clear discrimination\r\n",
