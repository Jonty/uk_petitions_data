        "additional_details": "We currently have MPs and Lords who have had a conviction, spent time in prison and then returned to their former position in Parliament.  This is ludicrous, especially if the conviction relates to circumstances in which they're open to commit the same criminal offence again.\r\n\r\nWe propose a lifetime ban for MPs or Lords who have broken the law and received a criminal conviction.  The ban should include loss of pension and exclusion from the \"hard times\" members fund.  This should serve as a deterrent from their colleagues doing the same thing.",
