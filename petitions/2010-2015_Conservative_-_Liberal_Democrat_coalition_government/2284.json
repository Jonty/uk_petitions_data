        "additional_details": "This petition asks that the house debate the notion that David Cameron should personally apologise to everyone with a disability that he has effectively lied about, end the shameful process of moving disabled and ill people onto JSA via an assessment that a house committee has described as 'flawed' and turn this assessment process over to British medical professionals, not a profit and target driven highest bidder.\r\n\r\nThis assessment process has resulted in much distress and many feel they cannot face it, or practical issues prevent them from doing so which are not taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron has quoted misleading figures on the results of these 'flawed' assessments, which anyone who looks slightly deeper should see is an agenda driven ideological move.\r\n\r\nI respectfully ask that the house debate these points and resolve this shameful situation.\r\n\r\n",
