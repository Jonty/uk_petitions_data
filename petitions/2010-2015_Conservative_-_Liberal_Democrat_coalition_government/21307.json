No one would appreciate if hunters went round capturing humans and using them for skin or food , so why should they do it to animals ? Its not nice seeing pictures of abused animals on the internet , its a revolting sight to see and shouldnt even be put up , on top of getting abused its almost embarassing for animals being exploited on the net.  One day animal cruelty needs to stop and animals to be treated the way they deserve ",
