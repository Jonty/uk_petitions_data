        "additional_details": "We are asking you to sign this petition to show your support for a very worthy cause. The area known as Lees Brook / Brook Farm has recently been earmarked for development. Many of the residents that know this area or live in the surrounding areas do not believe that any development should take place on Brook Farm Chaddesden. The proposal is for approx 300 houses to be built here with access directly on to a narrow section of Oregon way and another on to Tennessee Road a 200 yards from the school gate. We would lose the wildlife and the beautiful open space that the community loves and that many people use regularly. We, the undersigned, are concerned citizens who urge our leaders to act now to protect the open space named above, already earmarked as a proposed public open space. We want Derby City Council to say NO to any development on this land. ",
