This is not who we are. The sound political and financial reasons for putting these weapons aside are secondary to the need for us to become a more thoughtful, caring and enlightened society and to show that face to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nWe ask our government to end Britain\u2019s nuclear capability.\r\n",
