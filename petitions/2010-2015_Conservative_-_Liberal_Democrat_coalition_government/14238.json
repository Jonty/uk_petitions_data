        "additional_details": "Some Muslim groups have been calling for a separate student loans system that would not conflict with the rules of Sharia Law which dictate that taking out loans is forbidden.\r\n\r\nDue to the changes to the student loans system coming into force in 2012 students will pay back a higher amount than they would have under the previous system which matched the rate of inflation.\r\n\r\nI do not believe however that it is fair to implement this system of 'positive discrimination' that would see students of other religions paying back much more than their muslim peers.",
