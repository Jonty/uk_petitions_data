        "additional_details": "I propose the Department of Transport should increase the penalties imposed to drivers if caught using a hand held mobile device whilst in control of a vehicle. The offence should carry greater punishment i.e. \u00a3100 fines and 6 penalty points or alternatively a fine and an instant 1 month ban. Too many drivers flout the law on this placing unnecessary risks on the safety of cyclists, pedestrians, and other road users they encounter. It's time for change.",
