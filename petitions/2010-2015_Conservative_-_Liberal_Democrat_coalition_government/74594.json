        "additional_details": "I am from an area in Stevenage called Bedwell and I would like to start a petition to get speed bumps on Bedwell Cresent. This is a very busy road because it is used very regularly by people in a rush as a short cut from end of Stevenage to the other. The speed limit is 30mph but most motorists go much faster. There are two schools on this road and Fairlands Valley park so children are crossing this busy road every minute of every day. My little girl was hit and flew into air. She was very shook up and only bruised quite badly. My friend who lives on this road see the incident and could not believe my daughter survived. We are so lucky. My friend that witnessed this says that she sees an incident as serious as this or worse once a week. Speed bumps would slow traffic right down and save life's. It is unbelievable they are not already in place.",
