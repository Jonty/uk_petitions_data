I would like to promote non aggression treaties between Iran and Britain with possible extension of such an idea to other parties in Middle East so as to diffuse any future problems which only at the end of the day effects the common man in both countries in terms of human lives, jobs, living conditions, more expensive essentials ,and cost of living. If a country like Britain starts to make such gestures then by a domino effect other countries may also follow and hence centuries of war and 'cold war' may be replaced with centuries of peace.
