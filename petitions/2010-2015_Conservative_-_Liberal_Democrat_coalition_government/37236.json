During existing economic climate, unless time tables are not compromised, many run the risk of not being able to commute into London from outside the capital. I have first hand experience of commuting over 100 miles each way in just over an hour!\r\n\r\nTrain users have purchased houses, moved to get a better work life balance based on train availability, what guarantees are given to users? Train users should have more say and be able to get more involved when the Government make these decisions.\r\n\r\nLet us get more involved.",
