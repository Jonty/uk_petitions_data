        "additional_details": "The Jeremy Kyle Show regularly contains adult themes including threats of violence, barely hidden sexual references, much bleeping of swearing and general behavour which most of us would deem innapropriate for children. The programme airs between 9.25 and 10.25am every weekday morning allowing it to be witnessed by millions of pre-school children and others who are off school. During the school holidays all children can easily get access to it.I'm sure Jeremy Kyle would agree it is an adult programme which only adults should watch and therefore should not be screened before 9p.m.",
