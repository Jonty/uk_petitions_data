        "additional_details": "This petition is in response to the clear bias that BBC have shown towards the conflict in the middle east.\r\n\r\nThere is lack of impartiality in reporting Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza and for valuing Israeli lives above those of Palestinians.\r\n\r\nThe BBC has painted a picture of two sides as equal. The BBC failed to inform its audiences about the attacks carried by Israel on the people of Gaza.\r\n\r\nOn 8 July, after missile attacks on Gaza, BBC had reported on its web page, a biased article with the headline \u201cIsrael under renewed Hamas attack.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe article stated ,Palestinian militants have fired more rockets at Israeli cities.\r\n\r\nMany senior columnists have argued that there is a clear bias being shown by the BBC. As license payers we expect  fair, accurate coverage from our national TV channels. The people of UK deserve to know the truth.\r\n\r\nWe ask David Cameron & the government to raise this issue in parliament & take immediate action against the BBC to resolve this issue\r\n\r\n",
