        "additional_details": "Following the release a a recent game, Destiny, by the company Bungie, there has been considerable disquiet in respect of the ability to play aspects of the online game.\r\n\r\nEssentially, the company has not enabled part of the game to its customers who do not have sufficient online friends. Typically an online game will put random people together to play - this is called matchmaking.\r\n\r\nGiven that customers pay for this game, I'd like a parliamentary review on the legislation behind online gaming and a bill to ensure matchmaking modes have to be available for any part of a game that has been paid for.",
