About 1/3 is given as remission.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that all repeat criminals subsequently convicted of a similar crime should serve the current sentence as normal (with time off for remission) PLUS 1/3 of ALL previous sentences (no remission).\r\n\r\nThis makes repeat offending less and less attractive to those who do not like prison food.",
