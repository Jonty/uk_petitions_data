        "additional_details": "The Government should introduce measures to control the posting of inappropriate, culturally insulting and sometimes illegal content on Facebook, You-tube and other social media.\r\nMedia sites, such as Facebook, on which anyone can upload any content, share it with anyone so each time content is viewed it is spread to the readers subscribers which spreads the content like a virus.  Facebook may suspend such accounts but there is no further action taken against such individuals.\r\nThere is currently some very disturbing content on Facebook, posted by a UK citizen, concerning insults towards the Thai Royal family which is causing significant offence amongst the Thai community in both UK and Thailand.\r\nSign this petition so the government can recognise this issue to put in place tighter regulations and act against individuals who habitually post offending content on Facebook and other social media.\r\nEmail kaekaiyasit@gmail.com\r\n",
