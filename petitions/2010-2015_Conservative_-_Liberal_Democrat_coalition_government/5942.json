At the end when the results are announced the figures are never published of how many do not vote. The end figures only state the amount of votes each candidate receives. I believe there should be an option on the ballot which says 'None From Above'. This will provide clarity on how truly popular and legitimate our leaders are. This 'Party' will represent truly the non-voters in this country. ",
