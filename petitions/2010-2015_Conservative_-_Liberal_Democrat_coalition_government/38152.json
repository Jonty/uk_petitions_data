        "action": "Banned the growth of ragwort on all land to protect our livestock and countryside",
        "additional_details": "Ragwort is a very dangerous non native plant, its highly toxic to horses and other livestock, in addition it can make you ill and even kill humans. It must be removed in full otherwise anything left in the ground will grow into a new plant. Its so toxic you must wear protective gloves to handle it and when dried animals such as horses and livestock are more likely to digest it with often a negative end. It is not native to the UK and is spreading with alarming rates. Unless a total ban is introduced this highly toxic plant will increase in population leading to greater chances of animals and humans being effected. The only wasy is an outright ban on allowing the growth of it on your land, not just the current rules of not allowing it to spread onto neighboring land. Please support this petition.",
