        "additional_details": "Clegg has promised \u00a350 million pounds to summer schools, for pupils at risk of going off the rails. This project is aimed at pupils about to start secondary school in England. Clegg had linked this summers riots to educational failure. \u00a350 million will allow the scheme to run for 1 year and will provide extra support for 'disadvantaged' pupils. According to Clegg, it will help to make the transition into secondary school, however \u00a350 million pounds is a lot of money to  spend on a transition that many have made before successfully. I am not against the theory of the summer schools, I believe that the figures could be re-evaluated and the money could be used more effectively.   ",
