        "additional_details": "It is SAFER for cyclists to ride 2 abreast and it is legal to do so. This is not understood by most car drivers and results in abusive behaviour and a danger to cyclists.\r\n\r\nRule 163 of the Highway Code states: \"Give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as you  would when overtaking a car\"\r\n\r\nMotorists should give cyclists the same amount of room as a car when overtaking. The Highway Code advises cyclists to ride 2 abreast so that car users are forced to pass on the opposite side of the road. It also shortens the passing time for car drivers.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to promote a public information media campaign  to re-enforce the Highway Code.\r\n\r\nMake the roads safer. Save lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubject Explanation:\r\nhttp://ukcyclelaws.blogspot.co.uk/p/overtaking-cyclists.html\r\n\r\nHighway Code:\r\nhttp://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_069837\r\n\r\n",
