        "additional_details": "Too many young people are dying from knife (and gun) crime because other young people who have become socially marginalized have victimized them; we want Government to invest more in youth intervention projects that seek to reduce social marginalization amongst young people and reduce the risk of offending and gang affiliation. To date the Governments response has been to put forward plans to axe funds currently directed towards mentoring, volunteering, supplementary schooling and services for young people excluded from schools. If Government continues with its plans to cut funding and fails to address the escalating social and educational issues faced by marginalized youth then it is likely that we will see in the future more riots like those that occurred in 2011.\r\n",
