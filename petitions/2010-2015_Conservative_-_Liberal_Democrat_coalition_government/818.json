        "additional_details": "What I want the goverment to do is fund music courses in Primary and Secondary education by giving more money to invest in better equipment.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of Digital Music Production, I believe pupils who start to undertake courses at a young but reasonable age will gain a better understanding of technology and the evolution of music over the years and how music can and will advance over the years to come.\r\n\r\nI believe that if pupils get the chance to produce music through the digital recourses available to them such as Laptops, Music Software and Hardware. They will become more educated in how to use computers in a way which will help them create a career and inspire them to become more motivated through a medium which they enjoy and in some cases feel they can relate to the music they are producing.",
