Someone who has a learning disability and a few other lame excuses. Some of the people I see running for the bus then pulling out a free pass (and to rub salt in the wound WITH COMPANION)\r\nThis surly cannot be right. More and more people are abusing the loop holes and soon the subsidised travel will be lost to the real people who need it.",
