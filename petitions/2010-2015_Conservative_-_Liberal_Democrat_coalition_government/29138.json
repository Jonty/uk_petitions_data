        "additional_details": "We have no confidence in the Coalition, David Cameron or George Osborne. They have repeatedly demonstrated their refusal to listen & have reneged on many promises made in their Manifestos.\r\n\r\nThey are arrogantly pushing ahead with ill-advised & often dangerous reforms in Education, NHS, Welfare/Benefits & the Civil Service; all of which have considerable opposition from respected professionals & the public.\r\n\r\nThey are taking financial actions which are resulting in considerably worse fiscal conditions, fudging projected outcomes & refusing to take responsibility.\r\n\r\nThey have done little to force the Banking Industry to atone for its irresponsible actions & yet are actively pursuing a campaign of scape-goating the very weakest members of our society with little regard for the devastating effect their extreme actions will have on communities, families & children.\r\n\r\nThey have shown themselves to be incompetent & incapable of representing us & should therefore leave office immediately.",
