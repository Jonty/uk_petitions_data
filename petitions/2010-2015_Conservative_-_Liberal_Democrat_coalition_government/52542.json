        "action": "Ban Door To Door And Telephone Cold Calling",
        "additional_details": "We the people of Great Britain would like to petition the UK Government to place a ban on cold calling by both telephone and door to door.\r\n\r\nPeople across the UK regularly receive cold calls through a number of methods... door to door, telephone, text message etc from sales, marketing, PPi and many more. It is believed that a lot of people find this to be anti social and crime related to cold calling would appear to be on the rise, especially with the elderly, people with mental health issues, learning difficulties and people at risk.\r\n\r\nDoor to door cold calling can be unsettling for some people, eg people with disabilities or people suffering from Dementia and Alzheimer and telephone cold calling can often be a nuisance as opt out services such as TPS don't seem to stop callers from calling.\r\n\r\nCold calling has already been restricted in some areas of England by local councils but we would like to ask the Government to place a ban across all of the UK.",
