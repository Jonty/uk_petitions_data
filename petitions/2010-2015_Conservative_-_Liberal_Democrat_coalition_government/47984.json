        "additional_details": "For far too long motorists have been hit with high taxation. Fuel tax, road tax, tolls (dartford), company car tax, congestion charge and also council tax. Yet, none of this money seems to be spent repairing crumbling infrastructure. Our transport network is vital for people to get to work. We are tired of people sitting in offices making decisions about our roads when they have never even driven on them. Our roads are over capacity and crumbling with potholes, humps and just plain bad quality. I don't expect this from a private company and nor do I Del. our government. We pay for a service, it is your duty to keep our roads up to scratch. Furthermore, many non uk registered vehicles clog our highway system up, fill up in france because diesel is cheaper and then drive here free. a toll charge for entering UK should be implemented, this will pay for the repairs and improvements. Dangerous potholes haven taken lives. Get your wallet out Ozzy. We're bored of you tight ways now. ",
