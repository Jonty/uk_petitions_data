        "additional_details": "HGV are too cumbersome to be used on A roads in East Anglia in both directions.  The police do not uphold the law and they are allowed to congest narrow A roads. Their contents should be moved by rail as they do in Germany. They cause standstills everywhere, force smaller vehicles to cause accidents. Drivers are never accountable, they leave behind broken windscreens and smashed cars on a continual basis and car owners have to foot the bill. These roads were built for the horse and cart not for massive HGVs. Alternative arrangements must be made for the dreaded HGVs they are too large for our roads.",
