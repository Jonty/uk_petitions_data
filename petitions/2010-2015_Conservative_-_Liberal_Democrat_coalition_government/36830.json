        "additional_details": "A quick look at the internet demonstrates just how many people have been left high and dry by the antics of Warmfront (a Government-backed initiative).  Most of the people hoping to benefit from this much publicised Government-backed scheme are either elderly and/or vulnerable members of our society, often those without a voice.  Shoddy workmanship often means that the heating system is either inefficient or, even worse, does not work at all and necessitates a catalogue of expensive repairs.  This organisation are making millions by 'legally' targeting vulnerable people with cowboy methods of workmanship, incorrect installations (thus negating the manufacturer's guarantee) and then simply making themselves unaccountable when the inevitable complaints arise.
