Students, Seniors and now all Couples travelling together, qualify for discount but NOT single people who may actually rely on train travel more so to visit friends and family.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to include single people travelling alone by calling on those appropriate to introduce the same discount for single people travelling alone. We pay our taxes and NHS too!!",
