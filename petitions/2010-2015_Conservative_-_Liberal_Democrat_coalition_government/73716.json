        "additional_details": "Over the same weekend when European leaders linked arms in Paris against terror in Europe, increased atrocities by Boko Haram led to hundreds of murders in northern Nigeria. For 20 dead in France, read up to a reported 2,000 in Nigeria. Since 2005 the UN has adopted a 'responsibility to protect' threatened populations. In the absence of effective action by the Nigerian government, the UK must use its position as a Security Council member and its influence in the Commonwealth to demand that the UN fulfil this responsibility through action under its Charter.",
