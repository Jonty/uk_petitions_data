        "additional_details": "Sir, Ma'am, Ladies and Gentlemen. The Emergency Services and Armed Forces are one of the lowest paid public sector employees. Their jobs require them to work away from their homes and loved ones, whilst out of what little wage they receive on a monthly basis has to pay for public transport which could come be anything up to \u00a3300 per trip, this is disproportionate to what they actually earn. Therefore this petition is being put in place to give something back to these heroic men and women! Not only does this boost general morale among ALL of these forces, it will provide a safer environment to travel, will reduce the risk of fatalities due to fatigued drivers, be more environmentally friendly and finally it will increase revenue in the train and bus stations, hence boosting the economy. This was proven to work during a successful Olympic Games. Are AIM is 100,000 please assist and support worthy cause.\r\n\r\nKindest Regards\r\n\r\nServing Men and Women ",
