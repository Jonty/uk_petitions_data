Guess what? we're stuck with it now.\r\n\r\nJust look at our public utilities / energy: The bills are getting larger and larger and beginning to eat into our pockets deeper and deeper. Guess what? We're stuck with it now.\r\n\r\nWhat next Air? Roads? Oh wait...\r\n\r\nThe initial offer may be acceptable and sound lovely but you wait and see how things turn out 5/10 years down the line.\r\n\r\nLet me put it his way, if we knew that out trains and energy would have turned out like they did prior to the sell off; we would be up in arms and letting the government know that WE WANT A SAY!\r\n\r\nPublic roads belong to the public. Lets get that message to the pople that are sopposed to represent our interests!\r\n\r\nWe want a referendum on this decision!",
