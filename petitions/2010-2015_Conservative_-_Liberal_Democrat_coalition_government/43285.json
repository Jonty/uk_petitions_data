        "additional_details": "Barnet Council is steamrollering through a multi million pound outsourcing of local government services to companies such as Capita - against the wishes of residents and rate payers, who are being ignored.  They employ consultants unfamiliar with the area. Cornwall introduced a similar project which failed.  To whom are individual councillors who voted for One Barnet to go ahead responsible and who will pay when it all goes wrong.  We the undersigned ask the Government to stop 'One Barnet' now.",
