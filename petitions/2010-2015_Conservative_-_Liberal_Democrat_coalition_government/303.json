        "additional_details": "When anyone sets fire to a pile of garden waste, the result is smoke containing countless harmful particulates and toxins. Many of them are carcinogenic and all of them are harmful to air quality and the environment. Most people are not content with just setting fire to garden waste, but will add to the pollution of the environment by burning anything that they wish to dispose of, be it, plastic, rubber or painted wood. Bonfires are also a major cause of disputes between neighbours and we call upon the Government to control burning by private individuals and banning bonfires within 100 metres of a dwelling house.",
