        "additional_details": "It is clear that the increasing incidence of mass murder by rampaging killers  (Breivik, Moat etc) are driven by a desire for fame (albeit by those who do not understand or care about the difference between fame and infamy).\r\n\r\nTherefore it seems that the best approach is for such cases to be reported in a way that keeps the names and faces of such criminals out of the media.\r\n\r\nAlthough this could be achieved by a voluntary media code of conduct, it would be better if there were an international legal agreement. However, this may be difficult to achieve, certainly in the short to medium term, therefore we suggest that the UK should take a lead and set an example by acting unilaterally and putting in place laws to prevent these people being glorified by media coverage.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the proposal is to put in place laws to prevent the names and faces of those committing acts of this kind from being shown in the media. And make every effort to have this become an international agreement.",
