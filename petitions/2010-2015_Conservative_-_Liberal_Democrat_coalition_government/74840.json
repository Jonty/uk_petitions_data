        "additional_details": "Nestle should be removed as a national partner of the Change 4 Life initiative with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental start to a healthy life is to breastfeed your baby exclusively for at least 6 months.  There are many initiatives to support this target, such as the Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) and the International Code for Marketing of Milk Substitutes (the Code) http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/code_english.pdf. It is well documented the consistant violation of this code carried out by Nestle and their worldwide underhand practices.\r\nTheir connnection to a Health Promotion initiative, with nutrition at its core is completely contradictory.  Health Professional working within organistations towards BFI accreditation, or to maintain their accreditation are now reluctant to distribute the Change 4 life Breastfeeding leaflets due to their conncetion with Nestle and breaking of the Code.\r\nFor furthe info http://www.babymilkaction.org/nestlefree#evidence\r\n\r\n\r\n",
