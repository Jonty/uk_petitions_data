        "additional_details": "It seems impossible to extradite Abu Qatada due to concerns over the quality of evidence lilely to be used. My suggestion is that the Government creates the means to enable a proxy trial.\r\n\r\nThis would be a trial conducted here by the Jordanians (their rules of evidence and laws) - there would need to be an act of parliament to create a proxy zone inside but outside the UK.\r\n\r\nThis way he can be tried and extradited to serve his sentence (if proven guilty) and we can monitor the evidence and how it was obtained.",
