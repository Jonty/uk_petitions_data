        "additional_details": "The appallingly low turnout suffered by the PCC elections and by-elections in November 2012 highlight the how dreadful voter turnout has become. In some cases, turnout was as low as 12% for the PCC elections, with some polling stations receiving no voters at all over the course of the day.\r\n\r\nThis lack of voter turnout weakens democratic legitimacy, not just for government but across all of our elected posts. Low turnout reduces accountability  and highlights how uninterested in politics the electorate has become.This must change.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase legitimacy,accountability and ensure the survival of this country's democracy, turnout must increase. To do this, government must consider these options:\r\n-Introduce compulsory voting for all elections and votes, including referendums etc.\r\n-Introduce compulsory voting for general elections.\r\n-Step up efforts significantly to educate, inform and get the populace involved in politics, to drive up voter turnout.\r\n",
