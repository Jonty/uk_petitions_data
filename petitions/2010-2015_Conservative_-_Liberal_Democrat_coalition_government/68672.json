        "additional_details": "The UK is a world leader in tackling infertility but much more can and must be done to support men in this area.\r\n\r\n3.5 million people in the UK suffer from infertility and in half of cases men contribute to the reason why couples struggle to conceive.\r\n\r\nYet for many men, the subject is still taboo. This is not surprising given the limited support and inadequate treatment options offered.\r\n\r\nAttending a fertility clinic may currently lead to referrals for invasive treatments that carry risks, despite the fact that other effective treatments are being uncovered by researchers at UK universities.\r\n\r\nAll treatments that show promise need to be taken seriously and scientifically examined through clinical trials so that they can be made available to people who need them.\r\n\r\nThe government must take action to enable this. And it must do more to encourage an open dialogue and better support men. The UK can take the lead in tackling male infertility head-on to make fertility conceivable.",
