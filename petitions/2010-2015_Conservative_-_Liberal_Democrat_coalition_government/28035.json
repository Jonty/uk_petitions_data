        "additional_details": "If you drive a car you MUST have car insurance, its the law. Most of us would have it anyway but some would chose not to. Becasue it is mandatory though the insurance companies have us locked into a service we cannot do without and its extremely unfair they can charge us interest on monthly payments when premiums are up and into the thousands of pounds, for a service we must legally pay for. I want this process of paying interest on car insurance banned.",
