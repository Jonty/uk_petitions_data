        "additional_details": "Teachers provide a public service to educate our children, by undertaking strike action they are disrupting our children's educations. Strike Action by teachers often forces hard working and financially stretched parents to take time off work or find funding for additional child care. The affect on both businesses and family budgets is unacceptable, particularly in the current economic climate. Strike Action by teachers should therefore be banned",
