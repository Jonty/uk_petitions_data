For such mothers work should remain A CHOICE. If Cameron truly believes in the importance of family as he claims he does, then we should have the basic right to care for and influence our own children! Give us back this right and raise the age to at least secondary school. OUR YOUTH NEED US! LET PARENTS PARENT PROPERLY! ",
