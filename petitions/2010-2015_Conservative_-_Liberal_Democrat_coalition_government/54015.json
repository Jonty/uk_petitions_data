        "additional_details": "I call upon the government to make brownfield developments a legal priority; to halt all greenfield activity where brownfield sites are available, removing planning permission where applicable.\r\n\r\nI understand that development is necessary, but in all but the minority of cases it is being done on greenfield land as this is cheaper and easier, giving more profit to the developer and more development funding to the councils. Vast swathes of precious agricultural land are being built on while long-vacant or demolished industrial sites are unnecessarily left empty, and always will be while there are cheaper options.\r\n\r\nThis has to be done at government level as regional and local councils are biased towards larger funding incomes against environmental, agricultural and other issues.",
