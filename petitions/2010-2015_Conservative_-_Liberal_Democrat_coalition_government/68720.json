Those animals were here before us yet we are the ones destroying the nature and tier habitats! Those hopeless animals need our help! Let's stand up to the cruel people who for fun beat those animals up with bats and sticks! Did you know that some animals get electroshock  just because? Where is fairness? Where is justice? They can't defend themselves! I say let's make a change! They deserve freedom! They deserve love! Let's show them that there are humans who care about them in this heroic world! Sign this petition! Be a hero! This is important to make the world a better place for all! ",
