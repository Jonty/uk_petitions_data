        "additional_details": "This group has been created to gain support in Midlothian community's fight to have Robert Green, Da Vinci rapist, removed from Midlothian !\r\n\r\nGreens\u2019 new home is just six miles from Rosslyn Chapel, where he brutally raped a 19-year-old Dutch student in 2005. He was jailed for ten years after what a judge described as \u201cone of the worst cases of rape\u201d ever dealt with at the High Court.\r\n\r\nBizarrely Greens has now been rehoused within a small community which is rural and closely resembles the environment in which he subjected his victim to the most abhorrent crime. Greens is also not tagged during daytime, the very time of day in which he carried out his sick attack. Given he poses a high risk of re-offending due to the inability of agencies to properly manage him in Midlothian, we the Community believe it is only a matter of time before he strikes again!!\r\n\r\n",
