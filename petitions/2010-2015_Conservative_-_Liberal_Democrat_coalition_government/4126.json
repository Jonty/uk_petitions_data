        "additional_details": "This is a petition to start a debate about banning the discussion of the death penalty in the press.  Hideous crimes are highly emotive issues that are used by unscrupulous areas of the British press to stir up feelings of hatred and, under a veil of legitimacy, demand for the institutional murder of individuals whose right to life is enshrined in the protocols of European Convention on Human Rights and the legal framework in the UK that has been constructed to incorporate it.\r\nJust as acts of racial hatred, religious hatred and homophobic hatred are rightly prohibited by law so should any such discussion about state termination of lives as a crime of human being hatred.  By prohibiting all calls on criminals being executed, both for and against, a default public opinion may be formed of statutory human rights within the public mindset as well as within the law.\r\n",
