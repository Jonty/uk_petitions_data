This RAF Station contributed to the National War Effort in its own right.  This aerodrome's Wartime History has Not Been Addressed Properly or Protected From Past Development; this is an International Masterpiece, that Must be Preserved and Restored for future generations.  I want the Government to Start to Respect the 'Sacrifice Reminders' of Former RAF Aerodromes.     ",
