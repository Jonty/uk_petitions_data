It is obvious, therefore, that the UK would be better served by NOT being a member of this corrupt, unanswerable, monster\r\n\r\nA debate should be held to negotiate our exit from the European Union and use the monies we contribute to support OUR OWN COUNTRY instead of lining the pockets of faceless politicians\r\n\r\nThank you for reading and voting",
