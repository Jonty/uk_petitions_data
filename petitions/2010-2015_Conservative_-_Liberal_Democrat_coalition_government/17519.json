        "additional_details": "Previous to the \u00a3's  decimalisation in 1971 you could have coins in your pocket with the portraits of  five   British Monarchs. This provided continuity of the British way and purpose for all who used coins, and was very instructive for children. With the Queens permission (of course), coins could be produced for normal circulation with the portraits of her ancestors as well as her own. After all, coins have been produced featuring Charles and Diana and  the Queen Mother and with the English, Scots,  Welsh and Ulster heraldic arms. If  we want to keep the Monarchy in this country and are willing to take positive steps to do this then having these coins in circulation will provide some continuity and interest.",
