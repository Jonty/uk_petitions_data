        "additional_details": "I believe that we need to reform the way that dogs in this country are bred. The majority of breeders breed their pedegree dogs for cosmetic appearance only and do not care for the dogs health. I think that the government needs to create an independent committee to make sure that the breeding of dogs is controlled by not allowing dogs with a known condition, an apearance that will lead to a poor quality of life or at risk of genetic mutation to breed and fining or pressing charges against breeders who knowingly breed unhealthy dogs",
