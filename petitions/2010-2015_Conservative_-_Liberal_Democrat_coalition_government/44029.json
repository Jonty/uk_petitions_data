        "additional_details": "I say no to lower benefits for people who live in the north. I say you will not take into account the facts of cost of living in the countryside in the north of england. I believe this to be more expensive than living in the south cities. Cost of diesel per litre here is \u00a31.59 locally, fairness for all, not just widening the north south divide. Also we need more money to search for jobs, do shopping and basically live as we live further away from local ammenities. No lowering benefits for those in the north. ",
