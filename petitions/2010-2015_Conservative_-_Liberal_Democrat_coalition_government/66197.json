        "additional_details": "We call on the Home Secretary to allow Iryna Mynich entry to the UK.  Iryna is a 13 year old Ukrainian girl who came to Cornwall in 2012 for a recuperative health visit.  Iryna lives just outside the exclusion zone of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  Whilst here, mum was brutally murdered at home.  Iryna has no father, lives in poverty & is a carer for gran, 76, infirm & has cancer.  Gran\u2019s dying wish is that Iryna comes & lives with Heather & me.  Cornwall Council & Bodmin College have offered her a place.  The government says she MUST go to a private school, but ALL in Cornwall have rejected her as the Government says that she must also speak good English!  We are in a \u2018Catch 22\u2019.  We invited her to visit us whilst sorting the long term plan, after which I would return with her to Ukraine to care for her.  5 days before she was due to arrive here on her booked return ticket, her visa was REJECTED - apparently we would adopt her HERE in the UK in the space of these 6 months \u2013 impossible!",
