        "additional_details": "There is a UK wide problem of cats being poisoned by ant-freeze. It is not known if this is deliberate or accidental. Anti - freeze is enticing to cats as it has a sweet taste which they like. This petition is to get the Governmentt to pass a Bill in Parliament urging all manufacturers of anti - freeze to add a bittering agent to its products, so that it is not attractive to cats and other small animals. Only a teaspoon of anti-freeze is sufficient to be a fatal dose in a cat. The cat will suffer a very painful death.\r\n\r\nAdd a bittering agent to anti-freeze.",
