As long as human justice remains fallible, the risk of executing the innocent can never be eliminated\"\r\n\r\nIn 1988 a survey was conducted for the UN to determine the relation between the death penalty and homicide rates. This was then updated in 1996. It concluded:\r\n\r\n\"...research has failed to provide scientific proof that executions have a greater deterrent effect than life imprisonment. Such proof is unlikely to be forthcoming. The evidence as a whole still gives no positive support to the deterrent hypothesis.\"\r\n\r\nCapital Punishment therefore can be seen as revenge and not justice, and this has no place in our modern society.\r\n\r\nOn this basis we petition the government that no action is taken that could re-instate the death sentence.",
