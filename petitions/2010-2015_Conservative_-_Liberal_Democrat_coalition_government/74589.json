        "additional_details": "Alison Saunders put a young doctors career in jeopardy and caused him to be subject to death threats. Bringing a failed prosecution against him three days before she was due to give evidence to a parliamentary committee. This either demonstrates weakness in the face of pressure or poor judgment. Either way this is not what we would want to see from a Director of Public Prosecutions. Following a jury finding the doctor in question not guilty in less than 30 minutes, we demand she resigns from this important role.",
