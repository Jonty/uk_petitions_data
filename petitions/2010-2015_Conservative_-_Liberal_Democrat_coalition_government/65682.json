This so called '9 Dash line' encompasses the Spratley islands and Scarborough shaul as well as nearly 90% of the South China Sea which through history the Philippines and some other neighboring countries supported by evidence has held claim to.\r\n\r\nI am calling on China and the Chinese people to work towards a peaceful solution and engage with the Philippines and Filipino people. This is an issue of grave concern to the Filipino people based in the UK of which there are around 300,000 people. We are asking the British Government to raise the issue with the Chinese and hold a debate in Parliament over the rising tensions and concerns.",
