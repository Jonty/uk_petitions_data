        "additional_details": "The UK has more stringent laws on the treatment of farm animals than many other nations, in order to prevent undue cruelty.\r\n\r\nThis gives british farms a disadvantage in terms of production costs.\r\nIn order to encourage production within the UK, and to increase animal welfare worldwide, the laws governing treatment of animals within the UK should also be applied to the producers of any meat which is then imported into the UK.\r\nMeat produced in an improper manner should be banned from sale within our nation.\r\n\r\nThis measure would help to encourage the UK economy, while simultaneously improving animal welfare.",
