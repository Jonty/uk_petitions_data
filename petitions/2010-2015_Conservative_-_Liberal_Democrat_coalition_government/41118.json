Really?\r\n\r\nOn a nearly daily basis we hear of more Tax scandals, the scale of which make benefit fraud look like pocket money. Services are being cut, economic prosperity squashed, jobs lost, lives ruined.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Apple, Amazon, Starbucks, Vodafone, etc etc have made a mockery of British decency. They've made huge profits and paid a pitance in Tax, an estimate 3% on profit as opposed to the standard 26% any other business has to pay. How has this been allowed?\r\n\r\nWe want Britain to be business friendly but not a cash cow for corporations propped up by the tax payer. Equality and transparency. ",
