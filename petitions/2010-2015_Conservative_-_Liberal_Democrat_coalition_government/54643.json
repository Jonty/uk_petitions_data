        "additional_details": "The government has set new rules regarding term time holidays for school children. As of 1st September 2013 the government is going to fine all parents/guardians who take their children out of school during term time. This fine will be \u00a360 per child for each parent.\r\nThis law amends the 2007 law which allowed a leave of 10 days per child at the head teachers discretion, dependant on the individual child's attendance.\r\nThis new law should be abolished and returned to the existing law.\r\nChildren learn in many ways and holidays can help their education, it can teach things that cannot be taught in the classroom, it is not right that some parents will be fined because they cannot afford, or cannot get the time during school holidays to go on holiday.\r\nThe government should instead look into the extortionate prices that holiday companies and airlines charge during school holidays, as these prices will rise even further now.",
