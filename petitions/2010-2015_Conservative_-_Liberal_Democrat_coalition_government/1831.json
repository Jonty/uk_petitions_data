        "additional_details": "This is a petition to force the shadow chancellor to give an opposition budget in addition to that of the government. The economic future of this country is in doubt and unless voters are offered a clear outline of economic stance from our political parties we no longer have a say in our economic future. This alternative budget will show the strategy of both the government and its opposition. This will allow us to vote for our preferred budget at the next general election. A shadow budget would illustrate contrasts in the economic priorities of our political parties and increase transparency to voters. ",
