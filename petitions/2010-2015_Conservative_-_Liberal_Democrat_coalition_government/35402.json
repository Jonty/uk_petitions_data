        "additional_details": "The funeral for a service man in Coventry has been disrupted by an establishment refusing entry to serving military personnel.\r\nThe serving men concerned had entered for a short drink prior to attending the funeral and the reason for barring entry was purely on the basis of the mens military uniform.\r\nThe serving men and women of our armed forces represent the Crown and the ability to refuse entry on this basis insults our Nation state. It sends the incorrect message to those brave men and women who are sent to fight for our Nation. As a Country we should be seen to fully support our service personnel. The wearing of a military uniform by a serving member of our forces should be seen as a right ensconced in law and such a right should not be discriminated against.This law should be known as Thacker's law to compensate the memory of the family whose son gave his life for our country and whose shameful treatment has resulted in this petition being drafted.\r\n",
