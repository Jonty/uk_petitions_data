        "additional_details": "The abuse of Blue Badge Parking Bays is rife across the whole of the UK, for both on street and off street parking. There should be a law enforcing off street parking for Blue Badge Parking Bays, thus making it an offence to abuse these parking bays unless you display a Blue Badge. Companies like Tesco\u2019s and retail parks should be held responsible for upholding this enforcement. If they fail to comply then they should be fined for their failure in carrying out their responsibilities. Spot checks should be carried out by the authorities to ensure that companies are complying with the law.\r\nThis law should be a blanket across the UK, not just for England.\r\n",
