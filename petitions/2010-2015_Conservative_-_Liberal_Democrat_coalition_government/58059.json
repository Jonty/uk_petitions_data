        "additional_details": "With the news of 11% pay increase in 2015 for MP's while the rest of the public sector will increase 1%.\r\nIf they take this increase then the MP's expense MUST be CUT.\r\n\r\nOther public sector workers do not get these extravagant expenses.\r\n\r\nEven our armed forces have to pay their way. They get a pitiful fuel allowance (that has been cut over the last 3 years) if they live further from camp and subsidized food on camp. They rest they pay out of their wages.\r\n\r\nTheir expenses should not be paying for MP's to stay at luxury hotels or paying their heating bills.\r\nIf they must stay over in a hotel JUST like every other workforce it should be a budget hotel etc.\r\n\r\nIf we really are in it together then the MP's MUST show they are by cutting their expenses to the bare minimum.",
