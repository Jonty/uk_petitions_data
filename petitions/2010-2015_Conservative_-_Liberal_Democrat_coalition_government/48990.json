        "additional_details": "Irlen Syndrome can be a part of the problem for people who have Eye problems, Dyslexia, ADD/HD, Autism, Aspergers syndrome and Dyspraxia. Children are labelled within schools as lazy, lacking in motivation or having behavioural problems when in fact they have this condition that effects 12-15% of the population, however it is undiagnosed as it is not identified by standard visual and medical examinations or by educational assessments. The tests carried out cost in the region of \u00a3300 with the corrective lenses costing \u00a3100+ none of the treatment is currently funded by the NHS and for those whom need further Vision Therapy sessions it can run in to the thousands. What we are asking for is that the Government make this a recognised condition and means tested so that parents on low income can get the irrelevant treatment on the NHS. Today's children are tomorrows future and they deserve the right to learn",
