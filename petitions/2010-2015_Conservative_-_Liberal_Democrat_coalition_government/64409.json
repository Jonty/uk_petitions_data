        "additional_details": "It is time for local authorities to exert the power given to them by virtue of their localities. Warnings/penalties need to be issued to those who park illegally, park on verges, foot-ways and/or residential grounds, exceed national speed limits and of utmost concern, endanger the safety of residents, parents and children.\r\nParking on verges and foot-ways can cause many problems: obstructing vulnerable road users who use the verge/foot-way, obstructing road users entering/leaving properties, reducing visibility at junctions/pedestrian crossings, increasing the risk of vehicle/pedestrian accidents/casualties.\r\nWhilst prohibition is scarce, particular incidents of such parking may be considered dangerous and/or obstructive and/or may cause damage and constitute a criminal offence under numerous statutory provisions.\r\nPlease sign this petition to try and avoid the tragedy which is waiting to happen. Do not let a tragedy signify action.. Act now!",
