        "additional_details": "Currently the passport control waiting time for EU passport holders at Londons Heathrow airport can be over 2 hours at peak times, on average its around 1 hour at daily peak times.\r\n\r\nIt's totally unacceptable to arrive at passport control to find a long queue that is serviced by only 3 immigration officers, especially when there are desks for 10+ officers.\r\n\r\nThe UK border agency need to increase the amount of immigration officers they have, especially at daily peak times in order to reduce the waiting times.\r\n\r\nThis must be effecting the economy due to the fact it's putting business travellers off from travelling to the UK. Other busy airports around the world take pride in getting people through passport control in a swift but concise manner.",
