Thousands of families and working people have suffered due to the poorly administered scheme that makes little or no sense even to the people who work within HMRC.  The forms are lengthy and unnecessarily complicated.  This scheme was designed to help low income families but due to the overly complicated nature of the application process families have been told they must repay thousands due to blunders on HMRC's part and poor checking systems.  Families and working people are being squeezed from every angle, this overpayment fiasco is unacceptable and is costing the taxpayer even more in admin charges to chase debts that many will simply be unable to pay.  Write off all tax credits overpayment charges and review the entire system to avoid this shambles happening again.\r\n",
