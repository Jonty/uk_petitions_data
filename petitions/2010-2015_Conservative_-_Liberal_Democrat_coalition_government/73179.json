        "additional_details": "In 1981, actor Sir Ralph Richardson unveiled the statue of film star Charlie Chaplin in Leicester square.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2012 renovation of Leicester square the statue was removed.\r\n\r\nIn late 2013, the statue of beloved film star Charlie Chaplin was reinstated and relocated outside the Prince Charles Cinema (minus the plinth).\r\n\r\nA few months ago, the statue was defaced. Chaplin's trademark cane that the statue appeared to be leaning on was torn off.\r\n\r\nThis is not only a great piece of the Square's history but a wonderful memorial of a much loved icon that see's many tourists every day which now has a great many people disappointed at it's neglected state. It's only right that this statue should be repaired.\r\n",
