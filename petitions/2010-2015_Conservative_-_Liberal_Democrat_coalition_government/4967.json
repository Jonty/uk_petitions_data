        "additional_details": "The failure of the international climate change negotiations to agree on substantial and sufficient action to curb greenhouse gas emissions reflects difficult challenges creating a fair and equitable solution. We believe that the climate change framework known as Contraction and Convergence, proposed by the Global Commons Institute, which undeprins the UK Climate Change Act, should be made the government's objective for an international agreement. We note that this framework has widespread support, including that of the coalition government's partners, the Liberal Democrats, as well as the All Party Parliamentary Climate Change Group and the Environmental Audit Committee.",
