The report concluded that cannabis didn't act as a gateway drug and that it would be a good idea to decriminalise it. The government's response was that cannabis acts as a gateway drug and must therefore remain criminal.\r\n\r\nIt is a massive waste of money to commission reports if you are going to completely ignore the findings. Please cut costs by either not commissioning the reports in the first place or acting on their findings.",
