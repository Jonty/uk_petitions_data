As part of an effort to place \"shadow taxes\" throughout our economy parking control have been turned into a revenue producing means, not quite its accepted purpose. A centralized response by Government to reel in this madness is necessary via the following methods;\r\n\u2022 The guaranteed provision of free street parking in residential areas, free of additional council charges, to all homeowners in the United Kingdom (where such is viable) with all unused space turned into free general parking (rather than the current mass disused space it currently constitutes).\r\n\u2022 An immediate removal of all street side \u201cpay to park\u201d facilities in non-residential areas, all unnecessary double yellow lines (those not there for safety reasons) and the replacement of all this with simple free to park zones.",
