        "additional_details": "This is a petition requesting that Irvine Patnick be stripped of his knighthood. The former MP for Sheffield Hallam has been found to be one of the sources that were perpetuating lies about the Hillsborough disaster. Patnick's lies, printed in The Sun, have caused much distress to the families of the Hillsborough 96 and to the people of Liverpool. His conduct was unbefitting that of an MP, and we urge that his knighthood be removed for professional misconduct.",
