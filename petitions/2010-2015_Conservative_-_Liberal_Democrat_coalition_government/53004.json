        "additional_details": "The internet has grown to become the amazing tool it is today thanks to the freedom of information that it enables. If we choose to start building walls in the internet we only serve to divide its power and as such reduce its power. With a decent internet filter in place how would Edward Snowdon have gotten his message out? Do you think wikileaks would have been able to function? Do you think the protests in Egypt would have been as large? How about the Occupy movement? It\u2019s not that these things wouldn\u2019t have happened, but it\u2019s the free and open internet that has helped all of these movements develop.\r\n\r\nWe haven\u2019t even begun to realise the full potential of the Internet and already we\u2019re starting to shut it down, and that goes against the core tenets of every scientist that worked so hard to realise this idea. David Cameron wants our brightest minds working on this filter, but he won\u2019t get our brightest and best because they are the ones that understand this ideal. Stop Filtering.",
