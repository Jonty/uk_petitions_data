        "additional_details": "This petition is to force the Castle Point Borough Council to withdraw plans passed on 31 July 2012, to develop Benfleet Downs in any way until adequate and detailed discussions have taken place with the residents they failed to satisfactorily inform in accordance with their Statement of Community Involvement, which they breached by their own admission.\r\nConcealed within the planning application for development of the Hadleigh Olympic Mountain Bicycle Course were plans to construct 3.5m gravel tracks through largely unspoilt areas of natural countryside historically known as Benfleet Downs which is classified as a Special Site of Scientific Interest.\r\nThis development is heralded under the excuse of being \u201can Olympic Legacy\u201d. In reality the legacy will be further destruction of what little natural countryside exists in the area.\r\nBenfleet Downs Preservation Society [BDPS]\r\nwww.bdps66.wix.com/bdps\r\nemail: bdps@live.co.uk\r\n",
