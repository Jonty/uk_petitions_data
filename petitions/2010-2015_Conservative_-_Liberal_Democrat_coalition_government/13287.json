        "additional_details": "In light of the recent riots and subsequent sentences handed out to those found guilty of looting and associated crimes we demand that the inquiry into MP's fraudulant claiming of expenses is reopened. Any MP found guilty of looting the public purse, regardless of whether monies have been returned, should be put before the courts and subject to the same level of sentencing that our fellow citizens have suffered. We will not tolerate a two tier legal system where those in power are afforded leniency by the criminal justice system whilst those with the least power are shown none.",
