The Chancellor himself said at the select committee that luke warm food would not be penalised (http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/george-osborne-feels-the-heat-on-pasty-tax-and-cut-in-50p-rate-7593586.html).\r\n\r\nA North East based company like Greggs does not need this kind of punishment after surviving the recession and with the money it uses in the Greggs Foundation to help disadvantaged people.\r\n\r\nWe need growth in this country, not more obstacles to creating growth and taking money away from charitable foundations.\r\n\r\nPlease stop this tax Mr Osborne.",
