        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the European Court of Human Rights is interferring in the justice system of the UK. It shields common criminals from proper justice and ignores the needs of the common people. Therefore, the issue of power being surrendered to the ECHR from our own Judicary needs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nThink of the children that get raped and murdered by the sickest individuals, Imagine that is your child who is dead and that a court of liberal do-gooders says that he has to be protected at your cost. Sign if you agree.",
