By receiving this tax free shares, the employee gives up the right to sue their boss if they are mistreated or sacked unfairly.\r\n\r\nAn appalling policy, bordering with bribe and blackmail. We all need money, but we need our right, dignity and integrity more!\r\n\r\nThe Government should first of all apologise for such crass manipulation and secondly, give up any thoughts to have such a policy in place that will encourage even more discrimination , will destroy people's self esteem ",
