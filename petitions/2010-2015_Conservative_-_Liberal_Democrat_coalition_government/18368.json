        "action": "Remove the requirement to sit a trailer towing test",
        "additional_details": "Driving licences issued after 1997 no longer automatically include b+e towing entitlement. This is despite the fact that pre 1997 the standard driving test did not have a towing section.\r\nIf anything in recent years the driving test has become more difficult with the introduction of theory tests and changes to the practical test.\r\nThis issue should be addressed as it is causing problems for many charity/community organisations and employers where younger drivers are unable to tow trailers.\r\nFurthermore the points outlined above are also applicable for licence entitlement for category C&D.\r\nRepealing this law could also help to ease unemployment as there are jobs that require these licence catagories before a candidate will be considered for the position therefore preventing young people from getting these jobs.\r\nPlease support this petition and lets get this unjust law repealled once and for all.",
