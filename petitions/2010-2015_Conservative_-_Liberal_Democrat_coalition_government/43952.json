No need for lots of expensive signage \u2013 in fact you could probably clear a lot of street clutter. And motorists would see a saving in fuel costs and wear and tear, at the \"cost\" of an average of 90 seconds being added to their journeys.\r\n\r\nWe're seeing big progress around the country on 20mph limits \u2013 the London borough of Islington is likely to soon be followed by others \u2013 but we could make a big national leap and save a lot of campaigners' time and energy, and a significant number of lives, if we took an immediate step across England and Wales.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Source: http://v.gd/guardian)",
