        "additional_details": "Most people know of Katie Hopkins but for those that don't, she is a regular on Television and has appeared in such shows as 'The Apprentice' and 'I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here'. Yesterday (10.11.2014), Katie Hopkins tweeted the following: \"Palestinians busing knifing Israelis. 2 state solution my arse. Filthy Rodents burrowing beneath Israel. Time to restart the bombing campaign\". Most people I know have an opinion on the Israel/Palestine conflict including myself but there is no way I would express these opinions, firstly on social media, but secondly in such a derogatory way. I believe from these tweets that she is encouraging the murder of Palestinians. I don't believe that an apology is enough anymore (she has already apologized for comments following the 2013 Glasgow Helicopter crash).  She should be removed from TV and Twitter as she is nothing but a negative influence on the public and an embarrassment to the UK.",
