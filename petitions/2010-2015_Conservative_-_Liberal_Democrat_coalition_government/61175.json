        "additional_details": "With more and more online purchases being made than ever, there is a growing number of parcels never reaching their destination. Tracking and insurance simply raise the profits of the carrier but offer no extra care or security. Carriers have a duty of care that is lacking in many ways and until they can be held directly accountable for losses this will continue. Once a carrier has to pay for all loses, it will be in their interest to stop the criminal activities within their walls.",
