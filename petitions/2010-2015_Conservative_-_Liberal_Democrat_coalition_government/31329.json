However there is no punishment really, should the Parent With Care refuse access without due cause. Obviously there have to be safeguards for the child, however many mothers use this tactic as a power trip. I would like to see the PWC lose their maintenance should they deny resonable access repeatedly. The rights of fathers are continually overlooked and surely a financial penalty would be more suitable, as the courts are loath to do anything.",
