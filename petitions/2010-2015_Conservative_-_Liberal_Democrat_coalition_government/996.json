With all the red tape you cant build anything without traversing a bureaucratic nightmare, this means that many don't bother even trying. Then we are left with housing developers who build small homes emphasizing numbers of bedrooms etc with tiny windows little light and low quality materials. Instead of functional beautiful and pleasing homes. Therefore I would like a minimum standard for room and window sizes including ceiling height put in place for the whole of the UK . It would also be prudent to relax planning regulations and allow more interesting architecture .",
