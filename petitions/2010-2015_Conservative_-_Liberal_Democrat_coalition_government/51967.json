        "additional_details": "Bognor Regis born Formula 1 driver David Purley was given the George medal for his courage in trying to save the life of fellow driver Roger Williamson after his car overturned and caught fire in the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix. Footage shows his heroic efforts to save his friend and ensuing despair as he realised his efforts were in vain. We think his heroism should be recognised in his town of birth with a statue.",
