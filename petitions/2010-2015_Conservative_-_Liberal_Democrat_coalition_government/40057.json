        "additional_details": "Notts County Council has handed over \u00a30.9 million to Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club to help pay for a new scoreboard at Trent Bridge. Conservative councillors argue that this is justified because international matches there \"help boost the local economy\".  The money is not being loaned as \"the Club already has loans\"!  Cricket's - and international cricketers' -  wealth has increased dramatically in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe County Council has sold care homes for the elderly to private operators and dramatically reduced the opening hours of its libraries.  It has made swingeing cuts in provision and support for children with 'Special Educational Needs' as well as other vulnerable groups.  Council-subsidised rural bus services are now also under threat.\r\n\r\nThe government should act and make sure that Notts County Council immediately revokes its \"gift\" of \u00a3900,000 to a wealthy Cricket Club and spends that taxpayers' money in areas where there is far more pressing need.
