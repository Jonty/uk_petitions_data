        "additional_details": "As a tax-payer I am fed up of able-bodied, unemployed individuals receiving benefits without doing anything to earn it.\r\n\r\nOur environment is littered. Our hospitals are dirty and short-staffed. Our classrooms are over-crowded. Our elderly relatives are not being looked after properly. The list goes on.\r\n\r\nI suggest that jobseekers are to work a minimum of 20 hrs per week for their benefits.\r\n\r\nGenuine jobseekers will feel they are contributing to society. Scroungers will be made to actually do something worthwhile.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine what a fantastic country we could live in with extra classroom assistants, helpers in homes for the elderly, more school crossing people, countryside litter pickers, churchyards and canals cleaned, graffiti removed, etc?\r\n\r\nThere are almost 2.5m people out of work in UK & our economy isnt at its best, but that doesnt mean we should live in poor surroundings. There is nothing wrong in asking for a contibution to society in exchange for benefits!!!",
