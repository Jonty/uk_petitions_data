        "additional_details": "The government should legalise and license the use of any form of bow and arrows such as re-curve bows, crossbows, and compound bows for hunting. Hunting with the use of a bow or crossbow has been a traditional way of hunting for hundreds of years up until the 1960's when it was banned. Bows and crossbows are powerful enough to dispatch any game with one shot just like a firearm. It is a perfectly humane way of hunting. The legalisation of bow-hunting would not only revive the tradition but would also reduce the number of firearms. Licensing the use of bows for hunting would ensure that they are not used without proper knowledge of how to use them and training on how to use them.",
