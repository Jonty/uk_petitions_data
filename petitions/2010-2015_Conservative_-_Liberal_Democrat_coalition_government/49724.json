        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that plans to transfer all radio signals from FM and AM to Digital should be scrapped.\r\n\r\nPeople should be able to choose between the three options of FM, AM, and Digital Radio as they do now, and not be forced into listening to digital radio (or indeed no radio at all). The current system works fine as it is and does not need changing.\r\n\r\nWe have already witnessed several issues with the TV Digital switchover with many individuals now receiving a worse signal than they did with analogue, and were forced to buy a new digibox despite being happy with watching only 5 channels. We should not let the same happen with radio. If people are happy to listen to FM or AM radio, let them do this. Do not force them to switch to digital radio and experience a poor service.\r\n\r\n",
