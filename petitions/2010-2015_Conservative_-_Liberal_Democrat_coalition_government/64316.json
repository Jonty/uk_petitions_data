        "additional_details": "Shared Residence via court order declares that all parenting is shared and each parent has equal rights\r\nThe problem is there are no laws to say how financial support is shared. This can cause financial problems for the 'non-resident' parent which is a by-product of zero legal guidance.\r\nThis is becoming more common and society recognizes the way families and therefor children's lives can be complicated.\r\nGranting shared residence via court order alone simply isn't enough, and can leave separated parents in a confusing situation; which can become another matter of conflict. This creates more tension in the situation for the child concerned and is detrimental to them.\r\nI am asking that the Government acknowledge this important change within society and begins to work with families by creating laws to organize how any financial support ie benefits are split in suitable cases and making both parents exempt from CSA claims so long as the shared residence order is in place and enforced",
