        "additional_details": "I am utterly disgusted that Nick Cotton, famed for more than thirteen Eastenders come backs, has been written out of the soap after all these years. It's tragic to say the least. After years of public service, entertainment and non stop giving, our anti hero is being dropped without an adequate farewell.\r\n\r\nI'm pushing for a change in the storyline. Simply give Nick his last hurrah, let him die on screen, one last final exit. Why punish the millions of fans, who watch in constant suspense for his name to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe BBC, as a public body, should grant us this wish.\r\n\r\nPlease sign.\r\n\r\n",
