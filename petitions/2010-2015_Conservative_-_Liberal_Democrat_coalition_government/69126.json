        "additional_details": "Parental Alienation is a subtle manipulation of the children by one parent who, for their own ends, poisons the children\u2019s minds against the other parent. 24% of UK children have no contact with one of their parents and the primary cause is parental alienation by the resident parent. The alienated parent loses interest in life, and sometimes commits suicide. The rate of suicide among men is 3 times higher than among women, and parental alienation is a principal cause of this higher rate.\r\n\r\n To be dealt with medically, PAS has to be recognised officially as a medical \u2018disease\u2019 or a definable \u2018syndrome\u2019.\r\n\r\nIf any of the above sounds familiar or you know of a loving relationship that is being affected by PAS (Parental Lienation Syndrome) then PLEASE help us get heard by signing this e-petition, 100k signatures is a HUGE goal\r\n\r\nThe UK Government MUST recognise PAS as the life threatening issue that it is proven to be.",
