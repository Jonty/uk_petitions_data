Ban all taxpayer funding of tax avoiding companies. Public  funds should not be provided to tax-dodging companies, in the form of subsidies, outsourcing contracts, procurement contracts etc..). If they are not a British based company (or registered subsidiary) that pay their fair share of taxes, they mustn't get a penny from the government.\r\n\r\n2. A ban on tax avoidance schemes. A change to the tax code should be made to legislate that if a scheme is for the explicit purpose of avoiding tax, then it is a criminal activity.",
