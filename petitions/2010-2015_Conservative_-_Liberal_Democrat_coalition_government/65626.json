This would allow new blood, new ideas and new people to act as MP/MEPs and the public would get new people to vote for.\r\nAt the moment the people standing to be an MP in an election are the same old faces that we appear to have zero faith in. This would explain the very poor turnout at the Council and MEP election last week. ",
