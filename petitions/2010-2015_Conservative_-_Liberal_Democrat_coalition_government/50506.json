Our prisons are over run with 'lifers' which cost us, the tax payer, stupid amounts of money to keep them locked up, when this money could be better spent elsewhere. There are 316 rejections in e-petitions from people asking for the death penalty, does this not tell the government something? After the slaying of the woolwhich soldier, the Tia Sharpe murder, April Jones, the list is endless... Prison is a breeding ground for even more evil. Lets stop it now.",
