        "additional_details": "There are many negative environmental impacts of building a barrage across the Severn.\r\n\r\nHowever, whilst we rely so heavily on energy imports we are sacrificing our freedom as a nation, because of our addiction to energy.\r\n\r\nRussia recently shot down a plane full of civilians. But we still will have to import 56% of our coal from Russia. We are trapped in this cycle because we fail to develop our own domestic energy sources.\r\n\r\nWind and solar are growing. But we will need other sources.\r\n\r\nIs nuclear a good option? Or shall we stick with our Russian Coal?\r\n\r\nBuilding the Severn Barrage would create lots of jobs. Further develop our domestic engineering skill and increase our energy independence. It would also provide up to 15 GW of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThis project is of strategic importance and should be allowed to circumnavigate some of the more \"stubborn\" planning rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
