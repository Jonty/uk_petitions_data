        "additional_details": "As the Abbey Road Crossing is a totally unique crossing in the world, I think the simplistic and original look should be preserved. There are too many road markings, I think it could benefit from the removal of the ZIG ZAG lines reverting to the formerly straight lines.\r\n\r\nPeople are aware of the fans and tourists who are at the crossing everyday, the place is constantly monitored by CCTV, so there is no concern of parking on the crossing, that is common sense.\r\n\r\nThe crossing is a major tourist attraction and i think it should be preserved closer to the original format as possible.",
