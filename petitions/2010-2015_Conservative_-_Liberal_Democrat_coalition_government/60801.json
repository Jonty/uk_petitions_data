They can be swapped for the replica casts on display at that museum.\r\nAn online petition is particularly apt as a democratic method for determining the return of its most important heritage to the country where democracy originated.\r\nThe return of the marbles would give a boost to tourism for Greece at a time when it needs all the additional income it can earn.",
