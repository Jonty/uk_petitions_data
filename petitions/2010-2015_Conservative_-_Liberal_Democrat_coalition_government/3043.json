Worried about the increasing economic divide between north and south? Increasing northward mobility of people in higher education, and hopefully retaining them after college, will be an unequivocally positive step towards redressing the balance. That, or charge scots the 'overseas student' tuition rates in universities in the rest of the UK!",
