        "additional_details": "Should you get 13 or more penalty points on your driving licence, it will be suspended immediately and can only be reinstated once you have taken and passed the Extended Driving Test. You have demonstrated your inability to drive on the roads safely and within the laws of the Highway code.\r\n\r\nYou, as a driver, now need to demonstrate to the UK public that you know the Highway Code and you can handle a vehicle correctly.\r\n\r\nThere are no exceptions to this rule. A judge can state that the driver can still keep his licence, but cannot remove the requirement to pass an Extended Driving Test before being allowed to drive a vehicle again.",
