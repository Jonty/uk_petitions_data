        "additional_details": "Allow a minimum daily rest of 12 hours for HGV driver's.  An HGV driver can work up to 15 hours per day, with daily rest 9 hours per day.  While this may be OK for a tramper (sleeps in their cab) they only have to climb onto the bunk at the end of their shift.  A shift worker who travels to and from their home every day gets far less daily rest. If a shift worker commutes to work travelling 1 hour each way, they would reduce their daily rest to around 7 hours or less per day, therefore, reducing their sleep time even further.  The law allows a reduction in daily rest three times a week consecutively. Working long hours with very little sleep may cause a serious accident brought on by tiredness and fatigue.  Long term this may affect the health & safety of the HGV driver. They can be forced to work up to 15 hours whether they like it or not.  There should be a distinction between a shift worker who travels to and from work every day and a tramper who sleeps in his cab.\r\n\r\n",
