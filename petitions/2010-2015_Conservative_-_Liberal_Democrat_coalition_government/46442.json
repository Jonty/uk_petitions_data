The cheapest ticket in town is now \u00a345. Football is becoming a rich man's game, working away from the traditional working class roots.\r\nThe Bundesliga is an example i'd like to use.Tickets for German Champions, Dortmund, cost around \u00a312. The fans sing loudly throughout the match and are well behaved. I propose that the government should force the FA to cap ticket prices so man and boy can watch football together again.\r\n",
