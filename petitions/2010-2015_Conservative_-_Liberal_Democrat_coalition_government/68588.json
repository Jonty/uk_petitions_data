        "additional_details": "On getting married in July 2014 I was disappointed to discover that I have to pay \u00a360 to change my name by deed poll to a double barrelled name as I am not following traditional protocol as a married woman by taking my husbands name.\r\n\r\nPlease scrap this sexist and at least 300 year old rule that makes it difficult for modern women to uphold their values and equality and make it the same process as if I were taking my husbands name!\r\n\r\n**If I were to change my surname to my husbands, to change all of my legal documents eg driving license, passport, all I would have to do is send a copy of our marriage certificate to the agencies in question. However if I want to take on his surname and keep my own I must go through the normal and totally separate legal process that someone wanting to change their name entirely must go through which involves a physical appointment at my local town hall, paperwork and a fee of \u00a360!**",
