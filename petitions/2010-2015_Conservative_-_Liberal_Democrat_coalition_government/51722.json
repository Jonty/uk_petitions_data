        "additional_details": "The BBC is biased against Christianity and Judaism, often reporting news events in a way akin to Nazi propaganda.\r\n\r\nIncidence of violent Islamic extremism are reported in a way that suggests fear of Islam (ironically, 'Islamophobia'); the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been distorted to make Israel look bad; and reports on events relating to Christianity are consistently done in a negative way. For example, child abuse in the Catholic church is reported in such a way that it frames the Church rather than the individual priests involved. Whereas, the serious child abuse scandal at the BBC has been swept under the carpet.\r\n\r\nI believe that the general public should not be forced to pay a fee to fund an organisation as immoral and biased as the BBC, regardless of whether they watch BBC channels.",
