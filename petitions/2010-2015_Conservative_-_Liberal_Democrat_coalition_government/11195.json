        "additional_details": "The British people were left horrified by rioting and looting that took place in the UK recently. Youths and adults took part in destroying people\u2019s livelihood, homes and in some cases, their lives. The Prime Minister David Cameron, said in his own words the rioters would \u201cpay for what they have done\u201d however, a string of juvenile criminals have been allowed to return home.\r\n\r\nThese light sentences handed out have angered the public. All the criminals that took part in these riots should be punished heavily for their serious crimes, whether old or young.\r\n\r\nWe suggest longer months of strict community service to help re-build communities in as many ways as possible, this includes those under 18. Young criminals should be sentenced to \u2018boot camps\u2019 where they are taught discipline, responsibility and skills of life, which they seem to be lacking. We fear for our safety if these criminals are being let out so swiftly.\r\n",
