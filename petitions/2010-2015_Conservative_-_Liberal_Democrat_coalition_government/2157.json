On conviction, ALL \"Freemen's\" privileges should be withdrawn, ie., no access to television, radio, or any other forms of electronic entertainment. A newspaper should only be allowed once a week. By executing convicts, we are no better than they are. We obliged to keep them alive & healthy, but NO more.   ",
