        "additional_details": "Solar energy should not be subsidised by the government/taxpayer. These devices are only affordable to the people rich enough to have 25 square meters of South facing roof space and \u00a310k knocking around. These people are being effectively subsidised by the poorest people, in the smallest most energy inefficient homes in Britain, those who's bills and taxes are handed to the wealthy so they can have free energy. That is plain wrong and must stop. By all means, buy solar, but don't expect to sell surplus energy for any more than the commercial rate.",
