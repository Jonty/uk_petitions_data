        "additional_details": "Britain must block Turkey joining the European Union.\r\n\r\nIf Turkey were to join, the level of immigration to European States and to Britain could rise dramatically. Particularly illegal immigrants coming from Asia and people fleeing the middle east.\r\n\r\nThe EU is not a Eurasian Nations Association, it is a club for countries in the continent of Europe and the British Isles. We have close links with European states, Turkey doesn't.\r\n\r\nTurkey would bring nothing to the EU only exploit it. It would threaten our national security and the security of our allies on the continent.\r\n\r\nTurkey is an Arab/Asian country with no links to European culture. Moreover, Turkey's human rights record and animal rights record is appalling and is one of only a few countries where Bear Baiting continues.\r\n\r\nWe must retain that the EU is an \"exclusive club\" for the European countries and the two countries in the British Isles. We must block Turkey joining the European Union. ",
