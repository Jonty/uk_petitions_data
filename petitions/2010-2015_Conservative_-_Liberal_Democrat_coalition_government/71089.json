        "additional_details": "After seeing 3 lanes closed on the M1 for 2 guys with a cherry picker messing with a camera, myself and every other person who signs this e-petition feels that the Highways Agency should be using the closing of motorways more sensibly.\r\n Furthermore when undertaking roadworks should keep a minimum of 1 lane open (restricted or not) for traffic use unless immediate threat to life (changing a barrier, resurfacing and white line painting etc btw is not threat to life). They should be considerate and close half the lanes do the work then close the other half to finish the work. Reducing disruption and rubbish diversions.\r\n\r\nPlease Sign Everyone thank you ",
