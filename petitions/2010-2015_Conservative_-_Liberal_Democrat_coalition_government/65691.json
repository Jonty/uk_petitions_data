        "additional_details": "In the light of the growing obesity epidemic, we call on the Secretary of State for Health to review all links between the NHS and slimming clubs such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World.\r\n\r\nThose who sign this petition believe that both the eating habits and processed food products promoted by these companies are not conducive to health or sustained weight management.\r\n\r\nThe journey of millions of British people through the slimming industry has been one that has ultimately led them to food addiction, binge eating and increased weight gain. The focus of obese individuals should be on exercise and nutrition, not weight and low-calorie meal replacements.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the Department of Health:\r\n\r\n1. End all referral schemes to the slimming industry.\r\n\r\n2. Improve education on real food nutrition.\r\n\r\n3. Increase referral schemes to qualified personal trainers and nutritionists.\r\n",
