        "additional_details": "After two years wasted of my trying to secure an opportunity to present a wholly original \u00a3600 Billion economic stimulus package to the Prime Minister / Chancellor & despite me being promised by my local MP (the Minister for Europe; David Lidington) that once \"proof of concept\" was provided he would \"walk you in myself\" (proof given over twelve months ago), I am still awaiting said opportunity to ever eventuate.\r\n\r\nThus I, once again, politely request that my fiscal concept be given a fair hearing; in line with Mr. Cameron's request upon election that he was \"open to all suggestions, as we're all in this together!\"\r\n\r\nWith the aforesaid in mind & our economy now laying off soldiers, policemen, etc. I now ask that those who might be able to leverage this topic into the PM's view please do help me to do so.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
