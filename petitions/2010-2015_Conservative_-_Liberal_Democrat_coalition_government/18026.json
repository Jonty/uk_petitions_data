        "additional_details": "The Child Abandonment Law of 1861 section 27, has had wording changes over the years but the law is basically the same today. It states that it is an offence to abandon a child under the age of 2 and quite rightly so, the law is not under dispute.\r\nThis petition is asking for an amendment to be added to the law bringing it in line with most of Europe and the US.\r\nThe change would state that if a parent surrenders their baby, up to the age of, (to be decided), in a designated safe place then the parents would be free from prosecution. The safe places suggested could be NHS facilities, police or fire stations.\r\nWith this change much needed national policies and procedures would be put in place with regards to the foundling, parents of the foundling and subsequent adoption if required.\r\nThis petition is about saving the life of a baby and giving that baby a life, either by reunion or adoption, please give your support by signing this petition.\r\n",
