        "additional_details": "We shouldn't have to pay VAT on First Aid courses. Common first aid courses that are supplied by various suppliers such as the well known Red Cross & St John's Ambulance are not generally free but are necessary for certain careers, e.g Childcarer, nanny etc. They are therefore charged for and these courses are subject to VAT which is a disgrace. You cannot justify the addition of a 'consumption tax' to the learning of the ability to potentially save someone's life. Sign this petition now & demand that this is reviewed & hopefully stopped! ",
