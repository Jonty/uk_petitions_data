        "additional_details": "10/01/13 the Government announced the closure of HMP Isle of Wight, Camphill Site along with 6 other establishments.\r\n\r\nThe local community and economy will be directly effected by this closure.\r\n\r\nThe Government plans to open a new Titan prison with 2000 spaces. Titan prisons do not work; they are dangerous and fail to rehabilitate prisoners directly risking the protection of the public.\r\n\r\nThe government should debate the closure decisions and realise that local community prisons work; Titan prisons do not, and realise the damage these closures have done to the local economy.\r\nIt is our belief that Camphill should remain open doing the job it has done so well, for so long. The staff should be valued for the hard and demanding work they do on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nplease support us",
