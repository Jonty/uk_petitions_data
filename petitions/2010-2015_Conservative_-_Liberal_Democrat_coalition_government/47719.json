        "additional_details": "EU and UK law states  that fees for registered  care homes should be VAT exempt.  Because of a business loophole, some elderly  dementia residents are forced to pay VAT, at a rate of around \u00a3120 A WEEK, on top of their fees.  Neither  Government Ministers,  HMRC, the Parliamentary Ombudsman nor the businesses involved, can, or will, do anything about this unfair and immoral charge.  The injustice is exacerbated by the fact that Local Authorities can reclaim this VAT, on behalf of residents for whom they are paying,  but private individuals, who have had to sell their homes to pay for dementia care, can not reclaim VAT.   Please sign to enable this matter to be brought to open debate in Parliament.",
