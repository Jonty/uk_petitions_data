        "additional_details": "After a recent day trip to a beach with my two young children, I was surprised at the amount of cigarette ends decorating their sand castles. Despite signs requesting \"no butts on the beach\" I was constantly knocking them from my 2 year olds hands. The cigarette smoke constantly drifting our way was also very unpleasant and unhealthy! Obviously another important issue is that the never ending cigarette ends are bad for the environment too, not at all nice for the local wildlife.\r\n\r\nI believe Britain's Beaches should be smoke free zones, cleaner air, cleaner sand.",
