Everyone knows the risk so It should be a matter of choice weather we implement this. Not wearing a seat belt only harms the person who doesn't wear it no one else. I agree it should be a fine for failure for adults to not put them on children, however we have an informed decision to make. the role of government should be to put out true factual information not to force upon the citizens of this country what we can and cannot do.
