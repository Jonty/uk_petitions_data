It is not only the person at the head of a Company that causes it to be successful, it is the whole Company including all its employees. I suggest that whatever the level of remuneration is applied to the head or heads of the Company, the same amount in terms of the percentage increase of the person's basic salary it represents should, by law, be applied to every employee in the Company. This would automatically limit the amount to what the Company can afford.",
