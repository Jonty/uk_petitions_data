        "additional_details": "Ofqual have announced that from September 2013, A-Level students will undergo a linear exam system. This petition requests that the government retracts their proposal.\r\n\r\nLinear exams would be more of a memory test than an actual test of ability/knowledge. Modular exams with a fair number of resits would give students the chance to perform to the best of their ability without the stress of having a congested exam timetable as the current plans would ensue.\r\n\r\nThe role of education is to give students the opportunity to achieve their best, if you can understand the harm that these change will inflict, then please support young people across the UK by signing below.",
