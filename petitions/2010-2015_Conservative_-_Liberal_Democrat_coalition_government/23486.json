        "additional_details": "We are distressed by the trend emerging of small departments in Humanities faculties closing to preserve funding for larger departments. We consider this BIS's responsibility, as it is their attitude promoting science and skills above all else which has led to it. We cite as evidence the predominance of science and skills organisations on BIS\u2019s list of partners.\r\nWe consider focusing on science to be a false economy, as Humanities graduates give just as much back to the future economy as the government- funded work of a lab. We would point out that a university is a centre for thought and research, not a factory for future taxpayers. While Humanities degrees may not offer the most direct path to a career, they teach core skills without which nothing can be achieved to a high standard. If small departments close we will lose the specialisation and expertise for which Britain has become famed. It is the Department\u2019s job to stop this illogical focus on the purely technical.\r\n",
