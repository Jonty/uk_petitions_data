        "additional_details": "This petition is to reduce the Drink Drive Alcohol Limit (Blood Alcohol Concentration) to fall in line with recent legislation changes in Scotland and the majority of European Countries who have a lower drink drive alcohol limit than the UK.\r\n\r\nThe current legal drink drive limit in England, Wales and Northern Ireland is 35 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland (from 5 December 2014) the legal drink drive limit is lower at 22 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.\r\n\r\nThe UK has the joint highest drink drive limit in Europe. In 2012, there were 230 deaths due to drink driving.  Drivers with even small amounts of alcohol  are at least three times more likely to die in a road traffic collision that those with zero alcohol in their blood.\r\n\r\nEven small amounts of alcohol effect drivers reaction times, judgment and co-ordination so drivers must make it zero when driving.",
