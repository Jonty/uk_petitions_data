These people have, through their own selfish actions, forfeited their place in our democratic society.  Therefore, the liberal attitude to these criminals and the incessant need to make sure their welfare and well being is paramount, must cease.  We must take heed of other countries in the civilised world who only give basic rations, after all, how are computer games, snooker tables, gym equipment, televisions and dvd players going to educate and rehabillitate?\r\n\r\n",
