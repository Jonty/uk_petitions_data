Society needs and wants the NHS. Privatisation is not an option, doctors would/may concentrate too much on the money aspect of people's health rather than the actual caring aspect. There is an unequal distribution of 'Wealth' within society please do not let it be the same for 'Health'. Equal opportunities for everyone to receive health care, Please leave our NHS alone.  We do not want a \"No Wealth No Health\" scenario thank you.",
