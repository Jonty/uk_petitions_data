From simple planning officers taking bribes for building permission to those in parliament claiming fraudulent expenses and not to mention those bosses of the BBC who allowed Jimmy Savile to molest children. However we the public can change this by asking everyone paid from the public purse to be subject to a criminal records bureau check like most privately employed staff these days are.\r\nAll that have Convictions for serious offences such as fraud, theft, child abuse and violent crime should be banned from applying for any job paid for by the public purse",
