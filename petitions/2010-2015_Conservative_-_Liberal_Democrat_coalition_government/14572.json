        "additional_details": "Drug dealing, prostitution, muggings, tax evasion and many more crimes are all due to the fact that we still use hard cash. Switching to bank cards would cripple crime bosses, save paper and reduce the costs of creating coins and notes. It is inevitable that money will go digital, and the introduction of random number generators mean that online banking is secure: the technology is here, so why not take the opportunity to hit crime hard? We the undersigned petition the government to discuss a transition from hard cash to bank cards. ",
