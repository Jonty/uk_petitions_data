        "additional_details": "As we all know the Government predominantly uses's motorists as a cash cow, whilst there is little one can do about this, I would like to propose at the very least that the 12 point 'totting' up is removed from driving licences as its almost impossible not to get caught speeding several times within the four year limit. As removal of a driving licence from most people can result in destroyed careers, loss of income etc for the simple fact of doing a couple of miles over the speed limit. Motorists should not be made to feel like common criminals.",
