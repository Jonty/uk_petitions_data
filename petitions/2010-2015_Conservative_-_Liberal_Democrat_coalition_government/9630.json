        "additional_details": "Mr Jahan is the gentleman who tragically lost his son in the rioting. Just hours after this devastating news, he came out on national TV and called for calm with a heartfelt, measured and powerful speech which many feel prevented futher rioting. The death of the 3 boys in Birmingham, could have easily worsened the riots and made them about race and religon instead of just mindless thuggery. This speech achieved more at the time than the government or police could have. The government shold recognise this man with honours for services to national peace and order.",
