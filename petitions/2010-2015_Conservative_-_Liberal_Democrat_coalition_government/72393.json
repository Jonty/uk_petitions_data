        "additional_details": "As a passionate Welsh man I personally think that the cross of Saint David should be represented on the union flag of Great Britain. As the flag of Saint David is the only patron saint not represented on the union flag. As a United Kingdom it should only be fair and that Wales and Saint David should also be represented on the union flag. I want the government to explore all possibilities of adding the flag of Saint David onto the union flag.",
