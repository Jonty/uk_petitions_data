        "additional_details": "At present, adulterers can stake a claim to the savings and property of their ex spouse, which represents a considerable injustice.   They have made a choice to leave the marital home and live with someone else, leaving their spouse without the financial contribution to the running of the home which they formerly had (something that can lead to considerable financial difficulty), and by their actions they cause emotional distress and even psychological harm. That they should be able to claim part of that person's savings/property when it is their own actions which have brought about the separation adds insult to injury and should be disalllowed.  Instead, all people found to have committed adultery during a divorce proceeding should be forced to make financial contributions to their ex spouse as compensation for the money they have lost as a result of the adulterer's infidelity, which would otherwise have been joint income.
