        "additional_details": "This petition is to request a \u00a330 cap on prices for away tickets in the Premier League.\r\n\r\nAway support is one of the biggest contributors to a good atmosphere, without it there is no back and forth between the two sets of supporters. There's no question that more than half of the noise that the fans make is fed by the away support.\r\n\r\nRecently Arsenal announced the prices for the visit of Manchester City; an extortionate \u00a362. More than double what West Brom & Sunderland fans were charged. Add to this the cost of travel to London and you're talking over \u00a3200 for ONE game.\r\n\r\nThis and other prices are in danger of ruining the popularity of the premier league amongst local support, whilst removing the atmosphere at games.\r\n\r\nWe need to cap prices to keep the fans coming to games and I don't think \u00a330 is an unreasonable price to ask.\r\n\r\nWe also need to be aware that this does not give clubs the right to increase home ticket prices to compensate, as that's just counter intuitive.",
