        "additional_details": "I wish to petition the Ministry of Defence to make sure that Waddington International Air Show 2016 takes place, is safe and secure and does NOT get permanently axed.\r\n\r\nFirst, the air show generates, in the region of \u00a312 million to Lincolnshire economy. If this is lost, it would have a negative knock-on effect on local businesses and people that rely heavily on trade when this important event is taking place.\r\n\r\nThe image of Lincolnshire would be tarnished if one of the most important events is cancelled forever.\r\n\r\nWhoever signs this petition wants the Conservative Government's cast iron guarantee that the Waddington International Air Show 2016 takes place!",
