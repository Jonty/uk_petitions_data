        "additional_details": "As the ways we have jobs in the UK is changing from the predominantly full time jobs to part time jobs.  Income Tax should be adapted to follow this trend:  No matter how many part time jobs you have (to make ends pay),  you pay the full basic tax of 20% on each job.  Reading Gov.uk it says you will get a 2nd Tax code for the other job, but you still pay this 20%.\r\n\r\nI suggest that until your part time jobs total \u00a310,000 you should pay no other income tax. You are already paying 20% Income tax",
