Advertising 'bet \u00a35 and get \u00a330 free' etc is completely irresponsible and not unlike a drug dealer on a street corner offering free samples of heroin. We wouldn't accept that in our neighbourhood so why accept it elsewhere! Gambling is an insidious and destructive illness which can rip families apart. By offering these bonuses online gambling companies are essentially trying to get their hooks into the vulnerable and targeting the weaker willed of society. As much as I would like to it is completely unrealistic to stop gambling in the uk. However I don't think its unrealistic to say that these bonuses are a poison on society and if you want to bet then you bet what you have earned not what you are given supposedly free from the very people who want to take every penny you have.
