        "action": "Stop solar farms being built on green-field sites",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to introduce policy legislation to STOP Solar farm developments on green-field sites. The new \"Planning Practice Guidance for Renewable and Low Carbon Energy\"introduced in August 2013 has done little to stop inappropriate development of green-field sites. Detailed policy legislation must be introduced to provide regulations and restrictions on solar farm developments.  Solar farm developments should instead be sited on brown field, industrial sites and disused airfields. Our countryside must not be allowed to be taken over by industrial solar power plants, which have mistakenly been termed as 'farms'.",
