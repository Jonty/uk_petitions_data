        "additional_details": "I petition the government to bring about legislation that sees all taxes levied be a percentage of an individual's earnings. E.g. at present, low eaners paying road tax pay 50% of a weekly wage to tax their cars. Council tax can be as much as 10% of yearly take home pay. If these percentages are deemed reasonable for a poor person to pay, surely, on the grounds of equality, they should also be reasonable for a more well off person to pay. Also, fines should be calculated as a percentage too. That way everyone is affected to the same degree.",
