Being excused from the summons may only be requested in exceptional circumstances.\r\nMany people are unable, primarily due to other commitments, to attend the Jury Summons. There are other reasons people may not wish to attend court, including disbelief in the system.\r\nRegardless of the personal views, Jury Duty should be made optional as forcing this upon people is removing their right to choose NOT to attend.",
