This time, in a scenically beautiful part of the region, close to the communities of Torthorwald, Hightae and Lochmaben - a region that is already overcrowded with wind turbines.\r\n\r\nWe would ask that the planning application is refused on the strength of local concerns, proximity to villages and towns and the impact on local scenic value as well as local conservation and migratory birds which inhabit the nearby lochs.
