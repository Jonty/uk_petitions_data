How many have been ignored? As a UK Citizen and Voter - I would like to know how to table a vote of NO CONFIDENCE in the current government.\r\n\r\nTake one significant point to start 'Upholding our own values abroad' - so it's our own values that allow us to give \u00a310bn per year in foreign aid to corrupt governments and those capable of looking after their own people, yet we allow over 4 million UK children live below the poverty line?",
