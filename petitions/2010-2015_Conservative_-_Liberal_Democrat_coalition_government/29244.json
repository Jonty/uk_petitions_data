Presently registered keepers of vehicles are allowed to nominate the drivers when their vehicles were caught speeding by speed cameras.  This system is open to wide abuse, as a registered keeper (including a fleet manager) can put forward the name of the driver that can be safely awarded penalty points that will not result in the driver liable be automatically disqualified by the penalty points totting up system.",
