        "additional_details": "On 3rd January 2012, the London Low Emission Zone will be extended to cover all Transit sized vans more than 10 years old, including camper vans, ambulances, recovery vehicles, buses, 4x4s, pick ups and courier vans. Over 300,000 vehicles in London and the South will either require expensive modification, or will have to stay out of the Greater London area. Vehicles which do not comply will be charged \u00a3100/day to enter. In the middle of a recession, this is absurd, and there is no need to introduce this extension under EU law until 2018 in any case. We, the undersigned, request that the government amend the Greater London Authority Act 1999, assert the sovereignty of Parliament and protect van drivers from this unfair tax. ",
