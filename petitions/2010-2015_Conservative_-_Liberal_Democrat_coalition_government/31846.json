This kit has a major flaw, as NOT representing The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the colours of the Union Jack, dating back over 200 years. We the undersigned, request the following to be corrected, before we become a laughing stock.\r\n1) The traditional colours are in place on all Team GB kits (ie. the Union Jack as we know it), That's our red, white & blue Union Jack\r\n2) The Union Jack is correctly presented on the Team GB kits (not the incorrect positioning/layout of part of our flag).",
