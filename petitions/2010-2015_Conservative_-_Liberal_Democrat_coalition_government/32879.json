        "action": "Promoting The Deep Space Disposal Of Nuclear Waste",
        "additional_details": "After many decades of space probes and other space vehicles we are surely now in a position to seriously consider the disposal of nuclear waste into deep space. We do not believe that alternative energy regimes can meet energy demands nor be acceptable in form to those living / working nearby - this is a proposal firmly in favour of nuclear power but with a new imaginative approach to waste disposal.\r\n\r\nThe safe disposal / storage of nuclear waste in underground sites or by dumping at sea is fraught with very serious and permanent problems and concerns but still is of great expense.\r\n\r\nThe safe ejection of nuclear waste into deep space is now a real possibility with many decades of space engineering reliability and safety behind it and with no ongoing concerns.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition if you would like the government to start to seriously discuss this very important issue and give British industry a chance to develop new system ideas to meet deep space disposal requirements.",
