They have made mistakes frequently.\r\n\r\nMost recently they sent me a letter saying I owe them nearly \u00a31,000, which is wrong.\r\n\r\nThey said they had a computer mess-up and since then, for the last 3 months, I have received different bills. Every time I call them, I have to wait for a very long time. To make it worse, when in the end I get hold of someone, it is always a different person and we had to go through everything again.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I have formally complained via email, since when I called them, no one answered for nearly one hour.\r\n\r\nThis is a shameful company, which makes you depressed.
