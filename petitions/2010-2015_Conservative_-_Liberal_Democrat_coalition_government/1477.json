        "additional_details": "Around the UK many local authorities still operate under a 2 tier local government system - if you include Parish its 3.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned think that government should legislate to remove all '2 tier' authorities leaving every area as a unitary Authority (Leaving Parish level Councils untouched as the only paid position is usually a clerk).  This would save thousands in Councillors expenses and in overlap of Council officer duties, it would also simplify for residents who does what - for example Planning and Highways would sit within the same council.",
