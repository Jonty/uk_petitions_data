        "additional_details": "Glue traps are a cruel method of dealing with mice and rats. A glue trap is a peice of cardboard with very strong glue on  it, and when a rat or mouse is caught in it they suffer a long, painful death. It is horrific, and it scares the animal so much they start to chew off their own limbs in an effort to escape the trap.\r\nThere are other traps available that are humane and do not hurt the animal, like live catch bait cages. These should be more easily available.\r\n\r\nGlue Traps are inhumane, and a a cruel way of dealing with pests. Ban them, and make Britain a more animal friendly place.",
