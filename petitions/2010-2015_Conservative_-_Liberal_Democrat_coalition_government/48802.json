        "additional_details": "In the light of the stabbing of an Everton fan today, we ask the Governemnt to consider requiring every club to install metal detectors at the gates.\r\nFootball is a family sport, often bonding family members in spite of team allegiance. We cannot allow the small number of \"fans\" to turn the grounds into fighting rings. Many pubs and clubs have metal detectors on their entrances, and figures show this has reduced knife crime. Let it work for football grounds too.",
