Yet we pay our MPs and ministers a mere pittance to govern the country. Surely logic dictates that if we pay our MPs and ministers a fair amount in millions with bonuses for positive results, we will attract the best talent into government and all our problems will be solved. MPs need to award themselves a fitting pay rise.",
