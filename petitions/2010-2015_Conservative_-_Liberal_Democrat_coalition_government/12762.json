        "additional_details": "It is my belief that the Government has a responsibility to increase awareness of ATAXIA at a mainstream level. At present, very few people have even heard of Ataxia (and generally they are Medical Professionals). Mass exposure would go a long way in generating the much needed interest to develop control of this evil affliction.\r\n\r\n\r\nATAXIA is one of the worst conditions that can affect anyone. It is Rare, Neurological, incurable, untreatable, life-limiting and inexorable in its progression. Unfortunately, we don't know enough about it to do much about it. Awareness of this terrible affliction is the primary key to making any remote inroads towards control/cure.\r\n\r\nBy signing this e-petition or visiting www.ataxia.org.uk you are making an enormous contribution towards the satisfactory conclusion of a most arduous and noble medical endeavour.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks and keep smiling :)\r\n",
