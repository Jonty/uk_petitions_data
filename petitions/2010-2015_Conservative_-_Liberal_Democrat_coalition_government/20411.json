The scheme proved to be a success in its original form, and much of the planning and infrastructure will still be in place, and would be relatively simple to resurrect.\r\nSurely the revenue from VAT made this scheme at worst revenue neutral for the government, and at best profitable. With the increase in VAT the benefits of such a scheme for the government and the country would only have improved.",
