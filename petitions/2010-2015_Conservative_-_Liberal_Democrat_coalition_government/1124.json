        "additional_details": "Is the licence fee sustanable in this day and age, as we all have less money to spend, the likelyhood of the licence fee being raised is unlikely.So less money for the BBC so spend. Would it not be better to bite the bullet and let it take in advertising.\r\n\r\nIf the bbc had no licence fee then it would be forced to be accounable to its audience, instead of acting like the MP's did with expences, and throwing cash around as if you could litteraly pick it from trees. I mean 3 million on car allowances, 13 milloin on taxis, and the purchase of another x factor for 22 million before you pay for procuction.\r\n\r\nAnd dont get me started on the sports coverage may i just mention cricket, F1, Boxing, and Darts all gone.\r\n\r\nBasicly if you want to get the TV licence stopped then please vote",
