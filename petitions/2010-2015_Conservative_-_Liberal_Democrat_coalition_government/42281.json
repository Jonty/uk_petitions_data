        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, are of the opinion that in the Israel/Palestine Argument, that a 3 state solution may alleviate the issue. Whilst having north Israel designated as the state of Israel with its capital at Tel Aviv, the Palestinians can take the south of Israel with their capital at Jericho.\r\n\r\nJerusalem would become an independent city-state, under the authority of a democratically elected city council. Guidelines could be set by an international body such as the United Nations to avoid the dangers of religious tensions.\r\n\r\nWhat we call upon HM Government and the FCO to do is promote this 3 State Solution in the EU, UN and other relevant bodies and, likely, take direct action in bringing such a resolution to the crisis.",
