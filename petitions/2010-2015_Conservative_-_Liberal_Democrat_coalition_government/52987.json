        "additional_details": "In the next few years there is a very real risk of a Solar Storm similar to the Carrington Event in 1859. In 1859 that super large solar storm only knocked out telegraph poles, but if the same event happened today, we could be without power for months or even years!\r\n\r\nTherefore, we the undersigned would like to see that a procedure is put in place to shut down all power plants in the UK in under 60 minutes after the detection of such a storm. This would protect the transformers that are a vital part of power stations and we would not be without power after the event",
