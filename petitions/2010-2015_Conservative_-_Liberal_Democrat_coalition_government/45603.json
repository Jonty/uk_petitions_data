        "additional_details": "Forget Leicester & York. Richard III was a Catholic. He would hardly have wished to have been buried in the care of a church set up by the son of his enemy. In 1483 he created John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk. Howard died fighting for his cause at Bosworth - a close friend and loyal to the last. Howard's descendants built Arundel R.C Cathedral, in a French Gothic style of the 14th century, which Richard would have recognised. We believe that he would choose Arundel for reinterment, given that both Leicester & York are now Anglican foundations. We have no idea whether Arundel would accept his remains, but it's clearly where he should now find his peace.",
