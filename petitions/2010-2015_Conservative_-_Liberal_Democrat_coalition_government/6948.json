        "additional_details": "In order to encourage people back to work, it would be helpful if the Job Centre advised correctly. The Job Centre advise people to return to work on a Part Time, Temporary or Full Time basis and that the Working Tax Credit will supplement your income if your income is low. This is not entirely true as I found out when I recently came off Jobseekers Allowance after finding a Part Time job of 20 hours per week. When I came to make a claim for Working Tax Credit I was advised that I was unable to claim Working Tax Credit because I had not been on Jobseekers Allowance for 6 months and that I was not working 30 hours per week. What is the incentive to return to work when you are no better off financially? The Government need to change this policy and allow ANYONE returning to work to be able to claim Working Tax Credits if they are on a low income.",
