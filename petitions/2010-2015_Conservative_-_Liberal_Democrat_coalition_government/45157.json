Established by King John of England and to a community of Knights Templar) and not to mention the affect on local housing.\r\nJust because you aren't next to the route does not mean you won't be affected.\r\nDo we need a quicker access to London through the Countryside - NO. We call on the Govt to reconsider these proposals and stop the blight on the affected areas.",
