        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask the government to cease the monopoly that the water companies hold over the reigions. We believe that the opening up of competition is long over due. We should have the right to switch providers in order to gain the best service and value for our water. The monopoly is not fair, unethical and outdated. Open up competition as soon as possible to promote value and fairness.",
