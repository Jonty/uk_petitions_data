This is in recognition of a great Trade Union leader, who did what it said on the tin..He represented his members brilliantly..I never met the man but I had the utmost respect for him as a trade unionist.\r\nThe Trade Union movement lost a true fighter for the workers on 11th March 2014.\r\n\r\nLets do him the honour of getting enough signatures that this has to be debated in the House of Commons.",
