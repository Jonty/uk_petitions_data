News paper articles such as these are a concern to us, because the press are gathering primary or secondary information that should not be published for any reason without the information owner\u2019s acceptance of publishing.There are arguments against our campaigns, which is inevitable to happen to any campaign.\r\n\r\nIf you are supporting this campaign please sign this E- Petition.\r\n\r\nThank you",
