        "additional_details": "With higher unemployment and low growth in the UK it is time for the Government to take action to introduce mass employment in the uk either by opening state run businesses or workers co-operatives, to create employment on a grand scale. We are told that the UK cannot manufacture competively, however if items could be manfactured and sold at cost price, ignoring an element for profit, then perhaps the UK could be competitive and become a major manufacturing country once again. The result would be lower unemployment, less benefits being paid and less social unrest.\r\nWe the undersigned support this petition.",
