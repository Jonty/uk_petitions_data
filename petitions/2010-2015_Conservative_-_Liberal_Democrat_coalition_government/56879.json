The vote could be done using the Internet.\r\n\r\nMost people in society disagree with the choices the government make and it's been obvious for years that the government have been making terrible decisions.\r\n\r\nI think that the citizens should be able to vote for most laws to be passed (or not passed) online and for each option to have a list of pros and cons underneath it so at least most people will know a basis of the situations where as a lot of citizens will already understand.\r\n\r\nI want the government to make a rational decision to save this country now by making at least most laws available to vote to pass (or not pass) online with pros and cons with each decision so that more rational decisions are made to get the United Kingdom back on track of progress.
