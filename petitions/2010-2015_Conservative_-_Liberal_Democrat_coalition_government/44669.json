Supermarkets reject entire crops of food simply because of size, colour or shape issues.\r\n\r\nEncouraging or forcing supermarkets to stock misshapen or differently-coloured produce will have a dramatic positive effect on food and water waste, chemical pollution, the landscape, local/small farmers, the UK farming industry and many other areas, and is so simple to enact!\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/10/half-world-food-waste",
