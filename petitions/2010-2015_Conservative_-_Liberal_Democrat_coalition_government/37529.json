        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the \u20ac200 million spent every year moving the European Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg is a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money. We are further concerned that the travelling circus generates 20,000 tonnes of CO\u2082 at a time when all countries are supposed to be cutting their levels of pollution. We want the British Government to support the \u2018One Seat Campaign\u2019 and lobby for the end of the Strasbourg Circus.\r\n\r\nWe request that the Prime Minister submits a proposal in support of the \u2018One Seat Campaign\u2019 to the European Council demanding a change in European law so that the European Parliament need only meet in one place.\r\n",
