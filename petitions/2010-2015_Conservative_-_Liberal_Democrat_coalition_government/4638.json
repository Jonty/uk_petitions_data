        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the ability of government to control, or at least influence, the price of electricity and gas that can be passed-on to consumers.\r\n\r\nAfter years of 'competition' in the privatised electricity and gas markets, we are left with a few companies dictating inflation-busting prices with little or no just reason for doing so.  The British public are being mugged for a necessity in daily life, and there will be thousands if not millions of people who will suffer this winter as a result.\r\n\r\nThe watchdog has, thus far, been unable to manage these multi-national companies and their ever-increasing demand for prrofit.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for the control of electricity and gas pricing to be centrally managed through intervention.  The companies involved in energy retail should be forced to make profit through the efficiency in how they go about providing it.",
