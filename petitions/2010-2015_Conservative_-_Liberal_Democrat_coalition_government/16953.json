        "additional_details": "I am calling for a review of the Agency Workers Regulations due on 1 October 2011.\r\nDespite the apparent benefits that the European led directive is said to generate, it is clear that the negative impacts are far likely to outweigh the positive, potentially leaving 1000s of people facing unemployment through no fault of their own.\r\nThe AWR states that those in temporary employment, for a period of 12 wks., should then be entitled to all of the benefits of a full time worker. However with this comes the requirement to impose impossible levels of administration.\r\nThe processes and procedures that will have to be enforced are going to cost UK PLC an est. \u00a32bn pa and a massive reduction in temporary jobs. There will be a reduced benefit to those preferring to work with temporary employees, leaving companies with little choice but to employ full time staff or no one at all. This is not a solution to the management of temporary workers who in many cases don\u2019t want a permanent job.",
