        "additional_details": "After using a public toilet, most people wash their hands- but not all! So with your nice clean hands you then have to pull open the door to get out, contaminating your hands in the process. If all Toilet doors opened outward you could just push the door open with your shoulder.  The Gov should amend the rules to ensure all public toilet doors open outward.",
