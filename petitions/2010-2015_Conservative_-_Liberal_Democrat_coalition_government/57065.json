        "additional_details": "A call to David Willetts MP to begin a dialogue over student maintenance loans and to change the current system.\r\n\r\nThe cost of student living is at crisis point.\r\n\r\nThe solution is a simple one: optionally larger loans.\r\n\r\nThis loan would be entirely optional, so it need not be an imposed debt on everyone. With transparency over interest rates, it would be entirely up to each student to make an informed decision on the level of support necessary and to take that risk as they see fit.\r\n\r\nIf the current loan proposals do not change, we will have a higher education policy which inexcusably discriminates on grounds of wealth.\r\n\r\nThe current loans are paltry, unfit for purpose and an embarrassment. By next year, the problem will have worsened.\r\n\r\nSomething must change - and it must change soon, before another generation of students are subject to living a degree in penury. ",
