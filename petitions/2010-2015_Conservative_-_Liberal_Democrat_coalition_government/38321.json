This investment in the future will cost approx \u00a35.5bn (equivalent to only 0.35 % of the National debt).\r\n\r\nIn the UK around 45% of GDP comes from knowledge intensive services, like our satellite industry, pharmaceuticals, advanced polymer sectors and other scientific R&D.\r\n\r\nWithout proper funding we would never have invented the jet engine, CT scanners, pioneered MRI, created the world wide web, pioneered stem cell research... the list goes on.\r\n\r\nThe UK must not stagnate, we need to be scientifically competitive and attract / keep hold of the best minds.\r\n\r\nSee this article from BBC News for more information: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-19513921",
