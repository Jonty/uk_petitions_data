This is an outdated way of testing and is open to widespread abuse both by D.S.A and it examiners employed by them.\r\nA much fairer way would be once the cadidatate has past the part one and part two test, they are permitted to instruct untill they have past a set number of pupils then they are entred onto to A.D,I regestert ( A probationery period). This would bring them in line with other Profession and get away from artifial testing.\r\nThey have PROVED they know the theory and CAN DRIVE to a VERY HIGH standard by passing part one and two. So Scrub the present UNREALISTIC part three \"TEST\"",
