        "additional_details": "Disclosing child sexual abuse is a difficult and distressing experience for a victim; often following a long period of fear, angst and desperation. Contacting the police is the next step to enable justice to be served through the correct channels.\r\n\r\nSadly, the reality for many of these victims is a long and traumatic ordeal. These cases frequently result in the victim being labeled a 'liar', and the non conviction of the perpetrator; allowing them to walk free. Ultimately the child or young person is left regretting that they ever shared their secret.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to act to stop these brave, vulnerable children and young people from losing faith and trust in humanity, and in some cases seeking comfort from alcohol, drugs and self harm.\r\n\r\nA review of court procedures needs to be conducted to ensure that the welfare of the child is prioritised, and a victim-centred approach to tackling child abuse is taken.",
