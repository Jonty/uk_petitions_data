        "additional_details": "This government has sustained and continued to support illegal wars (many of them started by the Blair government), attempted to push the UK into further conflict such as in Syria, lied to the citizens over Ukraine and the government support for the coup that has taken place there, continued to enable the milking of the country and its citizens by the banking industry, ignored the International Common Law Court regarding MPs, the Crown and others over child trafficking, and continues to support its own members when caught embezzling money from its own people. It is BEYOND time these criminals were brought to account for theft, deception, murder, child trafficking and treason. We do not have much time left.",
