The cost in human suffering has been immense and Afghanistan is no freer than when the war started. All agree there is no military solution so what is needed is an immediate ceasefire, all party peace talks and a withdrawal of all foreign troops in order to allow Afghanistan to rebuild with the support of the world community and for all its refugees to return. The British government should take a positive lead in initiating this process",
