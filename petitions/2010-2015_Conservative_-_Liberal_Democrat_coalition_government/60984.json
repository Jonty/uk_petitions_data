        "additional_details": "The amount you need to be entitled to sick pay is \u00a3109 because I'm under 18 I don't earn this every week dispite working full time. I recently had to take to two weeks off work after burning my foot at work so bad I couldn't put a shoe on. Even after my injury happened at work I'm not entitled to sick pay. Under 18s only earn \u00a33.72 an hour so even when they work full time they don't earn more than a \u00a3109 a week. This needs to be lowered for under 18s.",
