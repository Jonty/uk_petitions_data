        "additional_details": "To put it short, fire service personnel in the UK do not have adequate protection to deal with fires appropriately and fully on a day to day basis. They need better protection facilities. All police vans today are fitted with a windscreen protection cage. Firefighters find that they are the most targeted service of all emergency services. A windscreen cage such as this would allow firefighters to get to required locations safely and in good time. The police are also provided with stab vests. Should firefighters be presented with malicious attacks, a stab vest would provide the safety and security to carry on with their job, without worrying about problems such as gangs.",
