Most recent example is evident in its coverage on Israel-Gaza situation. It is effectively acting as an Israel mouthpiece. We reject this media extremism and would not like to fund such an institution through the TV licencing system.\r\n\r\nTherefore we ask the government to make the TV licencing optional so that people of good conscience can register their protest by opting out.
