        "additional_details": "Ambulance services and hospital A&E resources are being swallowed up every Friday and Saturday night by the treatment of drunks; at the expense of those with legitimate injuries or illnesses. Taxpayers have not paid hundreds of thousands of pounds to train doctors to hold sick bags and pump stomachs.This is not what the NHS is for. Those calling an ambulance  for the tratment of excess alcohol should be charged \u00a3100. A further \u00a3100 should be charged if A&E treatment is required. Legislation should allow the deduction of fees from salary and or benefits if not paid; GPs should be authorised to either charge patients or remove patients from thier lists if fees are not paid.
