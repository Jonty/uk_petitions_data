        "additional_details": "In their 1979 election manifesto the Conservatives promised to end the concession whereby foreign men can live in the UK through marriage.\r\nThe official figure was about 10,000 men a year using this method.\r\nBut Mrs. Thatcher's Government did not keep its promise.\r\nAs a result, at least 300,000 men are living in these islands.\r\nEngland is overcrowded, and the UK has more young men than young women.\r\nForeign husbands are entitled, thanks to equality laws, to deprive Britons of work and promotion.\r\nIt is also clearly unjust that some people have a choice of two countries in which to live, while others do not.\r\nThis petition requests the Government - for the common good - to end this concession.
