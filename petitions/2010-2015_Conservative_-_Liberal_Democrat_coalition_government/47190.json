The weapons supplied could be used against our own soldiers a few years down the line.\r\n\r\nWe think this would be common sense given the failure of the \"Arab Spring\" but obviously not.\r\n\r\nWe, the UK, have no reason to get involved at all, especially with the governments spending cuts, the last thing we want is to arm terrorists.\r\n\r\nIt's morally wrong and must be stopped.",
