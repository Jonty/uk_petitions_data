However, our dishonourable electeds MUST make sure that any money paid out on this basis is either deducted from our next payment into the EU OR by taking it from the existing foreign aid allocation - since we are NOT members of the eurozone it is legitimate to take the money from the foreign aid budget.  THE UK TAXPAYER MUST NOT BEAR THE COST OF THE CONTINUING EUROZONE FAILURE.",
