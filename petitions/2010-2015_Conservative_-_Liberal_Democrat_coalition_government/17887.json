        "additional_details": "We petition the Prime Minister to ensure that a Bill is introduced to Parliament whose goal will be the expulsion of all U.S. military personnel from British soil, this to include not just the mainland, but also Diego Garcia, where the inhabitants were removed and sent to Mauritius to make way for a U.S. military base..\r\nThe presence of U.S.(NATO)military personnel and hardware makes Britain a target for attack by enemies of the U.S.A.\r\nFor moral reasons too, the British Government must distance itself politically and militarily from the U.S. Administration, which has such an appalling record of causing death, destruction, and displacement on a colossal scale in various parts of the world.\r\nIt also has a disgusting record of propping up and arming brutal dictators, and of subverting democratic Governments.The expulsion would be a useful first step in showing British condemnation of the U.S. Administration's policy in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, where it has been bombing villages.",
