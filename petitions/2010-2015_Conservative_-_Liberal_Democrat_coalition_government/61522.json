        "additional_details": "I want the UK government to discuss in parliament, the option of Devo Max for Scotland. I do not believe independance is the way forward for Scotland or the UK. The only thing I believe is right, is more powers going to holyrood to control our part of this nation. I'm tired of listening to politicians making things up as they go,  especially when one sides \"experts\" state one thing and the other side states the opposite, one or both are lying. It's time for constructive discussion to take place instead of idle threats and scaremongering. This is meant to be a democratic nation after all.",
