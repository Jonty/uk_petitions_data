Why the double charge when it does not cost the Insurance Company double to insure.\r\n\r\nMy petition is\r\n1. The Insurance should not be more than the total of two single quotes of the two most expensive drivers.\r\n\r\n2. Why can the car not be insured instead of Driver being Insured?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
