He admitted to killing 13 children in Gaza in one day by posting an image of himself on his Instagram account holding his sniper rifle\r\n\r\nThis inhumane aberration is symptomatic of a state that is spiralling way past racism and arguably already well and truly embroiled in fascism (for example Moshe Feiglin (Deputy Speaker of the Israeli Knesset) only recently called for concentration camps in Gaza and Ayelet Shaked, another Israeli MP called for genocide of the Palestinians and in particular the mothers.  Given this rhetoric at the highest echelons of Israeli government it is not surprising citizens of that state (like David Ovadia) compete to show ever decreasing levels of compassion and humanity for the Palestinians resulting in ever more disgusting examples of cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe UK government must push for his trial as a matter of urgency and the UK must vote to have Israel investigated for War Crimes by undoing its recent abstention of that vote",
