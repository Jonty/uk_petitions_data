        "additional_details": "Drugs are a growing problem throughout the country, even the world. There has to come a point when we need to say stop giving out needles to users. This only encourages people to continue using and abusing. Not all users clean up after themselves and they just leave needles anywhere eg. playgrounds which is of course unsafe and the council would be held responsible if a child hurts themselves by accident on a discarded needle. If you agree please sign to stop users being given needles to fuel their addiction",
