Consultants are regularly denied access to breakthrough treatments which are yet to be approved in this country due to our strict licensing laws. If these drugs are already licensed in another country they must have shown that they are  sufficiently safe and successful at treating the given cancer. Allow consultants access to these breakthrough drugs if the patient is happy to be treated with them unlicensed. It may be their only chance and waiting for it to be approved could be life threatening!",
