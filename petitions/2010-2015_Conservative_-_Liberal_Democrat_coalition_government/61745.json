        "additional_details": "This petition is to be signed by everyone who does fully support deployment of NATO forces into Ukraine. The deployment of NATO forces would discourage any Russian attempt to invade Ukraine, the people of Ukraine want a democracy, not a fascist government. Too long has Russia been allowed to bully NATO forces, countries such as the US, UK, France, Germany and other EU nations need to stand up as one and voice our disapproval of Russia's actions.",
