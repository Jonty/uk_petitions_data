A factsheet with a full explanation can be found by searching online for \u2018RSPCA Religious Slaughter\u2019.\r\nhttp://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&assetId=1232719611043&mode=prd\r\n\r\nWe ask that the UK Government follows the courageous and principled lead shown by Denmark and other European countries and respect animal rights before this religious practice.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to remove this exemption, so that all animals are slaughtered to the same high standards.",
