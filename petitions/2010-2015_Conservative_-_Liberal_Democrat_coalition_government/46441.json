Thats why we need to put IT and computer science just as important as sciences and subjects such as RE which are compulsory up to 16 years old.\r\n\r\nI believe that by the end of primary school every child should know how to use simple programmes like word, powerpoint and excel to a basic level. In year 7 they should develop these into advanced skills and then in years 8 - 11 children should be taught how to write computer programmes using software / languages like scratch, visual basic and HTML. This would mean that every child would have at least a basic understanding of programming.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom needs to be a leader in computing. Sign this petition.   ",
