        "additional_details": "The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) have shown that they are incapable of making decisions relating to MP pay that reflect public opinion as well as the wider economic climate. While many politicians have said they do not agree with the proposals, they appear powerless to refuse the pay rise!  The IPSA claim 'In everything we do, we focus on our main duty; to serve the interests of the public' ... this is inaccurate and government need to reengage to ensure transparent governance. This petition calls for IPSA pay related decisions to in future be adjudicated and approved by an independent and publicly nominated group. This group will represent the wider public and should be diverse in it's make up and representative of the UK community, employed, unemployed, young and old.\r\nThis group should be set up prior to the 2015 General Election to ensure that the current pay proposals are reviewed and current public opinion is represented.",
