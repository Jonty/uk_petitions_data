Charities are full to bursting point and are struggling to cope with the huge influx of dogs coming through there doors. Desperate dogs, heartbroken, damaged dogs. Should it not be illegal to sell dogs online? Should it be only registered breeders who breed these dogs? The amount of dogs used to breed for the sole purpose of making money is awful. We are all disgusting by what happens in other countries to animals but its happening on our front door. There are so many dogs desperate to be rehomed, desperate not to be abused to be used as a money maker with out even the basic of things, water, food, and to not be physically or emotionally abused. Selling dogs online should be banned, we are seeing a dog holocaust, These dogs are being BORN TO DIE !",
