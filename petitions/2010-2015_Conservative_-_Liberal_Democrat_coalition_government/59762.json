        "additional_details": "ONE in every ONE HUNDRED babies born in England have a congenital heart defect to some degree. Many of these defects are undetected in ultrasound scans during pregnancy, around less than half are found this way, and many are not picked up even after birth.\r\n\r\nOften the only indication something is wrong is that they have a low oxygen level of less than 95%. This is not something which is routinely checked and often these babies appear pink and well. If it became routine to have this test then many babies lives would be saved and the earlier it is detected the earlier babies can have treatment.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ask the Government for a change in the law and to make this simple test compulsory.
