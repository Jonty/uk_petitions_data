        "additional_details": "The people against the new harsh European rules, labelling them 'unfit' to drive.  Under a new definition of the rules to meet an EU directive, a diabetic who has two hypos in a year \u2013 even while in bed \u2013 will end up banned from driving.  We do not want people who are a danger to the public on the roads as such, but we ask for a fair approach to this, and think that it is unfair that the DVLA state nocturnal hypoglycaemia as a choice of banning said drivers as the EC Directive does not specify it. The UK DVLA has been accused of applying the directive far more strictly than other countries.",
