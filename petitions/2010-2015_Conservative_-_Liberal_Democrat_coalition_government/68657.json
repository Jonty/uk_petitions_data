Given the major increase in the number of people driving and speeding on London Road, crossing the road by Potton B1040 Junction has now become extremely dangerous and unsafe, especially for the pupils of Stratton Upper School.\r\nWe therefore demand that the council founds the provision of a pedestrian crossing as soon as possible.",
