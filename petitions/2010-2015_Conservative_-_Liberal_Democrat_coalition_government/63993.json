        "additional_details": "BAN HALAL AND KOSHER SLAUGHTER IN THE UK\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nUnder UK law, all farmed animals must be stunned to render them unconscious before slaughter. However legal exemption (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/731/contents/made#sdiv12) which applies only to Halal and Kosher slaughter, means  animals slaughtered, \u201cby a religious method\u201d for halal or kosher meat - are exempt. We believe that on animal cruelty grounds, that this exemption should be removed. This is not racist, anti Muslim or anti Jewish. It concerns inhumane animal cruelty in the UK.\r\nAnimals slaughtered by the above method suffer prolonged painful and cruel deaths, After their throat is cut they bleed to death still fully concious and in unimaginable pain .
