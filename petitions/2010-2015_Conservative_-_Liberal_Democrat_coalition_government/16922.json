        "additional_details": "Reverse decision to Reduce Salt Level  in HP Sauce.\r\nThe previous version of the brown sauce, which has become synonymous with fry-up breakfasts and bacon sandwiches, used to contain 2.1g of salt per 100g. The new version contains just 1.3g. Heinz made the changes after signing up to the Coalition Government\u2019s Responsibility Deal, which aims to reduce salt used by food manufacturers. The key pledges include an agreement to reducing salt in food so people eat 1g less per day by end of 2012. Health experts claim this measure will save the NHS \u00a346 million a year within three years and prevent more than 4,000 premature deaths a year. This is Absolutely Rubbish. People do not consume this product by the bucket but just pour a tiny amount. Reverse the decision Immediatly. ",
