        "additional_details": "The minimum pension age was increased from 50 to 55 in 2010 without any preservation of rights for individuals who had planned their savings and retirement based on the previous age.\r\n\r\nThe Government (elected for a five year term) should not repeatedly fiddle with the pension terms and conditions for people who have to plan thirty to fifty years. This should include the setting of the minimum pension age.\r\n\r\nThe normal pension age must be restored to 50 for all and then a consultation launched on any changes which should only apply to new savers. Any other approach undermines the whole concept of saving for your retirement,\r\n",
