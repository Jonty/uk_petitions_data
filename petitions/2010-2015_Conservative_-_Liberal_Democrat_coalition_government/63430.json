        "additional_details": "Most of our NHS based GP surgeries are failing the patients they were built to care for. I believe it\u2019s time for the government to introduce more rigorous inspections for GP surgeries across UK and Ireland; More vigorous sanctions should be put on those which are neglecting their patients and failing to notice when a patient needs urgent referral to their local hospital. We as tax-paying citizens deserve a better healthcare system. The government cannot sit back and watch thousands of patients being sent home to die when they've made the point to come to their GP (in whom they trust) to miss important symptoms that regretfully could have been treated. This is negligence and incompetence; Please introduce more frequent inspections and sanctions for those GP surgeries that are neglecting their patients and putting filling up patient quota first before patient needs.\r\n\r\nI urge the government to do something about this before we see another NHS sector fall down the drain.\r\n\r\nThank you ",
