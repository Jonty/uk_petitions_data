This has nothing to do with religion necessarily.\r\n\r\nIn some countries such as Germany the use of power tools, including lawn mowers for example, is banned on a Sunday.\r\n\r\nI propose that power tools, any noisy work that is not carried out in the context of an emergency, should be banned on a Sunday, to be enforced by the police.\r\n\r\nThis is vital to maintain a reasonable quality of life in residential areas for at least one day in the week. London is noisy enough, let's keep a day of relative peace.",
