        "additional_details": "If an individual intends to leave school & does not have employment, a place in a higher/further education course, an apprenticeship, or any form of recognised career development in place, then they immediately are enrolled to \"Fallback\" national service, where they may be deployed to carry out work within the community, for local or central government, & receive full training to carry out this work. Payment is in the form of income benefit. On firm evidence that employment, a place in higher/further education, or an apprenticeship is successfully obtained, \u201cFallback\u201d National Service will cease. There will be no minimum period that must be served as long as the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. \u201cFallback\u201d National Service will also apply to those who have been unemployed for a period of 1 year or more. Defaulting on \u201cFallback\u201d National Service will result in the immediate cessation of income benefit payment to the individual. Those with valid health problems/illness are exempt.",
