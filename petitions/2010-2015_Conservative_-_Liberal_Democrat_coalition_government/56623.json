        "additional_details": "The Present legalisation states that only one parent can claim the child benefit, this parent is then labelled as the resident parent even if the agreement is 50% equal shared parenting for the child/children.\r\n\r\nShared parenting is in the best interests for any child that has their parents split/divorced and many parents are amicable enough to put the needs of the child first however legalisation as it stands allows the resident parent to claim CSA payments from the non-resident parent and divorce solicitors push clients to claim for this.\r\n\r\nI believe this should be changed to allow parents with equal costs and responsibilities for their child to both be labelled as resident parents so neither can claim CSA from each other and become proper Shared parents, putting the child first instead of money issues/\r\n",
