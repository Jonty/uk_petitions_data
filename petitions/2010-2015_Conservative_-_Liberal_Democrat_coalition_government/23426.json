        "additional_details": "Car insurance prices are becoming a joke, mainly due to the blame-claim society we live in. I propose the Government take action by placing a cap on the premium payable by the customer dependant on age and power output of the vehicle they wish to drive. Likewise I also propose they place a cap on the payouts received by people involved in minor motoring accidents so that it is proportionate to the injury and inconvenience suffered. If more people could afford to own and run a car the government would make more income via Road Tax and Fuel Duty thus hopefully reducing fuel prices and improving road infrastructure and also more people would be able to apply for jobs further away from home thus reducing the number of unemployed relying on state benefit. The benefits to society by not pricing people out of motoring could be endless.",
