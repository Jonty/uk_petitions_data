        "additional_details": "I served 2.5 years in prison for selling drugs, similarly a sex offender (rapist, pedophile, abuser) would serve the same time as I did, or maybe even less!\r\n\r\n30% of all sex offenders go on to commit further sexual offences upon release.\r\n\r\nThe sentences aren't long enough, the supervision they receive upon release by both the probation service and sex offenders register is utterly appalling\r\n\r\nI am asking people to sign this petition so we can get sex offenders longer sentences with more supervision upon release, it could happen to anyone!\r\n\r\nThere are more and more independent prisons being built to house sex offenders, there are independent wings to house sex offenders. Sexual offences are rising but we are not keeping up with the times.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and hopefully MOJ/The government will do something about it!. ",
