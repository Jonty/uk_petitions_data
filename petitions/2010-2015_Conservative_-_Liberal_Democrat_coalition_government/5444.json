        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament to legislate at the earliest opportunity to overhaul MPs' salaries and expenses so they are paid the Minimum Wage for the Maximum Working Week and this is means tested so that wealthy individuals do not receive anything.\r\n\r\nWe ask MPs to acknowledge that their role is one of public service, not career building, and it is their duty to remain in touch with the ordinary people of the UK.  Consequently being paid salaries far in excess of the actual average in the real world does not help MPs to appreciate how difficult it can be to live on such a small wage level as the Minimum Wage.\r\n\r\nThe amount of money saved would also be considerable and could go towards further reducing the national deficit.",
