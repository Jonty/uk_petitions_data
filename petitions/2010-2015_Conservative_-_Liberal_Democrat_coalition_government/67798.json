        "additional_details": "Birmingham to London currently takes 1 hour 20 minutes, the HS2 rail link will cut 30 minutes off of this journey.\r\n\r\nAt a cost of \u00a380 billion this seems ridiculous let alone the fact it does not connect to any airport or have any stations between Birmingham to London, the money would be far better spent connecting East/West where journeys take 4+ hours.\r\n\r\nAlternatively this money could far better fund a revamp to our tired motorways or knackered train network.\r\n\r\nWe do NOT need HS2 it is unlikely more than 1% of the population will ever use it & it would be like building a canal at the start of the railway age.",
