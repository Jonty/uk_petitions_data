        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask parliament to conduct an enquiry in to why it is necessary for The Lord Mayor of Leicester to benefit from an 80% pay rise. This pay rise makes him the second highest paid mayor behind the mayor of London when Leicester is not even one of the top 5 largest cities. It's seems corrupt and unjustifiable that someone can increase their pay by this amount with the current financial climate. What do the people of Leicester get from this?",
