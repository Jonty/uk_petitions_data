        "additional_details": "If you are in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance and you fail to adhere to the regulations outlined in the Jobseekers Act 1995, you are at risk of being sanctioned.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases, Jobseeker's Allowance can be stopped should a claimant not be available for or actively seeking work or if he/she does not sign the Jobseeker's Agreement at any stage during a claim.\r\n\r\nJobseeker's Allowance claimants are being unlawfully sanctioned for up to 26 weeks for failing to apply for a vacancy handed to them by a Jobcentre adviser.  Even for the most dedicated clamant who DOES want to secure employment, he/she is being unlawfully penalised for failing to applying for a vacancy.\r\n\r\nNOW is the time for the Government to reform this legislation which clearly breaches the human rights and fundamental freedoms, as outlined by the European Court of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nIf you are in support of overruling these benefit sanctions, please sign this e-petition.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
