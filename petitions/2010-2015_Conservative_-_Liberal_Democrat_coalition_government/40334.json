        "additional_details": "Matthew Woods' jokes at the expense of missing child April Jones were in horrendous taste. Likewise Barry Thew's abusive T-shirt, which made a mockery of the tragic deaths of two police officers in Manchester.\r\nTheir actions display a level of insensitivity that cannot be defended.  What they did was grossly offensive.\r\nBut their imprisonment is wrong.\r\nAll Britons deserve the freedom to air their views in public, without fear of recrimination.  Of course, we should be protected from threat of violence, malicious dishonesty and divisive slurs against minorities. But neither Woods nor Thew made threats or committed hate crimes.  They made jokes in terrible taste.\r\nIt is absolutely NOT the role of the government to decide what is and isn't amusing, moral, immoral or offensive.\r\nThis talibanisation of British society and culture by Section 127of the 2003 Communications Act, and other laws that establish the state as an ill-defined moral compass must be stopped and reversed.",
