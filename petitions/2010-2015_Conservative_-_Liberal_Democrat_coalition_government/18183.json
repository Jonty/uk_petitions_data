        "additional_details": "As an inventor and a songwriter, I find it much easier to write a song and, indeed, can produce one \u201con demand\u201d. Inventing however is something I find much harder, and indeed may not happen at all. A songwriter owns the copyright in his songs for life plus 70 years, copyright being free and automatic, and can potentially earn from them immediately. On the other hand, an inventor may not earn from his invention for many years, it is also expensive and protection from a Patent only lasts for a maximum of 20 years, the origins of which can be traced back almost 400 years.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is for a global debate, beginning with parliament in this country for bringing Patents \u201cup to date\u201d with other creative property. Perhaps at least if a patent is kept in force monopoly is possible, and on expiry royalties could be due as in the case of songwriters, life plus 70 years.",
