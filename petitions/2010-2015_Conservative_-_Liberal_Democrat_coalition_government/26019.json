        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that the UK government currently spends too little on improving cycle safety.\r\n\r\nEvidence shows that spending money on permanent infrastructure improvements and lifelong training and education for all road users is a more effective, preventative road safety policy than relying on individuals buying helmets (which only last a few years and do not prevent accidents in the first place).\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to raise a dedicated cycle budget of \u00a325 per person per year (effectively match-funding the cost of a standard bicycle helmet). This would bring the UK in line with other European countries such as the Netherlands who have achieved:\r\n\r\nincreased road safety for all users;\r\n\r\nsmoother traffic flow;\r\n\r\nimproved public health;\r\n\r\nbetter air quality;\r\n\r\na reduction in carbon emissions.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
