        "action": "Increase University Maintenance Loan",
        "additional_details": "Currently a maintenance loan of around \u00a33,500 is available to any student who begins studying at University, irrespective of parental income. If parents earn less than around \u00a350,000 then this amount increases gradually, to a maximum of \u00a34,950.\r\n\r\nAt 18 years of age, you are independent. Why should it be down to your parents to give further support in ensuring you are able to go to University and study in an environment in which you will thrive?\r\n\r\nIn September, I will hopefully commence study of medicine at Oxford. My maintenance loan barely covers accommodation. Not my food, or my clothes, or a computer, or my books, or a bike, or transport... I wouldn't say that these things are idyllic to a 'student lifestyle' of clubbing and the like.\r\n\r\nSo this petition is for a reconsideration of how maintenance loans work, in the hope that the government will find a fairer way that disadvantages no students from going to university.
