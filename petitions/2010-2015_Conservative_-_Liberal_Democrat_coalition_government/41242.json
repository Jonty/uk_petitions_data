        "additional_details": "During the Olympics, TFL had the tube running late throughout the Games which made it easier for everyone to get around at night and did away with the worry of missing the last train home and being stranded in central London.\r\nGiven that London has a busy nighttime economy, it would make sense to keep the tube running late on Friday and Saturday nights to help people get home safely and easily when they have been out late.\r\nThe night buses currently on offer are over-crowded and infrequent.\r\nPlease work with Transport For London, The Mayor of London and the transport unions to keep the tube running late at night on Fridays and Saturdays. It would be a boost to London's nighttime economy and make journeys home safer and simpler.",
