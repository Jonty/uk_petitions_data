        "additional_details": "Much of the public sector could be replaced with web pages or a smartphone app.. Also, teachers could be replaced by high-quality, high-production, interactive video lessons:: (1. every pupil gets the same high quality teacher; 2. every pupil has to answer every question; 3. 'class clowns' no longer exist [classes no longer exist!]; 4. each student can advance according to their own abilities; 5. adults can use the lessons to top up their skills (improved job centres). [I personally feel 'adult schools' would be a very good thing to have regardless]; 6. some teachers are retained as 'learning coaches'/exam markers)...  A much smaller public sector might be a painful transition, but could lead to vast savings, which can be spent on:: (1. decreased taxes (which in turn will stimulate business/make UK more attractive/improve citizen spending power); 2. remove the deficit; 3. invest in proper infrastructure projects/etc\r\n- improved market confidence). \u2018New lines\u2019 = BETTER PETITION LAYOUTS!",
