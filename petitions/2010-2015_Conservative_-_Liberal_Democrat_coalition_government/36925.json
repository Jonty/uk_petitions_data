Wales is the poorest constituent nation of the United Kingdom, and is required to be subjected to nonsensical rhetoric from nationalists, who stand on the platform of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt should be abolished and all powers devolved to local councils. That would be real devolution and save excessive costs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Welsh must decide, and so a Referendum on Abolition of the Welsh Assembly should be called very soon.\r\n\r\n",
