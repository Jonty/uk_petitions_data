        "additional_details": "A petition to call on HM Government to increase investment and subsidies in the hydrogen fuel cell and technologies industry.  That they do this to reduce the UK's dependence on foreign oil and reduce pollution caused by petrol- and diesel-powered cars. We, the undersigned, note that through investment HM Government could increase employment throughout the UK. Moreover that through doing the above, the UK could financially benefit from a lead in the technology.\r\n\r\nTherefore the undersigned believe that this will help the UK towards a more sustainable future.
