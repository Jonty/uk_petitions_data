        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition that southeastern trains, operated by Go Ahead, should have their franchise removed from them and given to a different operator. The current company provides excessive levels of defective stock to service, does not provide suitable weekend capacity, presents its stock poorly and has very low levels of stock cleanliness. Investment must improve, and the only way to ensure this is done is to bring a new operator to the network.",
