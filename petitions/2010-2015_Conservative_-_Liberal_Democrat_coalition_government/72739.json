        "additional_details": "Subject: RE: Landlord registration fee\r\n\r\nI am against the new compulsory Landlord Registration to pay \u00a31000 per property that a Landlord has for Rental Purposes - this the Government has to stop in its tracks - it is clearly a STEALTH TAX by Croydon Council. Below is the response from Mr Gavin Barwell MP on the matter.\r\n\r\nMr M Bharwani ( Proposer to Petition)\r\n\r\nEdited Letter: from Mr G Barwell MP - Croydon\r\nYou\u2019re right that Croydon Council is consulting on introducing a 'Selective Licensing' scheme for private rented accommodation. Despite the title, there\u2019s nothing selective about it. Every private landlord in the borough would have to pay \u00a3200 a year to the Council for the privilege of renting out a property. If they don\u2019t, they could be liable to a fine of up to \u00a320,000.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\nGavin\r\nGavin Barwell, Member of Parliament for Croydon Central\r\n",
