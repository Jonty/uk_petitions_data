        "additional_details": "The UK is one of the highest taxed countries in the world. Other countries, to create jobs, increase public well-being and kick start their own economies have reduced VAT levels for the hospitality (accommodation, licensed & catering) industry.\r\n\r\nIn France it is 5.5%, Germany 7%, Italy 10%, Spain 8% and Holland 6%. Ireland became the latest in July 11 slashing 4.5% off hospitality VAT.\r\n\r\nIf the UK reduced its hospitality tax to the same level as France it would create up to 320,000 new jobs.\r\nIt has been successful everywhere it has been applied.\r\n\r\nJoin our e-petition to cut Hospitality VAT -  100,000 signatures and the matter must be debated in parliament.\r\n\r\nThey are your government - Make them listen!!!\r\n",
