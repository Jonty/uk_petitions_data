There is currently a \u00a35billion black hole in the presumed  stockholding - this has happened due to insufficient investment in appropriate IT systems, poor decision making and infighting.\r\nThere is also the ongoing cost of maintaining storage facilities for redundant and out of date stock(does the army need  treadle singer sewing machines?)\r\nAll this needs a complete overhaul.\r\n\r\nMy petition is to enable a suitable private sector experienced operator to take this over - first thought is the Eddie Stobart Group.\r\n",
