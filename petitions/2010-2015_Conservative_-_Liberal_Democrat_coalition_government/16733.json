        "additional_details": "We the undersigned were appalled to find that the Fantasia on British Sea Songs is still being excluded from the Last Night of the Proms.  Arranged by Sir Henry Wood himself, it is a vital component of the Last Night of the Proms. It's removal from the programme in 2008 and persistent absence ever since brings shame on the BBC and all the Prom organisers.  It should be reinstated immediately and included in the Last Night 2012 and thereafter without exception. ",
