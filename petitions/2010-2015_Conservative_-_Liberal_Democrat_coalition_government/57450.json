Some senior civil servants working on behalf of councillors and MPs fail in their duties and continue to do so with impunity, where peoples' lives are adversely affected by their decisions.\r\n\r\nThis petition is simply to call for senior civil servants to be subject to election and re-election as are MPs, regional and local councillors.\r\n",
