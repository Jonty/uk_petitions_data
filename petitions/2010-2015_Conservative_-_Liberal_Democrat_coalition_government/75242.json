        "additional_details": "I am a student who will be starting university in September this year. The loan I will receive will not even cover my accommodation costs in the first year, due to the fact that my parents earn just over the cut-off point for the maximum student loan. What this fails to take into consideration is the fact that I come from a large family, and so my parents cannot afford to subsidise my education. I am not alone in this. I want the government to take into consideration the outgoings of larger lower-middle class families when calculating the sum of the student loan these students may receive. ",
