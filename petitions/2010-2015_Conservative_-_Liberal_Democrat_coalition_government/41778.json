        "additional_details": "Cumbira's politicians with the support of DECC through the MRWS (Managing Radioactive Waste Safely) have engaged with DECC as a volunteer community to express an interest in accepting radioactive waste in West Cumbria. This has been done without reference to the electorate and the justification comes by way of a telephone opinion poll. The plan is fatally flawed because the geology is unsafe. This petition calls for the upgrading of storage facilities at Sellafield and the volunteer process to be restarted in areas of the UK where the geology is known to be safe. The negative effects of proceeding in Cumbria will be an adverse and negative impact on the Lake Districts \u00a32Bn/year tourism industry and a potential biohazard for Cumbria within 200 years. ",
