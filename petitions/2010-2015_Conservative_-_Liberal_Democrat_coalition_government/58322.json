We have issues already with unemployment, crime, recessions, benefits and the county being massively in debt. We can't afford anymore immigrants and it will not benefit our society in any way what so ever except by dragging it deeper in to a place that we will not and cannot recover from! Please sign this petition and let the government hear our voices and let's stand together to make this country English again! ",
