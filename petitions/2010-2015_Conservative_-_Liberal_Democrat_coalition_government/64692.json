We have been inaccurately described for 400 years as BLACK. It is racist, derogatory, has negative connotations and is one of the most visible ongoing legacies of the indignity, dehumanisation, and degradation that went with the transatlantic politician trade. ALL other races without exception worldwide are today respectfully described by heritage, instead of the derogatory descriptions of the past, including those described by colour in the past. E.g. Native American or Amerindian has replaced \u2018red Indian\u2019, Oriental instead of \u2018yellow peoples\u2019. Even mixed or dual heritage has long-since replaced the pejorative 'half-caste'. The terms Asian, Arab, Latino etc respectfully describe other populations, in speech and print. We want the same respect accorded - Afroic as the generic global term for us, and NO LONGER black.\r\n\r\n",
