        "additional_details": "On 11/11/11 \"Hands for Heroes - Free Chiropractic Care for War Veterans\" signed its 127th UK Chiropractic office up, giving national coverage to provide free chiropractic care, worth \u00a34.4 Million, to war veterans from Afghanistan and Iraq.\r\nThe founder, a chiropractic patient and a veteran from 3 conflicts, was disturbed that the MOD would not tell the troops of this initiative as \"chiropractic was not endorsed by the NHS\". Chiropractic care is strictly regulated and was actively promoted by the government. It is used annually by 10 million+ people and is provided by the US government to all of its troops. As a different health model it does not need endorsement by the NHS.\r\nI request that the Government uses all of its communication channels to make every member of the Armed Forces aware of the existence of \"Hands for Heroes\" - www.handsforheroes.org so that they can decide for themselves whether they choose to take the valuable care that is being offered.",
