        "additional_details": "The current parliament building needs refurbishment at an estimated cost of at least \u00a33bn, with an annual maintenance bill of \u00a330m. It is proposed that the existing building is sold for suitable re-development, allowing the construction of a new landmark parliament building for the nation out of the proceeds. The cost of a new build would be far less than the \u00a33bn projected for the existing refurbishment and would be a more suitable workplace for the governance of the country with much lower running costs.",
