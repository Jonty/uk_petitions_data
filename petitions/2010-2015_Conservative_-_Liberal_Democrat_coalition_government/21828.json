        "additional_details": "The government needs to urgently act to revoke the unfair whip bans rules imposed by the BHA.  The current rules have put the sport in jeopardy with thousands of jobs at risk.   After reading the full report it is clear that there is not evidence to suggest that the horses feel the whip.  What is clear is that jockeys, owners and trainers have been placed in an unfair position where there livelihood have unfairly been put at risk.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended the government have a full independent review and whilst this ongoing the previous rules are re-instated and all bans are revoked.",
