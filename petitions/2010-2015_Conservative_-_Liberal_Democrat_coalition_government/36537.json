        "additional_details": "Under current legislation pork and other pigmeat products labelled as \"British\" simply means the pig has been slaughtered in the UK. It does mean the pig has been reared in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis means the UK consumer that wishes to buy British and support British; either to support British farmers, to have the comfort of British standards are being fooled.\r\n\r\nIt also means British pig farmers that adhere to higher standards of animal welfare at extra cost, are not receiving the proper recognition for their products\r\n\r\nIn February 2012 UK introduced a voluntary COOL code for pork, a new country of origin labeling system to provide clear food information on food labeling. We want to see this made COMPULSORY for all pigmeat products sold in the UK, with absolute clear wording and definitions",
