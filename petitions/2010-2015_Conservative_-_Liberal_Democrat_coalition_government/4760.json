        "additional_details": "I am writing in the hope that you would be kind enough to support a request for an increase or abolition of the \u00a35,000 cap on tax free season ticket loans that employers can provide to their staff. I do not believe the threshold has been reviewed for some time and travel costs for longer distance commuters have now breached the \u00a35,000 cap by some margin, with further significant increases in the pipeline over the next 3 years, due in part to the recent spending review. I believe an increase would help a great number of commuters, without impacting Tax and NI revenue materially.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration of this request.",
