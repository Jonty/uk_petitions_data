The other local villages already suffer seasonal flooding. Without proper flood defenses in place, the water displacement caused by such a big development will only make season flooding more regular wider reaching.\r\n\r\nAside of this issue, much of the infrastructure of the surrounding suburbs is already at breaking point. The areas roads simply couldn't cope with added pressure of over 2000 additional homes which in turn could easily see another 3000+ additional cars on the local roads.",
