        "additional_details": "At present in the UK The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011 states that beginning on the 7th May 2015 the Government will serve for 5yrs before there is another general election. A lot can happen in 5yrs and as we have seen from this current Government's service, a LOT can be done which the public do not agree with and without their consent. The only people who can legally have a vote of no confidence is the House of Commons, other members of parliament. This can only happen if the majority agree. We are calling for a change to the Act to give greater power to the public to allow them a vote of no confidence mid way through the 5yr term.",
