Our local centre charges people for certain goods dumped by people (how can this be?), though we are not permitted to take anything electronic. Too many old computers and general collectable electronics (and non electronic) are destined to be lost if we don't reverse this trend. Please, make the government order councils to make it 'ok' to remove goods if the owners don't want them. That\u2019s true recycling. But obviously, this does not include old oil, batteries or stuff like that. ",
