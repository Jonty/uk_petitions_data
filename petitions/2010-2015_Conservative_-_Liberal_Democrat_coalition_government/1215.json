We are an island nation and we are bursting at the seams and we, the British citizens are incensed at being ignored on this issue year after year. Also sick of being branded racist for having our countries interests at heart, what happened to being proud to be a British citizen. In the U.S they encourage patriotism, here we run from it and actively discourage it.",
