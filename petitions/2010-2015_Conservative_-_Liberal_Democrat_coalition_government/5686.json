        "additional_details": "\r\nBritian will continue to rely heavily upon the participation of private landlords to provide housing for the population. I would like to see a debate on the regulation and licencing of private domestic landlords. From now into the future,\r\n\r\nThe quality and security of housing has a direct affect upon the performance of Britain as a nation. Secure and acceptable housing allows families to flourish without fear of socially damaging upheaval creating stable and secure communities and a stable social platform from which to re-launch Britain.\r\n\r\nThis petition is requested to curb the casual and often fickle behaviour of some private landlords. Those that have no social conscience and consider tenants as a mere means to wealth, should not be allowed to become involved with the critically important area of housing.\r\n",
