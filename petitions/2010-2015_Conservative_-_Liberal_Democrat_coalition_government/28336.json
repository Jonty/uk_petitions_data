This is unfair.  There is no mutuality principle here.  Other pension schemes give married members the option to pay a little extra to provide a pension for their spouse/partner should they die and this is fairer .  Most local authority pension scheme members have no idea part of their contributions are taken so that spouses/partners of married members can 'inherit' their pension -many of whom contribute to a pension scheme themselves .  Thus single members subsidise the Treasury who might otherwise have to provide benefits to some surviving spouses/partners.\r\nI want the government to bring local authority schemes into line with the fairer schemes e.g. civil service",
