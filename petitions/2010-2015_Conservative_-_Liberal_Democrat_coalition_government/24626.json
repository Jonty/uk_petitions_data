This would raise awareness in parents thus treating and irradicating head lice more effectively.  Without these regular checks carried out by the nurse, the problem has escalated beyond control while schools remain powerless to intervine.\r\nWe would like the government to reinstate the Health Services to carry out regular checks in all primary, infant and junior schools in England.",
