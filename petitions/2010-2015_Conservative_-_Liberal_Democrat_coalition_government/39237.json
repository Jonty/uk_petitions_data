        "additional_details": "On the 19th of January 2013 new motorcycle laws will be enforced. This include increase in age from 21 to 24 to have a unrestricted motorcycle licence. And from the age of 17 too 19 you have too stay on a 125cc. Thus means more tests therefore more money spent and more time consumed too get a bike that goes as fast as a car. We want the government to revert back to the old laws on motorcycles which were fair as these new laws are age discriminating. If they are not able to do that then they must reconsider the catagory's. For example at 17 you should be able to drive up to 33BHP",
