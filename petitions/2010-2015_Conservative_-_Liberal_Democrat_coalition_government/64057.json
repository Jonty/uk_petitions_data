        "additional_details": "This asks the government to commission passionate, social experts to set up a non-profit autonomous service which provides social skills tuition (e.g. asking questions, getting a boyfriend /girlfriend), and resolves a client\u2019s overall situation (e.g. residence, social environments /opportunities, occupations).  This MUST be absolutely tailored to each client and their wishes, and MUST be immediately available and affordable to everyone.  It must be provided by a coordinated team who properly profile clients\u2019 character, situation and social skills; and the team must provide detailed, timetabled plans of how and when they are going to satisfy clients\u2019 entire situation, social skills and life-quality wishes (if possible).  The team must resolve tailored social skills and situation as a whole of interdependent parts, with social skills broken down into specifics and taught in-situ.  There will be a charge to clients as it tailors to their wishes, and because there may be a big demand.",
