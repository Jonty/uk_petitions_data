        "additional_details": "Today, Monday 15th July, a cap on the benefits was introduced. This means that the maximum that someone can receive is \u00a3500/week (\u00a326,000 p/a) this is more than what many hard working people earn. The government introduced this cap to encourage people to get a job and go back to work, but instead it's reiterated the fact that most are better off claiming benefits and sitting at home watching 'Jeremy Kyle' and 'Loose Women' all day than getting a job and working for a living! The real problem is that this'll make their children think that it is ok to stay at home and sponge off the British Taxpayer!\r\n\r\nWhilst listening to the news on the radio, a woman on benefits was asked, \"What'll you cut back on?\" She replied \"I'd cut things like mobile phones or Sky and stuff like that\", she was then asked \"What kind of Sky package do you have?\" She answered \"At the moment, I have most of it!\". Most working people struggle to afford one 'extra' on Sky never mind most of them!",
