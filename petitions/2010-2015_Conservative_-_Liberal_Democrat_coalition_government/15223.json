It also creates a long break in the time that childrens minds are stimulated, and has a negative effect on the learning progression of young people.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, long summer holidays where children are bored and have nothing to do, also influence negative and antisocial behaviour.\r\n\r\nIt is about time that the academic year ran from January to December.
