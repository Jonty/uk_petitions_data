We are told that we can't be beautiful, happy or successful unless we buy, buy, buy. And because this industry produces nothing they have to do it all again tomorrow.\r\nBan all forms of advertising in all forms of media and let these feckless goons who pride themselves on their ability to shill do something useful for a change.",
