        "additional_details": "We British are a political bunch but we are more interested in issues than in parties. We may want to choose the party (or parties) of Government once every five years but we want to have our say on the issues we care about much more frequently. That is why we support single issue campaigns and join single issue pressure groups and charities. People want to contribute their passion, experience and knowledge to our national debate but our party-based Parliament shuts them out. We need to establish a third, issue-focussed, people's chamber in Parliament. Called College House, this chamber could meet once a month with a number of half hour sessions. Individuals and groups representing a range of issues could apply to use one of the sessions and become Parliamentarians for the day with the right to put a \"Proposal for Action\" to a Minister and to require a proper response.  This reform would open up Parliament, reflect the way we think about politics and produce better-informed Government.",
