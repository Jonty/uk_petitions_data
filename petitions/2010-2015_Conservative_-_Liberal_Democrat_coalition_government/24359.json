        "additional_details": "Every year babies die and others are brain damaged as a result of this condition which affects around 1 in 500 pregnancies. If diagnosed in pregnancy it can be treated with near 100% success. If not then 1 in 10 of these babies will die & 2 in 10 will have an intracranial haemorrhage that can leave them with brain damage. FNAIT can be screened for in pregnancy using the same blood sample that screens for Rhesus-D type but currently is not. The only women that are offered treatment for this condition are those who have already had an affected child or who have lost a baby to this condition. We would like all pregnant women to be screened for this condition.",
