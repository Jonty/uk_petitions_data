They are no more than 25 minutes walk from each other. The Scottish Catholic Bishops are proposing to move the older Historic Archives to Aberdeen University and to split the rest between eight diocesan centers, with inappropriate accommodation, little trained archival support and difficult access. It does not make sense!",
