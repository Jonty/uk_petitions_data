If there is to be a referendum to leave the EU, or even if there isn't, the public has to be taught about the stories the newspapers make up, falsify, and exaggerate about the European Union, so they can make an informed decision about whether to support the campaigns against membership of the organisation.\r\nThis can be done through a campaign to educate the public, or even by encouraging the creation of laws to make these tall stories illegal.",
