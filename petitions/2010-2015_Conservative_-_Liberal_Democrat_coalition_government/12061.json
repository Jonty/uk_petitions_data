        "additional_details": "All children/young adults should be prepared to give a year of their lives between school and university/job to the community. NOT military service, but something useful to show them that they have a role to play in society. If it's a gap year building hospitals in the third world or digging wells in Africa, then that's fine. If people don't want to go abroad, then clearing canals, restoring derelict buildings, reclaiming farmland could be some of the tasks to be attempted: leave school, do a year's work for the rest of your community, then get on with the rest of your life.",
