        "additional_details": "Every week in the UK at least 12 young people die of undiagnosed heart conditions - also known as SADS. In most cases, this is without any prior signs or symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is a simple way to diagnose and subsequently prevent most of these cardiac abnormalities. This is by having an ECG test and results read by a cardiologist.\r\n\r\nThese tests are not currently available under the NHS and many GP's are unaware of the condition. We want these to be made readily available under the NHS, and awareness of the condition advertised by the government.\r\n\r\nPlease add your name to this e- petition and spread the detail to anyone you know. We would like Her Majesty's Government to debate this important subject in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nScreening SAVES LIVES! And helps prevent terrible emotional distress to loved ones who lose a family member to SADS. The loss is not just to the loved ones but to the country.",
