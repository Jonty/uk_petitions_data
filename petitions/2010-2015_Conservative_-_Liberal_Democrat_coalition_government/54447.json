        "additional_details": "Ofqual has announced (29th August 2013) that it is stopping speaking and listening assessments from counting towards final grades in GCSE English and English language.\r\nA large number of students taking the English GCSE in June 2014 have already taken these assessments. This in effect means the time they have spent on this module is a complete waste of effort.\r\nThe changes form a part of a number of rushed proposals without proper consultation and notice. Ofqual and the Departments of Education seem unconcerned at the impact of these changes to teachers and students at such short notice.\r\nSyllabuses should be reviewed regularly to ensure that they are fit for purpose in a changing world.\r\nHowever it is not acceptable for the regulators and governments to change exam rules retrospectively for students in their final GCSE year who have completed the work.\r\nMichael Gove should prevent injustice for students and delay implementation of the proposed changes by one year to June 2015.\r\n",
