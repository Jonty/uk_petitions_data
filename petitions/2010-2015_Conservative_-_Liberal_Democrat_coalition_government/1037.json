        "additional_details": "On December 9th 2010, the university tuition fees cap was raised to \u00a39,000 for all courses and \u00a312,000 for some specialist courses. This should be reversed owing to the following circumstances:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Many Liberal Democrat MPs who voted for the new tuition fee rises signed pledges before the election stating that they would do the exact opposite- scrap them.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Despite the bill that allowed these rises their legitimacy stating that the charging of \u00a39000 should only be done in exceptional circumstances, statistics revealed recently showed that 1/3 of universities were counted as exceptional circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The 80% cuts in the Universities budget are forcing universities into charging way over the odds for their courses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action we would like the government to take is to set tuition fees back to the pre-rise limit of \u00a33000.",
