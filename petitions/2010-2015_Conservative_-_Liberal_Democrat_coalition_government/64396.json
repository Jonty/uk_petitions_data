Time for us to protect ourselves!\r\n\r\n14 000 stabbings a year\r\n\r\nGun crime increasing. Since gun ban, 5X more gun crime.\r\n\r\nRape, house robberies, muggings, violent drunk crime etc. is increasing. Time for a stop to DETER criminals.\r\n\r\nCriminals prefer unarmed citiziens. Easier to rob, kill, rape, beat up etc.\r\n\r\n*Should law abiding and non-mental people with serious problems be allowed to protect ourselves?\r\n",
