They consciously and deliberately take money from their victims with no intention of completing the work agreed causing their victims continuing unbearable emotional harm and accrued debt in the process and yet they are not punished or pursued by the law despite a court judgement clearly stating they should pay.\r\nWhy should the victims incur yet more legal expenses to bring a criminal back into the court system to enforce what the judicial system has already agreed?  The justice system should do so on the victim's behalf.  Currently, the criminals are free to live their lives as normal, all the richer for their encounters with innocent, law-abiding citizens.  The resulting suffering from these situations currently lies completely with the victims and not the criminals.  The criminals suffer no consequence for their actions.\r\n\r\n",
