Talking to the students there is no incentive for them to behave and follow the rules and get jobs rather than turning to crime.\r\n\r\nSome 'Youngsters' make mistakes when growing up. These mistakes can be costly as they end up doing something silly and will stay with them forever. If they got compulsory 'old school' National Service that allowed them to come out with a clean record and having learnt a trade (as an alternative to going to college) could set them up for the future.
