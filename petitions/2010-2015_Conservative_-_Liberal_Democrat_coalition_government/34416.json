        "additional_details": "Petition to ban all Syrian athletes from entering the UK to compete in the Olympics, or similar measures with the result being that Syria play no part in the London Olympics.\r\n\r\nThis is in response to the Syrian governments atrocities committed recently against its own people. Sporting and cultural events are often used by dictatorships as propaganda to support their regimes - as evidenced by 'Hitler's Olympics', or even the recent Eurovision contest in Azerbaijan.\r\n\r\nEvidence of 'Sporting Isolationism' working can be found in the contribution of it being used to protest against Apartheid in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThis inexpensive method can be used by the UK to demonstrate we are a tolerant, human society - and, more importantly, to isolate the Syrian regime, and condemn its actions.\r\n\r\nFrom the time this ePetition is submitted (27th May), we have two months until the start of the Olympics. Please sign and pass it on.",
