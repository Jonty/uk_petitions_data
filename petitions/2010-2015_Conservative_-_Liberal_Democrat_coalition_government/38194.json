        "additional_details": "There is, at the time of writing, a public consultation on whether or not to have a mandatory ISP filter for blocking adult content. This filter can be turned off only on request, and there is currently nothing to specify what is and isn't adult. Potentially the vast majority of the internet could be shut down. The response form applies only to parents, those who work with children, and businesses, and does not take into account the opinions of everyone else who will be affected, hence this petition.\r\nWe propose that the Government scrap the whole idea. It is the responsibilty of the parents, and no-one else, to decide what children are exposed to. In fact, censorship can be demonstrated to have the reverse effect: the \"Streisand Effect\", increasing interest in the subject.\r\nAny censorship of the Internet is an attack on free speech, and a breach of Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and potentially also Article 27 (1)",
