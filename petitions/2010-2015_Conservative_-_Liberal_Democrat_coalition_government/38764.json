This movie is totally outrageous and utterly despicable - I have never seen anything like it in my life. Violent protests have erupted across Egypt and Libya.\r\n\r\nAs Muslims, we love all the Messengers of God - including Jesus, Moses and Noah - and we would never tolerate an attack on any one of them. But the Messenger Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has a very special place in our hearts, and we love him more than our mothers and fathers and the whole of humanity.\r\n",
