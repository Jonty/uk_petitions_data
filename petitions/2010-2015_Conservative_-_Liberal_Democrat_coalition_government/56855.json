        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls on the government to remove its unwarranted restrictions on British citizens to negotiate contracts with annual increments in the public sector.  The current governments intentions and action in this area are a clear breach of my rights as a British citizen and EU citizen to have freedom of employment and work, and to negotiate contractually about pay, holidays and other remuneration, by restricting my rights to negotiate or maintain existing contractual arrangement for annual increments with an employer such as local authority or nhs trust.  My employer is not the British government and they have no right to restrict my contracts under existing European and British law.  Any such attempt by the current government is unlawful and unconstitutional as it restricts my rights to freedom of trade.",
