Bicester, at weekends and Bank Holidays, is a no go area for Bicester residents because of the horrendous traffic and they park in the middle of the road, on grass verges and even between parking cones. Bicester residents deserve better than this. We, the residents of Bicester, do not want any more expansion of Bicester Village until these issues are resolved.",
