        "additional_details": "Lexi was born at Hillingdon Hospital and due to complications was left severely brain damaged after birth. Her mother Siobhan Rowland suffered from Placental abruption, which led to Lexi being starved of oxygen. Lexi suffers from daily seizures and is dependent on a tube to receive medicines and nutrients that help keep her alive. Siobhan needs a home, which will provide space the family need for Lexi, her equipment and medicines, however they have been placed on the wrong and lower banding by the borough of Hillingdon Council and are still waiting to be homed! Please help get Lexi and her family get the disabled friendly home she requires as a matter of urgency, otherwise she will be put into care on her discharge date, despite Siobhan doing everything she can to try and get homed correctly!",
