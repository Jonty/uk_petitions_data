        "additional_details": "On 19th May Wandle Housing Association contacted its buyers of Shared Ownership properties in the new Streatham Hub development and informed them that despite agreeing to a price and taking \u00a3500 deposit they would be increasing the prices for the properties. In some cases the increase was over 50%. Sadly this was completely legal despite being extremely unethical.\r\nGazumping is common amongst private sale but we thing this is the first time a Housing Association has done this. Sadly buyers have no protection from this unethical behaviour.\r\nThe \u2018would be\u2019 residents of Derry Court, ask that you sign this petition to stop this. The property laws in England should be reviewed and changed to protect buyers once an agreed offer has been formally accepted.\r\n",
