        "additional_details": "It's simple... teaching and learning should be at the forefront of all stakeholders involved in education; the irony is teachers no longer have time to focus on what's important- teaching itself!! Our time is consumed by admin, a million other jobs and a great amount of marking. This petition is requesting that all teachers are timetabled to have a 4 day teaching week and still be in on the 5th day but be timetabled in a way that this 5th day is kept for planning lessons, admin related tasks and marking; this way our workload will not impede on our weekend and weekday evenings, which in result will allow us to maintain a healthy work/ life balance. Every teacher within a school could have a different 'Admin Day', hence not affecting the general day to day running of the school. It's a win win situation for everyone involved that will really raise standards across the board! ",
