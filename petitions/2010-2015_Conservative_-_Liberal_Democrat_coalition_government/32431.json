This is scandalous given that for many,  aged 80 and over, their chances of ongoing foreign travel will be significantly reduced due age related problems, making it unlikely that they will benefit from a 10 year passport.\r\n\r\nThe Government should allow free biannual passports for all persons aged 80 or over.
