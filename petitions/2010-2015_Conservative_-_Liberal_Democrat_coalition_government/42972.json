        "additional_details": "Preston City Council and Lancashire County Council are attempting to demolish Preston Bus Station. They claim it would be cheaper to demolish it and replace with a smaller facility, despite figures indicating that it would be cheaper to retain and refurbish. Preston Bus Station is on the World Heritage Watch List, for British brutalist buildings in danger. A large proportion of Preston citizens are in favour of keeping it, and the city council voted against holding a referendum despite a petition being presented to them.\r\n\r\nThe government should take measures to save this building, as it is part of city\u2019s heritage. It should be listed as a fine example of 1960/70s modernist architecture. There is precedence for the listing with the recent listing of the Pennine Tower at Forton services. There is also a large Facebook campaign in favour of retention:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/saveprestonbusstation\r\n",
