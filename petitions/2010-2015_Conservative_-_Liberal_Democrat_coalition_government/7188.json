        "additional_details": "This is to e-petition the HM Goverment to think about as i have for many years to fully arm our Police forces & stop them from going to gun fights without any. As an example its a well known fact about 3 unarmed Police officers got close enough to shoot the Whitehaven gunman before he left the town to carry on his killing spree.\r\n We are one of the only Countries left who havnt got fully armed police on the streets & i know not everyone will agree with this. We have to get over the country cottage life thing & 'they'll only take guns to robberies' as they do it already.Lets give a bit of respect back to all our officers we send out to our streets, sometimes warzones !\r\nThank you.",
