But taxes keep our society running. They keep the lights on, ensure that the sick are taken care of, provide education for our children, and myriad other things.\r\n\r\nThere is much talk about not raising taxes too much. We're warned that high earners will leave the country unless we lower their tax burden.\r\n\r\nBut why not change the discussion? Let's honour the members of society who pay the highest taxes. Let it be a competition to see who gives back the most to society. Taxes are too often phrased as a punishment and a burden, but by giving OBEs to the most highly taxed, let's offer a reward and change the discussion about what taxation means. In doing so, we won't have to worry about the richest members of society fleeing after they make their first million. We should instead make them proud to give back to the society that enabled them to succeed.",
