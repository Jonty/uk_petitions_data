Thousands of peaceful protesters have gone to the streets to demand democracy in Hong Kong. Anti-riot squads have been sent and police are escalating violence against protesters.\r\n\r\nFreedom of speech, expression and demonstration are protected by international and domestic law (Basic Laws, Article 27).
