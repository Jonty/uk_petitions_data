        "additional_details": "Please sign this e-petition if you feel it's about time Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council did something about the state of Princess Margaret Way and its run down, derelict buildings previously named \"Hollywood Park\" as well as the fire damaged Aquadome.  Since 2006 when the \"Bowling Alley\" was meant to open things have got worse and worse, with the closure of Burger King franchise in 2007, the Burger Knight franchise in 2009, the fire at The Aquadome in December 2009 which has seen the complete closure of the entire complex, and The Water Margin in 2011..... What's left for the kids of Port Talbot as well as tourism ... one 6 screen cinema, an ice cream parlour and a small selection of bars/pubs/restaurants!!\r\n\r\nIt's time for this entire area to receive a whole new lease of life for towns people and to bring the tourists back to the area that Michael Sheen attracted during \"The Passion\"",
