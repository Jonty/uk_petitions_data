        "additional_details": "Rehabilitation & detox programmes for alcoholics are often not cost effective and NHS guidelines should not allow money spent on them, due to their high regression rate. From my experience, the only way for alcoholics to give up alcohol completely (i.e. teetotal) is when they actually wanted to do so. The adage that \u2018you are flogging a dead horse\u2019 comes to mind. No one can force a person to voluntarily not to drink alcohol unless he/she genuinely cognitively desires not to and therefore have a real aversion towards alcohol. If a recovering alcoholic have a genuine aversion towards alcohol in his or her own mind (cognitively) than it is certain that he or she is no longer a RECOVERING alcoholic but a 100% RECOVERED one from my experience. Perceptions of the pleasures of drinking alcohol (heavily, moderately or occasionally) would usually depend on one\u2019s perceptions, motivation, aims, habits, triggers, reinforcers, settings, lifestyle and psychological & physical cravings.",
