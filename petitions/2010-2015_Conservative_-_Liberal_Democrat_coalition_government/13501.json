        "additional_details": "The River Severn in Shrewsbury town centre has always been a saftey risk. Large parts of the river in the Town Centre are adjacent to pedestrian walkways and have no fencing allowing for someone to stumble and fall into the river. We, the people of Shrewsbury and surrounding areas, demand that the Council acknowledge this issue and place adequate fencing, primarily on Victoria Avenue and the walkway from the English Bridge to the Weir, to provide protection should somebody fall. We also demand a re-think into CCTV and other life saving measures so deaths can be prevented in the River Severn.",
