        "additional_details": "Why are the products that are best for the environment and us usually the most expensive to purchase?  It's not right that in order to have morals and a conscience you also need a deep wallet.  For instance nappies, a regular mainstream brand of nappy takes 400 years to biodegrade and these are considerably cheaper than the biodegradable nappies.  I would like the government to start giving financial aid to the companies who produce products that are not harming our environment.  A way to do this is to heavily tax those products that have no concern for the planet and this additional revenue can be used to help those who do.  Hopefully this will in turn encourage all companies to think about the bigger picture and not just the bottom line.  It is the duty of all of us to protect our planet for the future.  ",
