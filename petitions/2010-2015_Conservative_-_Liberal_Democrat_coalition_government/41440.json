        "additional_details": "The comment made by Mr David Cameron on ITV about a \"Witch Hunt\" on Gays is out right disgraceful! Peadophillia is not related to a sexual orientation. Why did he use this comment, steering peadophillia towards GAY people only? Further more, why has he not made an immediate apology to the general public? Mr Cameron has officially made a discriminating comment live on TV suggesting that GAY people are peadophiles. When Mr Philip Schofield handed Mr Cameron a \"List\" of potential MP peadophiles, Mr Cameron made this remark, without even looking at the list, so therefore would not of known whether the list contained Gay MP's. I ask for you to sign this petition in support of all Gay people within and outside of the UK & a full explanation from Mr Cameron as to why he felt the need to use sexual orientation in relation to a criminal investigation. I thought the days had past that Gay people were still dicriminated against, let alone from our own Prime Minister!",
