While we\u2019re approaching our table two people come in and they go to the counter:\r\n\u2018Five coffees, please. Two of them for us and three suspended\u2019\r\nSuddenly a man dressed in shabby clothes who looks like a beggar comes in through the door and kindly asks\r\n\u2018Do you have any suspended coffee?\u2019\r\nIt\u2019s simple - people pay in advance for a coffee meant for someone who can not afford a warm beverage. The tradition with the suspended coffees started in Naples, but it has spread all over the world and in some places you can order not only a suspended coffee, but also a sandwich or a whole meal.",
