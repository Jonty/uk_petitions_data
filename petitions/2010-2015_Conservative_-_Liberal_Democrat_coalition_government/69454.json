The UK should take this opportunity to totally overhaul the Constitution, and ensure that all domestic nations are bound to each other in perpetuity on an equal balance. The current system is archaic and unfair to all constituent countries (England, Wales, Scotland and N Ireland) and urgent consideration should be given to a federal system of government with central London government only responsible for big ticket items - defence, foreign policy, security, immigration, federal taxes, state policing and major transportation.\r\nThe current government should ensure that all parties abide by this and ensure that this is the first action point of any new government post May 2015 elections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
