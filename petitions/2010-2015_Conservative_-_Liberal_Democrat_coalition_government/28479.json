        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Reinstate Assisted Dartford Crossing Escort Patrols (radcep).\r\n\r\nThese escort Patrols, for the QE2 Bridge and Tunnels, were discontinued on the 31st July 2009 (decision made 2nd July 2009 without any written facts), by the Highways Agency (HA), after 40 years of continual service, without incident.\r\n\r\nThey stated this assistance was withdrawn by them on advice from the DVLA & Police but this has proved to be totally false.  HA finally stated, no requirement under legislation.\r\n\r\nDVLA confirmed a Fear of Heights and Claustrophobia are not reportable.\r\n\r\nThe HA have stated it did not save on costs or staff, as fitted in with their duties.\r\n\r\nThe service just being there gave people the confidence to use this part of the National Road Network, withdrawal of which adversely affects drivers, their families, relatives, friends and businesses.\r\n\r\nThank you for signing this petition to reinstate escort service, whether a driver or passenger.\r\n",
