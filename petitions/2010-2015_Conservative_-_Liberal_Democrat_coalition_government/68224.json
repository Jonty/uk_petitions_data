        "additional_details": "To stop further Islamisation of England. No flying of ANY foreign flags allowed on English town halls as has been the case this week. Living in this country everyone should respect and abide by English laws and customs, including halal not being forced upon us.  British laws should not be added to by foreign law (sharia). Stop discriminative workplaces recruiting from within own (foreign) culture. Muslim patrols should be actively combated by police. English women/girls are not safe in areas like Ilford or Tower Hamlets anymore. Signs in parks such as Victoria Park London put by muslims banning people taking their dogs into parks should be stopped and Star City shopping centre in Birmingham banning non muslims as these are \"muslim areas\".  My grandfather & father fought in world wars to keep England Christian and free.  Lets not make this a waste of time for them and the thousands more who died. Shame on the government of today for letting these brave Englishmen fight and die in vain.",
