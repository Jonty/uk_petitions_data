Now is the time for the UK to be a leader in unifying efforts to create a legitimate mining sector that benefits the people of Congo.\r\n\r\nThe Congolese Diaspora in the UK requires an open and free debate.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Congolese Diaspora, leaders of the private sector, and non-governmental organisations are all taking action and agree certification is a necessary next step to help stem the violence fuelled by minerals in the DRC \u2013 and that the UK must play a leading role.\r\n\r\nWe call on you to organise a debate on the floor of the House and to bring together senior executives of end-user companies, industry groups, Congolese civil society, and regional political leaders to create a single, comprehensive international certification system. Your leadership is essential to driving consensus towards a transparent and credible process.\r\n",
