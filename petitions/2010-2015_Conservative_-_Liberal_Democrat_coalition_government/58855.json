        "action": "Remove all executive authority from the Prime Minister and put it back, where it should be, in Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "Our utterly corrupt system of patronage in our now defunct democratic system means there is nobody below the Prime Minister who does not owe his/her current and future financial wellbeing to that Prime Minster.  The result is that recent Prime Ministers, Blair, Brown and exponentionally more so with the current one, Cameron, have completely subsumed representation of the people to running the Government like a dictator - because nobody dare stand up to him for fear of retribution.  THAT IS NOT DEMOCRACY and the people MUST be given an opportunity to vote on the scrapping of all Prime Ministerial authorities in favour of political action based on the wishes of the people of this country.",
