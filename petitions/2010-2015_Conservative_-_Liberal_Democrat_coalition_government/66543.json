The Government needs to take action now and put reforms in place to significantly improve the level of care and safeguards in care homes.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to urgently address the issue of regulation of care staff, this has been discussed before but action needs to be taken now. There needs to be a formal regulation of anyone working in social care with an appropriate code of conduct.\r\n\r\nCare staff need to have access to extra training, support and guidance to help them perform their jobs to the highest standard.\r\n\r\nThe Government also needs to look at the care regulators, there needs to be more stringent inspections and more enforcement powers to ensure that care homes do not slip through the gap and avoid taking action against poor care.\r\n",
