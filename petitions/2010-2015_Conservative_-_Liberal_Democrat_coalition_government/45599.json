From Anorexia to Psychosis to Depression, the services for adults at the moment is rubbish in certain areas. I want to get the same amount of help and at the same level in all areas of the UK.\r\nIn every town!\r\nI also want them to focus on the transition from adolescents to adults services because that is also lacking.\r\nPlease sign and help me realize this dream. I've had to suffer and i refuse to allow anyone else to if i can change it.\r\nThank you.\r\nSophie ",
