The majority of the \"looters\" from recent riots are under 18, and therefore face referral orders.\r\n\r\nI believe they should not only have referral orders but also have the jail time they would have received had they been over 18, applied once they turn 18.\r\n\r\nSimply put, offenders who are underage, do their time for their crime when they're 18. Would only take a few cases of this actually being carried out to make them realise they will always pay for their crime, eventually.\r\n\r\nSimples.",
