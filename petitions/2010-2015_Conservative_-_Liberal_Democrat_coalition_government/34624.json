It is very difficult for individuals to trace, or be removed from, the many mailing lists which result from such data harvesting.\r\n\r\nThe law should be changed so that, unless an individual has specifically opted-in to receiving marketing and other such unsolicited information (by simply contacting a company or entity this does not automatically assume an opt-in), it is assumed that they have opted-out and no unsolicited contact is to be made.",
