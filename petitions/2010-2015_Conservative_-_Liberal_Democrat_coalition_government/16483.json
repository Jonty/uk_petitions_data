        "additional_details": "Mark has several brain tumours and during the past 5- 6 years has had three major operations and radiotherapy.\r\n\r\nRecently his problem worsened and he was informed that treatment could not be continued because he lives in Gainsborough.\r\n\r\nThis young man is in his thirties, has a wife and two small kids. He spent 10 years in the British Army serving several tours in Northern Island - he has served his country and we think he deserves better!\r\n\r\nPlease complete the below petition and hopefully we can get this injustice reversed!",
