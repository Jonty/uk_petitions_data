        "action": "Change Universal Credit to help self-employed single parents",
        "additional_details": "Universal Credit will soon be used across the whole of the UK. The goal of Universal Credit is to help more people get in to work and make it more profitable to be working than to be on benefits, which is great for those who go out to work. The problems arise when single parents either are already running their own business or plan to start up their own business.  Single parents have to earn minimum wage within the first year or they will be pushed to go out to work.  This is completely contradictory as to how the UK government presents it's attitude to self-employment, openly vocally supporting people who have inventive and self motivation to run their own business and potentially creating more jobs for people in the future.\r\n\r\nI, and those who have signed this petition, urge David Cameron and the UK Government to give more financial support for self employed single parents and an increase in the amount of time given for their business to be making minimum wage.
