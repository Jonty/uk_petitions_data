It also has members and supporters from campaign groups and advocacy organisations from across the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Advisory Panel on Deaths in Custody report published in 2011 states: in total, there were 5,998 deaths recorded for the 11 years from 2000 to 2010. This is an average of 545 deaths per year.  Despite the fact there have been 11 unlawful killing verdicts since 1990 there has never been a successful prosecution.",
