        "additional_details": "Depression is becoming a recognized thing but only gradually. Many people still feel this stigma is too delicate to talk about outside of therapy. In my opinion one of the main causes of depression is the increasingly hectic world we live in, for example; how hard it can be to find a job compared to years gone by. This is accepted as modern life so Depression should be as well. Help me to raise this subject with the government so that mental health is not discriminated against. It has worked with other forms of disability so why not Depression?",
