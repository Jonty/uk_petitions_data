We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nThere is irrefutable evidence that we are sending bucketsful of taxpayer pounds to GoodLuck Jonathan who it is known is involved with corruption and terrorism.  We have no control over money given to corrupt leaders so we need you to tell us just how much of what we give to him is going to pay for the activities of Boko Haram, who you are spending much of your time decrying as a vile organisation - while you use our money to pay for its continuing existence.",
