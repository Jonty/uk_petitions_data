Often times the non-resident parent doesn't contribute to these costs and court proceedings to increase this CMS for a child in childcare is persued. It often is an elongated process that is avoidable.\r\n\r\nWhen CMS applications are made the calculation should include a minimum of 50% cost for registered childcare provision for children in childcare.\r\n",
