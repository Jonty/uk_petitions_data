        "additional_details": "This is a petition calling for the abolition of the television license. The BBC is the largest media monopoly in the United Kingdom, it's overarching reach is a detriment to the private sector and acts a barrier to competition. The TV license is an unfair tax and funding for the BBC's funding should be changed to either a model funded by advertising and/or on a subscription basis.",
