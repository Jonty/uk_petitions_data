In order to do this, the Government will need to change the law!  That's right, the Government will change our laws to legalise the sale of our data.\r\n\r\nDo you think this is correct?\r\nDo you think this is good use of our legal system?\r\nDo you want your data (your personal data) to be sold?\r\n\r\nIf not, please sign this petition - it will take a couple of minutes!  Petitions DO WORK, so please share, pass on ... and sign!\r\n\r\nWith absolute appreciation,\r\n\r\nScott Kemp",
