        "additional_details": "I feel \"Rule, Britannia\" is a more fitting song for the British national anthem as it is more patriotic and specific to this island. We share Queen Elizabeth II with 15 countries and therefore \"God Save Our Queen\" isn't  specific to this island, in fact I wouldn't even call it patriotic, it only talks about the Head of State and not the culture of this island. \"Rule, Britannia\" expresses our history as both an imperial power and seafaring nation, both of which with have loosely held on to, up until the 21st Century with the Commonwealth of Nations still intact and a navy that could only be defeated by the US. This song seems more patriotic and more specific to our island and expresses our culture.",
