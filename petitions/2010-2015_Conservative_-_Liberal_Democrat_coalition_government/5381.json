The actual Sky deal though is quite clever and I think to myself, if PPV TV can buy F1 Sporting Rights then 'share' it with a Free-To-Air Channel, then why not do it with others? May I suggest at least One England Test Per Series be Broadcast Live on Free-To-Air, at least 20 Premiership Football Matches and 20 Championship/Division One/Division Two Matches per season, One Guiness Premiership (Rugby Union) Game a week (and all European Challenge Cup Games) and one Super League (Rugby League) Game a week. It's not too much to ask is it?",
