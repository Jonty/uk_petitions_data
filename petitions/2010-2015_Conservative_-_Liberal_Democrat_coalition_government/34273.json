        "additional_details": "Hughes syndrome, known medically as antiphospholipid syndrome - is a potentially life threatening blood clotting disorder. Patients often suffer a variety of symptoms such as memory loss, overwhelming fatigue, balance problems, vision disturbances and migraines. It causes a pre-disposition to blood clots which can cause potentially fatal events such as strokes, seizures, heart attacks and multiple pregnancy loss. This disease can affect people in extremely different ways (the causes of which are still unknown) but many people are far too ill to work or even get out of bed on some days. This is in stark contrast to the views of insurers (life, health, travel, etc) who often won't insure patients due to the condition being potentially life threatening. There needs to be better recognition for the condtion and related conditons such as lupus and Sjogren's syndrome across the state departments and funding for further research to save or improve people's lives.",
