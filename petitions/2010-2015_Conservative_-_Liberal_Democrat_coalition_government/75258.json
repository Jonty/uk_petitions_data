It should be possible to borrow as much as you need from Student Finance England and be independent from your parents and not have to potentially jeopardise your degree by working part time to support yourself. Not all parents who earn above \u00a342000 have the spare thousands of pounds to support their children.\r\nThe government should allow all students to borrow a fair and equal amount from SFE and stop giving away free money to students from poorer households.",
