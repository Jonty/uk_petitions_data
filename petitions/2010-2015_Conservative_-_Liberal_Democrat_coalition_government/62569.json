        "action": "Stop train operating companies using vouchers as compensation for delays",
        "additional_details": "When trains are delayed, most train operating companies (TOCs) provide compensation under the terms of their Passenger's Charters. In some cases, this can be as much as the full cost of the ticket.\r\n\r\nMany of them currently provide this compensation in the form of travel vouchers, redeemable only against future travel (usually limited to 12 months).\r\n\r\nThis is unfair because:\r\n\r\n1. It  is useless to occasional passengers who do not travel frequently.\r\n\r\n2. It can only be redeemed in person at a ticket office, not by telephone or online.\r\n\r\n3. A special visit must be made to a station to redeem it against an advance (cheaper) fare.\r\n\r\n4. The cost of a voucher to the TOC is negligible in comparison to a proper refund.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call on the Department of Transport to force train operating companies to provide delay compensation to passengers in the same form as the original payment (e.g. debit card refund, cash, cheque) not by issuing paper vouchers.\r\n",
