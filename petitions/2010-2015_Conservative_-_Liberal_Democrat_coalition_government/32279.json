Dnt want a sham-marriage 2 get my vote.\r\n\r\n90% of British-born and bred citizens failed the CItizenship test (see CH4)\r\n\r\nI believe the test is on purpose discriminating against non-British citizens (eg Q: \"Ulster Scots is a dialect which is spoken in Northern Ireland\"\r\n\r\nNow ask yourselves do I need 2 know about Ulster Scots (spk by less 0.2%) b4 I can choose a political party? IS THIS FAIR?\r\n\r\nThese amongst MANY other errors in t'test make it a de-facto discriminatory tool to prevent me from my simple demand for my hardly-earned vote.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ukcitizenshiptest.co.uk/\r\n",
