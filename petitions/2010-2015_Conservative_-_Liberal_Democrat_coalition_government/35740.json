        "additional_details": "The Coalition Government is regressing 20 years in their definition and threshold for Child Emotional Abuse. Ignoring the previous comprehensive guidance and reinstating an ambiguous interpretation will no doubt see children \u201cat risk\u201d slip through the net.\r\nIt will fail to account for\r\nPreventing children to feel worthy\r\nPreventing the child participating in normal social interaction\r\nSeeing or hearing the ill-treatment of another\r\nSerious bullying (including cyber-bullying)\r\nExploitation or corruption of children\r\n\r\nWithout guidance around a child\u2019s self worth, the effects that domestic abuse has on a child, isolation and politicianry, the Coalition Government is taking away children\u2019s rights to support and safety. For children where emotional abuse does \u201coccur alone\u201d the threshold appears too hazy for any child to receive the protection they deserve.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask the Coalition Government to review the definition and threshold for Emotional Abuse.",
