The aim of this petition is to get Southend-On-Sea A New skatepark closer to the town centre!\r\n\r\nThe urban sports within southend over the years has contunied to grow. After numerous attempts to ask the Council for a new skatepark we have had little or no reply.\r\n\r\nWithin the local area of Southend there are a number of skateparks but Sadly they are poorly maintained or are too dangerous to go.\r\n\r\nI feel that a new skatepark would not only attact more people of our sport to the town but it would also give the Skaters, Scooters, And Bmxers a place to go.
