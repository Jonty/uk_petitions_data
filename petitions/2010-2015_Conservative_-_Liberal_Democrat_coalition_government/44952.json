We understand that our teachers will look through our creative writing pieces from previous years but we also know that there is not a S.A.T.S. paper for this subject which upsets us  (and many others) quite a bit. Also, many children in our school are considering a career as authors and we have made a lot of progress in our creative writing and know that many others have as well, but what is the use if there is not a paper for it\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nBluebelle Carroll, Ruby Fredericks, Dora Goudy, Ambrin Shafiq, Alice Perves from Eleanor Palmer School in Camden and on behalf of all the children across the land.",
