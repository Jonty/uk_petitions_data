        "additional_details": "A&E Nurses and Paramedics are currently band 5. The role of Paramedics and A&E Nurses has become one of great responsibility; one that exceeds that of other NHS staff working under band 5. Paramedics have skills in ECG interpretation, needle thoracentesis, needle cricothyroidotomy and intraosseus cannulation, as well as extended assessment skills. Similarly, A&E nurses have extended assessment and triage skills, not to mention the abillity to deal with challenging and abusive patients. None of these things are routinely required of other band 5 professionals; these are additional skills that carry further responsibility and are seemingly unrecognised by the NHS. It has been argued that we do not have a specialty and this is why it is not band 6. Emergency care requires a comprehensive knowledge, and should be a recognised specialty. Let's get the NHS to recognise the hard work and dedication that it takes to be an A&E Nurse or Paramedic, and have them paid fairly.",
