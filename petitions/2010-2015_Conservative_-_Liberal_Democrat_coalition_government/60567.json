Fewer brown trout means fewer sea-trout.\r\n5.\tYoungsters will not be tempted to fish our rivers for brown trout with such poor stocks.\r\n6.\tWe owe it to future generations to reverse this decline as habitat improvement alone will not repair the damage already done.\r\n\r\nLet us be allowed to improve the future of brown trout fishing in England and Wales for future generations by supplementing and improving brown trout stocks.\r\n",
