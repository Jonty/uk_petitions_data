        "additional_details": "Many people in the UK are 2nd or 3rd generation recipients of benefits and have no concept of work ethic; many are heard to complain that there aren't any jobs.  Yet every year, immigrants flock to the UK and find work.\r\n\r\nThe benefits system should be structured in such a way that no family should ever receive more money per month than they can earn in a job.  This could be either by curtailing the amount of unemployment benefit / housing benefit any family receives, or structuring benefits in such a way that families do not recieve money, but rather are provided with the very basics that they need to get by (weekly food parcel, second hand clothing, electricity cards etc).",
