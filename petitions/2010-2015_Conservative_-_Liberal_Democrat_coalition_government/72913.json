        "additional_details": "This petition is part of a growing campaign for Northern Rail to be held accountable for a generation of unacceptable public service on key commuter lines in Greater Manchester. The signatories of this petition want the issue of Northern Rail's poor service to be raised in parliament and are hoping to raise awareness of the train operator's ineptitude so that it does not receive another extension to its contract after 2016.\r\n\r\nWe would love all of our petition's signatories to also join our Facebook group and share their pictures and stories:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/No-More-Northern-Rail/1513076038963456?fref=ts\r\n\r\nWith success stories such as the East Coast Main Line currently in the news, it is more evident than ever that the current system based on doling out long-term contracts to private enterprises with little obligations to their customers is not the way forward. No more Northern Rail and no more of this nonsense: join us in our fight for social justice!\r\n\r\n",
