        "additional_details": "Responsible department: Department for Culture, Media and Sport\r\n\r\nThe government is currently trying to push a bill forcing ISPs to provide opt-out pornography filtering. However, I believe strongly that this could open people in certain jobs and walks of life to persecution if it became knowledge that they were 'opting in' to pornography. Such as teachers of small children or people that are in religious careers.\r\n\r\nInstead, I would like to urge the government to pursue an 'opt out' policy. So that people that want to limit pornographic content  to their home can do so, but so that there is no risk of persecution. ",
