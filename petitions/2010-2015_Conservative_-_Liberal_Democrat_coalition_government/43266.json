        "additional_details": "The Civil Aviation Authority(CAA) is responsible for the regulation of UK airspace and issues all aircrew and air traffic controller medicals and licences.The CAA chose to adopt new protocols in 2012 in order to comply with legislation from Europe under a new pan-European regulatory body, EASA. Other countries aviation authorities will wait until 2014.The CAA has chosen to implement EASA rules and practices with insufficient resources and understanding of the effects of implementation that has led to unacceptable delays in the issuing of aircrew and air traffic controller medical certificates and licences. This has resulted in additional expenditure for these personnel and is not acceptable since there is no alternative but to deal with the regulatory authority. The Government should review the status of the CAA, it's suitability for purpose and recommend a path to success for full implementation of EASA rules.",
