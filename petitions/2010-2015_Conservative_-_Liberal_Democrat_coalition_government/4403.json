        "additional_details": "The government has decided that a number of major UK coastguard stations should be closed arguing that fewer stations can cope with the workload. This fails to take account of the vital local knowledge of coastguard station staff who can direct emergency services directly and quickly to incidents where lives are at stake. More remote stations (often hundreds of miles away from the scene of an emergency) do not have this knowledge. In order to prevent unnecessary and avoidable loss of life the government must keep all coastguard stations operational.",
