        "additional_details": "On February 2, 2012, Top Totty beer was removed from the menu of Stranger's Bar in the Houses of Parliament because one Labour MP - namely Kate Green - was said to be \"disturbed\" by its presence at the pump.\r\n\r\nThe Daily Telegraph reported:\r\n\r\nClaire Fox, the director of the Insititute of Ideas and a regular panellist on the Radio 4\u2019s Moral Maze, wrote on Twitter: \u201cWhat really demeans women: idea we\u2019ve no sense of humour and MPs acting as sanctimonious killjoys in our name.\u201d\r\n\r\nTracey Crouch, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford, added: \u201cWhy is a beer called Top Totty offensive & now banned from Commons? Not as if it is called Middle-Ranking Totty?\u201d\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, want common-sense to prevail, and for this beer to be reinstated into Strangers Bar as soon as possible.",
