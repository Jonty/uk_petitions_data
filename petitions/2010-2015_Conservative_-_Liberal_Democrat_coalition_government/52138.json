As parents we want to be kept informed, but we don't need pages and pages of unnecessary verbiage that clearly take many hours to produce. We are grateful to the teachers for the job they do for our children, and hope that by reducing this burden they can concentrate more on their actual jobs.\r\nThe quantification-creep needs to be curtailed as it is causing stress for very little gain.",
