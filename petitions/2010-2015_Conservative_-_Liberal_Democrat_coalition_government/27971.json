        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would urge the government to reconsider their decision to refuse planning permission to 'Project Pinewood': a project that would generate jobs and housing for the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the project would create 1,000 permanent jobs and inject \u00a33.8bn into the economy over 30 years.\r\n\r\nWe would ask the government to meet with figures from the industry and to show proof that they have spent time reconsidering their decision to deny planning permission. Ultimately, we would ask that the decision is reversed and that planning permission is granted for this exciting project.\r\n",
