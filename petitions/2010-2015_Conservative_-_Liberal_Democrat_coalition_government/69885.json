        "action": "The renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system should be cancelled. The weapons should immediately be removed from the Clyde.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system is a scandalous waste of public money at a lifetime cost of \u00a3100 billion. We the undersigned call on the UK Government to immediately halt the process to renew this dangerous weapons system and redistribute the proposed spending to other areas.\r\nWe also call on these weapons of mass destruction to be removed from the Clyde. We do not want to live in close proximity to nuclear weapons, or be a 'first strike target' in the event of a war. We want our children to be safe. Scotland, its people, land, livestock, water and wildlife would be the most affected by a nuclear accident at HMNB Clyde, which would take generations to clear if at all. We demand that the Westminster Parliament consider our rights to life in safety and without fear of nuclear weapons.",
