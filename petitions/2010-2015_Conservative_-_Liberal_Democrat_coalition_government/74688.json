        "additional_details": "Nearly half of cars, motorbikes and vans broke the 70 mph UK motorway speed limit in 2013, according to official Department for Transport statistics.\r\n\r\nCars today are much safer and stopping distances are massively reduced at the same speeds due to new technology in cars.\r\n\r\nMotorways and engineering have also improved over the years with new measures and designs to prevent flooding and improve overall saftey.\r\n\r\nThe police do not often stop cars they catch doing 80 mph.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to raise  the governments awareness of car safety today and ask them to increase the speed limit to 80 mph on UK roads.",
