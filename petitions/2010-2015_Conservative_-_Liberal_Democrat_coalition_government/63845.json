        "additional_details": "A petition to create a National Print-Disabled Archive facility at the British Library to permanently store all publications as electronic source files making them available to registered print-disabled residents.\r\n\r\nOver 2 million visually-impaired UK residents have limited access to reading material from libraries or publishers, putting them at educational and vocational disadvantage. The Archive would serve as a national trusted intermediary between publishers and service users, managed by the British Library.\r\n\r\nCampaign Objectives\r\n1) Establish the NPDA within the British Library, to serve as a central location where present and future publications will be stored electronically.\r\n2) Equip the Archive so it can produce any accessible format standard required by print-disabled members.\r\n3) Amend the UK Equality Act 2010, to make UK publishers legally responsible for providing future reading material to the NPDA; removing the allowance for providers to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d.",
