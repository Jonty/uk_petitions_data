        "additional_details": "This is a petition to sentence parents who flaunt court orders to prison time, if a parent is granted a contact order in a court of law it should be upheld for the sake of the child, its becoming more and more common for parents who have  worked tirelessly through heartbreak and hell to get an order, which is put in place for the sake of the child, just for it to be ignored like it means nothing, this causes stress to both the child and the parent desperate to see their children. Its common knowledge that nothing is ever done to punish these types of parents and it needs to be stopped immediately.\r\nif an order is broken more than once, these parents need to go to prison, just like they would if they broke bail conditions or any other kind of court order, help fix it for all parents to see there kids fairly without pain and suffering. The thought of prison should make them think twice.\r\nGoing to prison will eliminate this problem all together.",
