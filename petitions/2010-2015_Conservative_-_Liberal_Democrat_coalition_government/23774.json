How can the government justify setting minimum wages for different age groups?.....its absurd!\r\n\r\nGender discrimination has been banned so what the government is telling us all is that a male and a female should be paid the same for doing the same work yet an 18 year old and a 23 year old be paid different? Where is the logic?\r\n\r\nI work in retail and there is a high turnover of staff at our store. Let me try to explain:\r\n\r\nA 20 year old male with three years experience with the company gets paid less than a 25 year old male with no work experience because there is a national minimum wage. ABOLISH THE BANDS AND SET ONE MINIMUM WAGE FOR ALL!!!!!! ",
