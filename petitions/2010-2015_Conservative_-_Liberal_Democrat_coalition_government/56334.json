        "additional_details": "When Shoreditch station was closed for the last time, it was with the promise that a new station \"Shoreditch High Street\" would be built to replace it as part of the new London Overground.\r\n\r\nShoreditch Station was in Zone Two - Shoreditch High Street, although a stone's throw away, has been classified as Zone One.\r\n\r\nAlthough and up and coming area, Shoreditch, Spitalfields and Bethnal Green are amongst the poorest areas in the capital, and so this price hike unfairly punishes many people who live and work in the area.\r\n\r\nBizarrely, the stations immediately before and after are also Zone Two ... thus making a one-stop journey just as expensive as a hop across London!\r\n\r\nThis petition is to oppose this move and to get Shoreditch High Street classified as Zone Two like it always was before!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
