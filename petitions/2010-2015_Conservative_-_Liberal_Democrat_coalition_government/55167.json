        "additional_details": "The closure of our community Libraries is something that should never be allowed just because of a shortfall in the local budget.\r\nLibraries are a source of education and research and 50% of most research done online is unreliable.\r\nOur children deserve the right to enjoy these places as our ancestors have done before us. If these are allowed to close with the offer of a mobile library, how long would it be before they are also cut back till eventually there isn't one.\r\nI am starting this petition for one reason only, to stop the proposed closure. The building itself is historical and shouldn't be left to be sold or turned into flats.\r\nPlease find the shortfall in the budget elsewhere.\r\n",
