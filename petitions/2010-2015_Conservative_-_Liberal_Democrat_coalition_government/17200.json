All of which we have no problem with but surely using a radio to help get through the day has been every persons right  and its main use since it's invention. Yet they are allowed to use the law to bully already struggling small business owners into paying vast backdated sums for listening to eg. radio 4 a station that plays little music and is paid by the licence fee, whilst alone and in an area that cannot be heard by the public something it's sister organisation PRS tellingly does not do.\r\nThis must be stopped, please do sign",
