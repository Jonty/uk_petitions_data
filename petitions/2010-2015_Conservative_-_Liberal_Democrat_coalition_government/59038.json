        "additional_details": "I unfortunately listen to the show daily and have realised how much of a damaging figure Nick Grimshaw is to young people and our society... Get him OFF the radio. He is not influential by any means and is seriously dumbing down an entire generation of listeners. He is materialistic and crude and he needs to know there is more to life than 1. Name dropping. 2. Twitter followers. 3. Bragging about his social life. He presents a prime time radio show, he should be inspiring listeners, of which he certainly does not... He is sculpting the next generation- please, let's stop him in his tracks!",
