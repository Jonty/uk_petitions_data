        "additional_details": "As it stands in the UK at the moment, women are allowed to have abortions up to the gestation of 24 weeks!\r\n\r\nAt 24 weeks, a \"foetus\" now looks like a baby and has already started to develop human traits, behaviours and physical features. If a woman was to go into preterm labour, the hospital are obligated to step in and help fight for the baby's life as the law recognises them as a full fledged human being. It seems barbaric that abortions are allowed to this stage, especially with regards to the baby being acknowledged as a human being and human beings being offered equal rights and freedom of being an individual.\r\n\r\nPlease help us lower the abortion limit to 12 weeks. If an abortion is wanted, a decision can easily be made by this point, if an abortion is still being 'considered' after this point then use this consideration time to think about putting a baby up for adoption where they have a chance to experience love and care. If other countries can low the limit then so can we!\r\n",
