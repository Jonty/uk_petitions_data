        "additional_details": "In these days of 'Political Correctness Gone Wrong', there are only ineffective and costly deterrents (both in time, money and resources). The Offenders, when they are caught and 'punished', receive ASBO's (and these are seen as 'medals' by Offenders' peers), suspended prison sentences (which are 'scoffed at' by the offenders and their peers) to ultimately prison sentences (and with the prisons at near maximum capacity, these sentences are relatively short and don't reflect a punishment for the crime in the 'Real World'). In fact, the victims suffer suffer MORE than the offenders in both the short and long terms.\r\nHistorically, when Corporal Punishment was in force, there were still incidents occurring, though statistically these were very small in relation to todays 'crimewave', with very little re-offending.\r\nWe need a deterrent that truly IS a deterrent, effective and LOW COST.\r\n",
