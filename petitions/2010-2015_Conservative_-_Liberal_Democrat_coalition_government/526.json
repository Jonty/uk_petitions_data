        "additional_details": "As sovereign citizens, we all have a natural, God given right to keep and bear arms.\r\n\r\nThe USA is often cited by the anti-gun lobby as a reason to strengthen gun control in Britain, however, US gun crime statistics are typically skewed by illegal ownership of guns in states that have strict gun control laws. In fact, US states that have few gun controls tend to experience far less crime than states that heavily regulate the private ownership of firearms.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland is another example of a country that allows widespread ownership of firearms, and their gun crime rates are so low that they don't even bother to keep statistics!\r\n\r\nI propose relaxing our authoritarian gun control laws to allow sovereign citizens of all ages and backgrounds to carry firearms in public for the purpose of self-defence.",
