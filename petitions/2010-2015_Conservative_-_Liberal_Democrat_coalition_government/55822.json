In spite of unprecedented levels of council tax, they are often left in a dreadful state or repair, with many repairs delayed until the repairs are 'necessary', rather than pre-emptively i.e. before they damage vehicles.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore necessary to review the extension of the remit of the Highways Agency to include more local roads or create a new body responsible for road repair (funded from local authority funds or otherwise), perhaps to include a portion of car tax funds as many motorists would prefer to know that a portion of their car tax serves to provide for improving roads (even if that means a small increase).
