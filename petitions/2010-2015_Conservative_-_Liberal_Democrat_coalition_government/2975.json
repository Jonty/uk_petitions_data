However, a special legal exemption (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/731/contents/made#sdiv12) which applies ONLY to Halal and Kosher slaughter, means that animals slaughtered, \u201cby a religious method\u201d  for halal or kosher meat - are exempt. We believe that on animal cruelty grounds, that this exemption should be removed. This  is not racist, it is not anti Muslim or anti Jewish. It is concern over animal welfare in the UK.\r\nWe want the UK Government to ban both un-stunned and pre-stunned slaughter in Great Britain. This practice needs to be outlawed there is no place for it in modern society.",
