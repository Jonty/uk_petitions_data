        "additional_details": "As you grow old basic everyday we find everyday tasks more difficult, driving is one of them.\r\n\r\nThis petition is so that people at the age of 70 years  must pass a driving test that is based around reaction time and correct responses if difficult and dangerous situations.\r\n\r\nDriving at 40mph while cars around you are doing 70mph is dangerous. This is done by most elderly people because they do not trust themselves to react properly and therefore shouldn't be on the roads, as they pose a risk to themselves and others. ",
