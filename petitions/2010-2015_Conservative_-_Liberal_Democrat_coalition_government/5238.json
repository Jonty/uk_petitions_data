It completely takes over a woman's life. Drs have little knowledge of how to treat this condition and a diagnosis can take years. The treatment options given to women are limited at best and due to NHS limitations treatment is difficult to get.  Let's move this forward and get better treatment for all women suffering this condition. ",
