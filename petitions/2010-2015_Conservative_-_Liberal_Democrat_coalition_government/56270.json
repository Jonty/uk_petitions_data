        "additional_details": "The Government must call-in the planning application re. the demolition of Earls Court Exhibition Centre for a transparent public inquiry, based on the key following points:\r\n\r\nThe scheme involves huge land assets held by TfL of which the Mayor is Chair and from which TfL would receive large benefits.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor is the planning decision-maker, hence a conflict of interest.\r\n\r\nThe residents of the existing estates oppose the scheme, but have little or no control over their own destiny.\r\n\r\nEarls Court annually attracts 2.5m+ visitors, 30,000+ exhibitors and over \u00a31bn/year to London, sustains 12,000+ jobs and is key for London\u2019s economy.\r\n\r\nLondon is short of event space, when the UK aims to promote itself as a global business centre but is losing revenue / trade to other countries.\r\n\r\nThe plan will substantially contract the events industry; reduce the number of visitors, all after the Olympics elevated the city\u2019s status to a global audience.",
