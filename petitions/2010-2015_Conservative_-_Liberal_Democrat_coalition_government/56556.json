        "additional_details": "This petition has been raised to high light that the new GCSE exam reforms will discriminate against students with Dyslexia and other Special Educational Needs. By returning to a system where 5 years of learning can effectively be wiped out by a 3 hour exam is horrifying. Children with Special Educational Needs such as Dyslexia often do not have the capacity to be tested in this way. This does not mean that they are stupid or failures, they just struggle in exam situations. Often they do not have a sufficient working memory that allows them to spew facts, in parrot fashion, on to the paper. A one off exam is not a true indication of understanding and does not reflect their true performance in 5 years of schooling. An element of coursework assessment should still take place. ",
