This is an unfair effect if people start their lives with different amounts of money. By effectively abolishing inheritance, every generation would start their lives on an equal playing field. This would be fairer to everyone and more economically efficient, as the best people would get to the best financial positions based on their own merits rather than those of their parents.",
