All police, social services who know about these crimes but have not protected these children must be brought to justice and charged as accomplices and with endangering children. Their professional bodies must also sanction them.  All historical cases must also be fully investigated and prosecuted with the full force of the law and for every single crime a charge must be brought against the suspects and if found guilty they should serve their sentences concurrently. This is the only way we can protect the most vulnerable in society.",
