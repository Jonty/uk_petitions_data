        "additional_details": "Our aim is for Dunstable to be recognised for the important site that it was during the Medieval period.\r\n\r\nDunstable was an important centre of trade sitting astride one of the busiest crossroads of England. Henry I built a palace in Dunstable and a number of monarchs spent time here.\r\n\r\nIn May 1533, just a few years before Henry VIII closed the Priory, he sent Cranmer and the bishops to Dunstable to grant him an annulment from Catherine of Aragon. The ending of this marriage resulted in the break from Rome and the beginning of the Reformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
