        "additional_details": "Derbyshire County Council's cabinet have considered a range of possible budget cuts. One of the services which could be included in these cuts is the school crossing patrol service.\r\nAt the moment no decisions have been made.\r\nAny proposed changes to the service will be the subject of a public consultation and they are asking schools, parents and the general public for our views.\r\nTherefore as a concerned parent I am starting this petition to support there decision. I believe that the safety of our children and all future children are at risk of being unable to make a safer journey to school. Please sign and encourage others to sign too....\r\nWE NEED TO KEEP ALL OF THIS SERVICE!!!\r\nThank you for your support!",
