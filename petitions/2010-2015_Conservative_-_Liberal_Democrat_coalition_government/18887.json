        "additional_details": "Every day millions of people across the UK walk away from cash registers with coppers that they do not really want due to the percentage of items sold at **.*9p. Many of these cash registers already have charity boxes next to them, into which this change can be discarded. The amount of money that this generates yearly is life-changing for many charities across the UK and this petition is an attempt to make it a legal requirement for at least one charity box to be present at every cash register across the UK. Every registered charity will be eligible for representation. ",
