However, Mr. Gove, has claimed that these legal provisions do not apply to the school curriculum. Not only do I believe this to be unlawful but that it also sets a dangerous precedent and would ask Mr. Gove to reconsider this view with some urgency. If he is unable or unwilling to fulfil his legal duties, he should be removed as Education secretary",
