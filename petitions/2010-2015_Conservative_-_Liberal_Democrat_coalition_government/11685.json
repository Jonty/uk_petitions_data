        "additional_details": "The credit crunch was caused by the banks not understanding, not properly assessing the risks inherent in the products and services they traded. They knowingly mis-sold these products on a massive and global basis. As a result banks collapsed, otherwise solvent companies collapsed and millions of people around the world have been traumatised, lost their jobs, their homes, families and have been seriously financially disadvantaged.  Many other cases of financial mis-selling have come to light. Clearly the directors of the companies concerned were guilty of corporate negligence or fraud on a massive scale and should pay for their negligence. This also applies to directors of any company that operates in the uk marketplace and who are responsible for mal-practice, such as mis-selling or major industrial accidents. The government should bring these people to book and ensure that they are penalised and not rewarded for their misdemeanours. ",
