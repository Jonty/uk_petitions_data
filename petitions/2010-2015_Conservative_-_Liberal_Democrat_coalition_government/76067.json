        "additional_details": "Currently councils are required to provide allotments to those who ask, but there is no time limit for them to do this. The waiting list for allotments are often > 10 years. This petition requests that there is a 1 year time limit on the amount of time that councils may take to provide an allotment. This would enable them to plan, if necessary, buying a piece of land into their annual budgets and provide growing space in a timely manner.",
