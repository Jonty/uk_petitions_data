We want this land protected and do not want developers creating a sprawling town like effect within our community.  there are other areas to include brown belt land available to build.  We live in a semi rural location and want to keep it that way.  We are not a town as the developers have told us, we are a village and want to keep it that way. The development would have a serious impact on our infastructure within the local  community.  The developers have a total disregard to the wishes of the local community and impact it will have.  Stop building on greenbelt land and change the policy.  Stats show there are over 900,000 empty properties, why build more when we cannot fill these.",
