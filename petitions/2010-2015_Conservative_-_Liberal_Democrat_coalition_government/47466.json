        "additional_details": "With the introduction of new parking restrictions at South Fistral it appears that either you cannot park between 9am - midnight or cars only between midnight and 9am.\r\n\r\nThis is a real restriction for all beach users. For a Surf Related Town who relies on Surfers and visitors for majority of it income it appears ridiculous that this sort of signage can be introduced restricting early morning beach users from parking anywhere near the beach. We would like the restrictions lifted before it damages the town even more.",
