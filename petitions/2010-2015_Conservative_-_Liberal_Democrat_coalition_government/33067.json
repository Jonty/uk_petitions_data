        "additional_details": "With the EU so keen to lower its carbon emissions and  UK keen to hit targets as well as stimulate the economy I suggest the UK government should remove all fuel duty on 2nd generation Bio fuels.\r\n\r\n This would not only allow such products to become worth investing in and producing but would help produce thousands of new jobs in a new Bio fuel industry, prices would eventually come down with better methods of refining the fuel as well as having an immediate reduction in carbon for transport.\r\n\r\nFor those that don't know 2nd Gen Bio fuel is from wastes such as animal fat, used oil as well as food waste so does not use any extra land than already in use today.\r\nIn summary the main pros are:\r\nIncreased jobs from a new industry\r\nMore stabilised fuel costs\r\nIncreased economic output from stable fuel prices\r\nReduced co2 emission.\r\nIncreased protection from a increasingly unstable middle east and unstable oil price.\r\n ",
