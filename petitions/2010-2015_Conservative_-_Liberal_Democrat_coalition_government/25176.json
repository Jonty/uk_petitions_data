        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls on the UK Government to take action on the concerns of young people about expensive bus fares and listen to the British Youth Council\u2019s and UK Youth Parliament\u2019s campaigning on this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nYoung people across the UK currently face a postcode lottery of expensive bus fares \u2013 some receive concessionary fares and get child fares until they are 16, but many don\u2019t. On top of this, many existing concessionary schemes for young people are being cut as a result of cuts to local authority budgets for transport.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need the UK Government to work with national bus providers and local authorities to make sure that there are cheaper bus fares for young people, concessionary schemes, and standardised child fares for under 16s.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure expensive bus fares don\u2019t affect our ability to get to college or get a job. Our generation can\u2019t afford to miss out on opportunities because bus fares are too expensive.",
