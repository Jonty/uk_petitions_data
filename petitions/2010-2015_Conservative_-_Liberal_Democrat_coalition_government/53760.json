        "additional_details": "I work for a company that provides Specialist equipment for Disabled people. The equipment is not often the cheapest option but in many instances replaces the need for an additional care worker. This can save Local Authorities anything up to \u00a334000 per year per care worker. This can be a saving of over \u00a3100,000 over three years for one patient for the purchase of one piece of equipment at \u00a36500. The trouble is that Red Tape can tie up the purchase of this equipment or someone at the top says there is not enough money in the pot to afford to buy it but they can afford continued care costs which does not make sense.\r\n\r\nWe can help reduce overall spending and help manufacturing companies in this country at the same time by moving this forward.",
