        "additional_details": "Floride may benefit teeth in young people. It's absorbed into the tooth enamel & is in toothpastes etc.\r\nIt 's of no benefit swallowed.\r\nIt's of no benefit to adult teeth.\r\nIt's an accumulative poison responsible for muskulo-skeletal illnesses - look it up.\r\nMost water is used for cleaning, flushing wc's & bathing.\r\nOnly a very small percentage comes into contact with young people's teeth & that consumed by adults is of no benefit.\r\nBoiling concentrates the flouride in water.\r\nFreezing has no effect.\r\nWater filter jugs are ineffective.\r\nWe pay for this chemical to be added to our water.\r\nPlease, enter FLOURIDE into your search engine then and only then, consider signing my petition to have the government order the cessation of adding flouride to our water suppplies.\r\nThe money saved from paying for flouride addition could be diverted to water charities.\r\nEmail everyone you know & ask them to do the same as you just did.",
