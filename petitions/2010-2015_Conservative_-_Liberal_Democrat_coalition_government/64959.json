Animals which are stunned then slaughtered are not Halal and should not be labelled as Halal.\r\n\r\nAllow muslims to have their place to slaughter animals according to their religion. All customers need to know where the meat has come from and if its Halal or not,.\r\n\r\nAlso businesses should not be selling Halal meat to customers who are not aware that the meat is Halal, all products need to be packaged fairly. As  this has been going on recently and is all over the news about major businesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and share with friends and family.",
