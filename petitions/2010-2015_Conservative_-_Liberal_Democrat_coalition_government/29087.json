        "additional_details": "Employees can currently fire staff if they have been arrested or charged even if they are found completely innocent by a court of law.\r\n\r\nThis is unfair and costs innocent people their jobs, and sometimes their entire careers or even their lives. Employers must be prohibited from firing anyone arrested or charged with an offence, and should only be permitted to do so if the person is actually convicted.\r\n\r\nFor people working in sensitive professions, e.g. with vulnerable people, the person should not be sacked, but put on leave on full pay until they are either convicted or declared innocent, when they may be fired or return to work as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe notion of innocent until proven guilty is sacred in our legal system and must not be overruled by extra-judicial condemnations by employers.",
