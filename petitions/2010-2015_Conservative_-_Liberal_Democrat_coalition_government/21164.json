        "additional_details": "Even after the terrible event in Dumblane it was reported that UK gun crime had increased by almost 40% in the first two years after the ban was introduced. The ban has only hurt honest hard working people that wish to take part in this leisure activity and lifting the ban could also help to create new jobs. If new pistol clubs were properly set up they could include the facility for members to leave all firearms in individual gun safes on site so that they were never taken home.",
