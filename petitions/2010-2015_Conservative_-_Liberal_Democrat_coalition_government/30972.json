Establishing rapport with patients is often the result of the interaction of effective communication, demonstrating empathy, trust, respecting patients\u2019 choice, showing unconditional positive regard, as well as empowering patients to overcome (or cope, minimise) their health problems. Commission on Dignity in Care recently advised HMG that healthcare staff should be recruited for their caring values, not only qualifications.",
