        "additional_details": "Since the privatisation of Royal Mail,  the Universal Service Obligation has been under threat. Now, Royal Mail is actively campaigning against it. This is a completely outrageous and unacceptable situation. The Universal Service Obligation is a statutary obligation and fully accepted by the operator when Royal Mail was privatised. If Royal Mail seeks to influence OFGEM, politicians or break its obligations, this should viewed as a breach of contract. Royal Mail should then should be either nationalised or given to a different operator.",
