        "additional_details": "Our tax system does not support sustainable resource in the UK. The Government should consider applying a sales tax to all purchased product based upon the cost of disposal / recycling of both the product at end of life for example tyres, and the packaging  like plastics and card. That means the consumer, when making a purchase, will know that the disposal / recycling cost has been accounted for, and reflected in the point of sale cost.\r\n\r\nNuisance costs such as chewing gum removal could also be included.\r\n\r\nWeightings can be applied to different types of product, ie unsustainable land fill destined product could carry a high premium. Manufacturers would then be discouraged from using these types and seek alternatives to improve their competitive position.\r\n\r\nThe revenue should be then paid to the local council to pay for the disposal / recycling and subsequently reducing the council tax burden for residents\r\n\r\nIn other words those who consume will pay for the product to be recycled.\r\n",
