In 2001 UK census people put Jedi as their religion and yes some did it for a joke but they are those who are serious practitioners of this belief. Despite being inspired by the films of star wars it has grown to be more than that it's grown to be a philosophy and way of life. And it's about time it should be acknowledge and recognized and get the respect it deserves.\r\nThe government allowed a death cult like scientology be recognized. It's only fair in the name of Democracy that jediism should too.  ",
