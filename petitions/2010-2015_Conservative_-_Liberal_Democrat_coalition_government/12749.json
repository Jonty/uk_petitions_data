        "additional_details": "A system should be put in place whereby 12 months minimum national service is issued upon second offences to 18 year olds and above. Under 18s to be issued with an order that they are then later to receive 12 months national service when reaching the age of 18 for the crimes committed as a minor. As it stands there is too much money being pumped into the court and prison system with very little long term result in justice and change in society.\r\n\r\nA National Service Reform System does not solely imply being sent straight to \u201cfrontline war\u201d but  primarily being put through the training to give these people: self respect, discipline and moral values. More opportunities may then be available when finishing their time. As everybody knows the prison system does not work!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
