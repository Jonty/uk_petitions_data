        "action": "Change the law to make Electrical Condition Reports a legal requirement for properties that are rented.",
        "additional_details": "Currently there is great misinformation and confusion over the requirements for Electrical Condition Reports for non HMO (House in Multiple Occupation) rented properties. Due to the report being only a recommendation rather than compulsory there are a great number of properties that are not being safely maintained which is putting people at risk of potential injury and in severe cases, death. This petition calls for the Electrical Condition Report to be made compulsory for any type of rented accommodation, to be done every 5 years depending on the condition of the electrical installation. Hopefully we can put a stop to any further misunderstandings. ",
