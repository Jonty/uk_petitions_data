        "additional_details": "Free Bus usage for Under 18's, without being able to earn a solid income, this should be brought in as a scheme to encourage youngsters to support their local economy and participate in activities they like. Over 60's can earn an income plus they can drive so they can afford it especially with pensions. Those under 16 can't even drive or earn an income so what are their travel options? I would appreciate your support in helping this campaign of FREE TRANSPORT TO UNDER 18's UK WIDE",
