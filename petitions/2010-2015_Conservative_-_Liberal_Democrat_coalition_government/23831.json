        "additional_details": "Inventing is an area of human activity which remains untouched by sexual equality: inventing is still a man's world. Nearly everyone could not name one significant thing invented by a woman. Everyone can think of a woman doctor or Prime Minister. Yet to imagine a woman could have invented something like the computer, internal combustion engine, airplane, helicopter, submarine, sewing machine is laughable. Women live in a world were all the technology is invented by men. This complete onsidedness needs to end and females need government encouragement to prove their sex are not inferior to men when it comes to inventing.",
