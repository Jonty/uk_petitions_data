        "additional_details": "Our wounded in action servicemen and women need to be recognised for their sacrifice. The United States government has the Purple Heart. A long established medal that is awarded to those service personnel who have been wounded or killed in the service of their Nation. Although there is an established award for those who have lost their lives, the Elisabeth cross, there is nothing for wounded personnel,   We need to issue our brave troops with something they can be recognised by and can be awarded in appreciation for their sacrifice. A fitting name would be the poppy petal. As opposed to a medal it could be like the 'Mentioned in dispatches' pin. This would be cost effective and that way more attractive for the government to approve.",
