Personally, i am subjected to such an event daily.\r\n\r\nTraining and licencing laws may not be as stringent in countries outside of the UK and EU, which affects road safety in the UK when non UK residents and visitors are allowed to drive on the UK roads without adequate training.\r\n\r\nForeign migrants and visitors should be forced to perform some level of UK road safety training which MUST include road etiquette.",
