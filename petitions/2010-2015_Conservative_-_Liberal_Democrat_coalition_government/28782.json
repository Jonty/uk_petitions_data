This is bad as GCSE students will have more stress on them, they need to revise ALOT LONGER to make sure they remember everything, current year 8 students will be in the transition period (so they will be like guinea pigs) and Teachers may not be well prepared for it. Please sign and myself and other students will be grateful!",
