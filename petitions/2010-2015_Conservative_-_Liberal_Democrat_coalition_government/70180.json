        "additional_details": "This is a petition for the abolition of The House of Lords. The House of Lords is an unelected chamber based upon the principle of hereditary rule and rooted in aristocracy.It is the main reason that progressive political reform cannot happen within the UK. In the year following Labour's victory in the 1997 general election, in which the party won 418 seats, the House of Lords blocked 38 bills from the Westminster Parliament.The existence of the House of Lords means that we genuinely live in a country that is undemocratic, with parliaments restricted by unelected (whether appointed or hereditary) peers. Peers that we have no right to remove from power and who have this job for life.Whether you believe that Independence, Federalism, further regional devolution or a strong Westminster Government is the best way forward, abolition of The House of Lords is a must if any genuine political reform is to be achieved.We want the Government to abolish The House of Lords in its entirety.",
