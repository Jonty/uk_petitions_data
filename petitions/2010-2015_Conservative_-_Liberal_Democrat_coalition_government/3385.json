        "additional_details": "We need the law revised regarding Theft by Finding. Removing an item of waste from a dustbin for the purpose of reuse, at the moment, is classed as Theft by Finding. We need it clarified that if you remove something from a waste container of any kind with the intention of reusing it, this will not be regarded as theft. It could also be noted that once an item has been discarded into a waste container, the ownership moves to the public domain, from the person or company disposing of it. This could save 1000's of tonnes of waste going into landfill every year.",
