The developments encroach on ancient footpaths following field enclosures and parish boundaries and on a local wildlife site and conservation target area. The hedges and its oak trees are very old and provide protection for wildlife and promote its biodiversity. We will lose the corridors to the River Ray Conservation area and countryside access. We want a reduction in estate areas, and the local wildlife site left unspoilt and free of development for people's enjoyment to promote their health and tranquillity. We want policies ESD10 (protection and conservation of biodiversity and the natural environment) and ESD11 (conservation target areas) to be implemented specifically for the sites through a published plan which takes precedence over the developers\u2019 plans.\r\n",
