        "additional_details": "The falls of Gaddafi and Mubarak indicate that initially popular leaders become tyrants.\r\n\r\nThe UK is one of the few democratic countries not to have government leader term limits. In the UK the lack of fixed and maximum terms has led to arrogance and political turbulence in Prime Ministers' later years rather than an orderly democratic transition of power.\r\n\r\nI PROPOSE:\r\n\r\nThere should be a Maximum Total Term Limit of Ten Years for Prime Ministers. Furthermore The UK should call for all members of The UN to have Maximum Total Term Limits of Ten Years for Government Leaders.",
