        "additional_details": "Mental health issues, cosmetic surgery, suicide, etc. are all on the rise & research shows that a lot of the issues resulting in this increase in statistics actually stem from childhood. If this is the case then isn't it our duty to provide children with the tools to deal with serious issues & offer an environment for them to confidently discuss any issues they may have?\r\n\r\nThere is a huge variety of techniques that can be adapted to instil confidence & self belief in students of any age, starting at nursery level. If children are taught to appreciate & respect themselves as well as others then isn't that paving the way for a better co-existence for all in future generations? Equipping children with these skills has the potential to decrease bullying, encourage communication, improve social & mental awareness, boost confidence, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you want a better future for our children then please sign this petition.",
