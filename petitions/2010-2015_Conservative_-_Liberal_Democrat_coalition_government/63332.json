        "additional_details": "Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, proposes to change the BTEC assessment criteria from September 2014. His proposals are badly thought through and will disadvantage a whole generation of students including those who are already half way through a course of study they chose on the basis of the current criteria.\r\nWe call upon the government to make Mr Gove withdraw his proposals and consult teaching bodies responsible for delivery of BTEC courses. We also call upon Mr Gove to present his proposals, which were not in the Conservative manifesto, to parliament for debate and a vote.",
