This meant that although a majority voted for the proposal, the 1978 Scotland Act was not enacted.  We the undersigned would like assurances from the current Westminster Government that the conditions of the referendum of May 2011 are afforded to any future referendum on Scottish Independence, ie. a simple majority will carry the outcome.",
