Children\u2019s Services have been since 2009 under threat and have been constantly trimmed back. Incidentally this was at a time when Newcastle City Council was implementing its strategy within the \u201cAiming High Agenda\u201d at a time when it should have been increasing services they were being slowly eroded.\r\nChildren with disabilities are at their most vulnerable in 2012, children should not have to travel miles away from home for respite care of a high quality.\r\n",
