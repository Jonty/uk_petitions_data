        "additional_details": "The British tax payer is paying the salary of Diane Abbott.  Diane has made racist/bigoted comments numerous times and it's time she was made accountable.  As a British tax payer, I am appalled that my hard earned tax money is going towards paying her salary.  Racism works both ways. Black on white, white on black, whatever your angle, Diane has demonstarted she holds racist opinions and is not fit to sit in the house of commons. I further believe that her latest statement incites racial hated and she should be investigated by the police as well as being sacked from her job as a member of parliment",
