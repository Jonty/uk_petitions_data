        "additional_details": "The public display of Michael Ellis MP on the Home Affairs Committee who interviewed Alan Rusbridger of the Guardian newspaper was inappropriate and unacceptable but particular mention of his \"this is not a labour love in\" remark when being directed by the chair was a complete out of order behaviour. This comment not only ridiculed the committee and demeaned the chairman. He is clearly not practising value added to the committee and \"cause\" has been created to withdraw him from this committee.
