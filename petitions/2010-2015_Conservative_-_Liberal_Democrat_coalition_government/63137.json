        "additional_details": "Puppy mills and backyard breeding without breeding licenses is illegal yet it's still being done and is more common than ever in the UK due to high demand for designer and mixed breeds rather than purebred like the old days. Dog theft is increasing and the main reason is so they can be used as breeders even as young as 6 months old. Puppies are worth hundreds of pounds and are usually kept in crates with other breeding dogs in squalid conditions just like factory farmed animals. The government needs to crack down on this illegal activity and have a moral obligation to save these beloved domesticated pets. This is a serious issue that needs more attention and more police officers, animal welfare workers and investigators to bring down these criminals and stop this backyard breeding once and for all. ",
