        "additional_details": "I would like the government to sell off the BBC because the funds released would greatly help our huge national deficit.\r\nIt would be feasible because:-\r\n1. Commercial broadcasting is equally good.\r\n2. The BBC now has 'advertising' breaks for their programs, just as annoying as those on ITV etc.\r\n3. There is no need for licencing fees; advertisers obviously provide sufficient funds for excellent programs by the commercial media.\r\n4. The BBC owns a large amount of property and the funds released from selling would go a long way to help the national shortfall.\r\n5. Not too many jobs would be lost, as the new owners would need experienced staff.\r\n6. The BBC World Service is currently funded by the UK government, so would not disappear.\r\n\r\n",
