        "additional_details": "John Hutton's report in March 2011 exempted \"uniformed services\" from the working longer section of his report on Public Sector Pensions. Upon further clarification during the negotiations that the uniforms in question belonged to the Army, Police and Fire Service and that the Ambulance Services were not included. Subsequently there is a real concern that if ALL frontline 999 Ambulance Staff (Paramedics, Technicians and any assistant role) will be expected to undertake the full range of duties then the number of ill health retirement applications will increase and the vulnerability to assaults by members of the public is likely to increase and the cases of stress related illnesses such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is also likely to increase and the associated costs will need to be funded from public monies.\r\nAs a representative of Ambulance Staff I call on the Government look to exempt front line Ambulance Staff from working longer and maintain their ability to retire at aged 60.",
