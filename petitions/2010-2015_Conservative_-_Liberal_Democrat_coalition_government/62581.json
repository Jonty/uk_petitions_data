        "additional_details": "Given its many failings and cover ups, especially those involving child abuse, it is no longer acceptable or reasonable for the Roman Catholic Church to be given the special status of being a pseudo-country. The government (and the Church of England) could still work with the Holy See/Vatican in areas of mutual interest, but this would be fairer than now, as it would be in exactly the same way that it deals with other religious organisations. We therefore request that the government derecognise the Holy See as an independent state, thereby avoiding the possible mis-use of diplomatic immunity for any staff accused of abuse or other crimes.",
