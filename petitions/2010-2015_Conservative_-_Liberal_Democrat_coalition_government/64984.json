        "additional_details": "Cycle superhighways are currently built on red routes in London, the routes that are meant for free-flowing and heavy traffic, and thus trade, construction and transport to flow freely. These cycle superhighways put cyclists lives in danger by encouraging contact with HGVs, Buses, and Lorries. 20mph zones exist in all boroughs in London, generally on residential roads. These are the obvious cheap solution to improving cycle safety. Additionally keep the 20mph roads to residential streets, allowing public transport to use main arteries at 30mph. Separate cyclists from these routes and save lives. ",
