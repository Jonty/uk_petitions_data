        "additional_details": "Consideration should be given to legalising the use of pepper spray / CS gas as a self defence protection method. The current legal options are limited to personal attack alarms and dye sprays. These are largely ineffective passive personal security devices if the victim is located in an area where there is no-one around to hear the alarm and react to the situation. Legalising such sprays would ensure women can feel safe that they hold an active personal security device that will actually work in the event of attack.",
