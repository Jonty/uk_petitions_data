        "additional_details": "The government is considering cutting taxes for high earners at a time when the lower paid are suffering under a VAT rise, rising living costs and deteriorating public services due to government austerity. The government promised those with broadest shoulders would be carrying the greater burden of dealing with the country's deficit, the 50p higher rate is part of that and it would be hypocritical and cruel -given the estimated \u00a3750 million the government would surrender would doubtless be clawed back from more cuts to public services- to cut it now. The rate should stay or be set even higher.",
