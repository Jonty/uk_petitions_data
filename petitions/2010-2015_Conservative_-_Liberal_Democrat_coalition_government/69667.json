I've recently lost my job and I'm expected to pay \u00a3150pm out of my benefits towards my rent, Money the government gives us to survive on. If bedroom tax is being abolished because it against their human rights to pay, then surely this is against ours and we don't even have a spare room. Please help by giving your signature and help get families out of poverty.",
