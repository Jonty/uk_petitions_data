        "additional_details": "This is a petition to insist that the Artic Corsair is restored back to its former glory. St Andrews Dock in Hull used to probably be one of the busiest fish docks in the country. It has just been left to rot. Considering Hull is now the city of culture it is sad to see that such an important and historical place has just been left like an old graveyard. This is so disrespectful to the many families in hull who lost loved ones at sea. A proper memorial and redevelopment of this area needs to happen. ",
