        "additional_details": "Make the banks and credit card companies responsible for financial loss due to credit card fraud. The current system encourages credit card fraud by criminals because it is nearly impossible to get caught and convicted. The banks suffer no loss because they pass the charge / loss on to the customer or the retailer, therefore they have no incentive to eradicate this crime. The police as a matter of common practice do not even investigate credit card fraud claiming it is to complicated to prosicute. If the banks were made to cover the loss they would come up with better security over night.\r\nCredit card fraud is rife in this country and the authorities are doing nothing about it. It is not rocket science to make a difference we just need someone to have the will.",
