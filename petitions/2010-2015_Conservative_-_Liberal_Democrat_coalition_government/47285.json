They significantly reduce the rights avaiable to the worker, in order to increase corporate mobility.\r\n\r\nWe should utilize the piece of legislature :-\r\n\r\n\"C181 Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997\"\r\n\r\nAnd create a \"quota\" for the amount of work available via agencies, set at perhaps 5-10% of total labour market.\r\n\r\nThis should encourage healthy competition between agencies. Those doing good business will survive, those who don't will not.\r\n\r\nIt will also encourage a sense of responsibility towards the respective operating nation, by large corproations, as they will be required to employ more people directly, thus affording the workers full rights. And maintaining a more stable workforce, and thus forth economy.\r\n\r\nAs such these entities are, as far as i'm aware, still under the jurisdiction of the government. ",
