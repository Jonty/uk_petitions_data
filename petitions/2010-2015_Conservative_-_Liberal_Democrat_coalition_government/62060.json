        "additional_details": "Street Lights on in Fingringhoe.\r\n\r\nResponsible department: Department for Transport.\r\n\r\nWhen the Council switched off our street lights it presented criminals with the opportunity to operate under cover of darkness. It created concern and anxiety for vulnerable people, especially those who live alone. Will we receive  council tax rebates for this reduction in services? Will the Council assist with increases in home and car insurances as our village is identified by insurers as a high risk area? Will the Council compensate those who have accidents as a result of this policy. The taxpayer is tasked with saving energy and have risen to the challenge. The Council should do likewise and use LED or Solar lighting to illuminate our streets. Please turn our street lights back on.\r\n",
