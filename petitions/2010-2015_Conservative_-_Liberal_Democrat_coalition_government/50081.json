        "additional_details": "There is a proposal to have a Velodrome built near Paignton. It would be a great development for sport in the South West but the local Government is worried that it would not be used enough or supported. They feel it would not pay it's way. I feel the South West is very pro sport, especially pro- cycling so please sign the petition and help to get this great sporting facility built here in the South West.",
