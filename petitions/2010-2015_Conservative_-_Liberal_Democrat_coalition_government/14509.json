The United Kingdom is a maritime nation, whose security and prosperity has always and will always been reliant on our seas. It is right and proper that the people of our realm \u2013 whether they be at home, or our other territories - are defended accordingly. A strong maritime force has been a continuous part of British (previously English) Culture since the defeat of the Spanish Armada. It would be foolish and ignorant for our respected Government to ignore that fact.",
