Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit...  Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement\".\r\n\r\nA recent report by Human Rights Watch points out that Saudi Arabia not only refuses to allow women to participate in its Olympic team but also puts considerable barriers in the way of women and girls taking part in any form of sport or exercise.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government should make clear to the International Olympic Committee that the people of the United Kingdom are not happy to welcome Saudi Arabia to the London 2012 Olympics without assurances that Saudi Arabia will allow women to participate both in the Olympic team and sports and exercise in their daily lives.
