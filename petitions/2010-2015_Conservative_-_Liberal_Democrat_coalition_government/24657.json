        "additional_details": "We, the Undersigned, are actively coming together as one voice in order to express our beliefs that every public building \u2013 schools, libraries, and offices \u2013 should have solar panels installed, and it should be compulsory that all newly built houses are installed with solar panels before the house is put on the market. This will conserve the non-renewable energy resources of fossil fuels for the next generation, as the houses, schools, libraries, etc, will all be run solely on solar generated power, and will allow electricity production to be more eco-friendly, with less pollution generated. The panels will also act as a way of funding these buildings, as any excess electricity that is generated can be sold by the libraries and schools to main electricity suppliers. ",
