        "additional_details": "I am writing to make sure you are aware that The Hs2(High Speed 2) a planned railway is going to be running under our houses. It is a high -speed railway between London Euston, North West England, English Midlands, Yorkshire and potentially North East England and the Central Belt of Scotland. This railway could damage most of our Greenbelt, Countryside and the towns and villages it passes through. This could cost over 21.4billion pounds to make or we could use the money elsewhere for example upgrading the train network we already have.",
