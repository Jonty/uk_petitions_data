        "additional_details": "Tobacco products cause more harm to it's users than other, already classified drugs in the UK. Tobacco smokers have an even higher dependance than many users of other already classified drugs have. It causes huge damage to the general health in the UK. The cost of dealing with tobacco problems is immense, to health services, councils (city cleaning) and society as a whole. It is a nuisance, polluting the air and our cities. It is a fire hazard. The Home Secretary is to suggest to the government to include tobacco and it's products as a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The government is to discuss this proposal in parliament. Parliament is to vote on this issue. ",
