        "additional_details": "According to a National Audit Office report, the total owed to the UK taxpayer by a combination of a number of banks is \u00a3456.33 billion. This is broken down into \u00a3332.40 billion in guarantees and \u00a3123.93 billion in the form of loan or share purchases.\r\n\r\nThe signatories of this petition ask that the British government intervene and create legislation to put a freeze on any further bonus payments to banking staff, at the banks that have availed of the bail outs, until the full amount of the loans have been returned, that the guarantees promised are no longer necessary and if applicable, the shares purchased by the British government in these banks are bought back.",
