Even if they are never tried for the alleged crimes, the victim's life can be seriously impacted.\r\n\r\nIt can seriously affect a person's social life, family life, and career prospects. Sadly people tend to believe rumours, and sometimes even add to them.\r\n\r\nA trial, and even a conviction based upon false allegations is surely one of the most serious miscarriages of justice.",
