The low life who killed him said that \" It was an eye for an eye\" so maybe he and his side kick should suffer the sentence of Death, \"an eye for an eye\", and the other annoying thing is that this low life will be defended by some greedy barrister charging the tax payer a fortune. No defence, no justice for them, no sympathy, just hang them. Done, finished.",
