If we showed our support, others would follow, if Palestine have support, Israel would think twice about attacking, negotiations would be less one sided.\r\n\r\nThis war is our fault. We didn't keep our promise, after originally striking a deal with the Palestinians which suggested that they would get an independent state if they gave their assistance, we later took side the of Israel and went back on our word.\r\n\r\nThe state of Israel was opposed by all surrounding countries, and yet they got their independence, with no small help from the UK, France and US.\r\n\r\nThe Palestine deaths are on our hands. We need to stop this massacre. We need to give our support to the Palestinians. Instead of thinking about the Israeli people in positions of power around the world, we need to think about the Palestinians, with no power, no defence, and no way out other than death. ",
