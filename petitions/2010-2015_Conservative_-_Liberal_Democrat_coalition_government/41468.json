        "additional_details": "Please prevent the massive proposed increase in PPL fees for community fitness instructors. We have to have a PPL license to use chart music in classes, currently \u00a382 or \u00a3178 +VAT per year. If we transfer music to IPod or CD we also have ProDub which is \u00a385 +VAT.\r\nFrom 2013 PPL will be 95p +VAT per class, rising to \u00a31.88 by 2017. For my 8 classes this will cost \u00a3450 a year, a huge amount in an industry where we rarely achieve a decent salary. Many of us continue to run classes which barely break even because we love our classes and participants and because we are passionate about doing something to help people. We can\u2019t afford more expense.\r\nCommunity exercise classes are doing a huge service to our country. In the UK less than 20% of the population are gym members. Community classes allow many people to participate who would never have the confidence or money to attend a gym. They build fitness, confidence and friendships and are vital in the fight against the obesity epidemic.",
