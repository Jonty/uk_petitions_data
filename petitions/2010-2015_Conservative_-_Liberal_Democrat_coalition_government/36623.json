        "additional_details": "I am proposing a nationwide cloth nappy voucher scheme where all local authorities offer a voucher to parents who use cloth nappies, thus saving the councils money on waste managment, saving the health service money because cloth bum babies get less nappy rash, saving the environment because less disposables will go to landfill and saving the public money because cloth is not only cheaper it also does not need replaced after one use. I feel this should be debated in parliment and debated as soon as possible. ",
