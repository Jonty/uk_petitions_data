        "additional_details": "In brief, Turkish Cypriots have been denied their basic human rights in the form of embargoes placed on them since 1974.\r\nLess than three years after Cyprus gained independance the power sharing agreement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots broke down and the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves which represented approx 3% of the island.\r\nIn 2004 The Annan Plan was an attempt to reunify the island, 65% of Turkish Cypriots voted for the plan and 76% of Greek Cypriots voted against.\r\nTurkish Cypriots were promised by the international community (EU, USA & UN) that they would be rewarded for voting for the plan as it demonstrated their desire to reunify Cyprus, Turkish Cypriots are still waiting for the world to make good on these promises!! The embargoes still stand today and this is unacceptable.\r\nWe, the undersigned, feel that this isolation of Turkish Cypriots and the embargoes placed on them has gone on long enough and the time has come for them to be removed.
