        "additional_details": "I  would like Local councils to charge the Council Tax cost in a per person basis. As a household of 2 Adults Pay the same of Household of greater than 2 Adults,  How can this be fair?  as these household are likley to cost comunities more. This process would then allow a reduction in cost as more would enter the pot.  I would also add, Individuals unable to pay i.e due to unemployment should have to work x hrs within the council opperations. This would also reduce the cost to Individuals and Families. ",
