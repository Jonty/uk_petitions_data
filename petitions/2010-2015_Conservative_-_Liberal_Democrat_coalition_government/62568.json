        "additional_details": "My 33 year old husband went into A&E with full bowel obstruction on 3rd September 2013. He had a 6cm cancerous tumour. He had visited A&E twice before and his GP twice, both times they had sent him home. He was 4 days away from starting a new job and we had just sent our wedding invites out April 2014. He underwent open surgery to remove the tumour, but the surgeons found it was too big and it was already stage IV cancer! He olerated 6 cycles of chemo. We found out he was terminal on 24th January 2014 and were married in hospital on 25th January 2014. He passed away on 21st February 2014. In 2006 he had polyps removed, had a 6 month review and was never followed up. Bowel screening is currently only offered to over 60's with a stool test kit received via post. This service needs to be offered to all those young people who have history of polyps. Please help consider reviewing the screening programme to help the younger generation who have their whole lives ahead of themselves. ",
