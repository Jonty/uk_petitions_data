        "additional_details": "Construction companies pay the CITB an annual levy to subsidise training within the industry.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to consider scrapping the scheme based on a review of whether the CITB levy and grant scheme offers:\r\n\r\n1. Value for money to the industry\r\n\r\nGrants are disproportionately low compared with the amount of levy paid suggesting an unnecessarily high administer cost/ organisation inefficiency\r\n\r\n2. Fair benefits across the industry\r\n\r\nThe levy potentially disadvantages small and medium companies who employ a larger proportion of people v's their turnover than the major contractors meaning they pay a high levy in return for very low grant opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the scheme is so complex that it is difficult for workers on the ground to gain access to the grant funded training at all\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
