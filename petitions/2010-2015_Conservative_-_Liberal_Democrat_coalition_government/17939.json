        "additional_details": "The system of IVAs and bankruptcies is seriously unbalanced. An IVA is a supervised formal agreement to repay what someone owes over a fixed period of time (usually 5 years), based on what they can actually afford.  A BR attempts to repay debts by disposal of assets - in many cases yielding next to nothing and discharged after 1yr. Many of us were advised to enter IVA's 6+ yrs ago to 'do the right thing' by repaying our debts, and avoid the stigma that goes with a BR. It is not fair to have to continue to declare an IVA after the govt public records of the IVA have been deleted (and from your credit file).  A BR is a lifelong event recorded in the Gazette, an IVA should not be.  Credit file/govt time limits should be respected with no obligation to declare once deleted. Failure of institutions to distinguish IVAs and BR is beginning to show in more people advised to take BR as it's a faster process and 'treated no differently' post completion - with long term economic implications.",
