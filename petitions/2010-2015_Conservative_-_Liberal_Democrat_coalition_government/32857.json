        "additional_details": "Domestic workers won a major victory on June 16 2011 when ILO Convention 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers was adopted. The voices, experiences and visions of domestic workers were finally heard and respected by trade unions, governments and employers. The Convention aims to end the exclusion of this mostly female and often migrant workforce from labour and social protection.\r\n\r\nShamefully, the UK was one of just 8 countries that abstained from voting in favour of the Convention, standing together with Sudan, Malaysia, El Salvador, Panama, Singapore, the Czech Republic and Thailand who also abstained. Swaziland was the only government to vote against convention.\r\n\r\nWe believe the UK Government should ratify this convention and ensure international minimum standards for domestic workers.",
