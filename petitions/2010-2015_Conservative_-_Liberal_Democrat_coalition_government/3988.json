        "additional_details": "In America high school students take driving education from 16. As the law has changed to attending school until you are 18, students should be allowed to take driving education if they wish, and gain a permit 1-2months before they're 16. As younger drivers are said to be more \"prone\" to accidents, at least twice a week students have to go to mandatory lessons of road safety until they have graduated school. Lowering the age and enforcing road safety lessons whilst they are learning to drive, will not only improve the quality and knowledge of the driver and driving, but it will save lives.\r\nAt 16 they can give consent to sex, sign up for the army and do many other things that are above the risk of driving, so it should be acceptable that 16 year olds learn how to drive as long as they are being educated on how to drive safely.",
