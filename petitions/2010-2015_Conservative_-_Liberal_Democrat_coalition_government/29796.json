As my father was divorced and had not re-married, as the eldest child I was automatically next of kin. I struggled to pay for the funeral and other finances.\r\n\r\nI found out there was a Bereavement Payment and checked to see if I could claim this to help me out with the financial burden of my fathers death. I realised I did not qualify. Only wives, husbands or civil partners of the deceased are entitled to this one-off, tax-free payment when their partner dies.\r\n\r\nI propose the government change this and make the Bereavement Payment inclusive of all those who find themselves being the next of kin of a deceased relative.\r\n\r\nThis money would have paid for the cheapest funeral package and allowed me more time to grieve, rather than worry about where I would find the money to fund the financial burden of losing a loved one.\r\n",
