Please sign this petition if you want politicians to do EXACTLY what they say they're gonna do before they're voted into power. It should be illegal for politicians to say they're going to make this change and that change and then not make those changes after they've been voted into power. We're british people, if it wasn't for us voting, they wouldn't even be in power, the UK is OURS, not theirs. We the people have the human right to make politicians stick to their word.",
