        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that a dog is a representation of its owners or family and will act in a way in which it has been taught by its owners.\r\n\r\nTherefore we call for strict background checks on the person wishing to purchase or adopt a Dog, much like a CRB check when you apply for a job. This would ensure that the dog gets a well deserved family that will treat them as they would a human as oppose to many of the abuse towards Dogs that we see nowadays.\r\n\r\nIt would also ensure that because they have gone to a loving family that they are taught right from wrong which could dramatically reduce the chances of them attacking a human.\r\n\r\nHaving a pet is a privelidge that one should earn, after all, a dog is a family member more than a pet and we should treat them as such.",
