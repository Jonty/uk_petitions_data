        "additional_details": "In 2005, the BCG vaccination was stopped being routinely offered to school children without any prior notice. As a result, a large number of children have been left highly vulnerable to contracting the TB virus. Those of us who are not able to afford the luxury of private health care are not given the choice to protect them with the BCG vaccination. The action that I would like the government to take would be to reintroduce the BCG as a routine childhood vaccination and at least give parents the choice to protect their children.",
