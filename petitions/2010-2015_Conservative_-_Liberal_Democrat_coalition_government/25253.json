        "additional_details": "In these bleak financial times austerity measures should be applied to all areas that will not damage the British economy\r\n\r\nWind turbine subsidy is paid on the Installed capacity not the actual electricity generated. National statistics give a value of efficiency of wind turbines of 21% in 2010. This means we are paying a subsidy for 5 times the electricity generated. Many offshore speculators cashing in on this over generous subsidy. Last year \u00a3500,000 half a billion pounds was lost from the uk balance of trade in wind farm subsidies paid to foreign wind farm operators.\r\n\r\nThe current subsidy system also gives no incentive to improve the performance of wind turbines or even to maintain them in good working order. Linking the subsidy to the actual power output will reduce the bill for wind farm subsidies by 79% this money could be better spent on vital services that the country needs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
