        "additional_details": "How many of us see Sex offender and automatically think paedophile or rapist? Wrong. In a day and age where information on sex offenders is so easily available, we need to change the way the sex offenders register works! For our peace of mind and for people who don't deserve to be on it. It is wrong and unfair for people who simply urinate in public, download the wrong clip, decide to have intercourse in a quiet public place but get caught, who accidentally expose themselves to be put on this register for any period of time. They are not a danger to anyone and give the register and everything it stands for a bad name. I feel that the register should be for anyone found guilty of paedophilia and rape. People guilty of other 'crimes' that could currently get you put on the register should be monitored for a period of time and then a decision should be made whether to place them on the register or to end their supervision. This is my proposal.",
