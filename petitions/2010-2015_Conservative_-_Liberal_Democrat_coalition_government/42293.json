        "additional_details": "Neuroblastoma is an aggressive form of children's cancer. We are currently starting clincial trials within the UK for children who relapse. Children are been picked at random (Postcode lottery) and the rest have to raise between \u00a380,000- \u00a3500,000 to receive the same treatment abroad!. I want more funding to be able to cater for ALL children who relapse not just the chosen few.",
