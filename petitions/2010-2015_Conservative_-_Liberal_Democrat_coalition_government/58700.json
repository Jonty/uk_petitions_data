        "additional_details": "Why are thousands and thousands of Outer London tenants who are eligible to \u2018Right to Buy\u2019 discounts being unfairly and inequitably discriminated against vis-\u00e0-vis Inner London eligible tenants. The argument goes that they are eligible to receive the higher maximum discount of \u00a3100k (\u00a375k outside London) because their property prices are higher than elsewhere. This is true nationally but to differentiate Inner and Outer London eligible tenants is misguided and discriminatory. Why? First, although we live just a few miles outside the 32 London Boroughs, our prices have soared on the back of their price increases. This is not surprising as we are part of Greater (Outer) London. Furthermore, we are Londoners anyway as we have an 0208 phone number, receive London Weighting and live in Travel Zone 6 which is part of the main London Travel Zones. What\u2019s worse, a recent RTB valuation placed our house price above some similar Inner London properties. Give the \u00a3100k discount to all Londoners. ",
