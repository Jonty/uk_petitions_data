        "additional_details": "I would like to propose a petition to protect individuals from potentially damaging spam emails in that I would like to see advertisements  for pro anorexia sites and slimming trends banned from social media with the intention of banning Pro anorexia web pages which can be so dangerous and endanger so many lives. I would also like to bring in a law whereas gyms and fitness centres must make it compulsory to assess body weight and body mass index when considering membership criteria. Furthermore, I would like to call a ban on slimming aids  being sold in supermarkets and general stores and bring in a law where they should only be purchased over the counter on prescription following a full physical assessment",
