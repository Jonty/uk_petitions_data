How can the non-resident parents gross salary be used in the new calculation when they do not receive this amount themselves?\r\n\r\nSurely for those non-resident parents who may have other children living with them, this may put them at risk of neglect when their parents have even less money coming into the household than they did before on the CSA calculation.\r\n\r\nHow can the gross salary calculation be justified? The gross salary calculation is not used for anything else, it has always been your net salary.\r\n\r\nHow can the CMS justify the non-resident parent being charged 20% and the resident parent 4%. Why is this not equal?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
