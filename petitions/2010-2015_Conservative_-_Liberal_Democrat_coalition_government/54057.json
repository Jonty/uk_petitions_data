Have the government even conducted any polls into this matter? After all the government are supposed to be serving/helping us?\r\n2) Does this mean that I can buy a prepaid prescription for the year at a one off cost of \u00a3104 and get all the vapour I want?\r\n3) The government have not even looked into how much more is this going to cost me as a user without a prepaid prescription?\r\nBut fore-mostly surely the people who use vapour should be allowed a choice.
