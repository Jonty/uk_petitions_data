        "additional_details": "Medical Marijuana should be legalised in the uk because the universal declaration of human rights has many arrivals in favour of legalising medical marijuana and people are being denied these rights. It has also been proven to alleviate symptoms of Diseases like MS, cancer and Alzheimer's disease. So that is why I strongly believe medical marijuana should be legal in the UK",
