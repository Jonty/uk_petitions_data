The Government then could negotiate a cheaper rate for them with main dealer and perhaps people erroneously applying for the higher rate of mobility to get a free car would think twice before taking up the offer as it would be obvious as to where it had come from and perhaps more claimants would be caught for fraudulently obtaining new cars that working people only dream about",
