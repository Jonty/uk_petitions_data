I am 19 years old which means I am adult in my own right. I work with people my age and I work with people twice my age. We all do the same job and we all are adults with bills to pay. For example a full time job is around 40 hours a week. An 18 year old on minimum wage can expect to earn (before tax) \u00a3199.20. A 21 year old on minimum wage can expect to earn (before tax) \u00a3243.20. There is a difference of \u00a344. This may not sound like a lot of money to some, but it is a lot of money to somebody working full time on minimum wage. So why does an 18 year old deserve less pay than a 21 year old?",
