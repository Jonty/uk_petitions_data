A free phone number or prepaid envelope should also be included for those without access to the internet.\r\n\r\nAimed at:\r\nPaper catalogues that get sent to you after buying one thing online.\r\nUnaddressed post delivered by the Royal Mail etc.\r\nMail addressed 'To the occupier'.\r\nCatalogues and other commercial flyers delivered by the Royal Mail etc.\r\nTake-away menus and other hand delivered flyers; from local businesses - perhaps ignoring 'No junk mail' signs on doors could mean fines for this type.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\nMore specific than a blanket opt-out such as the mail preference service.\r\nSaves on printing and postage costs.\r\nReduces paper usage saving trees.\r\nSaves transporting unwanted post to landfill or recycling.",
