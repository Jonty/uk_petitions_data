In these times of real hardship for most people, coupled with a lack of  social housing accommodation is becoming rapidly out of the reach of many people. interest rates are very low at the moment-there is no real reason why rent hikes should be occuring and yet they are with no end in sight. The government needs to address this issue as soon as possible",
