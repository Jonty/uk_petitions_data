Terrorism is taking new forms and attacks on government infrastructure are becoming a less likely feat due to the current investment the government has in homeland defense.\r\n\r\nSoft target, public attacks (such as the Lee Rigby killings) are an easy way to spread terror. We, as the British public are currently defenseless and too reliant on the government for protection. This petition is attempting to change that and grant the right to self defense through the use of firearms both in the home and out, to all British citizens.\r\n",
