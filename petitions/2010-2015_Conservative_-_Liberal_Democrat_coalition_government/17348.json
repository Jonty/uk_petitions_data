        "additional_details": "Historically the uk has intervened when any ethnic minority is persecuted by another or traded as slaves however the treatment of some women under religions like that of the Sharia Muslims and a lot of middle eastern countries amounts to just that. Women are treated as chattels ( belongings) and are denied rights to education, mobility, freedom of dress, and also denied justice for crimes like rape where the blame is levelled at the woman.\r\n\r\nThis petition would like to see this discussed in parliament and strategies found for addressing it, possibly via the united nations, trade sanctions, awareness campaigns etc\r\n",
