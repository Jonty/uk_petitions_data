        "additional_details": "On December 18th 2012, UK Sport announced record funding for the 4 year cycle in the run up to the Rio 2016 games, however, British Basketball was one of the organisations who's funding was cut to zero.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Olympic \"legacy\"?\r\n\r\nThere is no sport in the UK that has bigger potential for growth and improvement than basketball. It is the number 2 sport in the world for a reason, and the UK needs a profile national team programme to succeed.\r\n\r\nRome wasn't built in a day. Some sports have been given, 2 or 3 cycles of funding before they achieved a medal, whilst others who underperformed at London 2012 only saw reductions in funding, not a complete end to it.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to get UK Sport to reconsider their cut to British Basketball's funding and make basketball a funded sport again.\r\n\r\n#fundbritishbasketball\r\n\r\n",

They were able to present new and compelling information which has allowed UK Sport to now award funding to the sport for the \u2018Rio cycle\u2019.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sport England is investing \u00a3493m into 46 sports between 2013 and 2017 to support the next generation of talented athletes.\r\n\r\nFurther details are available on their website at this link: http://www.sportengland.org/funding/ngb_investment/whole_sport_plans_2013-17.aspx which includes details of how England Basketball will receive \u00a36.75m including \u00a31.5m of talent development funding.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
