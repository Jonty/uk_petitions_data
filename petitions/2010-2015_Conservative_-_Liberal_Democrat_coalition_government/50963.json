His motives and actions are questionable in the current climate of fear that we all now live.\r\n\r\nI ask you to sign this petition to force Parliament to intervene and investigate his actions. Parliament must ensure these weapons are never sent to Syria and the United Kingdom acts in accordance with International Law\r\n",
