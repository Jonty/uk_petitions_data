        "additional_details": "A recent BBC1 documentary stated that The Taliban\u2019s Improvised Explosive Devices (IED\u2019s) resulted in 2010 in the death or injury of nearly 8500 coalition troops and is No 1 killer of British troops in Afghanistan. In the British army, \u201cSearchers\u201d locate IED\u2019s so that Bomb disposal operators can then dismantle them, untriggered.\r\nA Searcher\u2019s job is simply to locate IED\u2019s. To do this, searchers walk on untested ground carrying bomb detectors in front of them. They also probe suspicious ground with their bare fingers. As a result, in the last 3 months, two searchers have been killed, and a further 5 have lost limbs.\r\nSearchers are being killed and maimed in Afghanistan unnecessarily. The MOD must use robots and machines instead to locate IEDs.\r\n",
