        "additional_details": "Dear Foreign Secretary,\r\n\r\nAs an elected official, we call on you to lead the government in supporting the activism of young Israelis and Palestinians in the OneVoice movement, who are protesting against the building of illegal settlements in the West Bank, and campaigning for reconciliation between the Palestinian political factions.\r\n\r\nThe two-state solution based on the 1967 lines is the only means of establishing security and peace in the Middle East. However, the feasibility of this solution is damaged with each day that sees continued settlement expansion on land earmarked for a Palestinian state. Equally, the Palestinian people need one leadership, united under the banner of the two-state solution.\r\n\r\nWe urge your vocal support for a settlement freeze and a return to serious negotiations that resolves all final status issues in accordance with the international resolutions and ends all claims.
