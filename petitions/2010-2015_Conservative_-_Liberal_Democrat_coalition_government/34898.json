When this EARNED NCD was applied  for a second car the agent infomed this is not possible as \"the insurance industry view \" it can only be used for one vehicle.  HOWEVER  I was then offered a MIRROR NCD  policy  providing BOTH insurance policies were placed with one insurer.\r\nSince only ONE car can be driven by the policy holder the law must change to allow an individual's NCD to be used on ALL vehicles owned by the individual. This would REDUCE insurane costs as well as the number of uninsured vehicles on British roads.",
