The Prime Minister has stated that draft legislation will be published by January 2015.\r\n\r\nThis reform will lead to radical change in the role of Parliamentary representatives and will reduce their level of overall responsibility.  In the light of these proposals it is not appropriate to increase MPs pay in line with the recommendations of the Pay Review Body.",
