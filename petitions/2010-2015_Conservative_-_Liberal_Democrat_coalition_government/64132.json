Instead, we are a very open society, with Abrahamic religions at its core. Yes, our justice system is founded on Christian beliefs, and one of those beliefs is the the individual and collective rights to religious freedoms.\r\n\r\nThe British Humanist Society is in itself a belief system of sorts, and they are entitled to it. This does not retract from the fact that our justice system is inherited from 2000 years of Christian theology and teachings.\r\n\r\nHere we are, to make a stand, for the rights of Christians, Muslims, Jews in this country. For we are all connected by our shared belief in the one true ever-loving God. ",
