        "additional_details": "I will keep this plain and simple.  The Bank of England has just announced another \u00a350 billion of QE.  Now instead of giving this money to the biggest banks (Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds) etc, at zero % interest rates, who then charge us mugs % at anything they choose, and some of the institutions charge up to 3000%.\r\n\r\nI would prefer you stopped doing this.  Why dont you give this money to every man woman and child in this country, and they can then decide what is best to with it.  Instead of the likes of fred goodwin given millions in compensation?\r\n\r\nAnd to finish off, you are also guilty of decreasing the value of this countrys money supply by continually diluting it with artificial stimulus which never hits those who need it most.\r\n\r\nYou are storing up problems which far too many people are now aware of.  I am one of them.  You are robbing us blind.  Stop doing it.  Before something breaks.",
