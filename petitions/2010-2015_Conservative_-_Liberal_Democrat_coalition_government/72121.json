        "additional_details": "In 2011 my life was turned upside down when we discovered my partner had been accused of sexually abusing a girl from the area. He was charged with underage sex as he was 14 and she was 12 and he was placed on the sex offenders list for 2 and a half years. She is currently roaming around free to destroy another mans life, free to ruin someone else's reputation. I believe there should be a criminal charge for people who falsely accuse someone of a sexual offence, especially considering they are committing perjury while doing so. ",
