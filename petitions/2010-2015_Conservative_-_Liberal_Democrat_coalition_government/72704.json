        "additional_details": "The UK's draconian drug prohibition laws are in dire need of reform; incessant denial of failed prohibition has lead to a vicious and vast black market, allowing some nefarious individuals to profit greatly.\r\n\r\nAll laws should be conceived from the pairing of good reasoning and corroborating evidence, this too applies to drug laws. Discussion on drug prohibition reform is arbitrarily dismissed  in favour of circular reasoning, drugs are bad because drugs are bad, yet this does not seem to encompass tobacco and alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe current UK government insists to revel in ignorance, discarding any positive outcome observable in other nations which have been subject to decriminalisation; economic growth, smaller prison populations, reduction in crime and advancements in individual rights, yet debate on reform has been quelled.\r\n\r\nIt is time to adopt drug policies which result from the corroboration of evidence and reason. Decriminalize marijuana.\r\n\r\n",
