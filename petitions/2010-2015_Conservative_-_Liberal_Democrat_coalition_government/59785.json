        "additional_details": "The government claims that small/medium businesses are the way to create wealth, jobs and stimulate the economy; however, the survival of small and medium businesses,  as well as sole traders is, often in the hands of the larger coporations who choose to take up to 3 months - or more - to settle their invoices. Cash flow is very important to small businesses and sole traders and when large companies delay their payment it places inordinate financial stress on the small business. If business is to succeed then this huge hurdle needs to be removed. It is not as though the large corporations cannot afford to pay. The government should act swiftly to counter this barrier to growth and prosperity.",
