        "additional_details": "Following huge rental increases placed on our Scout Hut (we own our HQ but pay land rent to the local council), we will now struggle to continue as a Scout Group.  Our group has been in this premises for 56 years and this represents an attempt to drive us out of the local area - this is an outright attack on our local community and its young people.  The Scout group is part of a national organisation which has existed for over a 100 years, it is run by volunteers and provides fun, friendship and lifelong relationships to millions of young people.  In our area, no other facilities are provided for the community's young people, so the work we are doing and the service we provide is crucial.  Please help us by signing this e-petition, your local Scout group could be next!",
