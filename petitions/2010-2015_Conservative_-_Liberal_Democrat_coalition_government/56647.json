        "action": "Stop sending aid to India while all they do with it is launch expensive rockets into space to impress China.",
        "additional_details": "An Indian government spokesman said, this morning, that the Indian space programme is run to impress China with its technology skills.  When asked why 400 million people are allowed to starve he said 'technology is more important'.  For British taxpayers it is much more important to keep our pounds in thus country, not to blow them into space 'just to look good'.  It is to be hoped that the people of this land will ensure that ANY politician who agrees with sending our taxpayer pounds to a country with a space programme will be out of a job at the next election.",
