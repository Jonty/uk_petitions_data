Significant harm has already been caused to victims and survivors by a small number of malicious individuals who attack anyone who disagrees with their views and actions, which is bringing the safety of the inquiry into question and stopping those who want to come forward from doing so, for fear of harassment and bullying on social media and in the press. Victims and Survivors of child sexual abuse must feel sure they will be protected from further abuse and harassment if they disclose to the Inquiry.\r\n",
