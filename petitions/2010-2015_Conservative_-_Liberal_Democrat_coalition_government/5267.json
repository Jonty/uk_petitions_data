If this test is failed, then their application for UK citizenship should be denied.\r\n\r\nI would argue that the ability to speak the language of the country in which you wish to reside indefinitely is a necessity; without such communication skills it is impossible to integrate into the host society and become a productive part of it.  Given the current economic crisis, we as a country can no longer afford to provide for those who create their own barriers to providing for themselves.",
