        "additional_details": "Thirty years ago it was commonplace for a GP to make a monthly visit to any vulnerable or frail pensioner.\r\n\r\nMany GP's now will not respond to a request to make a home visit unless the pensioner is bed bound (they have to be registered as such) even if the pensioner  is very ill or actually terminally ill.\r\n\r\nGP's must put compassion and patient care before budgets and targets and starting with the very aged reinstate the basic need to respond to the most vunerable in society.\r\n\r\nAn annual visit to the over 90's is not ideal - it should be more frequent - so this should not overload the work load of the practice.",
