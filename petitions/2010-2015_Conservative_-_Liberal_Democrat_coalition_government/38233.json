        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on Parliament to repeal the Climate Change Act, because we need cheaper energy now! Climate legislation is hurting hard-pressed families. It will cost \u00a317,000 per household and is making fuel and energy unaffordable. Over 6 million families are suffering from fuel poverty. Thousand of jobs have been lost due to \u2018carbon-leakage\u2019. Plans for a zero carbon economy have pushed up inflation, decreased competitiveness, and made our lives miserable. A report by Peter Lilley MP exposes the flawed 'Stern Review' as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, and concludes the costs of climate legislation will exceed any benefits. Politician\u2019s never openly debated the costs of climate legislation - we want to have that debate now. Support Repeal the Act campaign.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thegwpf.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Lilley-Stern_Rebuttal.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://www.savethechildren.org.uk/sites/default/files/documents/child_poverty_2012.pdf",
