        "additional_details": "The Obama Administration just highlight exactly what is wrong with this Snooper Charter. Spying on everybody in order to corner a minority of terrorists. People's freedom should not be taken away due to a small group of people. Government's are well know for using this information for other reasons too. This sounds to me too similar to George Orwell's '1984', \"Big Brother is watching you\" Britain is already the most watched country in the world and this sort of snooping needs to be stopped!\r\n\r\nPrevent what has happened in the USA, in which President Obama feels it is his right to listen in to personal calls, emails, messages, personal documents of the very people who voted him into office. Sound like State Control to you? Prevent it from happening here and sign this petition",
