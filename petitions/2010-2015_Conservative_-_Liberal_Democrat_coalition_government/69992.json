        "additional_details": "We believe that the House of Lords is essential for British democracy. Hereditary Peers have provided balanced opinions over many centuries, in loosing them we have lost part of a British safety treasure, a network of families influencing the structure of law. This system worked for centuries and was destroyed for short sighted erroneous political bias. We believe that the House of Lords Act of 1999 needs to be repealed. Calling on the British to restore their heritage!",
