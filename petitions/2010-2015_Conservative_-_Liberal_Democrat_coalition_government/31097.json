It should be scrapped or radically changed.\r\n\r\nThe test consists of obscure questions, sometimes worded inaccurately, the answers to which can generally only be given after studying the official study guide.  Try the test at www.ukcitizenshiptest.co.uk and if  you consider yourself British, but score less than the pass mark of 75%, consider signing this petition.",
