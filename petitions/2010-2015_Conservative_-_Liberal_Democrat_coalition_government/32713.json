        "additional_details": "Yellow box junctions have a valid purpose and should act as a deterrent against inconsiderate driving.\r\n\r\nHowever in a small number of cases the junction arrangements are such that disproportionately large numbers of drivers become subject to unnecessary fines.\r\n\r\nThis is a petition to introduce a well-defined trigger point at which the continued operation of a yellow box junction becomes subject to independent review.\r\n\r\nAuthorities should publish on their websites monthly PCN statistics (including income figures) for each yellow box under their control.\r\n\r\nAny yellow box that generates more than 250 fines in any single twelve month period should have enforcement suspended for three months while its effectiveness is scrutinised and measures are put in place to improve the design of the junction (including phasing of traffic lights if appropriate).",
