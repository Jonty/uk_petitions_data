Schools are known throughout the UK to not be following what is in place, delaying processes , especially when there is no diagnosis. \u00a0Parents need clear guidelines on what to do, who to contact and what benefits are available to help them. \u00a0They also need to know what is each departments role, and who in their area is responsible for this. \u00a0There needs to be someone to support parents through the mine field of paper work and council beauracracy. Too many parents are not acknowledged by teachers, councils, health visitors and GP's. \u00a0Special attention needs to be paid when there are border council issues. \u00a0Families that live on a council border are passed from one to the other. Neither accepting ownership of a child. \u00a0The statementing process alone is fraught with problems not only the length of time it takes for the process but the framework is unclear to parents trying to navigate it.\r\n\r\n",
