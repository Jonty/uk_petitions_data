        "additional_details": "In the aftermath of the horrific random terrorist attack on a serviceman in a Woolwich street, the focus of anti-terrorist activities has been complicated to an immeasurable degree. Similar random attacks are inevitable in the future and impossible to predict. In response to this new reality we call upon the Government to amend firearms and knife legislation to allow responsible citizens to be licensed to carry concealed weopons as a means by which they may protect themselves and others from such attacks.",
