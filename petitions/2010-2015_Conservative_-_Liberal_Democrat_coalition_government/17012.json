        "additional_details": "I would like to propose a debate with regard to the government using many of the empty factories to manufacture and install free solar panels to all homes in the United Kingdom using long term unemployed who are desperate to get back into work.\r\nThe solar panels could produce 50% of the homes electricity needs, leading the way to replace gas as the reserves run dry. Any energy sold back to the grid could be used in helping to cover the manufacturing costs, and as materials would be sought on such a large scale the costs should in fact fall considerably, bearing in mind the governments run solar panel factories would be a non-profit scheme.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and help apply a common sense approach to our energy needs for the future.\r\n",
