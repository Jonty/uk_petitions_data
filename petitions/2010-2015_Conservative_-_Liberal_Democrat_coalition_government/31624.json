(Which the Government is not overly concerned with as it will be a private company escalating road usage costs)\r\nc) Increase the overall cost burden of road network on the tax payer. (As with most PFI deals, The government may subsidise it initially as a smokescreen, but ultimately the true cost will fall on the consumer. E.g Water utilities)\r\nd) Asset strip public owned facilities into private controlled profit driven companies.\r\ne)Will be the thin end of a wedge. How many new roads will be built? Very few. How many will be extended and tolled?  Very Many.\r\n\r\nStop this folly in it's tracks.\r\nVote No to PFI\r\nNo to Tolling\r\nNo to foreign control of national infrastructure.\r\nNo to government Lunacy.\r\n",
