        "additional_details": "Government using the Bank of England as a proxy has chosen a very low bank rate to get the economy going. This is not working. Why?\r\n\r\nAbout thirty million people with savings who were actually spending their 'notional' income, are no longer spending. The thrust of the Bank's policy is to get borrowers to save the nation, but in reality, borrowers do better at recapitalising banks via the large amount of interest they are charged.\r\n\r\nThe commercial banks are now using the lead of the Bank of England as a mandate to short change retail depositors.\r\n\r\nDon't forget a vast swathe of the population - the nations savers - are not spending, either because there is no money, or they have totally lost confidence in the government's  policy.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England must start raising interest rates now to restore confidence, and please, no more  quantitative easing - it doesn't get real money into the bottom end of the economy and it stokes up trouble for the near future.",
