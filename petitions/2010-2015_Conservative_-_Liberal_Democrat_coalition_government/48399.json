Furthermore for government spending to be denominated in alternative currencys according to what they can collected in tax\u2019s.\r\n\r\nFor the reworking or abolishment of current legal tender laws.\r\n\r\nThere is now an obvious trend towards the adoption of alternative currency\u2019s on an international scale. The US government via congress has already discussed possibilities of incorporating alternative currencies into its operations.\r\n\r\nWe the signers of this petition believe it would be wise for the UK government to embrace such innovations in money at an early stage.\r\n",
