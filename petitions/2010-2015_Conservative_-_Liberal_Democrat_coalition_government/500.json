        "additional_details": "The purpose of a drugs policy is to inevitably stop or reduce the amount of people taking drugs. Currently the system of banning substances has created a huge black market which costs us all money. I suggest the government decriminalise all substances under the  Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and introduce methods to help addicts, such as rehab programs. This can be paid for by taxing the drugs and also from the savings of the police, who would no longer have to spend so much time and paperwork on this matter. This will also remove the fear and oppression of people in this country and abroad as a result of the powerful black market.",
