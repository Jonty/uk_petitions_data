        "additional_details": "Google Glass, and likely other devices like it that may come along, allows users to record video directly while wearing them. As the technology improves, these types of devices may soon look like ordinary glasses and the fact they can record video while being worn, without any warning or indication of this, is a serious privacy concern.\r\n\r\nWe ask our Government to enact legislation to require companies that import, distribute and/or sell devices that are worn on or around the face to require a clearly visible LED light on the front of the device whenever it is actively recording video, in the interest of people's privacy.\r\n\r\nThere should also be minimum requirements for how bright the LED light needs to be, the size of the LED and what colour it should emit when the device is recording video, so it is absolutely clear to those even at a distance when a wearable device is recording.",
