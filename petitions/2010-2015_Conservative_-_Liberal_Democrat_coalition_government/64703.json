        "additional_details": "'Heaven is for real' was realised in America over Easter 2014. Yet is believed that it will not be played in Britain at all in cinemas, finding this out I was completely gutted. I believe what it says in the headlines of the advertisements 'life changing' as the prime minister said Britain is a christian country. In my heart I believe that it's right for Britain to get the chance to see this film. I've been excited for it to come out since I've heard about it. We all need to watch life changing films/programmes for the good and to bring hope back into our lives. To make up for the bad things that happen in the world/lives. Would appreciate if you signed this petition if you feel the same way about the film and take it seriously. Thank you. Much Love xx",
