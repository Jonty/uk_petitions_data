Why should they be allowed a 5% increase in 2012 when the people who actually work in the public sector are having their pay frozen for a number of years.\r\n\r\nPeople on benefits should be given the minimum - not be better off for not going to work!\r\n\r\nAlso, the benefits should be paid in vouchers - not cash!  They should be told what and where they can spend the benefits on so it stops them buying luxury items (i.e. alcohol, cigarettes etc)",
