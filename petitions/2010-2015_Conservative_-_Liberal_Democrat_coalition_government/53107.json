        "additional_details": "The population of stray and feral cats is a problem that will soon be out of control unless appropriate measures are taken. The whole cycle of irresponsible breeding and abandonment causes huge suffering and the needless loss of life for thousands of cats and kittens each year. It also places a heavy burden on the charitable and voluntary rescue centres snd causes a huge cost to the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe non-profit organization Caring For Animals calls on the government to take urgent control of the national cat population. We want to see: 1. Compulsory & neutering of all cats, unless licensed for breeding. 2. Stricter licensing so that all cat breeding, regardless of the number of litters involved, is under proper local authority control, inspection & annual review. 3. Stricter enforcement to weed-out irresponsible owners and breeders. This petition differs from similar ones relating to dog breeding only in that the problem involves greater numbers of litters being born at a faster rate.",
