        "additional_details": "Currently there is no regulation on private event medical and first aid companies that cover events. These events could be festivals, school fetes, marathons or anything really that has a risk of injury or people becoming unwell.\r\n\r\nThis means that these companies can prescribe and administer drugs to patients without any regulation. There is no requirement for minimum qualifications and nobody checks to see if these companies are qualified. They can be started overnight with minimal cost.\r\n\r\nIt must be regulated to protect patients and help filter out the unqualified companies.\r\n\r\nThe best organisation to handle this would be the CQC who regulate private ambulance companies only if they have an ambulance. There are many event cover/medical companies which get away with it as they do not use ambulances.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to support the CQC regulating private first aid and medical cover companies.",
