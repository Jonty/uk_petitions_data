        "additional_details": "I wish to petition the government to abolish the 3 year residency rule for spouses of British expats living and working abroad. I believe the rule would force many couples to live apart for 3 years just so one of the couple can apply for citizenship. I am sure there are many such as myself who are forced to work abroad because we cannot find work in the United Kingdom. The separation is also likely to be at the start of the marriage for many couples and so felt more keenly. The government should show respect for family and private life and make the rule equitable to all living and working abroad \u2013 government staff and those on government contracts are already exempt from the residency requirements.",
