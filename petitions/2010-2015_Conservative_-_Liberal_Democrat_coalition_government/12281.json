        "additional_details": "My petition is that the NHS improve the quality of wigs for people with long term total hair loss. Presently they supply cheap fashion wigs designed for occasional use they are made of man made fibres. They are uncomfortable and designed to fit over your own hair. If you do not have any hair they are too large, a one size fits all. Using them on a permeant basis means washing and styling is a impossible task.\r\nIt is a travesty that the NHS is using cheap fashion wigs that were never designed to be used on a daily basis rather than prescribing a proper prothesis made for the individual patient.\r\n ",
