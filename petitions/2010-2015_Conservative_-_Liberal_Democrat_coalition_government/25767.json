Londoners have sadly got used to it but the high prices, the constant signal failures and the continued threat of strikes is going to cripple the UK financially. The world will see we have a transport system that is expensive and doesn't work and tourists won't return which will cost us. Make London Underground Ltd implement radical and significant changes to this critical service as a trial during the Olympics; changes which are maintained after the Olympics have finished if service and price have been improved.",
