        "additional_details": "Currently, TfL are robbing Londoners blind with the highest prices in Europe. Purchasing a montly travelcard gives the holder travel for one calendar month but a lot of people don't may not travel on weekends, losing around 8 days of paid travel and money per month.\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial for everyone using the system if it worked on a days-used system, so that once you tap in using an Oyster card, that counts as a day used until the day is over, thus saving Londoners money during a time when wages have been frozen since around 2008 yet everything else has increased in price.",
