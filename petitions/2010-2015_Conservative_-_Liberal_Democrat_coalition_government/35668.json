        "additional_details": "In a time of government spending reductions, the defence of the UK should NOT be put at risk. This is not only a recent problem, for example if the HMS Ark Royal was not scrapped, I believe the Falklands War would have come to a swifter conclusion, ending with less deaths and equipment loss- or even would have proven a big enough threat to Argentina for them to think again. Recently, government RAF spending cuts were shown up when bombing sorties over Libya stretched the force to its very limits. The government should get its priorities correct, and stop cutting essential sectors such as defence and public services amongst others. Sign this petition if you believe that this is the case, stand up for your defence!",
