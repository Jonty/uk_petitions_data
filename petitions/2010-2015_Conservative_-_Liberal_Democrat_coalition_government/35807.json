        "additional_details": "Any graduate undertaking undergraduate (UG) Medicine is not entitled to a tuition fee loan from the Student Loans Company.  With the tuition fee rise from September 2012, a student starting UG Medicine as second degree will be forced to self fund \u00a39,000 per year for 4 years. I feel this is an unfair amount, totalling \u00a336,000, for anyone to afford without any funding.  When the tuition fee rise was introduced, I feel this policy of not funding graduates studying UG Medicine should have been addressed with some sensibility and the realisation that \u00a39,000 per year is unrealistic for most graduates to afford.  The government should introduce, in my opinion, some form of tuition fee support for graduates entering UG Medicine; whether these are at an increased interest rate, reduced loan amount or a loan for only some of the years of study. The employment rate of medical students shows this will be a worthwhile investment for Student Finance and the government who are guaranteed a return.",
