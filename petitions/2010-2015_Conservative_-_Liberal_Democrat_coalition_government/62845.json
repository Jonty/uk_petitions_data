        "additional_details": "The UK black and ethnic minority (BEM) population is roughly 10m or 15% of total 65m UK population. In 2014 there has been several media reports on the flight to the USA and subsequent success of black British film and television talent. It is noteworthy that in the USA affirmative action was first introduced in 1932 by FD Roosevelt and first used for racial non-discrimination purposes by JF Kennedy's Civil Rights executive order 10925 in 1961 as part of the US civil rights movement. The US legislation still applies today.\r\n\r\nI propose that the BBC TV License is in fact a government contract between the UK Government and license fee payers and as such the BBC workforce both in front and behind-the-camera in particular should be subject to the proposed affirmative action of 15% proportionate representation of black and ethnic minorities (BEMs). Please sign and pass along.",
