        "additional_details": "Working in a school over the years I regularly hear children as young as Six explaining to their friends, in graphic detail, the people they have killed online. Children are becoming more and more aggressive and violent, desensitized to crime with no understanding of good morals. British values are lost amongst the online wars that children tune into everyday after school. Government do not make it a criminal offence for parents to allow children to play such games. Yet if a parent was to expose their child to pornography it would be a different matter? Parents take no responsibility for protecting their children. An important question is why would anyone want to play violent games? What sane person enjoys pretending to kill someone and why are we allowing it? Violence is no longer shocking and will continue to rise if we continue to allow the media to encourage children and adults to glorify it. Ban violent games or make it a criminal offense for children to play 15 or 18 rated games.",
