        "additional_details": "Virgin Media has a monopoly on the cable communication network in the UK.  It should be open to all to use.  Competing broadcasters should be allowed to use the network to give the consumer a choice of programming packages.  The internet is stifled by the lack of competition on the network as well.  Others should, by law, be allowed to broadcast channels or internet, locally or nationally at a reasonable cost.  This will not happen as long as the infrastructure is controlled by one company.  Communication is a right in a democracy, it should not be controlled by one company.",
