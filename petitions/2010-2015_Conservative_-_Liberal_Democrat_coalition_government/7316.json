        "additional_details": "Following three nights of lawless destruction in London and Birmingham, I propose the HM Government should lead the way to set up, immediately, a compensation fund for the many victims who have lost their homes and their businesses.\r\n\r\nThis fund should be provided and managed through the Disasters and Emergency Committee, and a judicial committee should be appointed to assist victims in administering compensation. A portion of this fund, however much it should be, should also be used to fund civil law suits against perpetrators, should victims wish to take legal action aside from any public prosecution.\r\n\r\nWe the decent law abiding people of Britain must show solidarity for innocent victims of crime and demand the Government put funding in place. \u00a39bn of the \u00a311bn earmarked for the NHS IT system has not been spent, so the Govt has the cash.",
