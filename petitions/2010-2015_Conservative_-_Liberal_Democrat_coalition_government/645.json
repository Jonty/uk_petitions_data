        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the government to create a Charities Ombudsman with the power to deal with complaints about charities and the authority to order a charity to provide adequate redress if a complaint is upheld..\r\n\r\nThe Charity Commission is unable to get involved in a wide range of complaints because they are not within its remit.\r\n\r\nIf a complainant is dissatisfied with the outcome of a Charity's own internal complaints procedure their only remaining option is the legal system.  With legal aid being cut drastically this is beyond the reach of the majority of people.\r\n\r\nMany charities are now running services or even acting as law enforcement agencies, so it is important that they are seen to be properly regulated and to have an effective and objective independent external complaints procedure.\r\n\r\nWe want Parliament to debate this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
