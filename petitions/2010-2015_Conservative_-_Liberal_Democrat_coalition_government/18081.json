        "additional_details": "This petition is to initiate a campaign for reform of the Department for Work and Pensions and also Job Centre Plus.\r\nThe issues to be addressed are;\r\nImproved efficiency of administration.\r\nIncreased accountability of staff. A proposed option being employee identification numbers, to improve clients ability to identify who they have communicated with.\r\nImprovements to the delivery of services.\r\nThe abolition of the \"Balance of probability\" policy.\r\nEasy, instant access to DWP and JCP policies and legislation through any Job Centre or the internet. Currently there is no easy way to attain up to date information on policies etc. directly.\r\nThe disposal of ATOS health assessments and the use of the NHS with payments going to the NHS.\r\nSatisfaction surveys, which will have results shown publicly and independently. This would measure performance and highlight problem areas.\r\nThere are many other areas where reform is needed.\r\n",
