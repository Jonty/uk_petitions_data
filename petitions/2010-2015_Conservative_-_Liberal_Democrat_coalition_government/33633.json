        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge the Government to resurrect the 'Wind Turbines (Minimum Distances from Residential Premises) Bill' by Lord Reay (HL Bill 17), which was dismissed in January 2012 after 2 readings.\r\n\r\nWhilst the issue of tackling climate change is an important one, it cannot be given greater priority than the health, safety and wellbeing of the people who would end up living in the shadow of a wind farm/turbine.  Lord Reay's Bill is well written;  It caters for turbines of various categories (taking into consideration the risk factors of each category) and has since been proved as being highly relevant after a case brought before the High Court in 2011 which resulted in an out of court settlement for the family who had suffered immensely as a result of a wind farm being built too close to their home.",
