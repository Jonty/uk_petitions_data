        "additional_details": "On the 5th of June 2013, it was reported that due to funding cuts that possible 1 of 3, of the Science Museum Group, museums was at risk of closure.\r\n\r\nThis is a dreadful situation that could have deep and lasting impact of the cultural importance\u2019s of 3 vital visitor attractions in northern towns. It demonstrates the governments lack of foresight in trying to cut funding without considering the impact on communities.\r\n\r\nThe petition aims to show the strength of feeling against reducing the grants in kind to the Science Museum Group. It shows that free admission to cultural important museums should be persevered and that we need national centres and museums around the country and not just in the south and London.\r\n\r\nEach of the 3 museums under threaten are vital to attract tourists to the north and their loss would be fell by the wider economy.\r\n",
