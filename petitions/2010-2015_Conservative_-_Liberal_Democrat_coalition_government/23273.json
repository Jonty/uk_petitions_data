        "additional_details": "Each year Children in Need raises millions for good causes through the sterling effort and generosity of millions of people across the UK. Each year we see videos of charities supported by C.I.N. who cannot afford to fully function due to funding issues. Supporting the children using the charities on the videos should not rely on charity for income. The government should take it on board to make sure all these services are funded directly. People are suffering, struggling , children are dying and the providers of these services rely on charity to work.  THE UK TAX payer calls for the government to DO MORE. CIN can do miracles with the money it raises each year we call on the government could to accept it SHOULD be responsible for these services not charity. ",
