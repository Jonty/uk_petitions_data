        "additional_details": "The EHRC costs taxpayers \u00a353 million a year. It spends ten million pounds per annum on politically correct initiatives such as \u201crace equality councils\u201d and \u201cpromoting equality and human rights\u201d without even knowing where much of the money goes.\r\n\r\nI suggest we close this quango down and use the money in the NHS or schools instead. We have never needed this quango and never will, it is a complete waste of taxpayers money.",
