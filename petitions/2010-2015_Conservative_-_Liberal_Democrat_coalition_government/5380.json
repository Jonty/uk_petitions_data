        "additional_details": "One of the biggest factors contributing to ongoing gender inequality in the workplace is the cost, complexity and uncertainty related to childcare provision. Father involvement in parenting is also lessened by conflicts with work.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests a law making it compulsory for all businesses over 50 employees to provide childcare facilities for newborn to 5 year old children of their employees, sited within a five minute walk of work and open while the business is open plus half an hour on either end. Shared provision between different companies would be encouraged, and employers would be prevented from discriminating against employees visiting their children for up to 20 minutes per day.",
