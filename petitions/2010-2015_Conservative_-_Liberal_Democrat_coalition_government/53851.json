        "additional_details": "Many people (women in particular) face a great deal of resistance from the medical profession when applying for sterilisation, therefore often having to use unsatisfactory contraceptive alternatives. This is partly due to a minority of individuals who later have their sterilisations reversed. Sterilisation reversals are often unsuccessful and extremely invasive and risky. Overpopulation is also a serious economic and environmental issue.\r\n\r\nAn individual's age and lack of children is often used as a reason to refuse to perform sterilisation. Every person is entitled to a reproductive choice, and this should be widely available upon request. Sterilisation is intended to be a permanent procedure and reversals should no longer be offered, including in private healthcare.",
