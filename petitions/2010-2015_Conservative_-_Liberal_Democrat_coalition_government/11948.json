        "additional_details": "I petition that a new sentencing plan to tackle serious and or repeating juvenile offending be created as follows:\r\n(1) When a child is charged and prosecuted with a serious offence but unable to serve a custodial sentence a tariff sentence be added to the sentence and served if the offender commits and is convicted as an adult, regardless of the charge.\r\n(2) If they continue to be charged as a juvenile then the tariff  clocks up and is served whole if offending continues as an adult.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this type of sentence is to not only ensure that juveniles pay for their crimes if they do not learn their lesson.  It is to also have the tariff act a deterrent against them committing further crimes, especially as an adult knowing that they would serve a guaranteed custodial sentence.",
