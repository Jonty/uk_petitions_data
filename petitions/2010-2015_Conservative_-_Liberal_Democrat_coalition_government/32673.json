        "additional_details": "We call on the United Kingdom Parliament to vote and decide on the funding of the Trident renewal programme in this Parliament. We note that the Coalition Government have postponed a decision on Trident until after the 2015 General Election, and we note the increased costs caused solely by this delay.\r\n\r\nWe urge the United Kingdom not to renew and upgrade the present UK strategic deterrent. We believe non-renewal should be part of the multi-national nuclear weapon reduction process.\r\n\r\nWe believe that part of the cost savings resulting from this decision should be used to substantially reduce the cap on individual student tuition fees.\r\n",
