        "additional_details": "There is currently a postcode lottery for free 24 hour care in the community for those who wish to die at home. This means that a lot of people who want to go home to die cannot, simply as the care they need isn't available to them. This is especially true for people who may not have friends and family to care for them. I hope to make a difference by petitioning for everyone in the UK to be able to access 24 hour community care for free.\r\n\r\nI want the government to change the rules and eradicate this postcode lottery, so that EVERYONE regardless of where the live is able to die at home with the care they require. The area where the patient lives should not dictate the care they are entitled to, their needs should! Residential care is paid for for those who meet fast track criteria, so why isn't domiciliary care??",
