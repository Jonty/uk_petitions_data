        "additional_details": "There have been many allegations of rampant child sex abuse in children's care homes in England and Wales over a period of 40 plus years.  We call for the government to set up an independent, public enquiry to establish who knew what, when they knew it and what level of complicity the individuals, no matter how peripheral, involved have. We demand that the enquiry is followed where ever it may lead at whatever cost it may exact upon the enquirers.  And we demand this takes place as swiftly as possible.",
