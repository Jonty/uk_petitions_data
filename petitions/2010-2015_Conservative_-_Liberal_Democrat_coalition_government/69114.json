        "additional_details": "The new road tax laws are just another way of ripping the people of Britain off. Before when you sold a vehicle any remainder of Road Tax be it a day even transfered to the new owner but now if you were to sell a vehicle on the 1st of a month you would only recieve a refund from the next month but still would then have to pay for the new car for an entire month. the system is designed to make things difficult for honest buyers and will not discourage the illegal drivers who drive with no tax mot or insurance as they simply do not care. It will make buying and selling of private cars for private sellers more difficult and small time traders will be almost impossible without the added cost of trade plates or more recovery vehicles. I would like the government to make the system fair for everyone not just thierselves.",
