        "action": "Ban hands-free mobile phone use while driving",
        "additional_details": "Contrary to popular belief, the risk caused by using a mobile phone while driving is not caused by having only one hand to steer with, but rather by increased cognitive workload as a result of the conversation. This results in the brain having impaired problem solving skills and slower reaction times. It therefore makes little or no difference whether or not the mobile phone is on hands-free.\r\n\r\nAccording to an IAM study in March 2012, using a hands-free mobile phone while driving slows a person's reaction times by 26.5%, while for comparison driving while at the legal limit of alcohol slows their reaction times by 12.5%.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I think it would reasonable to ban hands-free mobile phone use aswell, with exceptions still allowed for calls to emergency services when stopping is unsafe or impractical. Doing so could save hundreds of lives each year.",
