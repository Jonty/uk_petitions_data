        "additional_details": "The Audit commission report (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20613183) confirmed English Councils reserves approach \u00a313Bn which is just being \"hoarded\" for no particular purpose.\r\n\r\nThese reserves should be clawed back by The Government either in part or as a whole to either:\r\n\r\n1. Allow councils to build affordable housing directly\r\n2. Fund major infrastructure projects but not HS2\r\n3. Allow the government to lower VAT to a sensible figure (hence subsidising the impact)\r\n4. Form part of measures to kick start business by way of grants for new businesses.\r\n5. Other ideas not mentioned above ....this topic is open for sensible debate.\r\n\r\nFundamentally, Councils should not continue to \"build empires\" and hoard cash reserves partly made up of parking fines etc...\r\n\r\nThe \u00a313Bn of Council funds should be used positively for the local or national benefit.
