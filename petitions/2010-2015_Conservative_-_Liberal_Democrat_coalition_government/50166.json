Instead one must drive to England, where on the North East coast there are several crossings.  And, on the South coast of England too many to mention.\r\n\r\nSurely Scotland should not rely on England for its transportation needs. Why must people driving to Europe not be able to cross from Scotland and vice versa. Tourists to Scotland must drive the length of England to reach Scotland by Car or Campervan. This just is not a satisfactory state of affairs for a country seeking independance from the UK.\r\n\r\nSomething should be done. ",
