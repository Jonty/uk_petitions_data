        "additional_details": "For some time now patients of Bitterne, Southampton have been without out of hours Dr's service at the walk in center.\r\n\r\nThis service was essential to the people of Bitterne. Elderly and disabled people within Bitterne, Merry Oak, Thornhill and other areas that depended on this service when it was available during weekends and bank holidays etc.\r\n\r\nNow we are forced to use the out of hours service at the Royal South Hants Hospital.\r\n\r\nFor those who need medical help at weekends are forced to go into the city when this unit in Bitterne would have saved money and waiting for public transport into the city and then transport to the RSH.\r\n\r\nSo please reinstated this vital service to the people of Bitterne.",
