This will leave many vulnerable residents of this city without community support, and leave them without the physical activity that keeps them well, and out of hospital. The loss of the service, or the continuation of cuts to its budget, will not be a saving but will shift the cost onto the NHS, through admissions to hospitals and extra visits to GPS and as in the case, due to lack of beds, and reduced community mental health teams, the police picking up vulnerable people that are not being supported in our communities. Please support us to keep this much needed service funded at a level that can sustain the current programme. please sign our petion below.",
