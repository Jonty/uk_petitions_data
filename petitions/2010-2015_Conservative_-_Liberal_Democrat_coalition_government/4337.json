        "additional_details": "Income Tax (an example of Direct Taxation) is unfair and is detrimental to all, including the poor.  Whereas Indirect Taxation is a fairer system as the more you spend the more you pay - so the rich pay nore for their luxuries and the poor pay less tax (if any at all) for essentials.   So abolishinhing Direct Taxation and increasing Indirect Taxation means the poor could be tax-free, the rich would pay more tax, people would be encouraged to save more of their wages and foreigners would contribute more to ouR taxation when spending money inthe UK.",
