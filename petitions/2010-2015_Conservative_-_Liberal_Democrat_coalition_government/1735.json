        "additional_details": "To once again bring the rail industry in to the public sector.\r\nMajor network infrastructure improvements are paid for by the taxpayer. For example the \u00a38bn upgrade of the east coast mainline was funded by the taxpayer while Virgin trains, the private operator, netted a \u00a318m profit this year.\r\nThe rail industry currently receives a \u00a34.6bn subsidy from the Government each year to ensure unprofitable services remain open. Under British rail in 1994 the subsidy was only \u00a32.2bn (inflation adjusted).\r\nNetwork rail is in effect under state control as is the East Coast franchise and all Northern Ireland trains. It is time to stop private companies levying a profit and raising ticket prices year on year, on the basic need to travel, while receiving a huge subsidy.\r\nA state operator would have no shareholders to drive for large profits and unify the country under one timetable.\r\nHere by petition the government to re nationalize the railways.\r\n",
