        "additional_details": "Parents currently have the right to deregister their children from school to home educate them. While many parents are responsible and provide an education, the local authority is currently powerless to ensure the child is receiving a suitable education that prepares them for society and suits their needs. This loophole in child protection, ignores the rights of the child to be educated; it cannot be assumed that everyone that deregisters their child has the skill, desire or motivation to provide a suitable education for their child. This petition is for a reform in the legislation on elective home education, to make it compulsory for the child to be registered as being home educated and to be regularly visited by the local authority to ensure the child is receiving an education and their needs are not being neglected.",
