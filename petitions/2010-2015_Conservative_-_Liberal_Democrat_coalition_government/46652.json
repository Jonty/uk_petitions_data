The project would be assessed on total carbon footprint, and therefore cheap imports from China and alike should not be able to compete with UK based suppliers.\r\n\r\nThe UK economy would benefit hugely, the government would reduce its overheads as its energy would be free, it would help achieve our commitments to the Kyoto protocol, set an example to the rest of the world, and who knows...we may even help save the planet!\r\n\r\nPlease vote for this e-petition.\r\n\r\nDavid H",
