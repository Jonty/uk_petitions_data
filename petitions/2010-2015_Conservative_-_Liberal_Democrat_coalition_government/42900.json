As we are a small pressure group it is difficult to gain the support of the public , however , we believe that if the government was to talk about our issue then we would have more chance of making a change . We have already began writing letters to several people with high authority , and on Wednesday 12th December 2012 We will be giving a presentation to James Clappison (MP) and Charles Kelly (Borehamwood mayor) We would really really appreciated it if you accepted our petition as it is a big step and will really boost our campaign. Thank you.",
