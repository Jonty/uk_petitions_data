        "additional_details": "The government has put forward the idea of charging patients to see their G.P. This notion will destroy the entire foundations and principles of the N.H.S. The  N.H.S was introduced in 1948 and was a part of the Welfare State. Before 1948 poor people could not afford to see the doctor, and therefore were subjected to disease, and early deaths. Moreover, to implement a payment to see a G.P. would be a massive step backward, which eventually would lead to an overall deterioration of the health and welfare of an entire nation. Therefore the government must not introduce charges for patients to see their G.P.",
