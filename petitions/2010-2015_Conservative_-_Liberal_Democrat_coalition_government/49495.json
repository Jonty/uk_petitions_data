        "action": "Amend the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and uphold local democratic decision making",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the NPPF is inherently unsound leading to irreversible loss of open countryside and irreparable damage to valuable landscape and heritage assets which are highly valued by local communities.  Prioritisation of economic factors and presumption to develop, together with risible sustainability criteria, is leading to decisions from the Planning Inspectorate that damage local communities and create expensive problems.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the NPPF flouts local opinion and damages democracy.  The NPPF is unjustly prejudiced in the interest of the construction industry and developers to the detriment of the local electorate, community, countryside, farming and tourism.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon the Government to amend the NPPF by removing the over-riding presumption in favour of alleged sustainable development, by giving Local Plans over-riding priority and, where necessary, to allow Local Authorities a further period of grace to revise their Local Plans.",
