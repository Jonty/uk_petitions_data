The system needs to be robust with proactive policing and instant suspension pending investigation. If they are found guilty they need to be sacked with loss of pension and pay. There also needs to be heavy fines and prison for the worst offenders. Obviously they should never be allowed to be involved in Politics again.\r\n\r\nThere should be single telephone number and email address where members of the public can report Politician's that are breaking the rules. The system should be totally transparent.  The whole process must be independent  with no political interference. ",
