        "additional_details": "The Government plan to shut down Burnholme Community College as they do not have a sufficient amount of pupils. As the money the school recieves depends on the amount of pupils attending the school, they are short on money. The money they have is not covering the total running costs and staff wages they are needing to pay, which is partly why the school is closing. This has caused much upset and floods of Facebook Groups and plans trying to keep it open, but we now wish to make this happen. We believe we need the Governments help as to keep this excellent school open. Therefore the action we would like the Government to take to solve this problem would be, not to close the school. This school has very good GSCE scores over the years, and the OFSTEAD reports have shown the quality of education provided at our school. Closure means many pupils will not get the best out of their education.",
