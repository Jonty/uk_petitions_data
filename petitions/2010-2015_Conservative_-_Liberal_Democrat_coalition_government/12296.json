The cost to the nation in lost production, fuel wastage, pollution and additional commercial/delivery charges is unquantifiable.   This river crossing is a National disgrace.\r\nI call upon the MInistry to set up an enquiry to establish ways and means of improving the traffic flow efficiency on this river crossing.  Would removing the toll booths improve traffic flow or would it be too dangerous?   I also ask the Ministry to oppose any plans to give or sell this crossing and its infrastructure to a private company.\r\n",
