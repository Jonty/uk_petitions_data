        "additional_details": "First off, I believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion and everyone should have a say in what they believe, however i do not believe Sharia Law should be a part of our legal system.\r\nWe should not introduce laws based on the Qur'an. Incorporating even part of Sharia Law undermines our own Justice System and British values.\r\nWe live in a great society - where men and woman are equal, all kinds of different people are accepted (homosexuals, transgender etc.). A fair society.\r\n\r\nPeople are too quick to point the finger and say that disliking the Muslim religion and disagreeing with it - is racist. I think we need to realize, this isn't about any individual Muslim person or people, this is simply about the Religion and its old fashioned values. I encourage those who have not read the Qur'an or Sharia Laws - to read it and find out for yourself.\r\n\r\nI think we should not allow any Sharia Laws incorporated into our Justice System or allow it into our society.
