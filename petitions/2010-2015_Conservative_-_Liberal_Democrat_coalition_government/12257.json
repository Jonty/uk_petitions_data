        "additional_details": "Turning off street lights during the night will only provide for haven for criminals.\r\n\r\nQuite rightly this will save power, however criminals will have even more opportunities to commit crime as they will be more confident, and quite rightly, that they will not be identified. Cameras will not be able to identify them accurately and people will not be able to identify criminals or avoid and escape a possible attack. In short, every street which has its lights turned off will turn into a dark alley of which you would usually avoid.\r\n\r\nPeople would not feel safe walking through their own residential areas.",
