These actions resulted in totally innocent people, including the 96 deceased and their families, the survivors and the people of Liverpool worldwide, being unjustly vilified, stigmatised and tarnished for 23 years.\r\n\r\nThe former MP\u2019s actions have brought the honours system into disrepute and they should be removed as a matter of urgency.\r\n",
