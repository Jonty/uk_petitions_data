The cost (in lost tax revenue) is minimal but the financial benefit for hard working families is massive. This is a group who the government claim to be concerned about and want to reward.\r\n\r\nThe new scheme only provides basic rate relief and only per child. The government also does not interfere with other salary sacrifice arrangements in the same way (pension, bike4work, car parking).",
