Rather than arresting them and wasting more of the TAX payers money, will instead be automatically signed up to serve the country on a reduced wage. The money saved from the legal system, would save everyone so much money, also providing us with a army that will protect the country.\r\nThey will then learn what respect means, they will learn about the men and women that saved them in the last world wars, they will also find out what its like to fight for their lives on the front line.\r\nThis should be compulsory to all that are arrested. This would solve all the issues that we now have in the country, it would also give these people a cause, which they do not have at the moment.\r\n\r\ncompulsory Active service for anyone aged 17 - 24 who cause trouble within their community...\r\n\r\nThis is what should be done. Sign today so we can make a difference for their futures...",
