        "additional_details": "Keeping UK time constant all year will be less confusing & therefore cause fewer accidents as a result. This is because people get \u2018acclimatised\u2019 & habituated towards the daylight hours available to them during times of the day when doing certain tasks like going to or returning from work or school. What is accepted as the chronological time at any fleeting moments interacts & affects people\u2019s idiosyncratic & varied lives. Therefore it is important to have a bottom-up approach by having a referendum on whether to keep: (1) the status quo and continue with the present alternating GMT in the winter & BST in the summer (2) UK time should be kept constant all year round at GMT (3) UK time should be kept constant all year round at BST (4) UK time should be kept constant all year round at continental time (2 hours ahead of GMT).",
