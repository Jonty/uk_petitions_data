        "additional_details": "We are campaigning to legalise assisted dying in the UK. Assisted dying is when a terminally ill, mentally competent adult, making the choice of their own free will and after meeting strict legal safeguards, take prescribed medication which will end their life. We understand that the current legal position is trying to protect the most venerable in our society but in doing so it causes a great deal of suffering for those who face death with a great deal for fear and concern for their dignity. We believe these people should be given a legal and medical pathway to fulfill their wishes whilst also protecting their loved ones who might otherwise risk protection I action on there belief.",
