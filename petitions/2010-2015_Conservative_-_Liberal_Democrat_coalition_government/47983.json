We The People of The United Kingdom are just tired of the cross party sniping, bickering & attempts to make political mileage whilst issues such as the Qatada debacle stumble on costing the tax payer a fortune. In line with The People's demands, ALL political parties MUST work together to reject this bill of Human Rights & return legislation of this sort back to where it belongs...Westminster. Failure to do so shall see you all punished at the ballot box!",
