        "action": "Abolish the Housing Benefit change of definition for young individual",
        "additional_details": "As it currently stands the definition of a young individual is stated as the age of 25. As of January 2012 this will be changed to 35 years of age. The change in this age limit will affect thousands of people, especially living in inner London who will have a maximum benefit entitlement of \u00a3100 per week.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to abolish this change for current claimants and to only impose this change to new claimants from January 2012, who will not lose their current home they already live in, but to make those claiming after this date find suitable accommodation within this new budget. This will enable a significant amount of single rooms to be available to new claimants without having to also compete with those who are loosing their homes due to the change in legislation.",
