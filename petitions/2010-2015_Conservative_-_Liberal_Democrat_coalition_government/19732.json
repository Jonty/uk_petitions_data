        "additional_details": "In Around 2005 Canterbury City Council Street Naming & Numbering ,Addressed the property i live at incorrectly and today they are still refusing to correct the mistake.\r\nEven though it states in Canterbury City Council's own Street Naming and Numbering Guidelines,If a building has entrances in more than one street, is a multi-occupied building and each entrance leads to a separate occupier, each entrance should be numbered in the appropriate road. The building i live at has been converted into 6 Apartments 1 accessed from London Road and Apartments 2-6 accessed from Whitstable Road. The council in 2005 issued all 6 apartments with the address 1 London Road, this causes great confusion with postal services, emergency services, delivery services & visitors.",
