        "additional_details": "Make it mandatory that by 2025 / 2030? That all busses + lorries across the country should be fuel cell powered and all cars 5 years later.\r\nThis will bring a vast amount of jobs to the country as we can produce our own hydrogen since we are surrounded by water! It will make our reliance on foreign fuels practically zero! Electric cars are not the way to go fuel cell cars are! The technology is there, London is already served by fuel cell busses and 2012 fuel cell taxis why not spread this to all cars and lorries on the roads reduce our carbon footprint ! Ok the infrastructure is not there yet (hydrogen production plants and hydrogen \u201cpetrol\u201d stations) but with the right investment it would not take long to get it.\r\nYou can even tax the hydrogen and well even with tax it will cost less than \u00a31 a litre!\r\n",
