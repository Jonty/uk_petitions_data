These represent people who have saved sufficient pension that they are concerned about the \u00a31.5m Lifetime Allowance.\r\n\r\nThey should be excluded from Auto-Enrolment automatically as there is only a downside to them - that they forget to opt-out and end up losing their lifetime allowance protection which would cause an additional unwarranted tax charge.\r\n",
