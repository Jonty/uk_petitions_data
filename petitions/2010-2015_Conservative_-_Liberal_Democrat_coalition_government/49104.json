        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to pass a law that requires all Businesses and Data Holders to be required to have my consent to hold my data and more especially to publish my data. This would include websites like 192.com and the selling of the Electoral Role with my data to companies. I have almost daily experiences where Job Sites and other companies contact me with out of Date and often personal data acquired from sources that they are not always willing to reveal. Why should these organisations have the right to keep or purchase data about me without my knowledge? It is a gross invasion of privacy and in these days of identity theft leaves the door open to all unscrupulous persons and organisations to carry on unabated with data they do not always have the right to use.",
