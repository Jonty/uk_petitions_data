If we get this petition heard and MP's do nothing to put this right, then the politicians will have to except the consequences of their actions. We need representation from those who want to represent with honesty, integrity and for the well being of all who love this country. Don't let them continually get away with a feeble sorry whilst continuing to earn a salary and pension as well as outside financial gains. Don't let them squander the public's money by making life better for themselves, their friends and business associates. HELP PUT A STOP TO THIS.\r\nIf they are found to have lied...We want them out. We do not want them representing the people whichever party they are from.\r\n",
