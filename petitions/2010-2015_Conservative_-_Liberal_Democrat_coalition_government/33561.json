This is very irresponsible for the millions of problem Gamblers in the UK. Problem gamblers are people who cannot stop gambling so having deposit limits helps people minimize their known risk when they are not gambling and thinking rationally.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted Betvictor do operate a self exclusion policy for their whole website; however this does not get to the heart of addictive gambling. Many problem Gamblers convince themselves that they can control it when they cannot; allowing them to minimize their risk when they know deep down their own actions cannot be controlled must be the responsibility of the bookmaker.\r\n\r\n",
