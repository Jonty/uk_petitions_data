        "action": "STOP BURBO BANK EXTENSION WIND FARM",
        "additional_details": "The planned Burbo Bank Extension Offshore Wind Farm in Liverpool Bay will destroy the natural beauty of the seascape because it is far too close to the North Wirral coastline. At just 7km offshore the existing Burbo Bank Wind Farm appears much closer than that. The planned extension will be the same distance offshore but with significantly more and very much higher turbines. It will stretch roughly westwards from the existing Burbo Bank Wind Farm along the North Wirral coast.\r\n\r\nWhile the detrimental visual impact may harm job prospects in the area by making it less attractive as a tourist destination, in particular as a location for the Golf Open, the developer has admitted that very few local jobs will be created by the wind farm.\r\n\r\nAs with all wind farms, this development will not be economically viable without the government subsidy paid for by higher energy bills for us all.\r\n\r\nPlease help stop this Wind Farm as it is currently planned by signing this petition.",
