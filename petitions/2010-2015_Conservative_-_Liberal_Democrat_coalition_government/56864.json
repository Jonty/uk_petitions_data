        "additional_details": "US drone attacks have resulted in deaths of innocent civilians and extra judicial killings of suspected militants in Pakistan near border with Afghanistan which violate human rights; are classed as a \u2018war crime\u2019 by UN and violate Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty.\r\n\r\nAmnesty International stated in its recent report (Will I be next?\u2019 US drone strikes in Pakistan) that Pakistan government sources confirm that the USA has launched 330 to 374 drone strikes in Pakistan between 2004 and September 2013.  As per these sources, between 400 and 900 civilians have been killed in these attacks and, at least 600 people have been seriously injured with life changing injuries.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we demand UK Government to stop any technical or intelligence assistance in this covert war of drones by US which kill innocent civilians; violate human rights and Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty and, do not be party to such \u2018war crime\u2019.",
