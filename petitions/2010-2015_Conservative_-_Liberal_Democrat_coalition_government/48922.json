        "additional_details": "BT have declined to upgrade the Hollingbourne telephone exchange in Kent and many others in rural areas on the grounds that it is \"not commercially viable\". This means that many residents have poor or restricted internet access which means that distance learning, e-commerce, and online applications for the Universal Credit are difficult if not impossible. BT should not be allowed to abuse their monopoly position by putting their profits before the provision of a reliable telephone and internet service.",
