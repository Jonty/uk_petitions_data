        "additional_details": "This petition is being created to reject George Osborne\u2019s increment cuts for all NHS staff starting 2015. Staff throughout the NHS work exceptionally hard to keep this country running and it is an insult that now our pay is at stake due to mistakes made by previous governments. NHS staff take on high levels of responsibility in various roles within the NHS and we deserve to get fair pay for it. There are plenty of other areas to make savings that are painfully obvious for people living in the real world such as the benefits system or keeping NHS care for British residents stopping health care tourism that is crippling the NHS. Stop punishing hard working people!  ",
