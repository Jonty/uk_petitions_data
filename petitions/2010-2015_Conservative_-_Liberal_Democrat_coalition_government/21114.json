        "additional_details": "Scotland and England have a long history together, why should we change this?  Many Scottish Parties what to ruin the over 300 year old treaty, by leading many of us with false hopes and promises. Without England and the rest of the UK, Scotland will struggle greatly. We cannot let the two countries be separated out. I believe that the British Government should take firm action to keep Scotland tight with England and the rest of the UK, for traditional, social, and economical reasons. Please sign this petition, Thankyou. ",
