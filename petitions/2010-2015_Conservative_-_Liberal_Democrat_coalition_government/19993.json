        "additional_details": "The cost now of making a planning application is prohibitive for small business with no help from planning departments and its nearly impossible unless you have a degree in law to try to understand planning policy. As such i feel that a fixed cost of industrial buildings under 2000 sqm2 should only carry the same base cost as a  70 m2 building as the costs involved are the same, it seems the Goverment has a back door tax collecting agenda. Hence many companies wont apply because of the financial risk of refusal.",
