        "additional_details": "The expectations of the government to provide quality early years education would surely be jeopardised if ratios increase to allow a single person to care for either 4 babies(0-2years), 6 toddlers (2-3years) or 8 young children (3-4years) and still provide highly quality care, provision and education.\r\n\r\nThis petition aims for the government to revise their actions with regards to the increase of child ratios in early years settings so that children\u2019s wellbeing and progression remains high and staff remain motivated educators as pre-school education should focus on life skills to allow the next generation to be independent, confident individuals in society.\r\n",
