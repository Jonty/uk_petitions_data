The price increases represent between 11% and more than 100% of 2012 prices;\r\n\r\n2. The introduction of the new size restrictions on UK Mail is restrictive of trade and will have the effect of severely adversely affecting small businesses and the services they offer.\r\n\r\n3. The introduction of the \"maximum depth\" of 8cm for Small Packets is unreasonable and will have the effect of severely adversely affecting small businesses and the services they offer.\r\n\r\nAction required:\r\n\r\nA. The Government should require Royal Mail to freeze any proposed price increases for 2014 onwards.\r\n\r\nB. The Government should require Royal Mail to re-work any size restrictions to a TOTAL measurement of all surfaces in the Small Packet category to, for example, 88cm, allowing for the same volume but for slightly deeper products to fall within the Small Packets category.",
