        "additional_details": "It is widely known that Tony Blair while Prime Minister, conducted three acts of treason in relation to surrendering of sovereignty to the EU.\r\n\r\nIt is a damning indictment of our legal system that he has never faced investigation or charges for these crimes. He was in full knowledge of his crimes as he signed us up to Protocol 13 of Article 2, prohibiting the death penalty, as until that time, the punishment for treason was still death by hanging.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly unacceptable that a politician, past or present, can manipulate the law in order to escape justice.\r\n\r\nTony Blair, and other politicians who have committed these acts such as John Major and Gordon Brown, must be brought to a count for their crimes against the United Kingdom.",
