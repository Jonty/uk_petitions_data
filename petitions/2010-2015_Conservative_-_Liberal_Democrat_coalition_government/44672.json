        "additional_details": "JLS being deemed the hardest working band of 2012 is an absolutely disgusting insult to the music industry. Every year, thousands of bands/singers in the rock and metal industry literally run themselves into the ground, mentally and physically, to bring their music to their fans, and they get absolutely no recognition for it. JLS, a band who have had everything handed to them on a plate by Simon Cowell and his croonies, as well as the millions of fans over the world, have absolutely no place on the 'Hardest Working Band' list. It's actually a physical crime to put these spoonfed talentless wastes of musical space on any kind of 'hard working' list when hundreds and thousands of bands out there grind themselves down with little to no monetary gain or fame for the sake of the fans they have around the world.\r\n\r\nI believe the government should be keeping a closer eye on the media and know when they're simply doing something to appeal to the masses.",
