        "additional_details": "Not something that MPs are likely to want to rush through and approve, (Turkeys voting for Christmas comes to mind) but lets be honest, it\u2019s beyond a joke the amount a time an MP can take off a year from their duties. The average employee in the UK has on average 20-25 days paid holiday entitlement a year. If the House of Commons genuinely want to become more relevant to ordinary people, then they should start by giving MPs an ordinary holiday entitlement, like the rest of the working population. This e-petition is to call for a review and significant reduction in the amount of holiday entitlement for MPs and to bring them closer in line with ordinary UK employees.",
