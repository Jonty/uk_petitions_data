        "additional_details": "Most of the responsibility about sexual health and pregnancy seemed to be focused at woman and not at men.   \u201cYour Sperm, Your Responsibility\u201d petition is to encourages all men, young and old, to think about the consequences of uncommitted sex and the effects this has on women whether they becomes pregnant or not. This petition places the responsibility on men instead of women and also places the responsibility of sexual health and pregnancy on men. This petition will reduce teenage pregnancies, abortions and unplanned pregnancies, and improve pre-marital and post-martial relationships. This petition will address concerns about men not paying child support, and make men responsible for the high STI rates in London and in the United Kingdom.  This petition will also address Parental Responsibility issues and assist in resolving child support issues, well before they become legal disputes.",
