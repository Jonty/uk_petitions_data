        "additional_details": "The 'forced treatment' of mental health patients is a social evil, reminiscent of 1940-45 and our British ancestors would not approve of it: so let's stop it.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed in the long term is complete pastoral care, so that people don't for example have to be pinned down and injected against their will.\r\n\r\nThis practice is unspiritual: please help the vulnerable-not exploit them.\r\n\r\nMay i offer a lesson from Jesus too- 'through faith alone are we made whole'.\r\n\r\n",
