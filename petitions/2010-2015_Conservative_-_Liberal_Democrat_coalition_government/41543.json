        "additional_details": "I want the government to ban allowing companies to make cold calls to everybody either by landline or mobile phones. Not everyone knows of the TPS - and I know of elderly people out there who are scared to answer the phone because of cold callers. This is, in my view, harrassment of my human right and dont want to not answer the phone because I dont know who is at the other end. These companies are cold and calculating and so long as they are being paid dont care about human beings. ",
