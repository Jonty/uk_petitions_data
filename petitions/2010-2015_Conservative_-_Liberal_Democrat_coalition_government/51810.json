        "additional_details": "The proposal of \u201cEducation For All\u201d, under the Dakar Framework of Action that was adopted by the members of 155 countries including Ethiopia, has not been followed through. In the Education Sector Development Programme III 2005/6-2010/11, 53.7 billion birr (approx \u00a31.8bn) was invested in educational services in Ethiopia.\r\n\r\nOf this, 0.01% was allocated for Special Educational Needs.\r\n\r\n0.01%...\r\n\r\nThis is not enough.\r\n\r\nThis is even though the Ministry of Education in Ethiopia recognises that 10 to 20% of the 15m school-age population may require it. It is also estimated that less than 1% of children with special needs in Ethiopia currently have access to primary education (Asrat 2010).\r\n\r\nIn short, by signing this petition you are calling for the relevant members of the UK Government to take action and assist the Ministry of Education in Ethiopia in implementing a strategy to educate this marginalised sector of society.\r\n",
