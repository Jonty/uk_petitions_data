        "additional_details": "To enforce the three R's by reducing pain,suffering, distress and lasting harm by a compulsory retirement scheme of laboratory dogs instead of unnecessary  euthanasia at the end of their commercial life and are retired to approved homes instead. Provisions for this to occur were made in the Animals Scientific Procedures Act 1986 with a clear policy for re homing however this has never been introduced and was on a voluntary basis therefore this should now be replaced with a mandatory obligation to retire the dogs once they have finished being of value to the researcher society. This should be enforced as part of the issuing of a licence for any project with the need for euthanasia rather than re homing being an exception not standard practice and with full explanations provided.
