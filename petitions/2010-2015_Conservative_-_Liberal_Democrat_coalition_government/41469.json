        "additional_details": "With more and more young drivers wanting to be on the roads at aged 17 it is absoloutely redicilious that car insurance is costing young people around \u00a310,000 just to insure there car, that is more then the actual car itself!   I am 16 and I am really keen on getting a car, I quit college to work full time, I do 12 hours a day most days and i've saved up quite a lot of money so far, but it feels like I will never get to my target of affording the insurance for the car. SORT THE PRICES OUT how can you possibly get a 17 year old to fork out THOUSANDS of pounds for a car insurance.. ",
