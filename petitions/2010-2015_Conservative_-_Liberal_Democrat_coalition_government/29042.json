        "additional_details": "I would like to see pensions to have an upper limit of \u00a335K at todays value, including the state pension. Thereby encouraging people to invest the residual money elsewhere in the country.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I would like to see the removal of upper limit of the tax relief, so having a single limit of tax relief; with a maximum that would achieve the \u00a335K. We could then increase the single tax relief, so that it would encourage the working population to take out a pension.\r\n\r\nThis would remove the large multi-million pound pensions, which are bankrolled by the Government through tax rebates.\r\n\r\nAs a result this would increase tax revenue.",
