        "additional_details": "We the below signed want to abolish child support payments to parents where there is a joint residency order in place and to remove the \"resident parent\" label so both parents have the ability to claim for benefits there child is entitled too.\r\n\r\nThe current scheme favours only one parent and can cause severe financial hardship for the \"non resident parent\" especially where no agreement can be reached.\r\n\r\nThis situation needs to be changed so separated/divorced parents that have a joint residency order and both play an active part in the child's life have equal rights under the law and puts an end to the \"non resident\" parent been discriminated against.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time for reading and signing the petition ",
