        "additional_details": "The Royal Navy is the smallest it has been for at least 200 years. Its ships are scattered all over the world doing tasks given to it by the government. 1 ship here,   1 ship there, is all the navy can manage at its current levels. At one time during the Libya campaign there was not 1 ship available to defend uk. This is absolutely rediculous!  There is no allowance for attrition in any forthcoming war, god forbid. Just think of how many ships were lost in the Falklands war. Rebuild our navy before its too late.  ",
