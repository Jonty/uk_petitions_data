        "additional_details": "The cost of complete glasses for those with higher prescriptions is too much.  People with higher prescriptions, and therefore people in more urgent need of wearing eye-correcting glasses, have to pay more (around \u00a3150 if their prescription is higher than +/- 5) than those with a lower prescription. The government needs to put pressure on suppliers/opticians for prices of higher prescription lenses to be reduced  and ensure that people with higher prescriptions are not discriminated against by ensuring opticians also include them in the 2 for 'n' offers in their shops",
