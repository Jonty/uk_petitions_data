        "additional_details": "We are a group of year 10 students from Rivington and Blckrod High School and as part of our citizenship coursework we want to see tougher for laws for Owners of dogs' who attack others. After the recent story of Jade Anderson and a few various other stories it came to our attention that the number of dog attacks were increasing in the UK and much action wasnt being taken. After soon realising that the owner of the dogs couldnt be prosecuted as the attack had took place on private land we decided that this was a growing concern in the UK.We belive that the DDA is not adequate and should be amended to protect the public and offer justice to victims and families. The DDA should lay more responsibility on the owner and include attacks on private land as well.",
