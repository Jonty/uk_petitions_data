        "additional_details": "Please sign this epetition if you would like to see Headlice tackled in Primary Schools.\r\n\r\nCurrently primary schools in the UK are not allowed to check childrens hair, treat a child or even speak to a parent if they have seen lice. The course of action they must follow is to send a letter to all parents informing them that there has been a reported case in the class and requesting that all childrens heads are checked. As we all know there are some parents who fail to check, fail to spot the signs or for various reasons fail to treat their child. This results in many parents being forced to spend needless money on lotions and treatments. Some children are never treated and in severe cases it can lead to anemia and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nMany parents would be pleased to become the Nit Nurse for their child's school and this should be considered as a viable alternative to avoid any costs.
