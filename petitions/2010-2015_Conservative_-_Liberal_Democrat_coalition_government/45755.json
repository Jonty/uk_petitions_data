Will he  initiate a process to  give  historic ships the same  legal protection as historic buildings. If historic ships must be licensed for sale abroad, ensure  the licence includes conditions that ensure continued appearance at UK festivals at intervals.\r\n\r\nSummer maritime festivals, which are free and attract  200,000 people a year in Bristol alone, are the most direct opportunity to improve awareness. The loss of sponsorship has seen the number of ships on show drop sharply. I ask Ministers to ensure the Lottery sets up a substantial \u201cappearance and interpretation   fund\u201d   which would support appearances at these harbour festivals, as in the splendid Jubilee parade. It would deepen public  understanding  through much improved presentations of the history of the ships.",
