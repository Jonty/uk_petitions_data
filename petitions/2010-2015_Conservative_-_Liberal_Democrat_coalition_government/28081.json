        "additional_details": "I want the Government to reduce the age limits on smear tests to be inline with the rest of the UK, who currently have the age limit of 20, and to make it easier for a woman of any age to request a test if she has symptoms linked to Cervical Cancer or linked to any risk of infertility. The Government is putting thousands of young women at risk, and is putting an age restriction on their health. There have been many cases where women have been to see their GP with symptoms and have been pushed away due to their age \u2013why? Research shows that women under 25 are more likely to have abnormal cells, so surely these women should receive regular check ups and tests to make sure it is not linked to Cervical Cancer or linked to any risk of infertility. The women who have already been failed by the Government are having their choices removed due to their age, they are loosing the choice to have a smear test, some are loosing the choice to have children and others are loosing their choice to live.",
