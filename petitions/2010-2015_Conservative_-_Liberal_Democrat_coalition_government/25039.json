Yes many of us now have cars, but it is not much fun being the driver, on day trips through our beautifull Nation when you cant stare at at the scenery because you have to be aware of road conditions and other road users. Or that it is raining when you get to the destination and everyone decides to go to the pub and you wisely drink soft drinks to protect your Driving Licence!\r\nWe respectfully ask Her Majesties Government our elected spokespersons, to set a Royal Commision to genuinely see which rail lines and stations can and should be reopened.
