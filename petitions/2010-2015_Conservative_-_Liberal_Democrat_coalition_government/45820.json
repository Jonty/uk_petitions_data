Skills such as: First Aid, Cooking, and Practical Life Skills. These are just some of the few skills we feel should be prioritised in all schools. We believe this as, these skills will help young people transition into the work place and life. These skills are essential for young people to become integrated into society.\r\nPlease show your support by signing this petition.\r\n",
