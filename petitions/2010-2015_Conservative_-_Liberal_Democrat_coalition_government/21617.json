        "additional_details": "As recommended in the 'Let Children Be Children' report by Reg Bailey, I would like to see a prompt introduction of age rating for music videos. Whilst I believe that musicians should be free to express themselves. The almost pornographic nature of some of these videos (whos main demographic audience are children) are damaging to children and young people. Please insist that the music industry take responsibility for the influence they have on such pliable little minds.",
