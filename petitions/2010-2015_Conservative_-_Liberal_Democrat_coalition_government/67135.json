        "additional_details": "Current election system is unfair, the smaller parties do not get equal chance. Labour and conservatives dominate the votes.  A lot of people can't see any point in voting.  The reason is, if they do not agree with main parties they don't think smaller parties stand a chance.  The current system means people have limited choices, only some of the population is being represented through elections.  If it was easier and cheaper to encourage, the average person to create parties, leading to more variety available.  In order to help smaller parties have a chance and to show people, lots of choice, not just the dominate parties. Increasing the percentage of votes and a larger percentage of UK citizens having their say. An alternative voting system such as Proportional Representation voting system such as Party List PR open list or a Single Transferable Vote in order to waste fewer votes, offer more choice. A more equal chance for smaller parties.",
