        "additional_details": "It has been announced today that millions of pounds is being spent by the government translating documents into more than 165 different languages to aid foreign nationals in claiming state support.\r\n\r\nThis is wrong. No other European country provides these services and for good reason. It is the responsibility of the claimant to provide their own assistance. In Spain, if you wish to settle, you must pay a lawyer to assist you if you do not speak the language.\r\n\r\nPut an end to the mass expense on assisting foreign nationals when we cannot even look after our own!",
