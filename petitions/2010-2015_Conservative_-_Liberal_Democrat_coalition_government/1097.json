        "additional_details": "Recently there have been talks of petitions asking that the Government consider bringing back the death penalty. This could possibly lead to innocent people being killed. It is also barbaric and the sort of practice that goes on for revenge and not justice. I believe this is a step backward in an enlightened society. It also has immense costs associated with it because legal proceedings such as appeals are costly and the humane methods and costs associated tend to cost more than just imprisonment and it does not allow for any reform of a person.
