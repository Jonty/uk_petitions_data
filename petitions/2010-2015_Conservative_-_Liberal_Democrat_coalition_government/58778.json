When this is done unlawfully it CANNOT be right that the murderer does not also face a state of permanence in their incarceration for the crime they committed.  They removed hope from their victim, they should not, therefore, enjoy ANY hope of any change in their future existence. This is not to say that in every convicted murderers cell there should not be a syringe full of poison so there is always the opportunity for the convicted murderer to join their victim(s) in the same state of permanence.",
