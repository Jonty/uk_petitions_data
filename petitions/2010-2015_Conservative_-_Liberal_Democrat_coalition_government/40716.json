Killing badgers is not a nice prospect and quite vicious.\r\n\r\nBut something has got to happen to stop the disease spreading and harming farms and farmers.\r\n\r\nDuring this temporary pause, we the petitioners, call for Defra to investigate alternatives to culling the badgers including a possible vaccination.\r\n\r\nHowever, if at the end of this pause there is no sensible alternative found to stop the disease spreading and not kill badgers, Defra must continue and re-start the cull.\r\n\r\nBadgers are delightful animals but if they are spreading such a disease something must be done, and if an alternative can be found it should be pursued. But if there is no alternative to a cull, the cull must take place. ",
