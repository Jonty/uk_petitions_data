This money will be allowed to pay off personal debt which must be paid off before allowing spending, towards mortgage repayments, house deposits, and to spend in UK registered companies. NOT Savings as this would defeat the objective.\r\nThis money would have to be spent in a set time (3 months) so the economy would benefit from a sharp shock and the VAT & Tax the government would get would offset some of the out lay\r\n",
