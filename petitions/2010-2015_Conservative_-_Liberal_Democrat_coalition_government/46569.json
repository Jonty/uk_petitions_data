        "additional_details": "The Channel 4 TV programs \"Bank of Dave\", and \"Bank of Dave2\", gave a simple role model, (FSA approved), for banking regulations to change to enable local communities across the UK to set up independent savings and loans organizations to increase competition with the big banks and support grassroots, start-ups, local community projects and charities.\r\n\r\nIn the TV programs, this process and concept was supported by some MPs of all major UK parties, but this topic needs wider support and debate, to revive the economy and put money to work, the way that banks used to do, before they got too big to fail, invest overseas and gamble on commodity for super profits and massive personal bonuses for individual bankers.",
