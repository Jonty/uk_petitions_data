I am happy to pay a reasonable sum for viewing a programme, say \u00a31 for a 1/2 hour episode or \u00a32 for a one hour episode or \u00a33 for a 2 hour drama. This is in line with a DVD rental or SKY Pay Per View.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to get the BBC, which is a licence funded Public Service Broadcaster, to make this available. It would also help bolster their coffers in this cash strapped time. I think ITV, CH4 and CH5 would follow suit if successful.",
