        "additional_details": "Dear HM The Queen and David Cameron,\r\n\r\nThe Malaysia GE has been stolen by the National Front because of these evidence:\r\n-\tThe EC decision of using the indelible ink is indeed washable within hours\r\n-\tForeigners are flown in to vote at 11th hour, given identity cards, escorted by police and in busloads to polling station\r\n-\tVote buying\r\n-\tUnknown ballot boxes arrived after blackouts\r\n\r\nElection result could be challenged in court via a petition within 21 days post election. The people have nowhere to go as all local petitions are corrupted. However, we can seek international pressure to revoke this election result. We demand:\r\n- appointment of a new independent EC\r\n- PM Najib resignation\r\n- a clean, fair & unbiased re-election\r\n\r\nWe urge Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Head of Commonwealth and David Cameron, PM of the UK to support our petition and call for change.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nEdison Chen and the rest of Malaysians\r\n",
