Due to this some of the general public don't have the time to find the nearest bin and result in littering. This has become a fairly big problem in my local community which covers Barking, Dagenham and Ilford with the litter becoming more and more noticeable. The solution to the problem is an increase of bins to reduce the litter. ",
