        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the introduction of special local authority planning committees, formed of council planners, charities, businesses & experts in architecture & construction. The special committees will be given authority to make decisions to enable development projects to be expanded beyond the original approved plan; profits from the expansion go to charity.\r\n\r\nThe incremental profits would come from, for eg, adding floors to residential buildings, with 100% of profits from the sale of the additional accommodation going to charity. The developer would have to demonstrate to the planning authority that the architectural merits are undoubted and all incremental profit goes to charity.\r\n\r\nSuch development expansions could generate \u00a3billions for community projects.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see planning guidelines re-aligned in specific cases to enable developers to generate funds to help the vulnerable, sign this petition.\r\nFurther information: www.thinairfoundation.com\r\n",
