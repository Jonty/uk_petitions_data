        "additional_details": "The Hague Convention needs to be redressed and amended when dealing with British children and their parents in deportation due to international custody battles.  Many children are being deported, with their mothers, back to situations of domestic violence and abuse.  The Hague Convention was originally brought into being for cases of Abduction - these laws need to be changed to accommodate international family disputes.   The Hague Convention needs to include Human Rights Legislation to ensure British children are given their basic human rights as every other person on this planet is given.  As it stands at the moment the Hague Convention overrules the Human Rights Act in international custody disputes. ",
