        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the development of a national qualification for university teaching staff who teach at either undergraduate or post-graduate level. The qualification could be similar to those offered in the FE/Life-long learning sector i.e. PTLLS, CTLLS and DTLLS.\r\n\r\nWith increasing global competition in the university sector, especially for overseas undergraduate students from Asia and Europe, this is an area where the UK can drive up standards, raise levels of student satisfaction, and attain a competitive advantage in the global market.\r\n\r\nJust because someone has a PhD or DPhil in a subject does not mean that they will be able to teach that subject to an individual or a group.",
