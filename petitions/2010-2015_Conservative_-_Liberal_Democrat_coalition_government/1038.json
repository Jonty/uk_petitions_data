It must also make a Clear and Strong commitment to control our borders. It must also have a clear immigration policy stated in a British Bill of rights. For far too long now the People of Britain have been let down by our politicians and our current immigration laws. This needs to change in order for the British people to have confidence in their own Goverment. ",
