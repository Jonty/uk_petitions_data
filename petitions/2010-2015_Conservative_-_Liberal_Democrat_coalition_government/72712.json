        "additional_details": "The recent announcement of Post Graduate funding is a milestone for anyone wanting to progress their careers, or pursue a research based career.\r\n\r\nHowever, the recent announcement also highlights the ageist nature of the funding as there are many people over the age of 30 that would like to engage in post graduate education, but cannot afford to do so.\r\n\r\nIf the government is using the length remaining of a career as its reasons for not funding over 30s, then this is not a good enough reason; they already fund people in their 50s and 60s for undergraduate qualifications.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition should you believe that this funding stream should be made available to anyone wanting to pursue a post graduate qualification.",
