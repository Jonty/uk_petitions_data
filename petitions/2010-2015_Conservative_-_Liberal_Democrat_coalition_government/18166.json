        "additional_details": "English Literature is being marginilised and cut from the curriculum by headteachers because it does not count in the school target measures. This petition is to get Gove to reconsider why a subject which celebrates our nations heritage and culture, encourages young people to become analytical thinkers, encourages young people to question the world around them, encourages young poeple to develop an ethical and moral standpoint, and a hundred other reasons is being marginalised. GCSE English Literature should be, at the very least, part of the Ebac and made compulsory for all students. How can we ever hope to improve literacy if we do not expose young people to literature? Our literary heritage is the envy of the world and Gove's narrow curriculum is denying  our young people their birthright.",
