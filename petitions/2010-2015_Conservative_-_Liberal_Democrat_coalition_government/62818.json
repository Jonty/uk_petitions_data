        "additional_details": "The Chancellor is \"proud\" to increase the Foreign Aid which is now 240% more than the Jobseekers Allowance budget. He has also said there is too little money to pay JSA and last year more than 500,000 Britons had their benefits stopped. When benefits are stopped people are referred to the Essential Living Fund which consists only of Food Parcels and vouchers for electricity (if the claimant is single). There is no cash.\r\n\r\n12 million Britons live in poverty, including 25% of children. If the Foreign Aid budget were diverted to UK Foodbanks, it would be equivalent to 1,000 pounds for every person in poverty. This is a vast sum for someone who could be living on just a few pounds a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impact on the Poor could be considerable returning them to work, reducing crime, and allowing people to start businesses.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor of London has questioned Foreign Aid and a hundreds of thousands of people are questioning these huge sums (a billion a month).\r\n\r\nJoin us.\r\n\r\n",
