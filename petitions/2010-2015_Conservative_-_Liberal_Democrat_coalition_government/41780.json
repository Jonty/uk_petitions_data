        "additional_details": "The EU recognised that the Hospitality sector is a labour intensive sector and as such should be taxed accordingly. This has been recognised by Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Germany and France (to name a few).\r\nIt has been credited in France with creation/saving of 320, 000 jobs.\r\nMost businesses with this sector would benefit little, if at all, from a reduction in corporation tax.\r\n\r\nI would urge the Government to reconsider the punative rate of 20% currently levied on this industry and follow our European neighbours to reduce the VAT rate to a rate closer to 5%.\r\n\r\nThis change would help protect small businesses and create jobs at this difficult time for the economy.",
