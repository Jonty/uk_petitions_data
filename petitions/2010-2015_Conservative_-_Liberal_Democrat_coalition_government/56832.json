Yet this entitlement is, on a daily basis, continually being taken away. The existing method, through Enviromental Health, for dealing with incessant dog barking is wholly inadequate in three respects. The first, being the absence of 'anonymity' for the 'complainant'. The second, being the absence of an on-the-spot fine for the dog owner. The third, being the mismanagement of time in dealing with the problem. A quicker, more efficient and confidential system is needed in order to improve the quality of life for people who find themselves subject to incessant dog barking. Therefore,\r\nWE THE UNDERSIGNED call upon the government of Northern Ireland to:\r\nprovide it's citizens with a more efficient method for dealing with incessant dog barking.",
