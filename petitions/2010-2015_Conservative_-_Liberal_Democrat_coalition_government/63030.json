        "additional_details": "Biodiversity offsetting is a process whereby developers can bulldoze ancient woodlands and other areas of outstanding natural beauty and attempt to appease the public by planting a few new trees elsewhere. This environmental vandalism will do irreparable damage to the most environmentally sensitive and beautiful natural areas of Britain and must be stopped. We the undersigned call on the government to repeal any and all biodiversity offsetting legislation.",
