        "additional_details": "My daughter was born with unilateral sensorineural deafness, this is profound deafness in her left ear leaving her with no hearing in her left ear. She has normal hearing in her right ear and because of this 'normal hearing ear' the health professionals decided for her, that she did not need a hearing aid or any support. At 2, her speech and language were very behind, but she was denied speech therapy and denied support! She was denied a hearing aid and although a cochlear implant would permanently solve her deafness, she can't have it! After making a complaint, At just under 3 years, Maisie was fitted with a BAHA. But the damage was done, the most crucial years for development of speech and language were in the past and Maisie was diagnosed with severe speech and language delay.\r\nShe does not talk to other children. She does not understand other children.She sits by herself and is withdrawn. All I'm asking is for this to be taken seriously and for there to be support available.",
