Many of them having to catch up with extra tuition and tutors. Surely it would save money in the long run to bring in another hearing test or move the school age hearing test at 5-6 years to a younger age?\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done, Our children deserve a bright future and any parent knows that a child needs to start life confident and not shy and worried because they cannot hear you, but do not know any different.\r\n\r\nPlease Help to close the gap!",
