        "additional_details": "More than one million immigrants will have the right to vote in the General Election - despite not being British citizens.Immigrants from Commonwealth countries - including Australia, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Nigeria - automatically acquire voting rights on arrival in the UK even if they are only staying for a short time.It is estimated that that by the time of the 2015 poll, more than one million Commonwealth citizens will be allowed to vote despite not having a British passport.\r\nEven a student on a six month visa has exactly the same voting rights as long-term residents, as long as they have an address, the research shows.\r\nApart from a few Caribbean states, British citizens do not have similar rights in Commonwealth countries.\r\nThis is a hangover from the days of Empire and should not have been allowed to continue, especially given the rapid increase in immigration from Commonwealth countries.\r\n",
