My cat was dragged off the neighbours fence by its leg and was severely shaken causing to it suffer extreme trauma, 3 broken ribs, punctured lung, nerve damage, She was in intensive care . Luckily she survived improving daily but nothing was done to the dog as cats are classed as \" VERMIN \" . A cat is no different to a dog they are both domestic pets but a breed of dog that has a proven track record of being vicious is exempt therefore i ask that they be included in the dangerous dog act asap and attacks on other domestic pets that they be prosecuted and be put down immediatley.
