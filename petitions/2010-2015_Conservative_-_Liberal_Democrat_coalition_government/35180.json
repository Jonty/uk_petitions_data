        "additional_details": "There are 10 million deaf and hard of hearing people in the UK who have NO access to online video content provided by broadcasters and digital providers is not subtitled. This includes all video content, video reports, live streaming of conferences and events, news reports, tv on demand, BBC big screens live events + The Space Arts website/channel. We call on the government to address this issue with agreed legal targets set, monitoring of quality and standard of subtitles, penalties for failure to do so and investment in technologies to make this happen. It must also be addressed as part of the Communications Review and consultation with deaf and hard of hearing people (not just charities). Failure to do so will lock out 10 million people + more from digital services online.",
