        "additional_details": "Alcohol is very addictive & drinking alcohol are habitual & lifestyles events. Alcohol, drugs & other addictive behaviours have been shown to biochemically stimulate the release of neurotransmitters Dopamine & Serotonin from the 'pleasure centre' (i.e. mesolimbic dopamine system) of the brain. As the high regression rates of alcoholics indicate, the only way for alcoholics to lower (or stop) their alcohol intake level is when they genuinely wanted to do so. If a recovering alcoholic has an actual aversion towards alcohol then it is certain that the person is not a RECOVERING alcoholic but a teetotaller. Perceptions of the pleasures of drinking alcohol would usually depend on one\u2019s will-power, perceptions, motivation, aims, habits, lifestyle, psychological & physical craving; as well as social triggers, reinforcers, settings.",
