Alim went alone to meet Danny and when he did, he was stabbed to death repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAlim's friends and family have been left devastated over the loss of the 6th former that had such a promising future ahead of him and want to see justice.\r\n\r\nDangerous Danny was sentenced to 13 years, in 13 years time he 29 and will be released and can continue to live a normal life. Whilst all that knew Alim will still live in a turbulent life of devastation due to this utter lack of Justice.\r\n\r\nOur wish is for Danny to have his sentence extended and the other unknown people whom were there to be found and also brought to justice.\r\n\r\nWe will not rest until we know this dangerous killer is going to be in prison for a very long time and only then we will feel as if there is some fairness in the justice system in the UK.\r\n",

It also only takes one person to make such a request."
