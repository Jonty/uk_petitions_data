However the current regulations that state they can be set off until 11pm unless it is Diwali and they can be set off until 1am is rediculous.\r\n\r\nThe education of our children is vital and them not being able to get a decent nights sleep on a school night as fireworks are being let of all hours of the night.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be punishments e.g. fines for people who break these regulations.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months when most of the fireworks take place it is plenty dark enough to start setting them off earlier.\r\n\r\nPlease help us make a stand against the noise polution of fireworks so late at night.",
