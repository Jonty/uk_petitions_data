Yasser Arafat came closest through the Oslo Accords, but when push came to shove and it was time for actions, not words, he rejected a peace deal. Three times in 100 years Israel has recognised the Palestinian right to self-determination; why no recognition the other way around?\r\n\r\nIt is time to move the peace process forward, and to place pressure on the Palestinians to recognise Israel's inalienable right to self-determination - a right recognised for all other peoples.
