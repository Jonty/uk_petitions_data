        "additional_details": "The recent news that the BBC wants Digital Rights Management (DRM) incorporated into HTML 5 which is an open standard for the delivery of web content. Attempting to force DRM onto an open standard flies in the face of openness and freedom.\r\n\r\nContent providers such as the BBC should seek to offer Pay Per View to anyone, including non-UK residents.\r\n\r\nContent delivery mechanisms that require protection from copying/duplication should be developed by the organisation(s) where the content originated from, and not expect everyone else to dance to their tune.\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done about the funding issues surrounding the BBC and I believe opening up content is better than dragging everyone into a draconian content-delivery mechanism that affects everybody - globally.",
