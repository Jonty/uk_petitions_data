        "additional_details": "Thanks to FCO efforts over many decades, British passport holders enjoy more international freedom of movement than many other people. However, for 2013 it\u2019s not good enough. Millions of Britons across the world are frustrated by deadlocks and complaisance regarding visa agreements. This stagnation keenly affects Britain\u2019s business and academic communities, obstructing our government\u2019s present aim of leveraging and facilitating British business overseas.\r\n\r\nThe UK government is still in a strong position to bargain hard for ease of movement for its citizens. This need not entail a trade-off in terms of easing immigration regulations, although the UK would benefit from more rational and innovative approaches to immigration.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for our FCO to make freedom of movement and settlement abroad its stated aim and energetic policy, with the ultimate goal (however utopian it now seems) being that UK citizens need not apply for a visa to travel or live anywhere in the world.",
