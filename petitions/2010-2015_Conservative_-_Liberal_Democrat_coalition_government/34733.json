        "additional_details": "Following the recent debate of whether or not to pump a further \u00a350 Billion into the economy through the bank's quantitative easing (QE) programme I believe the money should be spent boosting the sales of new homes for first time buyers.\r\nMany find themselves in a position around the UK were repayments for a mortgage can be afforded, however the initial lump sum deposit is proving to be a stumbing block.\r\nInstead of just throwing money into the economy to be spent in any way, a scheme should be created to encourage first time buyers to save, and the Government GIVES them money which MUST be spent on a property within the UK.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nHouse cost: \u00a3100,000\r\nDeposit Required: 10%\r\nFirst Time Buyer Saves: \u00a35000\r\nGovernment Adds: \u00a35000\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will dramatically increase the supply of housing, keep values at a good level and get a higher percentage of the population onto a mortage scheme.\r\n\r\nSurly this is a much wiser way of spending so much money!!!!",
