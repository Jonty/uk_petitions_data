He, therefore, is culpable and can legally be sued under civil law to refund whatever it cost the taxpayer to keep his failure on the road.  Government lawyers should be set on this task, immediately, before he has a chance to salt away any of his self enrichment at taxpayers expense, gains. Anything less than a FULL refund of the taxpayer contribution is NOT ACCEPTABLE.",
