This means officers and staff are going into work when they are sick making other people sick. This is a draconian way of dealing with sickness and should be stopped. One officer I know whilst trying to keep fit smashed his ankle and had three operations he feel foul of the attendance criteria which means he cannot attend courses, transfer or get apply for promotion. This officer is not a sick person and it is unjust to treat people in this way there are far better ways of dealing with sickness than punishment.",
