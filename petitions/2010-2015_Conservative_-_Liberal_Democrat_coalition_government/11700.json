        "additional_details": "Throughout history, criminals have been transported or sent to gulag work camps to pay their debt to society. Soft, \"big society\" rehabilitative justice does not work. Make convicts work for a living by making them contribute to society, paying by blood, sweat, tears and elbow grease.\r\nThe government should pick underdeveloped rural and deprived inner-city areas to be rejuvenated at no cost to the tax payer, without paying lip service and dividends to the private sector. Such an undertaking would foster a sense of David Cameron's big society, kick-start the local economy, and provide much-needed local services, thus reducing the local carbon footprint.",
