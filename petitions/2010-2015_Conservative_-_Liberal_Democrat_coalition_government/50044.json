        "additional_details": "Like most local authorities, Barking and Dagenham has been suffering a year-on-year decrease in the allocation we receive from central government for highway maintenance.\r\n\r\nDue to the poor state of many of our back roads we have been forced to spend an increasing amount of money filling in potholes after they happen.\r\n\r\nThrough our pothole campaign, Save our Streets, we are calling on the government to do two things to improve the state of Britain\u2019s roads.\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a five year highways maintenance grant.\r\nA lump sum payment every five years would allow local councils to spend their money more effectively \u2013 programmes of planned maintenance rather than reactive repairs.\r\n\r\n2. Increase resources available for local highway maintenance.\r\nBy spending more on local highway maintenance we can reduce the bill in the long run, by reducing the need for expensive and temporary patching of pot holes.\r\n",
