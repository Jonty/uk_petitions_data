        "additional_details": "There has been an application for planning permission and fund raising for an extension to the Old Kent road mosque in London. My reasons for not wanting this are simple.\r\n\r\n1. Many hate preachers use mosques as a gathering point to spread there messages of hate.\r\n\r\n2. It puts another nail in Britains coffin towards becoming an islamic state!! slowly eroding British culture, only to replace it with islamic culture.\r\n\r\n3. I don't agree with the condiments of the qur'an. The teaching of the oppression of women, and underlying unequality between islam and other religions that it attempts to spread.\r\n\r\n",
