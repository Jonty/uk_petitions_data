        "additional_details": "Canine Voice UK are calling for a review of current dog breeding legislation. Under current legislation, any person who keeps a breeding establishment for dogs at any premises and carries on at those premises a business of breeding dogs for sale must obtain a licence from the local council. Those people who are not in the business of breeding dogs for sale, so called \u201chobby breeders\u201d, and produce less than 5 litters in any period of 12 months do not need a licence.We would like to see licensing provisions extended to cover all dogs, prohibiting the breeding of any dog without a license. We believe this will help with: Stray and unwanted dog numbers and collection costs to Local Authorities, Reducing numbers of animal welfare and neglect offences, Increase the overall welfare of dogs used to breed from, Decrease the number of dogs that are being taken in by shelters and rescue agencies who are already over capacity.",
