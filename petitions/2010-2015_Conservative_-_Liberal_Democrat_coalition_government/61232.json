        "additional_details": "I have seen ex racing Thoroughbreds coming off a large overcrowded truck straight from the race track for re-training. They are the lucky ones.. But the one's that didn't make the grade went straight back on to the truck to go to the slaughter house. I have also seen horses out in the pasture for the first time being allowed to be real horses.\r\nHorse Racing needs a major reform.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to see change:\r\n\r\nA rise in the age of Thoroughbreds allowed to race. Minimum age of 4.\r\n\r\nThe breeding of racehorses having strict rules and regulations. Not being overbred or inbred.\r\n\r\nA mandatory trust fund set up by the breeder/owner of the horse securing a safe future for the horse when he/she is retired.\r\n\r\nA FULL ban of the whip.\r\n\r\nA complete ban on jumps racing as it is the most dangerous.",
