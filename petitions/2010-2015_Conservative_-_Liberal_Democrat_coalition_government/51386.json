Tax pensioners for heating allowance that has got to be better than taking it away from these voters. By using this method you will avoid the mess of working tax credits.Leave the Bus Pass and TV licence alone both have to be claimed and are not automatic.\r\nBy using this method all taxpayers with be paying regardless of their tax rate so work it out, looks a good idea from Bob Crow",
