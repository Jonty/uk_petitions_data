She is such an attractive and charismatic person that if she were to be on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing then she would increase the nation's happiness to such an extent that it should become a governmental matter. Please vote for this people, so we can get the hundred thousand names needed to force a vote in the Commons about this potentially fantastic state of affairs.\r\nThank you.\r\n(PS/ This is an independent campaign, I have never met and am not affiliated to Victoria Hollins in any way... more's the pity ;)\r\n",
