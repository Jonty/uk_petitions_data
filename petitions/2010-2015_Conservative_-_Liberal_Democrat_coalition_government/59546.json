Times have moved on and these benefits have still not been supported by science. These mythical superfluous remedies have no place on our shelves, as we have found medicines that are scientifically proven to work without the harm of endangered animals.\r\n\r\nMake a stand, remove the TCM's and prevent poaching.",
