        "additional_details": "I plea the UK government to take solid action and promoting the issue of the Chinese government breaking the Sino-British Joint Declaration to the United Nations. Chinese intervention on Hong Kong's Chief Executive election has violated the autonomy of Hong Kong which was agreed in the Joint Declaration. Recent refusal entry of Sir Richard Ottoway to Hong Kong by the Chinese government also prevents the UK government in fulfilling its responsibility as a counter-party of the Declaration. By promoting the issue to the United Nations, the world can put more pressure on China and prompting China to comply the Joint Declaration.",
