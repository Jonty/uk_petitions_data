Our income is only what my partner earns.\r\nFact: Everyone gets bad health in their lives.\r\nFact: Government are stealing what we put in to the system.\r\nFact: After a year on ESA, the ESA will go into means tested benefit.\r\nFact: If partner earns so much but so little due to having a family ESA can be stopped.\r\nFact: Arguements are made, no sleep, not eating much. You feel worse than ever before.\r\nPlease help me and everyone who is suffering with this and put a stop to this once and for all.\r\nThank you",
