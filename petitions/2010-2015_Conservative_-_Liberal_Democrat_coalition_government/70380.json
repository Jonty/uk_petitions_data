        "action": "Removal of tachograph regulations and drivers hours connected with 4x4s, pickups and small vans under 3500Kg",
        "additional_details": "The current legislation states we have to install tachographs into our domestic 4x4 family cars and pickups are causing issues with family use and small and hobby business.\r\nMost 4x4 small/hobby business people using there 4x4s at the weekend to tow a trailer of the correct weight within the limits of the tow vehicle now need a tachograph. But this means keeping records of everything you do the rest of the week weather driving another vehicle or your office job. Even other family members entitled to drive the family car not for purposes of the business are affected as the tacho records movement constantly. This is an invasion of privacy, cost prohibitive on a small business and difficult to replace a car when there is not a tacho kit available for the vehicle.\r\nSolution\r\nThe Gross Train Weight limit currently set at 3500Kg should be raised to 5500Kg which would alleviate the problem of a 4x4 towing a trailer and this nonsensical record keeping.\r\nSupport and create discussion\r\n",
