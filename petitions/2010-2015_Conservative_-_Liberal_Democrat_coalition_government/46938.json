        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, oppose the proposals for a residential development off the Pershore Road, Evesham near to the River Isbourne flood plain. We have grave concerns that:\r\n1. Existing homes, thoroughfares and parking areas will be under increased risk of flooding.\r\n2. The Pershore Road will be under increased risk of flooding and therefore, inconvenient road closure.\r\n3. The proposed access road to the development on a bend in the Pershore Road will endanger pedestrians and other road users.\r\n4. There will be an increase in traffic on what is already a very busy road.\r\n5. There will be further strain on the local infrastructure in general in an area which already has plans for, and is building, in three sites in the local area.\r\nFor these reasons, we the undersigned ask the Government and specifically Wychavon District Council's Planning Department to not grant the planning for this development.",
