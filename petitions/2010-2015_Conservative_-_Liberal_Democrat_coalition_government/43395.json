        "additional_details": "Stop the gradual closure of VOSA testing stations across the UK.\r\n\r\nVosa are transferring more examiners to approved testing facilities (atf's) and this means that the wait in Bristol for a HGV MOT test can be 8 weeks. This is being replicated nationwide. As the process progresses this waiting time for a MOT will increase making operators go to atf's for their MOT's.\r\n\r\nThis will push up the cost of goods in the shops due to higher distribution costs as atf's charge an addition fee for using their facilities. Also lorries generally travel further to get to the atf's increasing use of fossil fuels. Some atf's are not taking on new customers so truck operators have to travel to an atf that will accept your lorry for an MOT further increasing costs.\r\n\r\nFinally, safety is paramount on the roads and this process will only reduce the effectiveness of MOT tests as at the atf's facilities are not to the same standard as at VOSA stations.",
