Why should our children suffer or even DIE to cut costs to our own working people to help OUR youngsters. Why not cut the benefits to immigrants and scroungers, and cost to prisoners compensation for 'slopping out' etc. Where is our kids human rights, where are our rights after working and paying taxes to have foreigners benefit before our own kids.
