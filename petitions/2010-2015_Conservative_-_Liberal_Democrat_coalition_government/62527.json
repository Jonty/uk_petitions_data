It disgusts me to see how much people DON'T know about autism and how it affects people. I believe that people suffering with autism or any other learning disability/mental illness should be given the support that they really need,  especially in school. I think that the way to do this is to educate young people about the stresses, pressures and struggles that autism really brings about, not just for the sufferer but for the family or carers too. Maybe then, people with the condition wouldn't get bullied and discriminated against by others.",
