This would not only save the British taxpayer millions of pounds as in the case of the murderers of Lee Rigby when appeals against sentencing are made but also prevent the perpetrators from radicalising others within the prison system which is rife.\r\nI know it will be argued that if death sentences were carried out for terrorism it would be seen as martyrdom but at least there will be one less terrorist to carry out extreme acts against the human race.",
