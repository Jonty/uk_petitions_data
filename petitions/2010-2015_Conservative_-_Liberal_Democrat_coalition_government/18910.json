If enough people like this page and sign the petition, maybe we can get something done. Lice used to be a notifiable disease, which meant exclusion from school until cured.  Uncured lice affects general health - it's where 'feeling lousy' came from. Re-classify this pestilence so it is again notifiable and help stamp it out. Apparently  Human Rights legislation prevent s schools from excluding children with Lice, as it  'infringes their right to an education'. Well, what about the rights of the rest of us to enjoy a life free from pestilent infestations nad the right for our children to receive an education without being exposed to disease?",
