It keeps the licence fee money for the whole quarter in which that person dies. This amounts to at least \u00a31,000,000 per year being kept by the BBC. This is not right.\r\n\r\nThe government should instruct the BBC to give this money to the hospice movement who have to fund raise to keep services going for dying people. ",
