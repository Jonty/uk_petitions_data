        "additional_details": "A 65years old women gets 5years jail for breaking up a fight using her shoe.  She sees her son at 1am fighthing with the neighbour and runs out to stop the fight but when she fails to pull them apart she takes off her shoe to hit both not reliazing that her son is using a small knife. she excepts she used a shoe but was not aware of the knife. Jury charges her with GBH which means grievously bodily harm.?is this fair. The victim says she hit me with a metal poll but no other weapon was used which the doctor confirms.  Did the jury make the right decision? NO because they had too mich anger for the son and all victim lies were believed. She was a innocent person who tried to stop the fight but because she happens to be the mother she must pay. This was a way of teaching the attacker a harsh lesson but should that be allowed?  Please help me to raise awareness of the unjustified decision that was made by 11 random people because they didn't like the attacker. ",
