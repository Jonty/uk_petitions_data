        "additional_details": "It is my believe the Guns should be legalized in the UK. The UK citizens currently have no means of self-defence and are therefore essentially doomed in a hostile situation. I also find it enraging that a government chosen by we, the people, can tell us that we can't be trusted with guns after WE gave them power. Gun control is the first step to making the citizens slaves of the government as it means they have no means of defence or security. I say enough is enough. Legalize guns in the UK so that the people who voted you into government have protection.",
