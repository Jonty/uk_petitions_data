        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition the Department for Work and Pensions to implement new rules for entitlement to Income Support and Housing Benefit for full time further education students - with paramount importance placed on the following:\r\n\r\nAt present, a full time, further education student over the age of 18 cannot usually receive Income Support or Housing Benefit, even if they also work part-time.\r\n\r\nYet, if the same student were to leave education and continue working the same number of part-time hours only, they would become eligible for Housing Benefit and Income Support.\r\n\r\nWe believe that these rules give full time further education students who also work, and who are in financial hardship, incentive to leave education in order to become more financially stable.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also agree that those citizens simultaneously in study and part-time work deserve these financial cushions more so than those solely in part time work.",
