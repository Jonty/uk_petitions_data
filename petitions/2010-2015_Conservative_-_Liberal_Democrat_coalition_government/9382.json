Young kids needs guidance and inspiration  through work apprenticeship programmes by source  of technology.\r\n\r\nEducation is the engine of any successful nation. We should take a note from countries like India and China where we have millions people graduating each year by paying for their studies and haven't got the perks\r\nlike England. We need a proper education system where people who cannot afford University should get a chance from government to learn short skilled work in the society. Rather then we hiring the services from other countries we can train our young youth on those services. ex - IT field.\r\n\r\nYoung people needs to be disciplined through parents from the growing stage. Young people need proper structure in life where they can learn and develop.\r\n\r\nTo make a structured youth a structured approach by parents and government needs to be taken.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n",
