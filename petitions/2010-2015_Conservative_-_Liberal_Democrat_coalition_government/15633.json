        "additional_details": "Following the collapse of the banking sector in the Uk in 2008/2009, where the state used billions of tax payers money to bail out the banks, and where little has changed for the people who caused it, the Government should make assurances that this will never happen again. The tax payer will be paying for this action for many years to come yet the banks still pay huge saleries and bonuses to those responsible. If the Banks collapse then another system will form to fill the gap that will probably be better, fairer and safer for those that invest in them, and not for those that run them.",
