        "additional_details": "As most of you may be aware, our current national anthem 'God Save the Queen' is rather unpatriotic. We need a national anthem that promotes British identity. This is in no way opposing the royal family, however traditional songs such as 'Rule Britannia' or even 'Land of Hope and Glory' will give us a far more patriotic identity. My proposal is to change our national anthem to 'Rule Britannia'. Other options also to be considered if desired. ",
