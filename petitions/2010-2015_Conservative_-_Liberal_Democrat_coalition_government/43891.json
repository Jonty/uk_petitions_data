        "additional_details": "The recent train fare rise was completely unfair and unacceptable for an already struggling nation crippled with debt and ever rising living costs, yet no rise in wages. Many people will have to start looking for jobs outside of the city of London if this continues.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to propose a U-turn on the recent fare rises. The average season ticket is now 8% of many peoples yearly salaries. Almost a tenth of their annnual earnings just travelling to earn a living.\r\n\r\nThis has to stop. It is pure greed and is unfair to the hard working citizens of this country.",
