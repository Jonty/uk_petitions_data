In the main it insists on retaining a feudal-like policy of leasehold with its agricultural land, which traps it in a subsistance economy. In return for the considerable aid it receives, the Government should insist on land reform changes that have been successfully used by every modern developing country \u2013 the private ownership of land, othersie known as freehold.\r\n\r\nThis would help replace the traditional measure of prosperity - livestock, wives, and children - for a more tradable form of personal wealth that could be used as surety for borrowing and allow individuals to create investment economies that would put them on a more direct path to self sufficiency.\r\n",
