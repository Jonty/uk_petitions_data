        "additional_details": "The proposal for a North East super council comprising of County Durham, Northumberland and, Tyne and Wear, will leave rural areas such as Teesdale in County Durham marginalised as there will be a greater focus on the urban areas of Newcastle, Durham, Gateshead and Sunderland, with areas such as Teesdale essentially forgotten about. As such, this proposal should be consigned to history.",
