        "additional_details": "Since Cadbury's was taken over by American multinational KRAFT, an essential part of British heritage, culture and the economy has been under threat. Now KRAFT intends to close all UK factories of Cadbury's, despite promising to keep them open. Not only will thousands of jobs be lost, but a part of our heritage will die as well. The government should review the decision to let KRAFT own Cadbury's and if it finds the ownership to be detrimental to the brand and economy, as well as culture of the UK, KRAFT should be forced to sell its stake in the company.
