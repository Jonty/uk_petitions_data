        "additional_details": "The housing market should not be a volatile investment At the moment because of the boom and bust situation that is ever present in the housing market, there is a constant state of uncertainty and this is reflected throughout, from the financial providers, the buyer, the seller, the estate agent, solicitors, removal companies, home furnishing, DIY Stores and every other interested party that could possible benefit from a stable housing market.\r\nAbolish the 3 times salary method, it\u2019s to blunt. Fix house prices, only allow prices to move in line with inflation, no more interest only payments. Providing six months payments + 1 month in advance can be made and if more than one buyer is interested then the largest deposit is the deciding factor. If a person gets 3 months behind with their payments they would have to sell and re-enter the market at a lower level but without any loss to their original investment.\r\n",
