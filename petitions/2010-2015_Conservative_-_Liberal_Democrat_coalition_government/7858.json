        "additional_details": "The recent riots/ looting in London/UK shows a proportion of society\u2019s youth is totally out of control, undisciplined & criminally immoral. This disintegration of our society has been happening for years; however this level of criminality is extreme & MUST be the last straw. This proposal is to re-introduce National Service for those aged between 16-21 that are NOT in full time education OR employment. National Service WILL benefit our youth - instilling discipline & manners, giving a sense of purpose, patriotism & pride, the opportunity to learn a trade/skill & avoid gangs, drugs & criminality. In turn National Service WILL provide the country with these benefits - the removal of \u2018feral\u2019 youths from our streets, reduction of gangs, drugs & criminality & an opportunity for armed services to select best recruits. NOTE: \u2018National Service\u2019 does not have to be identical to the service of old; rather it should be tailored to specifically address the problems at hand in our society today.",
