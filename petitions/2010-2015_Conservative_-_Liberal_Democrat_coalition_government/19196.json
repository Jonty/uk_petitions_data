Rising wholesale prices have been cited by suppliers for the recent spate of tariff hikes.\r\n\r\nHow can energy companies justify price rises when making 3 million per day profit?\r\n\r\nRe-nationalisation of all or part of this cartel is the only way this problem will ever change. WE will be ripped off forever until we make a stand!\r\n\r\n\r\n",
