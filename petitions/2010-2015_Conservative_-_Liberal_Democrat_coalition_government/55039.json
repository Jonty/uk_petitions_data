I understand some families may have taken advantage of this but most simply cannot afford to take their children on a family holiday due to the astronomical prices charged by travel companies during non term time.\r\n\r\nWe want the governement to either revert government legislation to allow school children and opportunity to go on a family holiday during term time or force travel companies to reduce prices out of term time.",
