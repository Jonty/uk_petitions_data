        "additional_details": " I propose that there should be a change in the law, whereby if one parent abandons a child, leaving the other parent solely responsible for the care of that child, and expresses no interest in contact with the child, and has never contributed financially or materially to the upbringing of that child, then after a period of SIX MONTHS, the parent who abandoned the child relinquishes ALL PARENTAL RIGHTS, and any contact they may wish to have with the child at a later stage is SOLELY AT THE DISCRETION of the parent with care.\r\nParents have rights- but they also have RESPONSIBILITIES. Too many people in this society believe that they can abandon their children and swan back into their lives when it suits them, often causing  much upset to the child and its family.\r\nTHIS DOUBLE STANDARD CANNOT CONTINUE.",
