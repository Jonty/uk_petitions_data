        "additional_details": "Our current UK government is made up of millionaires who do not need their MP/MEP salary or pensions to survive. As this government has slashed hundreds of thousands of jobs and asked people to volunteer to fill these posts instead of being paid I think it's time this government was made to lead by example.\r\n\r\nI propose the current UK government act to ensure all MP and MEP jobs become unpaid and with no pensions with immediate effect.",
