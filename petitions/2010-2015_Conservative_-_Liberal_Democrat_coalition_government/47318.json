I love wales and have always supported Wales in rugby I had to take the highs and lows of them winning and loosing yes my birth certificate says English but my heart is welsh I don't feel English I love wales and all ways . what im wanting is to allow welsh families who have been drawn appart by the same issues is to allow the birth to be put down as welsh because of the same problems i had to do thru . i would also like my place of birth change to wales ",
