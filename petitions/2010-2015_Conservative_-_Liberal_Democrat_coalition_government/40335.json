Fines will apply.\r\n-Same applies for dog fouling in public places..\r\n-All dogs bred must be sold under contract which states responsibility of all dogs bred by a person remain their responsibility if the new owner can no longer look after the animal in question and it is the breeders obligation to re-home the animal.\r\n-Every dog registered at any vets will have to be licensed, any vet practice caught treating unlicensed dogs or not keeping licenses up to date will be fined.\r\n-I believe as an amendment at a later date all dogs should be insured as a mandatory clause of owning a licensed dog.",
