That inspiration has created some of the best scientists such as Aristotle, Archimedes, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton, Johannes Kepler, Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkings and many others. Seeing the sky in its ultimate form is one of the most breath taking sites and should not be deprived from others seeing this sight. I want the government to prevent the disappearance of the Milky way galaxy from the British countryside and to preserve it.  ",
