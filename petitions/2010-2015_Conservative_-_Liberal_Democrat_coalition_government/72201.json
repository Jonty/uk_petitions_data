        "additional_details": "In order to combat homelessness in Bicester, a homeless shelter should be created. It would aid those sleeping rough, those sleeping in cars and those 'sofa-surfing' by providing accommodation, donated food and clothes, and support to get a stable job using the shelter as a temporary residence. This would also aid in claiming benefits that they are entitled to in order to ultimately to find a home of their own. However, the local government does not acknowledge the problem of homelessness in Bicester so thus far seemingly little support has been given. There is currently no shelter in Bicester and the closest is Oxford which is also oversubscribed.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to create a shelter in Bicester to provide the homeless with the necessary support to become self-sufficient and get off of the streets.\r\nThank you.\r\n",
