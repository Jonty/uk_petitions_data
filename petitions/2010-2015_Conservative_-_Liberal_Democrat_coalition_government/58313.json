        "additional_details": "The use of flashing lights is becoming ever more rampant. From strobing TV shows and adverts to flashing Christmas tree lights or shop lighting, it has become increasingly accepted. Epileptics and migraine sufferers are being ever more marginalised. Those whose auras, fits and headaches are caused by flashing lights are forced to switch off the TV, leave the premises or miss out on that social event.\r\n\r\nDiscrimination is ruthlessly stamped out everywhere we come across it in society, as it should be. Yet this area is not even recognised as discriminatory against epileptics. A TV show host recently actually boasted about having strobe lighting as though it was something worthy of kudos.\r\n\r\nMinisters need to legislate to ban the use of unnecessary strobes and flashing lighting on TV (not including camera flashes) and to reevaluate the sale of strobe and flashing light products in shops.
