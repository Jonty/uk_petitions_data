        "additional_details": "With the 2011 quarter 4 GDP results released today (25/01/2012) indicating a contraction of .2% I believe it is now time for a change in economic direction by the government. The short sharp shock approach to the country's problems is causing the population needless worry and suffering.  With the Euro zone in crisis the country cannot at the moment rely on exports to correct its problems.  Hence, there needs to be a boost to domestic demand and a softening to the public sector cuts.\r\n\r\nWith the government not willing to change direction I petition that there be a vote of no confidence in the conservative led coalition government.",
