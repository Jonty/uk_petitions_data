        "additional_details": "I live in Birmingham and Birmingham City Council claims that Gyms are free, they are but only for a limited time. People like me can't benefit from these \"free\" gyms because they have specific times in which they are free. I am a tax payer and feel that I should be able to benefit from this program, but the specific times at my local leisure centre are from 10:00am up until 4:00am, therefore impossible for hard working folk like me to benefit from this. People that aren't working and on benefits can only benefit from this program.",
