Alcoholics and drug addicts will get priority treatment over those that are not. In certain areas of the country if you are a homeless couple hostels will not take you. The points system is rigged against you if you have no dependant children or mental problems. Once on the streets the system will abandon you. The whole housing policy is flawed and does not help tax paying law abiding British citizens.  ",
