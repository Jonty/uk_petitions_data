        "additional_details": "After witnessing the riot in Tottenham and the subsequent pillaging of stores in this town, and others throughout the United Kingdom I felt compelled to start this e-petition.\r\n\r\nOver the past four days both London and many other cities within the United Kingdom have fallen into disarray and anarchy whilst the police, who were severely under staffed, tried their best to contain and  control the situation.\r\n\r\nOur Prime Minister remained on holiday for the first 72 hours of these events happening and did nothing. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Clegg, was in the UK, but did not comment nor act upon the situation whilst our country fell into mob rule, anarchy and disarray.\r\n\r\nI therefore I ask you to sign this petition to force a commons debate on a public vote of no confidence in our countries current leadership of David Cameron and Nick Clegg.",
