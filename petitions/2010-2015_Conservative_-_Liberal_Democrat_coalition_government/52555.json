        "additional_details": "Under current legislation, cats are granted the 'right to roam'. This means that they are allowed to enter any private property they choose, defecate - sometimes digging holes in carefully-tended flower and vegetable plots, and attack and kill wild birds and small mammals at random. Puppies and very small dogs are also at risk of injury.\r\nI believe that the same duty of care should apply to cat owners as that which is applied to those of dogs, i.e. that they must be kept under control at all times and their movements be restricted to owners' properties. I believe that this law is successfully practised in at least one Scandinavian country.\r\n\r\n",
