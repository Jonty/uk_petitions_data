        "additional_details": "I would like to stop the sale and development of the grass lawn on Roseneath Rd, Urmston, M41.\r\n\r\nThe lawn is an attractive and welcome break in the rows of homes in Urmston and is used extensively by local residents.\r\n\r\nRoseneath Rd is used as a through road in Urmston, it is covered in potholes and is already extremely difficult for residents to park outside their homes, as well as navigating on-coming traffic, weaving between parked cars on the road.\r\n\r\nThe loss of grass land for local residents, increased building works traffic and an increase in the number of residents reliant on parking on the road will have an extremely unwelcome detrimental effect on the local community.",
