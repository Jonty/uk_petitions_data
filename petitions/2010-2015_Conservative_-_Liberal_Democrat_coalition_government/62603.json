        "additional_details": "RCVS has approved the alarming practise that veterinary Intensive Care Units can be totally unattended for recurring periods of 15 minutes, and, rejected irrefutable facts in complaints of a pet's death in a Small Animal Teaching Hospital's ICU.\r\n\r\nICU's are concentrated with special equipment/specially trained staff caring for seriously ill patients requiring immediate and continuous attention, Miller-Keane Encyclopaedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health 7th edn 2003 Saunders. This rule of continuous attention applies equally to an ICU in a veterinary hospital as confirmed on the website of the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.\r\n\r\nWe ask Government to either split the RCVS Preliminary Investigation and Disciplinary Committees from RCVS; create an independent veterinary Ombudsman; or veterinary hospitals are included in Government's series of measures resulting from public enquiry into Stafford Hospital scandal\r\n",
