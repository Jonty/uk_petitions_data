        "additional_details": "This petition proposes the re-nationalisation of the UK electricity, gas and water industries.\r\n\r\nThe contention is that the UK utility industry has become mess of complex interactions and regulation between suppliers, generators, metering companies and so forth. This complexity is expensive to maintain and is in place to shoe-horn the utility industry into being a privatised business in which it does not naturally fit.\r\n\r\nPrivatisation has created this hideously complex infrastructure and also the buying and selling of utility companies to make a \u2018fast buck\u2019. This has resulted in inflated prices for both consumers and industry and a slow response adopt new technologies such as smart meters and greener energy sources.\r\n",
