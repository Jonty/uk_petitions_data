        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask for cuts in MPs wages.\r\nFollowing Mr Ian Duncan Smiths outrageous claims on being able to live off \u00a353 a week: We believe in correlation to that, earning over a grand a week of tax payers money is paying them too much. We ask you to pay them the national average wage in regards to performance. In that sense if the country is doing better their wages increase and if it is doing poor their wages decrease. They get paid on performance not on personal greed, which is similar to banker\u2019s bonuses.\r\n",
