They are expected to go to college or get jobs, and have trouble doing both.\r\n\r\nWe have schools for people with learning difficulties, but after this they are expected to mingle with people of normal abilities which is incredibly hard for them.  They should have colleges especially for these people to continue there life to the best of their ability.  ",
