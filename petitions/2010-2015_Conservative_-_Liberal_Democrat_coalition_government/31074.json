As they currently exist forms are vastly over complex and use language that feels like it's out to trick you. As if the over-complexity of the form itself wasn't enough now people have to deal with Government Gateway IDs and Activation codes to be used within 28 days of receipt which is ironic for British citizens living abroad since the codes seem to arrive outside of those 28 days.  Why not just make it simple?  Why not benchmark other countries with vastly simpler tax return forms. Even Belgium does it better.",
