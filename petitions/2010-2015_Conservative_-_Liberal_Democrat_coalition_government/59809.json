        "additional_details": "Companies that aren't banks are able to place a default against a person's credit file, without having to notify the individual beforehand.\r\n\r\nThis leads to a situation where people are unaware of what has happened to their credit rating. Until, of course, such a point arises as they wish to apply for a mortgage and are rejected as a result.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call upon the government to introduce regulation to correct this circumstance.\r\n\r\nAny company that has the ability to place a long lasting, negative mark on one's credit profile should have to follow a strict framework, that includes notifying the individual via post and via email, where the company has an email address recorded.\r\n\r\nThere should be a standard boilerplate for the notification that includes clear and concise information explaining the following:\r\n\r\n - What has happened.\r\n - What to do if this is in dispute.\r\n - What a default actually means.\r\n - How to pay.\r\n - Who owns the debt.",
