        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request that Government make the following a pre-requisite to approval of all Nuclear new builds in this Country.\r\n\r\n\u201cAny application to build a nuclear power station must include two\r\nroutes for access and egress to and from the proposed site.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is in the interests of safety. We are concerned by the present proposals by EDF to build at Hinkley, Somerset, where there is only one route. This is a single carriageway over busy A and C roads through a town and villages. EDF fail to acknowledge the potential problems for emergency vehicles. These would arise in the event of road\r\naccidents (anticipated due to increased volumes) or a worse case scenario, a nuclear disaster on site such as seen recently at Fukushima, Japan.\r\nThis scenario could be repeated all over the UK with the proposed new nuclear builds.",
