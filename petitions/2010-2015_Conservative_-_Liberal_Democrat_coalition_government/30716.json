Privatisation of these services will lead to a poorer service to the tax paying public, an increase in crime, a drop in effective conviction rates and a far higher likelihood of abuse of power and miscarriage of justice.\r\n\r\nI want the Home Office to stop this move to privatise policing in the UK at all levels and use the funding set aside for this to adequately and properly maintain our public services.",
