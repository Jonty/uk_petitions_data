        "additional_details": "There is a constant cry lately for more money to help charitable causes.  With all sectors being forced to tighten their budgets and reduce costs it seems the only sector that is immune from this is in the wages of Premier League Footballers.  I propose that with these astranomical wages they should easily be able to afford 1 weeks fee from every month and put this to causes which are far needier than their over inflated bank balances.  Please sign this petition to see if we really can make a difference.",
