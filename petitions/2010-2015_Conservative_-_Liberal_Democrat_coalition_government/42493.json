It uses a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket engine to reach orbit in a single stage.\r\n\r\nThe European Space Agency (ESA) has evaluated the SABRE engine's pre-cooler heat exchanger on behalf of the UK Space Agency, and has given official validation to the test results.\r\n\r\nThe next phase is \u00a3250 Million pound build of fully functional SABRE engine.\r\n\r\nThis technology could revolutionise aerospace as we know it, reduce times, reduce emissions and reduce costs of putting payloads into space compared to the current \u201cold way\u201d rocket technology. It could also inspire the next generation of scientists and restore national pride post Concorde, but most importantly it has massive job creation potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
