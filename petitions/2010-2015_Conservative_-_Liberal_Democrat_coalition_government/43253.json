        "additional_details": "For the government to amend visa requirements for Chinese citizens which are currenly making it difficult for Chinese tourists to come to  Britain.\r\nThe current system makes it much easier for citizens of countries that are seen as non or minimal profit baring for the British economy to receive visas over Chinese citizens. An easier visa policy would see increased tourism in Britain leading to increased spending and exposure for British goods abroad. Currently countries such as Spain and France are reaping the benefits of having increased Chinese tourism at Britain's expense.",
