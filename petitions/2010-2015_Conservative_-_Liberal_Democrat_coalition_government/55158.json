Even though we are at college full time, we are expected to pay council tax, this draconian threat is putting many off the choice of going back to education and trying to purse there dreams and better themselves, all due to a small technicality that should not be an issue. Please spread the word and let's get the ball rolling, not only does this affect myself and class mates personally, it affects anyone who might not have a strong academic base who needs to start from scratch.
