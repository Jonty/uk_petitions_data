        "additional_details": "the L.G.P.S is a funded scheme and as such all payments made by members are invested in shares (in british industry). The increased payments being forced on its members will not go to the fund, but is simply a TAX on hardworking underpaid people trying to make a living. The increases will force vast amounts of members to leave the fund which will leave the burden of future pensions on our grandchildren. Please wake up mr Cameron. Under inflation pay rises since 2003 already have ordinary people on the poverty line. Dont take there pensions away to.",
