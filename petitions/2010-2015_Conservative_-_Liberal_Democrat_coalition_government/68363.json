        "additional_details": "St. Luke's Church, Bristol Street, B5 7AY was built in 1842 and has been used since then as a church. The current Christian worshippers in the building, The Redeemed Christian Church of God, Covenant Restoration Assembly (RCCG - CRA), has been using the building as a church since 2001.\r\nContrary to the initial agreement that RCCG - CRA had with the representative of Home and Community Agency (HCA), Birmingham City Council and HCA are planning to sell this listed building to another party, evict RCCG - CRA from the building, change the primary use of this listed building (after almost 200 years) from being a church and destroy one of the lasting heritage of the City.\r\nWe strongly believe this building should continue to be used for the purpose for which, it was built almost 200 years ago. We believe the current Christian worshippers should be allowed to continue to worship in the building as a church.",
