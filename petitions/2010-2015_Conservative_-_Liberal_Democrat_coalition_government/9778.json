        "additional_details": "Cutting benefits for convicted looters, who will already have a criminal record in an extremely difficult job market, will only serve to increase levels of crime. If you take away any means of self support, there will be no other option for them but to steal, sell drugs and commit violent crime. Of course something must be done, but this kind of blind punishment completely fails to recognise its own consequences. People are angry, understandably, and I don't expect this petition to gain many votes, but it needs to be said.",
