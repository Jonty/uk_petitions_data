        "additional_details": "The UK has one of the highest teenage birth rates in Western Europe,Around 21 girls under 16 (the legal age of sexual consent) become pregnant every day in Britain.I believe making the contraceptive implant more available to young girls will help to curb unwanted pregnancies.Apart from potentially ruining the young girls life, young and underage pregnancy is a financial drain on the country not only from the immediate cost to the NHS and costs in the form of benefits, but also the long term costs of the issues we will get from children being raised by children.The implants can protect the girls from unwanted pregnancies for up to 5 years.Therefore i believe the Government need to educate children about contraceptive implants and make them more available at a young age.",
