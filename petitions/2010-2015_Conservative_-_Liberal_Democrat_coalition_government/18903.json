        "additional_details": "Paternity Leave and Pay entitlement is currently specific to fathers who have worked for one employer continuously for 26 weeks up to the 15th week before the expected date of birth of their child.  I believe that fathers who have had continuous employment with one or more employers should be entitled to the same Paternity Leave and Pay conditions as those currently entitled.  The government should amend the current entitlement criteria to include fathers who have continuously paid tax and national insurance contributions for 26 weeks up to the 15th week before the expected date of birth of the child with no condition of needing to be employed by the same employer for this time.",
