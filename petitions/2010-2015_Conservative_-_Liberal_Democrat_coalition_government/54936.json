        "additional_details": "We the undersigned want the UK GOVERNMENT to abide with INTERNATIONAL LAW, 17 judges voted that the UK was in breach of HUMAN RIGHTS over the removal of DNA when NO charges were brought, yes it is swept under the carpet by the HOME OFFICE who seem above the law although they make the LAWS and hold the public to abide by them, this is VERY bias and makes the UK look stupid as they signed up to their findings.\r\n\r\nLets have some common sense on court rulings and the public`s HUMAN RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nWe need this to be implemented per the LEGAL SYSTEM by the HOME OFFICE.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you agree on this matter.",
