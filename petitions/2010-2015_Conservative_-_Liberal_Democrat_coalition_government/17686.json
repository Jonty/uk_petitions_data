We, the people, should demand a legal remedy to be made available for Ministers and Civil Servants who can waste money and lives.  With such legal remedies, to be debated, it would concentrate the government members to ensure value for money and lead to less rash decisions being made, that go catastrophically wrong, with absolutely no come back on those implementing them.\r\nPerhaps then massive waste of tax payers money would be saved and at last a transparent true democratic government and country will ensue.",
