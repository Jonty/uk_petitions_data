Thus creating a UK register for dogs.\r\nThis would assist the police, council workers and dog wardens in their roles of enforcing dog by-laws.\r\nDog owners would be more accountable, encouraging better practise with regards to controlling their dogs in public places. This would also assist in keeping our streets cleaner, dog owners would be feel more responsible for clearing up their dog's mess.\r\nCurrent dog by-laws are rarely put into practise, as it is too easy for irresponsible dog owners to provide false details. If dogs are chipped it would be easier for the law enforcers to uphold the law.\r\nDog chipping is not cruel or intrusive to the animal, I believe all responsible dog owners would agree. Let's make our environment safer and cleaner.",
