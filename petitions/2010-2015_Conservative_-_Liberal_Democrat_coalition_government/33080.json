        "additional_details": "The Government is proposing changes to the compulsory winding-up process which would seriously prejudice trade creditors at a time when British Business needs all the help it can get.  In particular:\r\n\r\n1)  The removal of the Judiciary (which is independent of the Government) from the process would result in a loss of impartiality especially where HMRC petitions are concerned.\r\n2)  The introduction of pre-action protocols for winding-up petitions might potentially enable unscrupulous directors to 'asset strip' a company.\r\n3)  The removal of the requirement to advertise a winding-up petition would be detrimental to other trade creditors, who would be denied their right to support or oppose a petition.\r\n\r\nIf you are opposed to a civil servant presiding over the winding-up process in secret, after a protracted pre-action protocol period, then please sign this e-petition.",
