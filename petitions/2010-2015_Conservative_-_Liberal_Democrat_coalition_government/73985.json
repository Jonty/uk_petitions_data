The excuse of London Bridge causing the issues is no longer acceptable as we all know that it's a rolling stock issue and a lack of overall investment in this line.  London Bridge upgrades will not increase capacity, rolling stock, or investment in the Uckfield Line.  It's time this line is future proofed.",
