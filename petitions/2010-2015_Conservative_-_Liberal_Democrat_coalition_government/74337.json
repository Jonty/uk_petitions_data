His replacement is a huge mistake and is rightfully causing outrage across the nation.\r\n\r\nI would ask the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to place as much pressure as possible on the Museum to keep Dippy in his rightful place and to remove all it's financial backing of the Natural History Museum if this move goes ahead.",
