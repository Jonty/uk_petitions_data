These are acts of terror, with the aim to deter Western allies from intervening in the Middle East.\r\n\r\nOur Prime Minister, David Cameron, has already said that these terrorists shall be 'hunted down' and 'brought to justice'. Because of the barbarity of these killings by IS terrorists, many of us in Britain feel that justice can only be served through these Islamists (not least of all the killer, known as Jihadi John) suffering the ultimate form of justice - the death penalty!\r\n\r\nWe call on the British government to reintroduce capital punishment for all terrorist offences so that, once these Islamist terrorists are brought to justice, they can suffer the full force of the law by being hanged or shot for their barbaric crimes!",
