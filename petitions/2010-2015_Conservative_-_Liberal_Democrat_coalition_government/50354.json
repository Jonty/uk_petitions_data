This will leave the residents of the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham \u2013 a large area of London \u2013 and residents of a wider area of West London, who cannot afford lawyers, without any hope of legal representation now that legal aid is to a large extent nonexistent due to legal aid changes. Please help us keep this invaluable and long-established legal aid centre open. It is doing work that no one else does. Please help NOW if it is to stay open.",
