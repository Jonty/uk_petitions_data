In the meantime gas and electricity prices are increasing to an all time high.  We are going to see increased deaths of our old folk from cold because they will be scared to use their heating.  I found out about these cut through a BBC article on the internet, but these facts were buried well within the article, so I am sure not many people are aware of it.  Stop these Cuts",
