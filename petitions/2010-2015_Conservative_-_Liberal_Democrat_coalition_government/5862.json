        "additional_details": "Simplify the tax system by introducing a flat rate tax for personal income and for corporate tax - with a higher tax free amount than we have at present for personal tax and introduce a low rate of corporate tax - with NO loopholes. I believe that a debate on this would highlight the fact that even at 10% corporate tax - we would find that a lot of corporations are not in fact paying as much as this now! The tax system is cumbersome and unfair at present and needs to be simplified.  I would favour a system based on 10s - 10K personal allowance, 10% tax on personal income and 10% corporate tax. Tax could be calculated by anyone! It would be interesting to have this debate as it might open our eyes to who is actually bearing the burden of tax at present!",
