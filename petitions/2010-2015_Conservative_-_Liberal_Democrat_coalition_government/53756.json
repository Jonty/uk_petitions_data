        "additional_details": "It seems clear that the business of running the country for the furtherment of all is subverted by the financial interests of politicians. Govt should change this.\r\nPolitics needs to be clean in order to allow politicians to make the best decisions. Perhaps the following points should provide a basis for this:\r\ni) MP's, Ministers and Advisers wages should be trebled or quadrupled\r\nii) No expenses are allowed\r\niii) No second jobs or advisory roles are allowed\r\niv) No shares can be held or traded by politicians or their immediate families\r\nv) No appointments to directorships paying more than official wages are allowed within 5 years of leaving office\r\nvi) Political parties to be publicly funded only. Commission to be appointed to find the most cost-effective and fair way of doing this\r\nvii) Politicians whose constituency is further than the 'average' commute into London to be allowed a free work-live apartment near their London office.\r\nNot exhaustive, but only 1000 characters allowed\r\n",
