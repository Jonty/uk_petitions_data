        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK Air traffic control chatter can not be broadcast we are currently the only major country that forces this law in the world. from what people have said it is a \"terror risk to broadcast what is being said\" but even america the largest worrier of terrorism in the world allows there chatter to be sent over the web, so why can't we. What I am asking is for the government to allow airports to broadcast ATC chatter to people who like to listen to ATC but would prefer it in there own county as apposed to another nations.",
