In many areas in the UK, housing has hit crisis point already. Investors need more encouragement to let their porperty. For this reason, I petition for a compulsory council tax increase by 100% for every full year that a habitable home is kept empty. This is not hostile to investors. They can choose to let their property and gain an even higher return on their investment. ",
