        "additional_details": "The Dartford Toll charge is currently applicable to both private and commercial motor vehicles, vans and articulated lorries. The burden of increased toll charges is borne by the owners of these vehicles, but what about motorcycles? These two wheeled road users have always enjoyed a toll free crossing. But is this fair? There have been several debates about toll increases, again the everyday motorist/commercial businesses will bare the brunt. I appreciate that the tunnel/bridge require regular Maintenance etc and am happy to continue contributing whenever I use them. However I feel the time has come to stop burdening the same people over and over again and start looking at charging motorcyclist. Why do they enjoy toll free crossing? I feel the government should freeze any anticipated increase and instead impose a 50p levy on ALL motorcyclist.\r\n\r\nThis is only fair. ",
