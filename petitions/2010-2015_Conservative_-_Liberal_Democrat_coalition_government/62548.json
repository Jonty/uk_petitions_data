        "additional_details": "Nobody deserves to die. No matter what crime they committed, a second chance is deserved. If unsafe to release an offender into the public then the offender will remain under life. However for offenders who have displayed significant change and are judged to be safe will have the opportunity to be rehabilitated.This is my proposition. Execution is murder in cold blood. This means the executioner is a murderer and by law HE too must die. This law doesn't work, and executioners don't die for murder. They can murder offenders and get PAID for it. This is not only morally wrong but it is a breach of human rights.\r\nYes, people have lost others close to them but is our hate so strong that people must die before we get closure. If in the eyes of God we are forgiven then why cant humans forgive, yes they may be offenders but there is a reason why they committed the crime that they committed. We cant just turn our backs on them.",
