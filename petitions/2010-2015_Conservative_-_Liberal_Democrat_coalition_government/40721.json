        "additional_details": "Last year there was a referendum on changing the voting system for the House of Commons. It was overwhelmingly defeated as the British people want to stick with the First Past the Post system.\r\n\r\nIt is the fairest of all systems and the most widely used. Whoever gets the most votes wins, and each citizen must have one vote only.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of democracy, we must do as the British people have said, to keep FPTP. But still, undemocratic activists who want a new system against the will of the British people, are trying to keep the debate alive.\r\n\r\nWe the petitioners call on Her Majesty's Government to block any change to voting system and that no new system is adopted unless there is clear demand for it a new referendum. At present no referendum is needed as there is no precedent for a new voting system and on the contrary there is public opinion against it already expressed.",
