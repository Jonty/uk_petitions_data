        "additional_details": "Zero hour contracts, whilst of great benefit to those employers who are willing to abuse those who work for them, provide no security to those employed on these unfair employment contracts. Zero hour contracts are an alternative word for 'unemployed' but without any rights. I imagine they must also constitute an infingement of basic human rights.I therefore propose these contracts are banned outright.",
