        "additional_details": "Cat fouling in private property is frowned upon, but perfectly legal in the UK, whereas dogs, for example, if caught fouling in public places, would have their owner slapped down on with a fine. Cats are allowed to foul wherever they please, while dog's excrement must be picked up and put in special bins, or cleaned if the dog did not even belong to you. Cat poo has toxins in it, and in some cases is as dangerous as dog poo. This petition stands for fines to be placed on a cat's owner if there is evidence (photograph or video) that the cat had fouled on the property.",
