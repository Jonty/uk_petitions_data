        "additional_details": "National Service should be re-instated for anybody who is age 16 and above who is not in full-time education, training, a job or an apprenticeship. This should be a two year period that will give young adults a purpose, teach them discipline and give them skills to succeed in the workplace. The army is stretched to the limit and there are calls to increase the Territorial Army. Why not create a reserve army of 16 to 18 year olds who will not be sent to the front line but provide UK border support. They should be given the same wages as an apprentice but given training in vocational skills to aid them finding work post two years. Upon completing two years service everybody will be given an option to leave and seek employment or stay and join the Army.",
