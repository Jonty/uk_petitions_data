        "additional_details": "Petition to have a Referendum for gay marriage. Only those in government get to decide on the issue of gay marriage. The public should get a say too. It is not fair that only the government should decide on such a large issue. This Referendum will mean that the people as a whole in the United Kingdom will get to decide whether or not they want their government to implement same sex marriage. The 'Yes' Option however should not include a religious ceremony, as forcing church leaders to wed same sex couples is for the most part against their teachings. Same sex marriage would only be implemented at a government level. This is to implement as much equality as possible whilst respecting the liberty of our churhes",
