        "action": "To challenge Republic of Ireland's land trespass law, 2002 which effectively evicted Irish gypsies/travellers from Ireland",
        "additional_details": "On 10th April 2002, the President of Ireland signed into law the Housing (Misc. Prov.) Bill(No 2), 2001.\r\nSection24 made trespass on land a criminal offence.\r\nNorthern Ireland, realising the likely consequence of this would be that the Southern Irish travellers would move North, followed with similar legislation.\r\nThe result of the new law was that a huge proportion of the Irish travellers, effectively evicted from Ireland migrated to England.\r\nThe Republic of Ireland along with the United Kingdom are all signatories to the European Union.\r\nMy petition is that the UK should challenge the Irish legislation before the European Courts on the basis that no country of the EU should have the right to pass legislation which effectively evicts a section of their citizens.",
