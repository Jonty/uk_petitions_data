        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to introduce a card for disabled children to enable them to enjoy this countries fabulous historical and cultural places. Very often disabled children find it hard to cope with places like National Trust properties etc. and feel the need to leave quickly, whether it be because of boredom or mental/physical problems. A card to prove they have a disability and to enable them to have cheaper entrance fees to establishments could open up a whole new world to these youngsters. Parents would not feel the need to drag their children round these wonderful places disturbing other people if the entrance fees were reduced a little.\r\n",
