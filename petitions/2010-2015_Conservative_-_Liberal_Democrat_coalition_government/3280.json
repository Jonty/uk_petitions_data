        "additional_details": "The Home Office should consider reclassifying .22 Pistols as Section 1 firearms. Currently firearm laws require any pistol to be a minimum length, which makes using them for legitimate sporting activities completely impractical. Our shooting sportsmen & women have to travel outside of the country to practice, which makes their training difficult & expensive. The current legislation should be changed to standard .22 pistols only to be used for target shooting sport purposes by any Firearms Certificate holder, not just a specially selected few, allowing all a chance to compete & practice to international standards.",
