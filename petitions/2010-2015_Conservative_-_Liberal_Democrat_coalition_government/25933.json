        "additional_details": "The contributions of Christopher Hitchens to the world through his outspoken critical thinking and writing should be commemorated with a statue among other national heroes. A statue of Hitchens should be placed in a prime position in the City of London, and it should be made of something tough. A suggestion for the figure to use would be the iconic image of him in the trench-coat, and suggestions and votes should be cast for which of his many brilliant quotes should go on the plaque. ",
