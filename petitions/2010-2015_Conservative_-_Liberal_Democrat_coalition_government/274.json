        "additional_details": "The present system of funding Local Government (locally) is by Council Tax.  This system is regressive and unfair and is not based on ones ability to pay.\r\n\r\nThe services a Council provide benefits the whole community but it is estimated that only a third of local people contribute.  The system needs radical overhall to take this into account.\r\n\r\nLocal Government needs funding, but it needs to be fair and based on abilty to pay.  A system similar to PAYE could be easily implemented on a national rate / scale (computerised).  Councils have the infrastructure to bill people accordingly. People pay taxes, not property.....\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to radically overhall Council Tax.\r\n\r\n",
