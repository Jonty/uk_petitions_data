The government claim to have given schools and heads more freedom than they have ever had yet they are trying to force examination entry points for schools through the use of league tables.\r\nEarly entry has been used to motivate and build confidence and we object to the government\u2019s use of first exam entry points to be the only measure used in league tables. A student\u2019s final grade at 16 is what should be used in league tables.\r\n",
