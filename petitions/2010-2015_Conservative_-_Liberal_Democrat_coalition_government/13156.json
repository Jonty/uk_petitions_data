        "additional_details": "Make psychology a compulsory subject in education for all children interlaced throughout the curriculum. Use this to foster an understanding of other people, their motivations, differences and similarities to each of us. The aim would be to create greater insight and ensure that children are able to see the impact of their behaviours rather than merely telling them what to do and what not to do. Children will amend their behaviours if they understand why they are being asked to change and understand the context. If this is taught to children at a young enough age, pitched at their level of understanding, we might be able to bring an end to bullying, anti social behaviour and many of societies other ills.",
