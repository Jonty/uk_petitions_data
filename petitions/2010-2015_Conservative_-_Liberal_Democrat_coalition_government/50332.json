        "additional_details": "Corporation Tax is currently calculated based upon the  country of residence of a particular company.\r\nThis allows multinationals to move their profits around from country to country and avoid paying millions and even billions of pounds/dollars in corporation tax.\r\n\r\nRecent cases such as Google and Amazon that have come before the public accounts select committee have highlighted the issues that governments face (sales in the UK being \"finalised\" in Ireland and so on). If corporation tax was calculated based upon the destination of the transaction this would solve this issue; anything sold to UK customers would be subject to UK corporation tax.\r\n\r\nThe world is an increasingly global marketplace, and anything short of a scheme such as the above will allow multinational companies to continue to shift money around and avoid paying what is due to the countries where these gigantic profits are made.",
