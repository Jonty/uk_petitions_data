        "additional_details": "NASA Mars curiosity rover recently returned an image showing an artifact that looks remarkably like a statue of a half buried humanoid figure.\r\n\r\nthe image is shown at the Nasa website:\r\nhttp://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/msss/00528/mcam/0528ML2087006000E1_DXXX.jpg\r\n\r\nunlike other artifacts this is a well defined sculpture and is worth further investigation.\r\n\r\nthe UK space agency should ask NASA to investigate this artifact to determine whether it was made by natural processes, or whether it may the artifact of a long extinct civilisation based on mars when it was in the habitable zone. If it turns out to be the latter it would have enormous implications about how we see ourselves and life in the cosmos.\r\n\r\nThank you",
