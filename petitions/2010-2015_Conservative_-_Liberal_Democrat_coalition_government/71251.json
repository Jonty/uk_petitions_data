Many people have lost loved ones for the flag. be it\r\nA public apology I feel will not be good enough from her.\r\nThe anger that is being felt and hurt goes beyond, a half felt apology! Many gave their lives, blood, sweat and tears for our flag and still do so to this day.\r\nThe Union flag does not move because the wind moves it.\r\nThe Union flag moves from the last breath of every service person who has paid the ultimate price protecting it!",
