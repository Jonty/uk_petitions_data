        "additional_details": "George galloway is a long standing member of parliament and should be selected for the house of lords, he has been elected 6 times and I think that for this alone he should be nominated.  Baring in mind that other MPs who haven't been in the house as long and contributed no more or less are now in the lords. George galloway is one of the finest orators the house has ever produced. So on this basis I feel he is being over looked and should be recommended to the lords. ",
