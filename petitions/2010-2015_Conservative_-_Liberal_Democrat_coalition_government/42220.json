        "action": "BBC: volunteers in management, salary and compensation research proposal",
        "additional_details": "This petition proposes the DCMS / BBC remuneration's committee research the possibility of a new system of recruitment and compensation for BBC managers. The focus should be to determine if there are sufficient incentives in place in terms of: expenses, hospitality and 'prestige' to attract suitable candidates from the private sector to top positions. e.g. A candidate could be a retired, experienced business executive (from any sector) who is more interested in working for the prestige of the role than for a large salary. If the research concludes that top candidates would work for less than +/-\u00a33.328mm (token salary, taxable benefits and other remuneration  ... the 2011-2012 cost of the BBC executive/non-executive boards + trustees), then that would indicate a viable alternative to the present system, even before considering the benefits of using 'quasi - volunteer workers' to avoid 'golden parachutes' etc. It may even encourage a sense of community responsibility and ownership.",
