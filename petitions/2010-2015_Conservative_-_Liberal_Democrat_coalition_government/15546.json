If they cannot find one, then they are drafted into civil service in their local area. i.e. cleaning the streets, tidying and maintain flower beds, parks and gardens Clearing the snow off pavements in the winter. All the jobs that the Councils have not got the money to do.\r\nIf they will not even do that, then the benefit stops. Pay for their housing, give them old clothes that the shops cannot sell, have their meals delivered.  They are not given any money at all! This would stop them spending our taxes on booze/drugs and gambling.\r\n",
