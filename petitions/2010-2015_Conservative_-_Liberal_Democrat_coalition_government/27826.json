        "additional_details": "This is an initiative promoting a glass-free zone in the Holylands area of South Belfast during the St. Patrick's Day 2012 celebrations. We hope that it will help reduce the number of injuries and damage to property, caused by broken glass.  We support a local bye-law being passed that compels local off-licences and bars to sell and serve drinks only in plastic cups or plastic bottles during this time.  And temporary actions that would prevent glass being brought into the area. ",
