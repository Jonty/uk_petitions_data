        "additional_details": "From the 02/12/2014 the UK-made\u00a0VoD porn or paid-for online porn now has to follow the same\u00a0strict BBFC (British Board of Film Censors) guidelines as porn DVDs sold in sex shops.\r\n\r\nThis means that spanking, caning, aggressive whipping, penetration by any object \u201cassociated with violence\u201d, physical or verbal abuse (regardless of if consensual), urolagnia (aka. \u2018water sports\u2019), female ejaculation, strangulation, facesitting and fisting are banned.\r\n\r\nThis does not only infringe on our individual rights to watch what we like but also (and probably the most damaging) has a bad affect on the British porn industry. These acts that are now banned are part of fetish porn and are all consensual acts of porn, this is in no way violent acts or is there any proof to suggest that it causes violent sexual acts without consent crime.\r\nThis petition is to ask the government to overturn the decision to ban this type of porn for the UK market.\r\n",
