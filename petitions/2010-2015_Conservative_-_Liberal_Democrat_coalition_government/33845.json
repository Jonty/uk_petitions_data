        "additional_details": "In the back garden about 20m from any house is a beautiful organic children sized playhouse on a platform which has stood for 3 or 4 years and 9 months. Built in 2007 or 8 by myself for my only son and his friends. It was built with approval of all existing neighbours. It is and has been enjoyed by many. However council planning have been asked by my neighbour, no.27 Clare Avenue, Julie Osborne to ask me to remove it. Her husband Paul Osborne has no objections, at the time of construction (as she did) or now. The structure is temporary, a development incidental to the enjoyment of a dwelling house, and well within the permitted development orders. My 10 year old boy will outgrow it soon. He lives with me half of his time and is deeply upset that his lovely home maybe altered because of the whims of one person. I am presently unable to alter it because of a reoccurring knee injury. I want the government or the council to relinquish any action till 2014.",
