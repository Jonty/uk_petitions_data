        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is quick to blame Pakistan when it's own citizens (born and raised in UK) supposedly blow up the London Underground, yet when a man who sits in London incites violence, riots and threats against civilians and threats acts of terrorism, British remain hum and quite.\r\n\r\nThat is the case with Mr. Altaf Hussain, a British citizen running terrorist organization MQM from its London headquarters. Mr Altaf Hussain's recent hate speeches are clearly violation of Section 18 and 23 of public order act 1986; and section 41 of terrorism act 2000.\r\n\r\nWe have filed thousands of complaints against him in London Metropolitan police yet no action taken.\r\n\r\nWe strongly demand Government of UK to stop promoting terrorism from its soil against Pakistan by stripping his citizenship and expelling him back to Pakistan.",
