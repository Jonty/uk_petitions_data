        "additional_details": "This e-petition calls on the Government to prevent foreign men from using marriage for immigration purposes. It also appeals to women to sign the petition.\r\n\r\nThis immigration loophole is a cause of much unhappiness to many British men.\r\n\r\nThree times as many men commit suicide as women.\r\n\r\n Among young people the ratio is even higher.\r\nOne reason, doubtless, is that there are more young men than young women in the UK.\r\nBritish men often cannot live in other countries through marriage.\r\n\r\nNote: The Government's answer to this problem in 2012 was to impose a condition on British men and women that they have an income of at least \u00a318,600 before their foreign spouse can live in the UK. Other EU nationals are not required to have any income!\r\n\r\n18,600 is too HIGH, and we demand for it to be reduced in order for Couples to live together and not be stressed by this new rule which has been shockingly passed, unexpectedly !",
