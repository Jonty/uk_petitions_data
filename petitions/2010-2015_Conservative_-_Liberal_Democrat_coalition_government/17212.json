        "additional_details": "This petition asks that the government bans palm oil from Malaysia and Indonesia in the UK, and any products that contain palm oil from these two nations.\r\n\r\nWhy:\r\n\r\nThese two nations are murdering an unimaginable amount of animal/plant species from rainforests, by deforestation, to make way for palm tree plantations. The biggest loss is the oncoming extinction of the ORANGUTANS, whom we share at least 95% of our DNA. The Sumatran Tiger is also destined for an oncoming extinction, with as little as 300 left in the wild. Undiscovered species are also being killed before discovery.\r\n\r\nPalm oil is not needed in the products we use it for. It is our duty as 'earthlings' and the 'guardians' of our world to save our brother specie.\r\n\r\nLets get 100,000 signatures and save part of our evolutionary line! It's our moral responsibility - If you read this petition, do the right thing and sign it.\r\n\r\nGoogle 'Orangutans and palm oil' for info.",
