        "additional_details": "Why should a 40% tax payer with kids be penalised whilst a 40% tax payer without kids is not? Surely the fairest way would be for all tax payers to contibute to lowering the deficit. A 1% increase in the 40% rate would easily cover the value of the abolition of Child Benefit to families with a 40% tax-payer. Please support this e-petition.",
