        "additional_details": "A majority of the country have made it clear that they think migrant need to wait a lot longer before being able to claim benefits. Currently migrants only have to wait a few months before claiming benefits and therefore haven't contributed to Britain at all and what's more our benefit system is attracting a lot of illegal immigrants, causing problems both here and in France.\r\n\r\nMaking migrants wait until they've contributed to our country is both fair and will help deter migrants from risking their lives to get here illegally.",
