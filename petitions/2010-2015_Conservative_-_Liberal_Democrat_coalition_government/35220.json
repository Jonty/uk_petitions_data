        "additional_details": "The ever-increasing numbers of birds of prey has led to the widespread destruction of a lot of our wild life, many types of small birds and animals once so common are now becoming quite rare, or are even being put on the endangered list. Its time that the pro-raptor brigade themselves were brought under control by strict licensing conditions, in the main to control the numbers of these birds being released into the wild.\r\n\r\nWhy are so many birds of prey being released in such excessively large numbers all over the country, raptors have no natural predators to control their numbers and man is banned by law from so doing! I propose that these laws are either relaxed or repealed, birds of prey are no longer themselves an endangered species, but as a result of their ever increasing numbers many other birds and mammals are rapidly becoming so!\r\n",
