        "additional_details": "Our aim: When Langwith College moves to the Heslington East, we want the University of York to maintain Langwith's affiliation with the current Langwith Corner Room situated at the bottom of A Block.\r\n\r\nCurrently the room provides an excellent space for any Langwithian during the day and night, and is vital for the social wellbeing of the college. The food preparation facilities are important, as well as the seating area.\r\n\r\nNext year, the move to Hes East will leave Langwith without any space on the main campus. By keeping the room affiliated, the students will be able to continue to use the facilities and it will provide an important communal area. It will also allow second and third year students to keep in touch with the college through advertising of events, which could otherwise go unnoticed.\r\n\r\n",
