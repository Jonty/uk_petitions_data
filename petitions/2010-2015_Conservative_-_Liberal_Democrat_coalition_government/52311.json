For repeat offenders this should rise to 100%, 200%, etc. each time they are caught.  In addition, any vehicle they are driving at the time of the offence should be seized and either sold or scrapped.\r\n\r\nThese fines should be imposed irrespective of ability to pay and if they can't pay they should be required to do unpaid community work that is calculated at the minimum wage rate until they have paid the fine, ",
