        "additional_details": "There is a lot of speculation about how the public feel about immigration. The government should ask the public for their opinions directly by way of survey/referendum. They should ask for people's thoughts as there are probably many fallacies that can be quashed, questions answered and fears alleviated. We need to hear what the public are REALLY thinking in terms of Immigration and the use of our strapped services. ",
