        "additional_details": "A call for the UK Government to openly denounce the persecution of Christians across the world. Currently 11 Christians are killed every hour because of their faith.  In the last year 100,000 Christians have been killed. In addition many more are beaten, tortured, raped and abused for their faith. It is time for those who lead this nation to say no more and to say so in the open. Where appropriate to take action through the provision of aid, to actively assist those fleeing persecution I.e. The Assyrian Christians of Mosul and to call on other nations to stand against these atrocious acts of violence. Christians are the most persecuted faith in the world at this time.  It is time for those who have the voice to stand up and be counted. ",
