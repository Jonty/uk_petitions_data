Families are being priced out of the market and cannot find suitable properties.\r\n\r\nBy stopping buy-to-let mortgage interest tax relief on residential properties, it would:-\r\n\r\n1)  Create a fairer market for those who wish to own their own home.\r\n\r\n2)  Stabilise prices.\r\n\r\n3) Encourage more sellers to help those stuck in renting to find a suitable home.\r\n\r\n5)  Provide greater revenue for the government.\r\n",
