        "additional_details": "The government has decided that non-working households need GBP26,000.00p to maintain their lifestyles.  Non-working households are unencumbered by the costs incurred by travelling to and from their place of residence and their place of work.  It is immoral and a gross injustice, therefore, to make those people who are working and have less than GBP26,000.00p disposable income to bear the cost of travelling to and from work.  100% of these costs should be allowed to be set against annual income tax so that those who are not working are NOT further benefitted from the fact that they are not working and being funded by those who do.",
