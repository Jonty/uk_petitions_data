        "additional_details": "We all know bullying in the workplace is widespread, takes many forms and is hard to prove.  It is defined by aggresive and forceful means that affects others.  Often it is managers abusing their power, without responsibility and proper accountability, but sometimes it is organisations where their own policies allow such things to take place and they call it organisational change. They are, in part, correct - IT IS TIME FOR CHANGE IN ORGANISATIONS.  It is well overdue for a change in the law so that this inappropriate behaviour is called what it really is ABUSE. It is time for all those organisations who use those policies to be accountable and it is time for any managers and staff to be individually accountable for inappropriate behaviours of this nature at work.  Work should be a place where people go to be safe and to do their job and that is it.  Please sign and get the debate in a place where real change can happen.. ",
