        "additional_details": "Ban GM food, it is a conspiracy against Darwinian evolution. Weeds and pests will evolve to counter any genetic modifications made, its called evolution. In fact this has already happened to the bollworm moth which has quickly adapted to GM cotton crops in the USA. Practically all food problems are political and growing food indoors would solve many more problems that GM can't. eg extreme weather, the 90% loss of water to the land, vertical farming would increase yields beyond gm, seasons would no longer be an issue, there would be no need for pesticides etc.",
