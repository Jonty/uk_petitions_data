        "additional_details": "Every morning thousands, if not millions, of people use the motorways to get about, and every morning we are faced with the same problem.  Lorries limited by law to 60mph trying to overtake each other.\r\n\r\nCars and Vans are then forced out to the outside lanes when they do not want to be, causing the flow of traffic in these lanes to slow or come to a complete stop.\r\n\r\nWe understand that lorries are important to the UK and its Economy, but on Motorways they become a reckless danger to other drivers.\r\n\r\nI petition the Department for Transport to impose a ban on Lorries overtaking each other DURING PEAK HOURS.  This ban would stop bottlenecks being created, save time and more importantly SAVE LIVES.  ",
