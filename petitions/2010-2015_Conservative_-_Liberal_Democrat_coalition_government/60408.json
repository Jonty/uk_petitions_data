Children born with scid will live no longer then a year without a bone Marrow transplant. The trouble is at the moment there is currently no newborn screening for this disease so our children have to become very sick before doctors suspect something is wrong. This then makes transplant more harder and riskier and our children suffer. Currently America is rolling screening out across the states to screen for this with all other routine baby screening. I would like the uk to follow suit just as Canada are starting to. This will give bubble\r\nBabies even more chance of surviving please please help save bubble babies xxx let's lift the cure rate from 80% to 100%",
