        "additional_details": "Advertisers for loans are clearly aiming their adverts towards the younger generation. Not to mention any names of company's but in some adverts characters that would only appeal to a younger child such as a certain advertiser who uses a singing item of fruit to advertise their products, as that obviously would not appeal to adults they are clearly aimed at the younger generation and this is why people are thinking its okay to get a loan and get in debt. Filling children's heads with this propaganda is unjust. Teenagers and if not younger are going to grow up thinking  loans are okay and are easy to pay back but when this becomes apparent to them it may well be to late. This needs to change. These kind of adverts shouldn't be showed on tv until at least after 22:00 and not on after 6:00 this will ensure this, as well as the futures younger generations enter adulthood with the right thoughts on finances and how to handle money.",
