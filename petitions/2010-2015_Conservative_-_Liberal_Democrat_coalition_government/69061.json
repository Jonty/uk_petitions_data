This child was in good hands and has been needlessly taken from his parents and his parents hunted down and arrested like criminals. They had every right to question their childs treatment without being threatened by the hospital staff. They need to be able to give their child the treatment that may help him and a full investigation on their treatment by the staff and police should be launched.",
