        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for the lowering of fuel duty. Fuel prices are \u00a31.30+ with around 60p of that being fuel duty. We have to suffer with some of the highest fuel prices in the world. A lot of people live in rural areas where a car is essential. Public transport is no longer any good, there have been many cuts that have affected this. People are going to be priced out of motoring, and with most people having a car as a necessity, there will be a number of people in bad debt. Lower fuel duty now!",
