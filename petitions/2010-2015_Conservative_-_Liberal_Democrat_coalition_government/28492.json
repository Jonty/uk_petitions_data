        "additional_details": "MP's have extraordinary perks, funded by the taxpayer. These should all be scrapped.\r\nExpenses- No taxpayer funded 2nd homes, expenses- buy or build a block of flats close to Parliament (or use the Olympic village after the games) with standardised, non-extravagant furnishings and basic computer facilities. When elected, an MP is allocated a specific flat for that parliament which they can use  whilst at Westminster. Any staff they require that is funded by the taxpayer (at westminster or in constituency) should be civil servants allocated to them from the most local government office available (probably a jobcentre or tax office) to stop non-jobs being given to family members/friends.\r\nPensions- should have same scheme as the new public sector ones they are forcing through i.e. 1/60th career (in this case, as an elected MP) average, accrued and paid at CPI rates.\r\nSubsidised canteens- Get Rid- everyone else has to foot the bill for their own lunch- so can MP's.
