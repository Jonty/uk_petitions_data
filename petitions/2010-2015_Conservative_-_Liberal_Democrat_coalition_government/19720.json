        "additional_details": "Your taxes are lining unscrupulous landlords pockets. Housing benefit is used by tenants to rent substandard accommodation, with little control over the quality and safety of the accommodation. Where a landlord has little interest maintaining a property (due to lethargy caused by inevitable income from the poorest minorities or more sinister long term plans), it\u2019s often the case that such a property owner will turn a blind eye to tenants needs, rights or any damage, anti-social behavior caused by tenants, or pay for the upkeep of shared boundaries, rubbish removal and damage done to the surrounding area. Most parties would probably gladly ignore the growing number of situations where this is occurring, as such landlords provide a cheap solution to make up for the shortage of housing association, council housing and budget required to keep such properties to a minimum standard. This petition is to enforce a monitored minimum standard kept on properties paid for by housing benefit.",
