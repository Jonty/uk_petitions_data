        "additional_details": "The British government to allow the residents of Diego Garcia (located in the central Indian Ocean) to return to their homeland and hand back any land/possessions taken when they were forcibly evicted to make way for the U.S to use the island as a strategic military outpost, (an agreement made between the U.K and U.S governments between 1968 and 1973) without any referendum or negotiation with the inhabitants, the Chagossians. Numbering approx 2,000 people, they were expelled by the British government to Mauritius and Seychelles to allow the United States to establish a military base on the island. Today, the exiled Chagossians are still trying to return, claiming that the forced expulsion and dispossession was illegal. Compensation and/or government support/investment should also follow.",
