        "additional_details": "Cowes Enterprise College will be cutting 26 Support Staff and teachers too and only 10 support staff will be kept for the students that have requirements for special education. There is approx \u00a3250,000 of unused leather furniture in the poorly created new building which is not being used and there are rooms within the new building which could be hired out for meetings etc to raise money. Why haven't the governors and the head teacher tried alternate methods of raising money to keep these ESSENTIAL staff! There are approximately 900 pupils that attend Cowes Enterprise College how many of those pupils need help? To put it bluntly, a lot. This school has only just come out of special measures due to the staff and now they're being rewarded with redundancy. The pupils are extremely concerned about there education along with their parents and today they've protested to show their support which was on the BBC news. VOTE NOW AGAINST THIS!",
