        "additional_details": "\r\nI believe this might be a more implementable version of the e-petition angled at the rioters in recent days. Although I signed it, I believe ultimately it would lead to greater homelessness, and increased associated crime.\r\nAt present, people have absolutely no incentive to come off unemployment benefit, so choose to remain on it indefinitely. By implementing a time limit, people on long term unemployment benefits will be given the choice to either accept what is on offer at the job centre, or report for mandatory community service paid at the minimum wage, thereby putting something back into the society that has supported them. This may even lead to a greater understanding and appreciation for the value of places and businesses around them.\r\nPeople need to learn that to exist in a society such as ours cannot be free. We as tax payers know this. It is about time the rest of the population learned it too.",
