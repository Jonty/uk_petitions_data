It seems to be a sad fact that famine support just seems to keep the populations increasing so that we solve one famine just to see the next generation going through the same misery.  I hate to see the starvation around the world and want to do my part in stopping it but simply keeping people alive just so they can keep contributing to population growth exacerbates the problem. ",
