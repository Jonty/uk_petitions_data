It has started already in many places in anticipation of this final act.  The PD-L party have  managed to seal the fate of hundreds of thousands of strays and public shelter dogs who will be killed using the cheapest possible methods many of which will be illegal and barbaric.  The collection, incarceration and finally the incineration of the murdered dogs is big business for many corrupt officials and the companies they employ to do this dirty work.\r\nWe need the Uk government to strongly condemn this in the European Parliament as this is inhumane and flaunts EU laws on animal rights.\r\n",
