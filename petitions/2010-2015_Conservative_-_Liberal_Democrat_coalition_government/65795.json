        "action": "Raise the minimum wage for 18-20 year olds",
        "additional_details": "The minimum wage is currently at \u00a36.35 an hour for people aged over 21, compared to just over a fiver for under 21 year olds. There is no evidence to support the government\u2019s argument that this will help to get young people into work. Instead, this unjust measure will only serve to widen the increasing intergenerational inequality that we are seeing in Britain, and force hundreds of thousands of young people further into poverty, I myself have personal experience of this. How is it fair that we are expected to work as an adult working to 2am in the morning etc yet get paid a fraction of what an adult would earn?\r\n\r\nThe petition is asking the Parliament to discuss an increase in National Minimum wage in line with Current rate of inflation and the rise given to the minimum wage for over 21 year olds. The cost of living continues to rise, and it is only fair that the minimum wage should rise as well, ideally 18-20 year olds should earn just as much as a 21 year old would.",
