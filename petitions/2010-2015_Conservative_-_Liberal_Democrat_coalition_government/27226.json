I propose that a 20% tax is levied on monies sent to European countries and a 40% tax on all monies sent to non-European countries, as money sent out of Britain is not benefiting the British economy. The Treasury can use the extra revenue for public services for the benefit of the people who reside in Britain and who do contribute to our society.",
