        "action": "Public inquiry into the ongoing child sex abuse in Rotherham",
        "additional_details": "A group of people have been able to traffic and abuse children for years in full knowledge of the police and social services. This has gone on for some sixteen years, and has known to have included children being \"beaten, doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight and made to witness violent rapes\".\r\n\r\nThe media found out about it only when a 17 year old girl was murdered who threatened to tell all. The leader of the council resigned as leader of the council, not altogether as an MP representing his area. Nobody else will face any kind of disciplinary action.\r\n\r\nThis is, at best, a whitewash. MP's thought it was distasteful enough that answer phones were hacked to launch a public inquiry, but seem remarkably quiet on this one. I'm asking you to stand up for children, because nobody else is right now, and stand with me to demand a public inquiry into how this was allowed to happen in 21st century Britain.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
