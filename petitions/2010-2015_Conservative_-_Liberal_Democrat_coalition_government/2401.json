The cost of electricity and gas is soaring.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to take control. By taking control of the energy companies the government can regulate prices to ensure that every British Citizen is getting a fair price! No longer should we rely on the good nature of those involved in the higher management of energy companies. ",
