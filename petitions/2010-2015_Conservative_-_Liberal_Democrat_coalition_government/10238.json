Our NHS is always short of money and our carers need to focus treatment on the needy not the self injured. My proposal is simple, where people have drunk irresponsibly and this results in a visit to A&E they should be given a bill for the full cost of their treatment. This should then give much needed funds to the NHS and at the same time bring home the message of \"being responsible for yourself\". ",
