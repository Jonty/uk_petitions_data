        "additional_details": "Clauses 33 & 34 in the proposed immigration bill institute charges for GP and A&E services for lawful immigrants to the UK. We call for the removal of Clauses 33 & 34 because they:\r\n\r\nare INTRUSIVE: forcing doctors to become surrogate border control officers, having to verify every patient\u2019s immigration status (including citizens of the UK) to determine who is \u2018eligible\u2019 for treatment\r\n\r\nwill lead to the SPREAD OF HIV: Around 60% of HIV diagnoses are made during A&E or routine GP visits. Placing financial barriers to GP and A&E access will reduce the number of diagnoses made. Individuals who know their HIV status are far less likely to spread the virus. Reducing the number of diagnoses will increase the HIV rate throughout the general population: HIV doesn\u2019t care who is a citizen, and who is \u2018only\u2019 a legal resident\r\n\r\nwill NOT save money: the cost of implementation, combined with the increased treatment costs for infectious diseases (HIV, TB) will negate any cost-savings/revenue ",
