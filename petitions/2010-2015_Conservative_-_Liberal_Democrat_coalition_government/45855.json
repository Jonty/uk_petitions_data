To this end I believe that Dignitas style clinics should be made available for all those who need them.\r\n\r\nAt present this right is denied to so many thousands of suffering individuals purely to satisfy the whims of a religious and natalist driven orthodoxy. Society condemns so many to die alone in agony, to die from very violent deaths, or continue living in pain from botched suicide attempts.\r\n\r\nSo I suggest there is an immediate change in the law to allow not only assisted suicide for those who desire it, but also drugs like Nembutal (Pentobarbital) to be made available on prescription for the purposes of ending life. Suicide is not illegal and should be made much easier to carry out, without incurring discrimination, blame, stigma or criminality of any kind.\r\n\r\n",
