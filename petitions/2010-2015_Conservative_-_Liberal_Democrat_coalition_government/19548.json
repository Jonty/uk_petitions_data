        "additional_details": "The government should introduce policy so that any business operating within the UK which outsources work (such as wages, IT or customer services departments) to foreign countries in order to cut their costs and increase profits, would have to pay a pro rata tax/levy. This would be dependant on the size of department or number of employees and in order to further encourage companies to keep their staffing needs within this country (and cut unemployment) a form of recompense/subsidy could be arranged. This should be paid in a way so as not to encourage companies to hire and fire here and abroad repeatedly and any monies given to companies would need to be paid back should they revert to foreign outsourcing within 10 years. Where companies prefer to pay a tax/levy to keep departments outside the UK, the money should be used to help train unemployed people.",
