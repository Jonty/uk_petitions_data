If Turkey becomes part of the EU, there may more chaos and conflicts amongst believers of various religions & cultures in the EU. As it is EU reaching is breaking point as regards absorbing more & more new countries and soon EU would become too expensive, unwieldy & chaotic. EU already is economically costly to UK. MEPs and staffing of the administration of the European Parliament and various subsidies are expensive and is a \u2018gravy train\u2019, as well as UK having to subsidise poorer EU states.  It is good that UK currently opted out of EU foreign policy, security, taxation, defence and the Euro monetary currency, but for how long? Where does the demarcation as to where Europe ends and Middle East and Africa begins?",
