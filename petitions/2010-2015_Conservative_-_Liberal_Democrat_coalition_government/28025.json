        "additional_details": "This petition serves to highlight an injustice that has been committed against young 'first time' offenders who got caught up in the August 2011 riots. The judicial system has acted \u2018irresponsibly\u2019 by incarcerating first time offenders for minor errors. Advised and misguided I might add, by politicians. The sentencing is inappropriate and exaggerated and I believe this act to be Unlawful!\r\n\r\nWhere is the Mercy and Forgiveness? Where is the Compassion? Where indeed is the Justice??? I believe the 'riot' situation has been exploited to bring in laws that suggest, as of 16th Jan 2012, All first time offences of burgulary will mean a custodial.\r\nHow will this help the overall problem of offending and/or re-offending. When mistakes are made offenders need 'help to correct and heal' rather than harsh punishments.\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider your decision to impose increased sentences.",
