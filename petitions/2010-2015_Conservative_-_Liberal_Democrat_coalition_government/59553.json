        "additional_details": "South West Water customers pay at least DOUBLE for their water than some other suppliers charge. While its true that SWW do have help available through their WaterSure Tariff the problem is that ALOT of SWW Customers don't meet the criteria for the WaterSure Tariff.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this forces us to not eat properly and even worse not heat our homes properly. Medical evidence supports the fact that not doing these two basic things can put our very lives at risk.\r\n\r\nIf you look online for the average SWW bill it will tell you its around \u00a3500. The fact is that I know no family that pays that amount. I have no arrears but am paying close to double that amount.\r\nI think that South West Water Customers are being unfairly charged by a company that is putting the health and very lives of their customers at risk so they can make vast profits. I personally think that SWW bills should be capped at around \u00a3600.\r\n\r\nPLEASE HELP...\r\n\r\n\r\n",
