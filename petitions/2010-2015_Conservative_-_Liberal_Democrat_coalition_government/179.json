        "additional_details": "We Petition the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to set up a public inquiry into the data from NASA satellites that shows the heat loss during warming periods from the earth's atmosphere is far greater than in any of the computer models used to set public policy in this area. These real world data suggest that the billions of taxes earmarked for mitigation, and the carbon trading system are simply a total waste of resources based upon error. The government has a duty to examine this urgently.\r\n",
