All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.\"\r\n\r\n \"This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.' 'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE.\"\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this statement, please sign, lets try and make our government stand up and be counted.",
