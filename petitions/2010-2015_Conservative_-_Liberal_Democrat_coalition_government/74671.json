The POTUS inexcusably refused the Jordanians access to Drones to help them.\r\n\r\nI'm asking you, TRH Michael Fallon, to aid the Jordanians in any way possible so we can stamp out the barbarism committed by ISIS since the start of the Syrian Civil War.\r\n\r\nWe the people, as Britons, have life great. We need YOUR help to make the lives of many more great too. By committing more to help eradicate the world of ISIS, the greater the quality of life for not just the people living in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East, but for the people in the rest of the world.
