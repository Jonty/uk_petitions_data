        "additional_details": "The Dangerous Dogs Act is ineffective and raises crime.  In order to combat irresponsible dog owners and prevent attacks or injuries, dog owners need to be punished and charged accordingly.  Deeming particular breeds or types of dog does not prevent attacks, nor does this prevent irresponsible dog owners from failing to provide the correct environment and socialisation for their dog to develop a stable mindset, be it an illegal breed or not.  The vast majority of illegally owned dogs will not cause harm or injury to a person in its lifetime, yet if found by officials the owner will be charged and the dog, possibly destroyed.  This wastes valuable time and money.  The large majority of serious attacks/bites or injuries caused by a dog in the UK is from a legal breed, this therefore clarifies that the Dangerous Dogs Act is ineffective.  I would like to see the Dangerous Dogs Act lifted and dog owners, whose dog has attacked, punished according to the individual case.",
