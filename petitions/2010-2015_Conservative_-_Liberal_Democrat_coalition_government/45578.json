        "additional_details": "For years now, Britain has been eroded by Political Correctness, Health & Safety, Human Rights and fear. We would like to move that they are replaced by a simple use of Common Sense.\r\n\r\nCommon sense is the basic level of practical knowledge and judgement that we all need to help us live in a reasonable and safe way.\r\n\r\nIn the past, Governments have failed to use Common Sense. In terms of Government, using Common Sense would ensure that decisions on a country-wide basis are made for the greater good of the public living here and not for one or two individuals looking to increase personal fortune or power. It would also mean that decisions aren't made that will appease other countries to make us look as though we're sorry for our past.\r\n\r\nDecisions on a community-wide basis are made to empower  individuals to create positivity and optimism.\r\n\r\nPolitical correctness is a ridiculous concept and needs to end now for the good of the country.\r\n\r\nHealth & Safety needs to be reformed.",
