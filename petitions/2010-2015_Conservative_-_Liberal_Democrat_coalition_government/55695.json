        "additional_details": "My e-petition is about the deforestation in Brazil. I want the tree cutting down to stop or at least for a new tree to be planted each time one is cut down. Also, I want them to make sure they don't pollute the water whilst they are doing the logging.I would like the goverment to not give any more money to Brazil to make dams because the last one that was made poisioned the water because the workers didn't clear the vegetation away from the edge of the banks near it. All this deforestation is killing animals, trees and plants. It is also ruining the lives of many indigenous tribes.",
