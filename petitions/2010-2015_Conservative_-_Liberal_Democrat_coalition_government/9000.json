The National Service should be for a period of no more than two years and should not involve active military service abroad but be centred in the UK in regionally based service camps.  The service would instil a sense of discipline and community introducing respect for themselves, their peers and their community whilst actively teaching them a skill/apprenticeship in a recognised discipline/trade which they can utilise on completion of their service in the community.
