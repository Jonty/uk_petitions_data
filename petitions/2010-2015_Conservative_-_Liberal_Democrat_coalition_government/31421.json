The Government has not brought in a concession for TV Licences for people who are deaf; therefore TV Licensing is not able to offer such a concession.\r\nIf you feel that there should be a concession in place for people who are deaf, you may wish to contact your local Member of Parliament about this issue. TV Licensing are only able to apply the law as it stands, and because there is no concession in law, TV Licensing are unable to offer one.",
