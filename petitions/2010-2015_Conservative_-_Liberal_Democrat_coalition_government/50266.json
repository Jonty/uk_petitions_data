It has now become a political, and neighbour voting contest.\r\n\r\nOur money that is being spent on this farcical contest, could be put to better use in our country. We are in a recession but we still find money in funding, what is now a political, neighbour voting contest. With the increase of the Eastern European countries and block voting, it is time that we, the citizens on the United Kingdom stand up to this and pull out of this \"pathetic\" contest. And stop wasting our money which we so desperately want to sort this country out. ",
