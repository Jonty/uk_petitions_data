        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that SATS undermine teachers' morale, waste taxpayers' money, and, most importantly, are symptomatic of an education system where teachers aren't actually allowed to educate children or encourage them to think creatively and independently, but instead are made to train them like monkeys to pass exams. They should be abolished so that teachers can get on with teaching and children can get on with learning without constanly being subjected to meaningless and counter-productive assessments.",
