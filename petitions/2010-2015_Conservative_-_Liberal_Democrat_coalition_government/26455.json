        "additional_details": "With the issue of public dept and the need to provide a safety net to the vulnerable in this country it seems wrong that people who are on the top rate of tax based on their retired incomes receive universal benefits. Whilst at the same time these universal benefits are cut so that those who really need them suffer. Therefore scrapping universal benefits for retired top rate taxpayers would seem a logical and efficient (easy to administer) way to make the limited resources available more focused on those who really need them.
