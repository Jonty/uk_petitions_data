        "additional_details": "My late father who, after suffering several severe strokes and could not speak anymore, was totally incapacitated and at the mercy of the anti-social noise pollution by fireworks being set off randomly through the year (not just 5th November or 31st December), which quite frankly could have given him a heart attack at any time.\r\n\r\nIt's all very well if fireworks are set off at organised displays - miles from residential homes etc, but when the public buy them and then set them off whenever they like throughout the year, it's frightening and dangerous. It's not only animals who suffer but the very young and the very old too, unable to fend for themselves. I would like the Government to do something proactive on the side of those who literally do not have a voice to express their terror against fireworks and ban fireworks from being sold to and used by the general public, regardless of what age they are. Fireworks are anti-social items, set off by inconsiderate people.",
