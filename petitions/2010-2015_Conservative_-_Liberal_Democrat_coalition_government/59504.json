        "additional_details": "In Scotland, both buyer and seller are legally bound at the point of the offer being accepted. Why can't the same apply in the rest of the UK? Too often us UK home movers have to wait until the final days before being sure the deal will actually take place, and on too many occasions, the whole thing falls through at the last minute. This wastes time, energy, money and adds a huge amount of stress to the process. Less stress on home moving = people may move more often = more revenue for the Government in stamp duty which can only be good for the economy. Let's adopt the Scottish system! ",
