        "additional_details": "Estate Agents currently fall under the A1 shop planning class, but unlike other A1 business types, they don't do anything in a brick and mortal store that can't necessarily be done online or by appointment only.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition is show an interest in having Estate Agents moved from Class A1 to class B1 in order to limit the amount of them that are currently occupying our high street retail spaces\u2014spaces that could be better serving a larger portion of our neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nEstate Agents fall in under shops/premises that \"display goods for sale\" if apartment and homes are classified as \"goods\" but could be argued that the majority of the A class usage permits are in place to ensure that communities can be serviced by local businesses that are needed by the residents daily (whilst Estate Agents aren't even needed by most yearly).\r\n\r\nLet's take back our high streets and let our neighbourhoods thrive again by letting diverse business in.",
