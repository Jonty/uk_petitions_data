        "additional_details": "Currently Judges are abusing their sentencing powers especially in recent cases with the 2 Handsworth men, who were not part of any terrorist organisation, but were charged on travelling to Syria and making an intention to defend the civilians against Assads forces.  13 years and 5 years license a ridiculous and absurd sentence.\r\n\r\nWith conflict zones and oppressed people many want to help.  However they are getting charged with terrorism law, this piece of legislation was not essentially for this use and needs to be amended.\r\n\r\nI call for urgent action.  Many in particular Muslims have been ushered to plead guilty and are facing long sentences.\r\n\r\nThis area of law is too wide and not very particular.  I call to an end.  Please support this petition. And lets get justice!\r\n",
