        "additional_details": "The current smoking ban allows people to smoke in public so long as they are outdoors.\r\n\r\nWhilst this has been a positive step forward it is now time to extend the smoking ban to cover all public places.  This should include doorways of public houses and nightclubs, beer gardens, parks, streets and any other public place.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair that non smokers should have to be exposed to second hand smoke when they are in a public area. A secondary problem is litter from discarded cigarette butts.\r\n\r\nWith the levels of awareness surrounding the dangers of second hand smoking it really is time that  full public smoking ban is at least debated if not enacted.",
