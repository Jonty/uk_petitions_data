        "additional_details": "Is this possible - not sure which Department has responsibility as this issue crosses many boundaries including International ones. But I raise it in all sincerity. At least I think it is time for Parliament, both Houses, and all Parties, to look again at this very important issue, which has had cross -Party support before, but has somehow  either  got lost in the sands or left in the long grass. Sorry for the cliches but that is how it seems. Many people have been affected, and at a graet cost, both personal and financial - the public purse picks up the tab too, so maybe time for a full and proper look at this issue.",
