        "additional_details": "The current RFL system is unfair and expensive to administer. It is also avoided by many non-payers and penalises people who only drive a short distance.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to replace the current charge with a variable charge per litre of fuel which would recover the total revenue lost under the old system.\r\n\r\nThis may be in the region of 10 pence a litre - but could be adjusted anually. The collection system is in place and additional cost of collection would be low.\r\n\r\nThis would add in the region of a penny a mile to motoring costs - encouraging the use of greener vehicles which do a higher MPG.\r\n\r\nVehicles would still need controls on ownership - but the current MOT could effectively control a vehicles eligibility to be safely on the road.",
