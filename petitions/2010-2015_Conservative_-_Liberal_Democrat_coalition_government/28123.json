        "additional_details": "We all know that older people are mistreated in hospital, but how many recognise that the same treatment is dealt out to the old and vulnerable at home.\r\nThese people are afraid to speak out as they don't have any support. Even if they do complain it's a case of nurses investigating nurses, so nothing gets done.\r\nIt seems the patients needs, consultant and GP's requirements of the district nurse are disregarded. It is not the district nurses at fault but their superiors who make the decisions.\r\nIn some health centres even the receptionists attempt to stop you seeing your GP. It is time we are able to see our GP without having to fight our way in.\r\nIf you agree please sign this petition and stop any more negative legislation being passed. In future we need to see our GP, and we need nurses to treat patients as instructed by the GP or consultant and we need older and vulnerable people to be treated with respect.",
