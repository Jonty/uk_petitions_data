People are sick and tired of the blatant cover up of genocide, yet the BBC do not present the truth and wage in propaganda with the Zionist, which makes them complicit in these atrocities. Thousands of people have voiced their opposition to the Israeli occupation of Gaza on the streets around the country and this is totally ignored by the BBC. The BBC have no morals, a Zionist agenda and therefore we refuse to fund the BBC, we demand the compulsory license fee be abolished as the BBC are incapable of telling the truth or being impartial. Also an independent body be formed to regulate propaganda designed to vilify minorities on the BBC and media as a whole. ",
