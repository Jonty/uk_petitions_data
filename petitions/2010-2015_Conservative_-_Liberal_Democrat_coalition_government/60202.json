Therefore, when they do go on strike there is a great deal on inconvenience for everyone.  I say that the trains for Crossrail should all be driverless.  In addition, to consider making all the other lines driverless too.  It is unacceptable that one of the major cities in the world is held hostage by these militant unions!",
