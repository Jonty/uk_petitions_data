        "additional_details": "Barbara Driver, a Conservative councillor and the former mayor of Cheltenham, compared housing developers ability to tell a council how many affordable homes it is willing to build on a specific site, to rape. This is what she said: \u201cThere is a saying and I am going to say it: When rape is inevitable, lie back and enjoy it.\u201d The Conservative councillor has since apologised for making the remark. However an apology is not enough. This woman should lose her job as a consequence of her atrocious comment, which perpetuates the myths around rape and is a highly inappropriate thing to say in ANY context by anyone- the fact that this woman is a Tory councillor, and in a position of power who should know better makes it even worse. I am disgusted by this comment- this woman should lose her job or resign.",
