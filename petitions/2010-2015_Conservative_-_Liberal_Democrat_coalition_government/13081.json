Here's the list :- Why spending time with your child is good for both of you,   Discipline in the home,    Respect and Trust from both sides,    Really listening not just hearing,    Explaining why and why not,    Manners, A parent is not your child's best friend,  How to handle buying things for your child,   Budgeting.\r\nI would like the Government to include 30 mins per week in the national curriculum for 15yr olds and older",
