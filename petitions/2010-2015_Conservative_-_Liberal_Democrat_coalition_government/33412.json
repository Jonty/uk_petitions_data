The laws on Human Rights do nothing to protect people who have a nuisance neighbour with a yapping dog.\r\n\r\nThis is made far worse by having to live in a flat next door, with an ajoining wall. It shouldn't be down to the complainant to have to go through the Environmental Health people to have this problem removed.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to take people to Court over this issue anyway, as the law stands!\r\n\r\nWhat about my \"Human Rights\" to have peace?\r\n\r\nIt should be pure \"common sense\", that keeping a dog in a flat where there is minimal, or no soundproofing should not be allowed.\r\n\r\nI already have health issues and am being driven to distraction by someone who cannot, or will not, keep their dog quiet!\r\n\r\nIt should not even be an issue!. People should not be allowed to keep noisy pets like this is a flat, it is ridiculous, plain and simple!\r\n\r\n",
