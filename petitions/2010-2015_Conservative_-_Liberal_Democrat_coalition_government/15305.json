        "additional_details": "The government should be accountable for its manifesto commitments, and should be subject to more direct challenge if acting outside of its mandate.\r\n\r\nGovernments are able to abandon, or substantially alter, manifesto commitments without the need to seek a new mandate from the electorate. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of a constitutional mechanism for resolving conflicts in party manifesto commitments during the formation of a coalition government. The ability to act outside of mandate is at odds with a representative democracy.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to create controls requiring greater commitment to manifesto commitments.\r\n\r\n* Granting the Opposition the right to seek a referendum on new policy outside of mandate, requiring a 2/3rds majority of non-governmental MPs in a Parliamentary vote.\r\n* Requiring the Government to call a general election within 6 months if defeated in such a referendum",
