The M.O.D. should come under the same rules and regulations as other government bodies, ie police, health board etc..... Too many young lives are lost and the military are being allowed to be a closed book. We need to change this now and make all government bodies especially the military open to questioning over these deaths. These young people put their lives on the line to keep this country safe the least we can do is make sure they get an unbiased and open inquest which is due to criminals who die in custody.......",
