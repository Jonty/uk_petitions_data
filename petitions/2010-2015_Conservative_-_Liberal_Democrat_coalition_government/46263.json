        "additional_details": "The British Empire collapsed during the end of the second world war, And we still own multiple carribean, pacific and atlantic islands. This is still greed, What if the people of the British Overseas Territories Wish to have independence of their own lands, Not have it being ran by a UK Government. I believe that the Government should grant independence to the islands and territories owned by them, Akrotiri and Dhekelia would maybe have to be given to Cyprus as it involves slight territorial issues. But i think all British Overseas Territories (excluding Antarctic because it states in the Antarctic treaty) should be independent nations.",
