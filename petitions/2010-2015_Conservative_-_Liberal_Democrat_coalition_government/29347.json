        "additional_details": "Sales calls, spam calls, advertising or generally abusive messages. We've all had them, and it has always been a nuisance to prevent. A number of smart-phones have applications to block incoming calls from certain numbers, but not every phone does (and the application is sometimes expensive). On any other media outlets (social networking, email or instant messenger) users are allowed to block another member from contacting them with a single click. However, with mobile phones you must have a police complaints number and go through a legal process to do so. This isn\u2019t giving us the privacy that we want. We should not have to spend time and effort blocking numbers from phoning or texting others. I propose that all service providers have an online system to permit customers to block numbers (without calling customer support). New smart phones should have applications built in to block numbers before they can be sold in the UK. It\u2019s a simple request, but phones are lagging behind in time.",
