        "additional_details": "In order to raise awareness of motorcyclists on Britain\u2019s roads I would like to propose that anyone wishing to drive a car should have to pass a minimum CBT and have that for 2 years before being able to drive a car. You don't wake up one morning without a licence and decide to drive a truck, you have to drive a car first. Even worse there is not one motorcycle related question in the driving theory. With this in mind I am not suggesting this to reduce population I am simply trying to raise awaerness to the car driver and by completing a CBT  or restricted licence it gives you an idea of how vulnerable a motorcycle is and that you will be more aware when driving a car. As many as 7,004 bikers and their pillions lost their lives between 1999 and 2010.",
