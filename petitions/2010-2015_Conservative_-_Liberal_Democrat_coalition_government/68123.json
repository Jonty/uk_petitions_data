        "additional_details": " We are petitioning to Newham council to raise awareness about youth volunteering opportunities in the borough.\r\nIn a recent survey, we found that 68% of 103 people we interviewed in Newham thought that a lack of youth volunteering was a noteworthy problem. They also said that anti-social behaviour amongst youths, crime and segregation were problems which need to be addressed. We believe that if the council proactively promoted the volunteering schemes available within the community these other problems could be reduced as young people would feel more involved with the community.\r\nWe phoned Newham council with regard to our petition they told us they were unable to talk with us about the matter as they did not see there was a problem. However, we, a group of local young people disagree.\r\nTherefore we ask you to take just 30 seconds of your day to sign our petition and help us raise awareness of this worthwhile motion.\r\n\r\n#VolunteerWhere?",
