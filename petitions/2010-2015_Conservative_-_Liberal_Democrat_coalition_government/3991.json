Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils are the leading cause to this.\r\n\r\nWe want the UK government to follow other countries such as Denmark and Switzerland to ban Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Fats and Oils in our food, and companies have to replace these oils with healthy alternatives such as Sunflower or Olive Oil.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will also cut spending on the NHS as many people will end up not being overweight and are less likely to develop heart disease.",
