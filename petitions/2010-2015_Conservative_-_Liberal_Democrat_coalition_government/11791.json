If parents believe they will be held liable for their inaction or the inappropriate behaviour of their children they will be much more likely to make sure their children are supervised and well cared for while absent parents will be further encouraged to take a much closer interest in their off-spring.\r\n\r\nLaws that enshrine parental responsibility will improve family life, re-establish bonds and create much needed respect from an early age and children will then be less likely to engage in delinquency if they feel their parents are likely to be held legally accountable for their actions.\r\n",
