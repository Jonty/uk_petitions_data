        "additional_details": "Let's prevent ungentlemanly conduct. We see it on our streets and sports fields and in our student protestors. Let's re-instate a sense of 'good-blokish-ness'. Let's stop hurling expletives at the public from car windows, let's not get vile tattoos/piercings, don't smoke/use drugs. Do snitch on law-breakers. Stop crime nonsense, behave/cooperate. Scrap interest rates on borrowing, take Don Corleone's approach, never asking for money back, he just wanted trust, and this trust, generated by gentlemanly conduct enabled him to operate a successful institution. Obviously the Don had faults, no one can condone his criminal tendencies, but we cannot ignore the fact that his system of old-fashioned decent blokish-ness brought him economic prosperity. Stop student protests, chaining yourself to a road doesn't get anything accomplished, we all have issues! Write letters or E-Petitions! Come on Britain let's cut the nonsense and just be decent.\r\n",
