        "additional_details": "\r\nThe Health and Safety Executive has had to cut down on the number of inspectors employed due to drastic cuts in budget over the years; this despite introducing fees for intervention.\r\n\r\nThis means that it no longer has the manpower or budget to effectively conduct spot-checks across the nation.\r\n\r\nThe HSE instead relies upon whistle-blowing and upon out-of-date lists from other Government bodies who are also unable to engage in spot-checks and who are struggling to function due to budget cuts of their own.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Work and Pensions, which currently sponsors the Health and Safety Executive (an independent regulator), should increase funds to enable the HSE to do the job it was set up to do, i.e. protect the health and safety of workers and the general public.",
