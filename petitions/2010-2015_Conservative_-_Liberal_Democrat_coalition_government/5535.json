A bit like the stock market but indices for charities.\r\nAll advertising and systems set-up to inform the public will be paid for from the charity funds.\r\nWhy does the public not already have this information; it is a certainty that when this happens, more funds will be raised in a far speedier manner.\r\nAny funds which are not allocated to the disaster or emergency appealed for, will be placed in a central fund more able to allocate the pooled monies to causes which are more immediate.\r\nCharities who fail in any of the above areas will be closed and all funds confiscated to the pooled fund.\r\n",
