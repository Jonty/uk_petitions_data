        "additional_details": "The British public want the Government to reconsider their planned proposals for porn to be automatically blocked by ISPs and to be 'opt-in'\r\n\r\nThe planned proposals are open ended as to what constitutes 'pornography'. Therefore internet freedom is at risk of being oppressed, as innocent social media platforms, forums and education websites are under threat.\r\n\r\nIt is also in the opinion of the below signed that it is not the Governments responsibility to provide parenting on behalf of the nation. Freedom of expression and cultural preferences should not be inhibited on behalf of those that lack basic parenting skills.\r\n\r\nThere are already sufficient options available to block internet porn in a family home at the responsible individuals digression. The planned proposals demonstrate a naive perception of the internet, and a lack of understanding as to how the internet works.",
