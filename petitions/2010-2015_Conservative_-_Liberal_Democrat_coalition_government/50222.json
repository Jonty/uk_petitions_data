        "additional_details": "This is almost trivial except that it is a major issue from a common-sense and prevention of stupidity viewpoint.  This sort of interference needs to be stopped.....dead. Vote now!!\r\n\r\nEU has recently decreed that olive oil served on tables in restaurants must be sold in sealed bottles. From Apr 2014  a dipping bowl or oil flask are not permitted.\r\n\r\nSee     http://bit.ly/10EiVx8\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial matter from a consumer viewpoint - if you don't like the taste you send it back. There is no stated evidence of public health problems. Only the (packaging) manufacturers will benefit.\r\n\r\nGovt should successfully reject the directive in UK, as pointlessly meddlesome in the life of its electorate.\r\n\r\nVote now against silly EU interference while we still have that freedom.\r\n",
