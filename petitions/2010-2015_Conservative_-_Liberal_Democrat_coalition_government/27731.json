        "additional_details": "That law regarding how income tax is collected needs radically overhauling so that taxpayers can refuse to pay when the judiciary and other organisations make ludicrous and nonsensical decisions which then end up costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.  Income tax is designed to be used for the benefit of the people who pay the tax.  Currently the taxpayers of this country are getting an extremely bad deal whereby their money is being used to support people and schemes which do not stand up to scrutiy and are, on most occasions, actually detrimental to the future welfare of those taxpayers.  Taxpayers MUST be given the opportunity to withdraw from these schemes.  TAXPAYERS HAVE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO HAVE THE MONEY THEY ARE OBLIGED TO PAY IN TO BE USED FOR THEIR BENEFIT, THAT MONEY MUST NOT CONTINUE TO BE WASTED IN THE WAY IT IS TODAY!",
