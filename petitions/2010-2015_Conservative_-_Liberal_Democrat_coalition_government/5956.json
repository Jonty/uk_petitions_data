        "additional_details": "The monarchy is an outdated concept that promotes a societal structure that is archaic.  The UK should move towards a republican system whereby the politics are governed by a truly democratic system.  The head of state should not be decided by a 'freak of birth' but should be an accountable individual.\r\n\r\nI propose that the UK moves towards a more democratic structure that is more reflective of the people that it represents.  Our current structure is not only expensive but provides the UK populace with no real control over its own destiny.",
