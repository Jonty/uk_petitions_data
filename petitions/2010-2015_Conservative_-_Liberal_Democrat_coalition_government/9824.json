Would free up space in prisons, boost the army numbers at no cost and teach them some respect.  6 weeks training with the Para's (tough unit) and a one way ticket to Afghanistan. The 'real' men of the army would soon teach them how to behave!  They would get 'valuable' experience and learn some discipline.",
