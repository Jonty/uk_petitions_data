        "additional_details": "Ascension Island is a small British owned island in the middle of the Atlantic, just south of the equator.\r\n\r\nThe equator is the ideal launch site for spaceships because the Earth's rotation gives natural acceleration to it.\r\n\r\nIslands are best because a failed launch can drop into the sea and because there are no problems with overflying other countries. The Atlantic is bordered by the 2 greatest industrial areas in the world.\r\n\r\nAscension is thus perfectly located to become the world's great Space Port.\r\n\r\nWhat is needed is the spending of a few hundred million on infrastructure - harbour, power station, some roads, world class Internet connections - and to set up the sort of low tax, minimal regulation regime that we have in the Bahamas, Guernsey, Hong Kong etc. and let the free market do its job.\r\n\r\nHaving a British ownership of the world's major access point to the immense riches space development will bring, not to mention low taxes on extreme wealth, would be of value.\r\n\r\n",
