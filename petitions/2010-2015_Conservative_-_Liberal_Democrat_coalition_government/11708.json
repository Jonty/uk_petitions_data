        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to prohibit councils and landlords from evicting those involved in the recent riots. It also asks the government to reject demands for convicted rioters to lose their benefits. It does this on the grounds that such actions are morally wrong, against human rights, will greatly damage the economic well being and future prospects of rioters AND their families, and will drive convicted rioters to commit futher crime due to their worsened economic situation. Such actions may in fact increase crime rates in certain communities.",
