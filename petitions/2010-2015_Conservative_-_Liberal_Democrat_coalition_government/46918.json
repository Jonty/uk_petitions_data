Some of them are basically disturbing & frighting images saying \"Like & Comment for the Angel, or ignore and the girl from 'The Exorcism' kills you in your sleep\". Also, there are photo's of grotesque injuries like a photo of a hand being sliced. Sickening. So I am calling the Government to force Facebook to moderate uploaded photos. People get traumatized from the photo's on Facebook. WE MUST MAKE THIS STOP!!!!",
