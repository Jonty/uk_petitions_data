        "additional_details": "It's Simple - The NHS is on its knees, underfunded, Staff moral low, all resources overstreched, therefore many mistakes are made unnecessarily some cost lives!. It should be a free services ONLY to the British tax payers who pay in + support the service, it goes too far to provide free service for everyone from anywhere in the world who comes through the doors, on holiday here, here illegally etc... It is a massive drain + its the tax payers of this country that lose out + suffer. Do the maths? something has to change! start charging at a private clinic/hospital rate, it certain circumstances + put some money back in this empty pot we cannot support everyone anymore. Even more crazy why should we pay in/contribute when anyone can come here + get it all for free, same goes for most public services in this country. Ludicrous we will soon be a bankrupt country as well, think we are well on our way already.",
