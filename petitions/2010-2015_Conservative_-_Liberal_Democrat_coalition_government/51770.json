        "additional_details": "To review and call for an increase in the 15 month sentence of Stuart Hall for sexual abuse crimes.  This is in the interest of the victims whose lives were changed irrevocably as a direct result of being sexually abused by Stuart Hall.\r\nHe robbed them of becoming the person that they would have been and gave them a life sentence of living with the consequences of being sexually abused and as such he should receive a sentence proportionate to this level of psychological damage.\r\nFurthermore it is in the interest of other victims of sexual abuse to see that these crimes will be viewed as abhorrent and that coming forward and undergoing the further ordeal of giving testimony will be acknowledged by appropriate sentencing.\r\nIt is morally repugnant to give a sentence that amounts to a few weeks per victim and this petition calls for a sentence that reflects the damage inflicted on victims and which conveys the message that sexual abuse will not be tolerated in our society.\r\n",

If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing.\r\n\r\nIt also only takes one person to make such a request. In the case of Stuart Hall, the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
