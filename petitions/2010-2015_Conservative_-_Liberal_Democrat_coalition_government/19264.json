        "additional_details": "Over the last few years Christmas advertising has started earlier and earlier. It has reached a point when you are seeing Christmas produce in the shops as earlier as August in some cases. I understand that a lot of stock is to be shifted but I feel Christmas should not be advertised in any form until 1st December, expect for Advent calenders for obvious reason (1 November).\r\n\r\nChristmas use to be a fesitival we all looked forward to and the end of a year at the darkest time of the year and now we begin to have it thrust in our faces when the weather if fine and the Autumn has not even begun. It is similar to seeing Easter eggs in the shops in January, which should also be banned until the beginning of March.\r\n\r\nPlease banned Christmas advertising, apart from Advent calenders (beginning of November), to the beginning of December. Also Easter, until the beginning of March.",
