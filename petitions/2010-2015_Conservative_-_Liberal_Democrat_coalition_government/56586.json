This appears to be a direct consequence of many vehicles being designed with dashboards which illuminate when the ignition key is inserted, regardless of whether the head or sidelights are activated.\r\n\r\nIf drivers cannot see their dashboard, they will know they have not switched their lights on.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be introduced to make it mandatory for all new vehicles to be designed with dashboard lighting which only activates when the side or headlights are activated.\r\n\r\nThis should eradicate what appears to be a growing trend of people driving at night without realising they do not have their vehicle lights on.
