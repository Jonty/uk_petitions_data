The answer is that they have all reportedly called for the legalisation of cannabis to be considered. The campaign has come a long way since it was first launched with a full-page advertisement in The Times in 1967.As cannabis is a Class B drug the police have the power to stop and search any person they believe have it on them. Theoretically stiff custodial sentences can be applied. In reality however, according to the Institute for the Study of Drug Dependency.\r\n\r\nThe use of cautioning increased dramatically from 1% of cases in 1981 to 45% of cases in 1992.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
