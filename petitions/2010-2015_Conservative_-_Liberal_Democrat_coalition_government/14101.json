        "additional_details": "We support growing calls for HMG to propose a climate deal based on Contraction & Convergence [C&C] at the UNFCCC, but urge it to negotiate the rate of convergence within C&C to equal per capita CO2 emissions entitlements globally. http://www.gci.org.uk/ http://www.candcfoundation.org/\r\nBy prescribing convergence by 2050, the \u2018Danish Text\u2019 alienated many nations at COP-15 because such slow convergence would give western nations free use of finite 'carbon space' which faster convergence would allocate to developing nations.  A 2009 Chinese paper, noting the Global Commons Institute proposed a range of convergence rates, argued that 'convergence of entitlements should occur immediately\u2019. http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/China_Research.pdf\r\n\r\nHMG can reconcile these positions by recalling support for C&C from India, Africa Group, China and USA at Kyoto (COP-3) and agreeing to negotiate for a faster rate of convergence to equal per capita emissions entitlements at COP-17.\r\n",
