        "additional_details": "The TV companies who broadcast live Premier League football matches (in doing so changing the dates and times of the games) are leaving it very late to do so. For example at the time of writing this (23/01/2014) the last fixtures for which TV coverage has been announced is 23/02/2014, the next round of fixtures (weekend of 01/03/2014) is less than 6 weeks away and no announcement has been made, or even indicated when one might be made.\r\nThe purpose of this petition is to make the UK government put pressure on the broadcasters and the Football Association to ensure that the games which are to be covered on TV are announced in good time (12 to 13 weeks ahead as a target) so that the match going fan, already spending a not insignificant amount of money on the match ticket itself are able to purchase travel tickets and book hotel accommodation at best value, in confidence that the match will take place when expected at the time of making these bookings.\r\n",
