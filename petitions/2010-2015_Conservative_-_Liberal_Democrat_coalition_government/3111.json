        "additional_details": "It's so upsetting seeing all these dogs in quarantine when the new regulations states it is now safe for dogs cats and ferrets to enter the UK without a blood test after 21 days coming in from EU COUNTIES.\r\n So why can't the new regulations come into force now, when DEFRA have proven it is safe.  WE DON'T want Rabies in this country, but when People like US have done everything required plus more by the new regulations that come in force on 1st January 2012, why our pets have to be the ones that miss out on a family life over here for six months.\r\nWE would be grateful if you could support US in this case to get our pets out of quarantine in the new 21 day rule.\r\n\r\nSO PLEASE SIGN",
