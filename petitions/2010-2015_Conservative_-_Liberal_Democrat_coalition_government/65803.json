I am not alone - out of the 8 friends I know who use them, 6 have stopped all together and the other two still use e-cigs but have never touched tobacco since. They have the potential to be one of the greatest inventions or discoveries for health since penicillin. Please don't doom thousands of people to early death just because of tax, do not ban these miracle gadgets!",
