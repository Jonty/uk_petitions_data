It's about time we take a stand and ban all Pin heads from the starting XI and not allow them to play until they grow either grow hair or get a wig, I'm sick and tired of seeing these hairless excuses of men running around and costing us points. I would also like you to ban Pin head refs (Howard Webb) as they constantly go against us.",
