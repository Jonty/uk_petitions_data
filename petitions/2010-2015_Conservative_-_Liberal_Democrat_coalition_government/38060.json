        "additional_details": "For too long now annoying Liverpudlian Sheila Fogarty has been allowed to pollute the airways with her small-minded attitude and frightening sense of humour. We need to stop her. Few radio presenters have reached the annoying, cloying and condescending levels of drivel  that Shelagh manages EVERY MINUTE SHE IS ON AIR. She scares me. If you have heard her on 5Live I am sure she scares you too. So join me. I have made cakes in preparation for our victory. I would like David Cameron to make Nick Clegg make the Lib Dems join the Tories in banning Shelagh from talking on any public medium for ever and ever amen. Thanks for listening.",
