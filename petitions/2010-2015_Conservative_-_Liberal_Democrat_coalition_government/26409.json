        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron has proposed a minimum price for alcohol. This policy has been tried in the Nordic countries to extreme, and while it deters the majority from drinking excessive quantities, there are still as many problem drinkers - binge drinkers and alcoholics, whose financial plight is made worse.\r\n\r\nThis measure will penalise the sensible, but not solve the root problems of health problems caused by EXCESS alcohol, bad social behaviour, and alcohol-related accidents/injuries.\r\n\r\nThe solutions to the problem lie elsewhere: education, licensing hours and regulations, policing and restoration of (indeed an increase of!) the budget for the alcohol/drug dependence services.\r\n\r\n(This petition is therefore not limited in scope to the Department of Health, but also covers Education and Home Office)",
