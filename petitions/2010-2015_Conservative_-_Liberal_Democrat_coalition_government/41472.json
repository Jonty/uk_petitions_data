I call upon the government to give serious consideration to disbanding the BBC and splitting it up and selling it off to the private sector.\r\n\r\nThis would raise an absolute forturne for public funds which are sorely needed in the current economic climate.\r\n\r\nPlease lend your support to this petition and sign it. Thank you.",
