        "additional_details": "I want an urgent reform of the benefits system. People arriving from other countries, unless they are asylum seekers and in danger, should be entitled to nothing until they have paid taxes in the uk for min 5 years. No benefits should be claimed for children who don't reside in the uk.\r\nBenefits for the unemployed, or those at home with children, should earn no more than minimum wage- the same as many hard working families have to survive on. Benefits for those who are fit and able to work will only be paid on completion, and evidence of, community service (I.e litter collection, painting etc). Let's stop the scrounges and the laziness at the root if our society. Let's make Britain great again instead of merely a free ride and laughing stock for the rest of the world. Reduced benefits for foreigners will take pressure off our public services and allow us who actually pay for it to benefit from where our taxes go instead of the free riders having all the benefit. ( literally!)",
