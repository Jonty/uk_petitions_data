        "additional_details": "I am petitioning the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister to cut off foreign aid to any country where our Embassies, Consulates and other Diplomatic Posts are attacked.\r\n\r\nI just read online that the US, UK and German Embassies in Sudan were attacked. Following on from the tragic events in the US Embassy in Benghazi, Libya and unrest at the US Egyptian Cairo mission.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how much Foreign Aid these countries get from us but I'm sure it is a lot, the next time any of our Embassies is breached then the UK Government should stop all Foreign Aid payments. That will encourage the host Country to mount serious protection outside them and protect our Diplomats who in turn look after us when we are abroad and assist these countries in maintaining essential and beneficial relations with our Country.\r\n",
