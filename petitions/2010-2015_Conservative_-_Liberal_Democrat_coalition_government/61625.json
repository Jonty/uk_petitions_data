        "additional_details": "We believe that gun laws in the U.K. are not tight enough. In 2011/2012 according to The Parliamentary Library , approximately 170,000 people were affected by gun crime in the U.K. but according to Government statistics, this figure could be up to 60% more.\r\n\r\nOne area of the law we think needs strengthening, is that under the 1979 Customs and Excise Act section 170(2), if you smuggle guns into the U.K. you could get away with only a \u00a32500 fine and six weeks in prison.\r\n\r\nWe want this changed. We want a higher fine or sentence to act as more of a deterrent for gun crime. If you agree, please sign this petition.\r\n",
