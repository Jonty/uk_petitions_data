        "additional_details": "The retail price of petrol and diesel has inceased over several years not only in this governments time in office. For every 1p increase per litre the government profits in tax by 500 million pounds per year. Since 2007 prices have increased  by at least 30p per litre.\r\nThat is approximately 500 x 30 x 5 =`75.000 million pounds. An astronomical amount of money even if maths are estimated. I would petition to find out where all that extra revenue has gone over the years.",
