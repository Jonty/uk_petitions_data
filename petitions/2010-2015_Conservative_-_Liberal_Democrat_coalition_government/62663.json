Nothing that we talk about or 'threaten' foreign powers with means anything to them any more, as has been evinced by Putin over the past week or so and is regularly pointed out to us by Robert Mugabe in his continued uninterrupted cruel abuse of citizens of his land who suffer because there is no oil under their feet.  There is a vast amount which is abjectly wrong with this country which you should be spending time discussing at times when the people can witness it.  If there is insufficient homeland activity to keep you occupied during PMQs then it is an ideal time to make huge numbers of redundancies from elected and non- elected members of the Palace of Westminster - such activity will also help significantly to reduce the national debt.",
