        "additional_details": "As aesthetic surgery becomes increasingly popular, proper patient selection becomes even more important to the entire surgery process. Aesthetic surgery is unique because, unlike any other surgical procedure, it is initiated by the patient and not the physician. In addition, this surgery elicits a more acute reaction from its patients than any other type of surgery.\r\nBefore agreeing to operate, a surgeon must evaluate the psychological condition of a patient.\r\nA report by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death found many centres in the UK offering cosmetic surgery were failing to assess and care for patients properly, including psychological evaluations.\r\nWe call upon the government to implement mandatory psychological screening for invasive elective aesthetic surgery procedures.\r\n",
