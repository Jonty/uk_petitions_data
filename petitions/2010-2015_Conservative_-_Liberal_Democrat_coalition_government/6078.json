        "additional_details": "Raising tuition fees to \u00a39,000 per year will discourage many of the bright but poorer students from attending universities in order to avoid high levels of student debt. It will also encourage students to either boycott English universities and study in other European countries, or get an education in England then move to another country to avoid paying their student debt. Consequently the Government should reduce the maximum universities can charge for tuition fees down to \u00a31,500 per year.",
