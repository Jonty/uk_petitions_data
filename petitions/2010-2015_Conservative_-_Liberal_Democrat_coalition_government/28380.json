With the recent riots nationwide youth have had a bad press - there are many young people who have a lot to offer society so why not let them have their own parliament where their ideas can be submitted to Parliament as are epetitions - I am sure they will come up with ideas our older politicians would never think of - This would be a boost to David Cameron's Big Society idea",
