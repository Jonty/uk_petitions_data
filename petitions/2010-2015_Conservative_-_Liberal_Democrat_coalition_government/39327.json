        "additional_details": "Estate agency fees are at an all time high despite public complaints about estate agents also being at a peak. The internet is making property search easier however sellers are still largely confined to using the big property portals via traditional, expensive estate agents. The average home seller pays over \u00a33000 to sell their home. This is an unjustifiably excessive amount and, if far lower, would encourage more sellers to move and would provide greater equity in their homes thus allowing lower asking prices. This would assist buyers in buoying the market. ",
