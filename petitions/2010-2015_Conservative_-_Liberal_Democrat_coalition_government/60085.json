        "additional_details": "From 1949 until 1968 the UK had an organisation that was trained, equipped and able to assist the population in the event of a major disaster, the Civil Defence Corps. Primarily this was preparation for WWIII, but it also proved valuable in incidents like the East Anglian floods and the Aberfan Disaster. It was virtually completely a volunteer organisation. The Government should consider re-forming the Corps to assist in coping with events such as the widespread flooding of 2013/14.",
