        "additional_details": "After my first(and last) visit to a greyhound racing site, doing my research and discovering what I have discovered I truly believe a ban needs to be put on greyhound racing\r\n\r\nEvery year countless greyhounds are exploited for profit in the name of ''entertainment'' & consequently sentenced to a brutal death. In the UK alone at least 40,000 greyhounds are disposed of every year by the racing industry.\r\n\r\nExtremely cruel methods such as drowning, shooting & beating are commonplace. Pictures of dead & injured dogs from my research have stuck in my head, along with the knowledge that people really can be that cruel & greedy. I strongly suggest you all look into this although a strong stomach is a must.\r\n\r\nThousands of puppies that fail the grade are routinely killed. The ''lucky'' dogs end up being abandoned but with little hope of finding a home even though greyhounds are naturally docile, affectionate dogs and, given the chance, make wonderful pets.\r\n\r\n",
