There is a lot of hype on how the government is helping by keeping the price of a pint affordable in British pubs.\r\n\r\nIt happened in last year\u2019s budget of 2013-2014 where beer duty was cut by 1p of a pint of beer and this reduction was not reflected in any of the pubs I visited. This year\u2019s budget 2014-2015 the same decision has been made to reduce the beer tax again by 1p. I believe this will again not be passed onto the customer. I therefore propose that a 2p reduction be made in April 2014, funded by the organisations that have kept this saving, and that it truly reflected in the price of a pint at the point of sale.\r\n",
