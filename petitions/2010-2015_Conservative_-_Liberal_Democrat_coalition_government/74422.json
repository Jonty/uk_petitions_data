Although I myself and thousands of others are against puppy farms, I believe that we should lift the ban and open registered, trained, healthy breeding farms for these dogs including a homing centre. Where people can come and give these loving dogs a loving home as long as they are neutered or spayed to stop the breeding and fighting and should also carry out criminal checks on buyers to prevent these dogs getting into the wrong hands\r\n\r\nBLAME THE DEED, NOT THE BREED!",
