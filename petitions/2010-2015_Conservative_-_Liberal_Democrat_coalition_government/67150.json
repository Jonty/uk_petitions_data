        "additional_details": "Please could you build a new rail line from Preston to Southport (but not on the old line that was closed in 1964 that is as it has being built on with houses and roads etc), i thought of proposing a new line from the South of New Longton/North of Midge Hall where it angle bends off the Ormskirk Line as it looks curve-ish as shown on a map, first the line goes trough fields between Much Hoole/Bretherton, second a new station around Bank Bridge or Liverpool Road in Tarleton, third the line goes between Mere Brow/Holmeswood, then the line goes on towards Southport, connecting onto Southport to Wigan Line at Blowick and then onto Meols Cop, this allows a direct rail route from Preston to Southport without having to change at Wigan or Bolton.",
