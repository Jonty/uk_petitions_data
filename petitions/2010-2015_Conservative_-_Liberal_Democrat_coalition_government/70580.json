        "additional_details": "This petition is to force petrol stations around the country to adopt a practice used in the USA that will stop the crime of \"Bilking\" which is filling up with petrol or diesel then driving off without paying. In the USA you actually go to the kiosk and pay the attendant an amount of money for the fuel, then you go and fill up. If you use the exact amount given to the attendant then you get a receipt from the pump. If you haven't the you go back to the kiosk where you pick up your change. If this practice is adopted then this crime will be eradicated.",
