It is only by looking at the full implication of what went on and examining whether a cover up took place that we will be able to protect children from this sort of behaviour in the future.  The inquiry should report on\r\nwhat took place,\r\nwho knew it was taking place\r\nwhy prosecutions were not made\r\nIt should make recommendations on cases that should be investigated with a view to prosecution.\r\nIt should make recommendations on future measures necessary to safeguard children from this sort of abuse ",
