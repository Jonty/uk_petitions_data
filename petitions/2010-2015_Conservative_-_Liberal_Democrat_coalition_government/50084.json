        "additional_details": "Fifteen years after release from prison convicted paedophiles now have the right to to go to court and try to get their name removed from the sex offenders register even when police have recommended that they should not.Their have been some recent cases where this has happend on the basis of the paedophiles human rights.Once off the register they are allowed to go on holiday and move home without any checks and yearly visits by the police are stopped thus giving them free reign.I think that the human rights of the victims who are children  should come first.I want the government to remove the right of convicted paedophiles from having the right to have thier names removed from the register.
