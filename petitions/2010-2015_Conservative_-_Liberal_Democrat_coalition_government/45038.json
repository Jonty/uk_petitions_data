This can have an effect on patient care.\r\n\r\nIn America, the Sunshine Act requires drug companies to declare all doctors and hospitals they have given any goods or services over the value of $10 (or multiple gifts below $10 each if the total value of all of them is greater than $100).\r\n\r\nInteractions between doctors and drug companies can be beneficial, and can lead to new medical advances. It is in everyone's interests that those interactions are transparent, and that patients are able to see them.\r\n\r\nA law requiring the declaration of all gifts and services over \u00a310 would help give that transparency.",
