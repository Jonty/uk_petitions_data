        "additional_details": "As we exit the world cup 2014 from pitiful management, Roy Hodgson should not be kept on as England manager, playing so defensively when we have a great attacking team. Liverpool play offensively and came second in the league scoring many goals and England could have done the same having so many players from Liverpool FC. No he didn't do that and after losing 2-1 against Italy he stayed with the same team and lost 2-1 against Uruguay, made late substitutions which couldn't change the game.\r\n\r\nIn closing Roy Hodgson has cost the country and it's economy billions going out in the first round and is just inexcusable. We need a manager who is willing to attack and take the England squad to a final not someone who is \"going to try his hardest\". We don't need a mediocre manager we need a great manager. We, the English, actually want to qualify for Euro 2016.\r\n\r\nSave England, Sack Hodgson",
