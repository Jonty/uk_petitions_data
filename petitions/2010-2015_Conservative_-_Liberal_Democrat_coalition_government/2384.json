We do not want to hear loud unsavoury, distressing, unsociable, inconsiderate noise (often bad music) on the buses, trains or public buildings. Someone\u2019s music is someone else\u2019s poor taste in music and such inconsiderate distressing hullabaloo racket should be stopped in enclosed public spaces.\r\n",
