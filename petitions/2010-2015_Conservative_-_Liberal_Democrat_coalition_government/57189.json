I'd suggest making them free so more people have a chance to improve grades and have a better chance for better jobs. People should only pay if they choose to go into college to be taught by a teacher.\r\n\r\nPeople can't afford to pay for courses on minimum wages especially if you have children.  Even if it was a one off payment of \u00a350 to sit the exam at a college the money the government could make back in taxes of people in higher paid jobs would make it worth it.",
