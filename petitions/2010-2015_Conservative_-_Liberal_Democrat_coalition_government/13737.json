        "additional_details": "I seek the mandate of parliament to instruct the Secretary of State for Energy to renationalise all energy generation & transmition equipment and operations in the UK so as it may be placed in a charitable trust. This non profit energy sector would first allow for a vast reduction in the cost of energy to all, reducing bills & levels of fuel poverty instead of lining the pockets of a privileged. Then any available \"profit\" could then also be used to invest in the rapid development of newer, more efficient technologies and to upgrade the ageing networks leading to a 21st century energy sector providing for the needs of the nation and not the needs of the select few share holders.
