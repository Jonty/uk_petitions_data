        "additional_details": "I as an unemployed 30 year old through no fault of my own left school with hardly any qualifications, I wasn't good at school. Many in my age group tell me there was no help after school with minimal grades, I would like to see more effort put into helping the 25's and over back into work, by either on-site training or an apprentiship, I would love to learn a trade and work but most of the jobs I've applied for have a 18-24 limit Apprentiship and need minimum of 5 Gcse's or Experience. I cannot get experience when no one will give me a chance. Over 30's normally have a family to support and are more likely to stay with a job they are trained in.      ",
