        "additional_details": "In my opinion the legal age of drinking alcohol is too low and should be increased to a higher age such as 20 or 21 mainly because people at the age of 18 have become more immature. I'm not trying to be stereotypical but recently i have been noticing the lack of respect and the immaturity of them has increased. This behaviour is noticibly caused by the consumption of alcohol. Also the legal age of being able to drive clashes with the age of legally consuming alcohol. This could lead to an increase in drink driving. ",
