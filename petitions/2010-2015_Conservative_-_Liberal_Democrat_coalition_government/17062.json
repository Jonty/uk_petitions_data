        "additional_details": "It is blatently obvious that violent crime in the UK has reached an all time high. We now have a society where it is normal for people to carry knives and guns without fear of the police of prison as jail terms are so short.\r\n\r\nIn interviews, reformed criminals themselves admit that prison sentances are too short. Should criminals not be afraid of going to prison? If so, why do we have a prison system whereby prisons are full? Obviously there is no fear of prison in the minds of offenders.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to make changes to the law as outlined by David Cameron himself during his election speaches to stop offences from occuring and if they do then the offender should truely pay for what he/she has done via a longer prison sentence.
