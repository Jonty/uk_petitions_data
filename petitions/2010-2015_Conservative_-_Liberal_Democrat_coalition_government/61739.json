        "additional_details": "The Oliver Close Estate and other roads surrounding the Leyton Orient Football Club have faced the issue of parking for many years now with the only alternative being to pay for permits which is another expense local residents could do without. The council has added new housing developments making it difficult for residents to find parking on any given day but parking has been made impossible on match days for those of us returning after fans have already arrived. This e-petition has been set up to show the frustation of the local community and to make a formal request for the council to deal with the issue. The petition is not for annual permits but only to address match days specifically. ",
