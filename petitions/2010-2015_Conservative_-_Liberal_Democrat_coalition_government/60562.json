        "additional_details": "As the horse community we all assumed out horses were safe and can be returned if ever lost or stolen. Unfortunately this is not the case, my pony was sadly hit by a car and I was never informed even after calling Surrey Police 5 times and reporting him stolen. I then, as well of thousands of other well-wishers and supporters, spent 2 days searching for him, putting up posters and sharing on social networks. I found out by my vet calling around the local slaughter houses. He did not deserve to be thrown on a pile of horses and burnt without my permission. I would have had him cremated and brought home! All this hope and heart ache could have been avoided if a simple microchip scan had been done either by the police or the slaughter house. Millions of horse owners pay to have their horses chipped as it is a legal requirement to me it is a false security net and a money making scheme, where does the money go? ",
