        "additional_details": "Public transport into and around London is unreliable and hinders the efficient conduct of business. Government Ministers, however, have unlimited access to chauffeur driven cars (sometimes with police outriders), adding to congestion and pollution.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed that all Government Ministers should be made to use public transport for all their travel to and within London at least one day per week, so that they can fully understand the problems faced by the taxpayers who fund their salaries and expenses. It is hoped that this will encourage Ministers to take action to improve transport into and around London.",
