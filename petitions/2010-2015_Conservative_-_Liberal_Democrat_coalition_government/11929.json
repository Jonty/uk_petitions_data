Don't punish the genuine claimants who have worked hard all of their lives, who have a job to return to. This is wrong and unfair, remove this clause and allow them to keep their ESA benefit until their GP states they are fit to return to work. Those who have proof that their job remains open for them should keep their benefit until fit (within reason of course, i.e. if they've had or are awaiting surgery)\r\n",
