She would spend time there with her family playing, exploring nature and collecting pine cones for the squirrels.\r\n\r\nBuckinghamshire Council say they no longer allow new memorial benches at the park. I want them to make an exception for a very special little girl.  It was more than just a park to Amelia it was the foundation for her imagination and stories.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and spread the word of our Woo!\r\n",
