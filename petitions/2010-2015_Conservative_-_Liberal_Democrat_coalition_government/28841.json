Government make and opt for the rules we are following but dare i ask Mr Cameron or Mr Duncan Smith when was the last time they had to use the child support agency? or claim child benefit? And did the system work for them? I am doubtful. We need a more effiecient CSA and with the aid of banks, police, more staffing and tougher punishments i am sure we as a state and society will reap the benefits!!",
