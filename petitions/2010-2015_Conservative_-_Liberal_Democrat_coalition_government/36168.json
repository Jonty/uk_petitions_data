        "additional_details": "Over the past decade or so, the behaviour of a minority of trouble makers at music concerts and festivals seems to have become increasingly bad natured, and of a far more criminal nature. The throwing of human waste, fighting, assault, stabbings, drug abuse and heavy intoxication are matters which appear to be going largely unpoliced. We demand that tighter security rules are brought in at such events, especially for dealing with people throwing urine at other members of the public, as this must surely pose a dangerous health threat.",
