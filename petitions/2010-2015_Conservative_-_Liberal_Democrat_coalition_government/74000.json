        "additional_details": "Chiari malformation, also known as arnold chiari malformation  is a condition where the lower parts of your brain have been pushed downwards towards the spinal cord, so they are below the entrance to your skull. This condition causes pressure at the base of the brain and can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CFS) to the brain, also has horrible symptoms that people suffer on a day to day basis. This is a serious disease and needs to be classed as a disability so people dont have to fight to get help with income when we have to come out of work or cant work because of this condition. This would help so many people and actually spread the awreness of how serious this condition is! ",
