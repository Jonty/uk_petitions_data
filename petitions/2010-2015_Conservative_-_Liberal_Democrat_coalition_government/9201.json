It would involve the devolution of all powers away from Westminster to each substituent country of the United Kingdom, leaving Defence and Foreign Policy remaining with a central UK Government.\r\nThe UK Government would be headed by a Prime Minister elected by every Member of Parliament from each of the separate parliaments of the United Kingdom.\r\nA new English Government would have to be set up dealing with English policies. Welsh, Irish and Scottish policies would be transferred to their respective governments.\r\nThere would be First Ministers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland elected only by the people in their respective countries. Each of the aforementioned countries would have its own parliament, make its own rules and have its own elections.\r\nThere could also be a possibility of the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories to become part of a Federal UK.\r\n",
