        "additional_details": "Funding for transport for  16-18 year olds has been axed. However it is a legal requirement that children stay in education until their 18th birthday. As a consequence of these new transport funding cuts it is going to cost around \u00a3600 per year to travel to the education venue. This is absolutely disgraceful and we need to stop it as it is discriminating against people in rural areas where there isn't a education venue to suite all ages! Education is meant to be free therefore transport to it should be funded. Young adults are always a topic of discussion in the media as they aren't getting jobs but if parents cannot afford to pay for transport to education it will stop the person from getting qualifications that could lead to a job.
