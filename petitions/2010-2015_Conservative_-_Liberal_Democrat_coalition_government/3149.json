All these companies should be \"forced\" to return those customer service jobs back to the UK to create more jobs. A good incentive will a tax rebate for companies that comply and a higher taxes levied on companies that do not. These tax rebates would be recovered through employee taxes and contributions. There is chance the UK can gain more than 100,000 jobs through this programme. These jobs should also be equitably distributed across the length and breath of the country including rural areas as most of the UK is now telephone and internet ready. Parliament should look seriously into this.   ",
