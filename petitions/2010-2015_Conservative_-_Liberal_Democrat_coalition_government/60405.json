        "additional_details": "Dentists are the professionals qualified to prescribe and treat patients for teeth whitening.\r\nThere are European laws in place to ensure that the peroxide doesn't exceed 16%.\r\n\r\nEbay are allowing sellers to promote teeth whitening kits that way above the legal limits with some as much as 45% peroxide. It even states on some of the listings to consult a dentist if you plan on using the product to treat a child.\r\n\r\nThis is extremely dangerous and must be stopped.\r\n\r\nBy signing this petition, we are asking the Government to ensure that Ebay stop users selling teeth whitening kits.",
