        "additional_details": "We are 4 students who are hoping to improve the road safety of the Horsham area near both Millais, school for girls and Forest, school for boys, by placing a zebra crossing on Orchard Road. Every day students are having for wait patiently for 3-5 minutes to cross Orchard Road (off the Highlands Road junction) and are experiencing near misses with fast moving traffic. Our aim is to prevent any serious accidents from occurring in the near future. We would greatly appreciate any support to make our wish possible. ",
