        "additional_details": "Former soldier Frank Rice, 49, from Wakefield, requires a ventilator to breathe after being taken ill with pneumonia while on holiday in the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is costing a $4,000 a day, but Mr Rice\u2019s relatives say his travel insurer has refused to pay the medical bills because he failed to disclose he was suffering from a lung condition when he bought his holiday cover.\r\n\r\nMr Rice\u2019s daughter Ashleigh, 19, said he had been in hospital since October 8 and doctors had to resuscitate him after he was taken off the ventilator temporarily.\r\n\r\nShe said the total cost of his treatment had already reached $29,000 and it could cost up to \u00a3100,000 to fly him home. The family has planned fundraising events including a sponsored walk and collections at rugby matches.\r\n\r\nWe want help from the British Embassy who have so far let the family down. ",
