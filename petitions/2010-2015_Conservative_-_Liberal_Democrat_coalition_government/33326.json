We want to bring 4G LTE to the UK as soon as possible, by allowing mobile operators to use existing spectrum for 4G LTE services and ensure the auction and release of new spectrum for 4G LTE is not delayed any further.\r\nAs an individual, you will benefit from faster mobile speeds.\r\n\r\n4G is significantly delayed in the UK.  The auction and release of new spectrum for 4G LTE services is behind schedule, threatening to make the UK among the last in Europe to rollout 4G LTE.\r\nhttp://www.ofcom.org.uk/about/what-is-ofcom/statutory-duties-and-regulatory-principles/\r\n",
