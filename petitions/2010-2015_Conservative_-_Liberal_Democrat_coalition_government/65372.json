Taxes are paid every month to ensure that health care is received free irrespective of wealth, status, class, gender, race,age and sex and at the point of need.\r\n\r\nBritish citizens appreciate and love this service.\r\n\r\nWhy are fees now being suggested when they were rejected in 1948/49 when the NHS was founded? For one of the richest nations in the world it seems odd if fees to visit your GP / doctor were re-introduced. Say NO to fees for visiting your GP.",
