        "additional_details": "We ask that the government restricts party donations to individuals and introduces an appropriate maximum annual contribution restriction.\r\n\r\nIn the long term, political parties can maintain their relevance only if they are required by those who vote for them. There is therefore no place for taxpayer subsidies to political parties.\r\n\r\nCorporate donations to political parties can have no direct relevance to political processes because they neither represent the political beliefs of a voter nor healthy for parties who are representing the people.\r\n\r\nVoters should be encouraged to donate to a political party of their choice. Political parties, trades unions and other organisations should be encouraged to promote party donations amongst their members so long as those members remain free to donate to the party of their choice.\r\n\r\nA process of enabling secure donations to political parties should be introduced and a regular audit conducted to ensure compliance with the donation rules.",
