        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand a limit to the number of social housing tenancies which may be provided following eviction. Currently, if a person is evicted from social housing then they still have the right to free accommodation and the problem is simply moved-on to the next neighbourhood. We argue that once a tenant has been removed from 3 properties by the authorities they have lost the privilege of social housing and must take responsibility for themselves. ",
