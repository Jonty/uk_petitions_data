        "additional_details": "This petition is for the closure of Guantanamo bay and a fair trial given to all detainees.\r\n\r\nGuantanamo Bay is a prison in Cuba that was set up by the USA in January 2002 to try to combat terrorism as a result of the act of terror on the USA on the 11th September 2001.  In Guantanamo bay, there are some human rights abuses and deprivations that are going on, for example, many of the prisoners there are denied their right to a free trial, and of the mere 7 prisoners that have had a trial and were convicted, 5 of them pleaded guilty in court due to pre-trial agreements \u2013 and these trials did not even meet the standards that a true fair trial has. The other people detained there have never been charged, tried or convicted of a criminal offence, and this in itself is illegal. The prisoners in Guantanamo are suffering immensely, and staying in the prison has given many arthritis - with alot of other medical conditions too.\r\n\r\nSources: http://www.amnesty.org.uk/guantanamo-bay-human-rights",
