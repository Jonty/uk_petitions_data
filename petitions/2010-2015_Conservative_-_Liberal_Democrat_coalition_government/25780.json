This petition proposes to introduce licensing stages which restricts allowable car engine sizes for the first 3 years of a licensable driver.\r\neg. Year 1 - impose a 1.0 litre maximum; Year 2 - 1.4litre; Year 3 - 1.6litre upwards. At each yearly anniversary, application has be made and a fee paid to 'upgrade' license if required.\r\nThis would reduce accidents and raise funding via the upgrading process.",
