        "additional_details": "We petition the Government to privatise the BBC and scrap the TV licence fee.\r\nThe licence fee model for the funding of the BBC is outdated. It was established when TV was in its infancy and the BBC was the only broadcaster and needed such funding to establish the TV medium. Today there are many alternatives to the BBC and other ways of consuming \"television\". People have a choice, and may choose not to watch the BBC. The licence fee also acts as a ring fence for BBC funding in these times of austerity. ",
