        "additional_details": "The tube map currently refers to the orange line as the East London Line or The London Overground Line. However, neither is suitable as Londoners refer to all overground trains as 'the overground' and the line has now extended all across South London and North London so East London Line is no longer suitable. Therefore, we the undersigned believe that the line should be renamed 'The Ken Livingstone Line' in honour of our brilliant former Mayor, the man who instrumental in ensuring this quietly efficient line was built and successful.",
