When it\u2019s raining and add the road mist is factored in people in other vehicles often can\u2019t see you. This is particularly the case on motorways and A roads.\r\n\r\nThis petition therefore calls for the following simple law to be passed in the UK:\r\n\r\n\"If you switch your wipers on (even to intermittent) then you must also switch on your dipped headlights.\"\r\n\r\nThis simple measure can reduce road casualties and improve road safety.\r\n\r\nSee and be seen.",
