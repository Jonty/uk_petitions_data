        "additional_details": "As we all know people drive really fast down the molesey road, hersham especially the skip lorry drivers! I am so surprised that considering there are three schools and a nursery as well as jumping jacks that there are no appropriate crossings and the ones that are there have great big trees in front of them. This road was deemed un safe for the lolly pop lady who used to cross the cardinal Newman children so why is it safe for our children to cross? Ii would like to see speed bumps and a suitable crossing for our children and pets.",
