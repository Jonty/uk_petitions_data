        "additional_details": "To get those who claim benefit is more beneficial than working I say that the government must push harder for an individual/family to seek work or lose benefits within a structured timeframe. Take any job available paying minimum wage or better and come off all benefits. They could then receive a salary top up (a benefit in essence) as a percentage of the claimant\u2019s wage (say 70/30 split) to keep the standard of living at the same or a slightly higher rate. This would reduce the amount the government would need to pay to an individual, increase productivity and contribute to the growth of economy. Main aims to reduce government spending, promote self esteem and pride as individuals earning a living. ",
