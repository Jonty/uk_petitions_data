It is usually 15 year old girls that I see riding horses on the road, if I drive past one (carefully) and the horse spooks then I will be held responsible! If I drove past another car and the other driver got scared, well that's his own fault.\r\n\r\n4. There is no age limit! Driving is MUCH safer. Even scooters require basic training, insurance, tax and an age limit.\r\n\r\n5.Most of the time there is a field there and a horse riding on the tarmac next to it. If you own a horse then as far as I am concerned one of the associated costs should be owning or having access to land for it to exercise. If you cannot afford the land, you cannot afford the upkeep of a horse. .\r\n\r\n\r\n",
