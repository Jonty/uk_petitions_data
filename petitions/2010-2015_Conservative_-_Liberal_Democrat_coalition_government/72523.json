        "additional_details": "Trees are commonly illegally felled as perpetrators knowingly accept the probability of a fine. It is a crime to illegally fell a tree but few are deterred by the current punishment. Many choose to fell in order to build on land, and will happily take the fine as it proves a very small amount in relation to the possible gains of development.\r\nStronger fines or indeed prison sentencing, will help to uphold the current Tree Preservation Orders which are routinely ignored.\r\nSpecifically to London, trees are vital in our carbon reduction and more must be done to preserve our tree population.
