        "additional_details": "We Hereby petition the government to create legislation whereby employers are required by law to list any non-internal vacancies with the Job Centre.\r\n\r\nThis petition has been rejected on a number of occasions on the basis that \"Advertising vacancies is a commercial decision\". This is no more of a commercial decision than choosing employees wages (which are regulated through minimum wage). This petition is not intended to interfere in any commercial decisions, but to create legislation to regulate these decisions.\r\n\r\nFor unemployed people searching for work, there is a tremendous amount of different websites, and job finding agencies where posts may be listed. Therefore very few positions are actually listed with the Job Centre.\r\n\r\nBy making it compulsory for employers to list any vacancies with the Job Centre, workers have one national website to find work. Thus making the search for employment far more simplified.\r\n\r\nOne website, every job in the country",
