Not only do they replicate much of the duties and responsibilities of the devolved administrations in these countries but they are also delaying the kind of State that is emerging in the British Isles.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Prime Minister of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should also be abolished. It too is a function of the present Ascendancy in the Islands of the English. The Leader of the Biggest Party in England should simply be First Minister for England and the Leadership of the British a Collective Affair for the First Ministers for England, Scotland, Wales and reunited and restored Ireland.\r\n",
