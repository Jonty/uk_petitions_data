        "additional_details": "The Government must create an independent expert dog team to investigate fatalities and serious attacks.\r\nThe breeding, training, neutering status and persons present plus the reactivity of the dog involved in an attack are things that, if investigated could lead to stopping more attacks.\r\nDEFRA have been asked about this, as have the Police and none feel that this is necessary.  They feel the current laws are adequate, even though these do not allow for assessment of the dog.\r\nAs a behaviourist, I do believe it is necessary. A team of dog behaviourists, Police, Vets and other appropriate professionals should be called in to assess the dog, and the family or owners as soon as is suitable.\r\nUnless access is given to these dogs by people who understand that poor breeding, lack of training, sold too early and much more affects behaviour, more will die.\r\nPlease support this petition and share with friends.  If we get at least 100,000 signatures, we can ask for Parliamentary debate.",
