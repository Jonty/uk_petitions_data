        "additional_details": "This petition seeks to protect the sovereign rights of England and Wales by seeking to ensure that any and all legislation, or directives, from Brussels become required by law to be debated fully in our Parliament and cannot be \"pre-approved\" via treaties or agreements prior to any implmentation into law.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the decision of Parliament must reign supreme in all such decisions and votes (which is not currently the situation). ie power will be restored to Parliament.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this petition seeks to protect English and Welsh subjects from non-democratic processes originating from Brussels that at present do not mandate Parliament to debate in order to protect its citizens.\r\n",
