We should concentrate our money within the UK until we have sorted our own issues before handing out to Countries that oppose our way of life. India and Pakistan have their own Nuclear Weapons Facilities and Space Programs so why do we send them British money when we cant even House our Ex Service Men and Women and every year Lose many of our Elderly due to Cold because they cant afford to heat nor feed themselves in some instances. Sort out our own House Before sorting out other Peoples. ",
