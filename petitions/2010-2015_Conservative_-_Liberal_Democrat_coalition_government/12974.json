        "additional_details": "A petition to encourage health officials to introduce cheaper and more mole clinics in all parts of the uk!\r\n\r\nGps should make it routine to check for abnormal moles on high risk parents. They should also introduce mole scanning in most gp surgeries or Introduce cheaper mole check clinics that are evenly spread through out each county so no one should have to travel far for a deserved health treatment.\r\n\r\nCurrent stats from the British Association of Dermatologists state that 2500 people die of melanoma each year and we need to fight to bring these figures down!\r\n\r\nWe need quick diagnosis - not the usual 6 weeks waiting for a result!\r\n\r\nWe also need prevention with regular checks and bigger sun health campaigns!\r\n\r\nSign the petition to make things happen and save more lives!!\r\n",
