A modern National Service will provide a service to the nation, instill some discipline into people, give them a work ethic and some skills.\r\nUnless young people are in University, or apprenticed, then they should be required to serve.\r\nIt is not necessary to do this on 'military' lines, but it should include discipline and requirements to carry out valuable work to benefit the nation.",
