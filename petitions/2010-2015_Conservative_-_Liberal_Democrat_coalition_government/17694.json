        "additional_details": "We can produce unlimited low cost modular housing, mass produced in factories and brought to site. .\r\n\r\nHouse prices have gone up 4 times, compared to the retail price index, over a century. There is no technological reason for this, so 75% of all housing prices are government regulation.\r\n\r\nDebate ending the power to make minor changes instead giving type approval; allowing people to build anywhere except on land specifically limited by Parliament - limited to 50% of the country; guaranteeing a minimum price of \u00a320,000 on each of the 1st 20,000 houses - reassuring banks which must put up the capital to start the industry.\r\n\r\nIt can be read in full on http://a-place-to-stand.blogspot.com/search?q=balanced+budget+amendment - the rest of it is basically legalese defining GNP, inflation and years so that the lawyers can't wriggle out of it.",
