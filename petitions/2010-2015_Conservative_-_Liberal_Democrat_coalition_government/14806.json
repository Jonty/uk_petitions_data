        "additional_details": "Following the August Riots there is a worrying rhetoric emerging about the use of social media and possible moves to restrict or block access to these services at times of civil unrest.\r\n\r\nIf we are to be world leaders in civil liberties and human rights, the freedom of communication via any means and an individuals right to freedom of speech has to be extended in law to protect the use of social media and any future communication channel that might become available.\r\n\r\nAny move to restrict or block access to these channels not only supresses our freedom of speech but is dangerous. People should not have to rely on the fickle editor-led culture of broadcasters and newspapers to receive important information and opinions. Person to person communication (without a controlling filter) is the bedrock of democracy and freedom. These rights need to be prtoected, not reduced.",
