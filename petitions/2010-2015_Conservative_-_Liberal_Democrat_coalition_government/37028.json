Bolt was referring specifically to the \u201cAgassi tax rule\u201d which allows the UK government to take sponsorship money from athletes competing in Britain.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was a tax case to do with the famous tennis player Andre Agassi, and in his prime, he was a test case in the United Kingdom. It was all about whether his sponsorship income, he had a massive sponsorship from Nike, when he played in the UK, at Wimbledon, could be taxed in the UK.\u201d explained tax attorney Francesca Lagerberg. \u201cAnd what the courts said was yes, not only could they tax it, they could take a huge amount of that sponsorship income into the UK tax net.\u201d",
