        "additional_details": "Scotland have recently had a vote on independence from the UK with a result of \"NO\" therefore Scotland will still be part of the UK for at least a generation if not a lifetime. Throughout the debates the English have sat back and watched without a say... Now I think the English should now have a vote if they wish for Scotland to be in and be part of the UK. Let's make this an even playing field, we allowed the Scottish to vote and gave them the opportunity of speaking up and making themselves heard therefore it would only be right to allow the English to have there say, let the English be heard and allow the English to vote.",
