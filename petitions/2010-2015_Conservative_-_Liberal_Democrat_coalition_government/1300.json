        "additional_details": "I believe that the use of e-petitions is contrary to the UK Parliamentary system and is not representative and consequently should be abolished. Parliament represents the electorate it does not follow it leads. The electorate have the ability to vote at elections and remove their MP's if they are not satisfied with their beliefs or performance.\r\nE-petitions will add to continued expense for the country which as a nation we can ill afford. Petitions are likely to reflect extremes of views and give a voice to undemocratic and unelected bodies.",
