        "additional_details": "The Benefits Up-Rating Bill seeks to cap any increases in most benefits to 1% per annum over the next three years. The argument for this is to ensure that benefits do not pay more than paid work.\r\n\r\nGiven that most public sector jobs have seen a pay freeze, it would be in the spirit of \"We're In This Together\" for MPs to have a similar cap on their salaries.  As 1% has been judged fair for benefit recipients, MPs' salaries should be capped at the same amount.",
