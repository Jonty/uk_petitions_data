        "additional_details": "I would like to see a compulsory form of teaching for  children and young adults to understand that there are all forms of disability, ie hidden disabilties as well as learning and physical disabilities that are obvious and that the laws regarding children and adults and verbal, emotional and physical bullying of the disabled are very real and a crime.....and maybe if the Education Act included this is mandatory teaching, then perhaps the disabled would not be so continually bullied and harrassed, especially given the concerns raised over the quite considerable rise of this type of bullying. If education took the lead and made sure that this was a compulsory fundemental part of teaching social behaviour, then the number of victims, silent or otherwise might be reduced.",
