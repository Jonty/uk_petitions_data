        "additional_details": "Many commuters only use overland rail services 5 days a week, but only have the option of buying either daily tickets (thereby not receiving any benefit of reduced fares) or weekly tickets for 7 days travel etc.\r\n\r\nThe government should force the rail companies to offer more flexible weekly, monthly and annual travel tickets. By allowing the purchase of a 5 day travel ticket for example (of which the commuter should be able to pick the days of travel) we should expect a close to 30% reduction in our travel cost, by only paying for the travel services we actually use. This methodology should further be used for monthly and annual season tickets.\r\n\r\n",
