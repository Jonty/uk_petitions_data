They should be scrutinised to ensure they have sufficiently robust measures in place to protect children from abuse by those they should be able to trust.\r\n\r\nWhen the Jimmy Saville scandal broke, the DG of the BBC was called before the commons. The churches should subjected to the same scrutiny. It's long overdue for religious organisations to be held to account for their appalling record of depravity.",
