Their have the power to stop any websites from being accessed. This will also allow companies which some started the whole \"privacy made easy\" job to sue any body that downloads a single torrent OR any website that links to a torrented website. This means for people like google which use spider bot and other web clawers to get websites onto their search engine could also be sued AND shut down. Facebook will be shut down if 1 person uploads a image/music or a video, or even linking to a copyright infringement content. Lastly NO more youtube, as 99% of youtube videos have music or video footage then by this law their will be shut down.",
