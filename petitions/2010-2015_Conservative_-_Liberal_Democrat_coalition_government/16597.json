        "additional_details": "At present British town centre military war memorials only use initials for first names. I think this devalues the sacrifice the men have made for their country and smacks of the old \"cannon fodder\" attitude of the war leaders in previous wars. Women are also now dying in battle, how will their names be shown? The MOD should change its attitude and insist that the full first name is used on new memorials. The memorials will have more meaning and give respect to individuals and  not be just be a symbol of overall loss.   ",
