According to Police and a witness she was not travelling at an excessive speed, however her car spun and landed in ditch. The Speed limit for this road is currently 60mph, There appears to several issues with the road and it's state, speed limit and signage. My Sister was not the first driver to end up in a ditch on the road and since her death she hasn't been the last, only a couple of weeks ago there was a similar incident. This speed limit needs to be reduced to 30mph and further signage to this area needs to implemented. Lauren was the 32nd person to die on our roads compared to 28 last year!!",
