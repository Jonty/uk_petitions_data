When the LGO itself fails to recognise and/or take action on this Statute; then that resolute non-compliance by either LA and/or LGO is not only fault, but illegally unjust.  Public funding pays LA/LGO salaries, yet ultra vulnerable publics' lives (in this category) are ruthlessly risked, solely because public servants' stoical 'brotherhood' protection supercedes upholding English Law, law of the land. Worse, peoples' human rights become trashed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
