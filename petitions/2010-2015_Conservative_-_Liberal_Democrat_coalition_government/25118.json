        "additional_details": "The government is calling 2012 \u2018A New Era for the Waterways\u2019. It has said it believes that \u201cmillions more can enjoy our canals & rivers\u201d. And yet, people in England and Wales do NOT currently have a clear legal right to access inland waters. / People love our waterways \u2013 the growing popularity of outdoor swimming, \u2018wild\u2019 swimming and canoeing show this. But people often find themselves confused, being \u2018moved on\u2019, breaking the law or (perhaps worst of all) staying away from inland waters altogether, because it is not clear where they are allowed to paddle, wade, kayak, canoe & swim. / The time is right for change. The \u2018New Era\u2019 will fail if many people cannot access inland waters in the ways they choose. But the government is currently drawing up legislation and forming a New Waterways Charity and there are obvious opportunities to amend the law. We therefore call for the government to put public access to inland waters at the heart of the proposed \u2018New Era for the Waterways\u2019.",
