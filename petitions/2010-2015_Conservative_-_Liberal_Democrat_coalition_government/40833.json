        "additional_details": "The ISSUE - Access to Porn on Internet is just a click away. Children can access it using PC's or Tablets or Mobiles very easily. This is not healthy or good for our children, specially below the age of 16. Apart from the common sense view, various studies and terrible individual cases highlight that action needs to be taken on this issue.\r\nACTIVITIES - a campaign was organised amongst others by 'safermedia.org.uk' which was supported by 140 MP's and was led by Claire Perry (MP), who presented it to Jeremy Hunt, the minister at the time (in Sept 2012). The outcome of it has not been satisfactory as the government has not framed any binding rules to force the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to put 'filters' to prevent easy access to Porn sites.\r\nACTION - We want the parliament to take action and frame laws. Various option are available to consider and the government should give the highest priority to the children rather than to any other vested interests.",
