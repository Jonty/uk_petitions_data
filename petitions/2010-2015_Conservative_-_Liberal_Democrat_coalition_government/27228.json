        "additional_details": "After many low speed collisions, many drivers fraudulently claim damages for supposed whiplash, even in cases where the collision occurs at less than 10mph where actual whiplash is extremely unlikely to occur.\r\n\r\nAs whiplash is very hard to prove, many drivers who are hit see it as an opportunity to claim for large amounts of money (In some cases over \u00a38,000 has been rewarded).\r\n\r\nMany people now take the 'everybody does it' attitude towards this, without realising that this has caused our insurance premiums to rocket over the last few years.\r\n\r\nI propose that making whiplash claims for low speed collisions (>10mph) be made illegal, and for genuine whiplash claims doctors should be more thorough in their investigation and must confirm, without any doubt, that a claimant is indeed suffering from whiplash before they can make an insurance claim.\r\n\r\n",
