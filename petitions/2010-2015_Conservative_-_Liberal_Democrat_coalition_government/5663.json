        "additional_details": "Under the Government's \"Localism\" agenda the role of local authorities is to be enhanced, at least theoretically.  So local government is at the heart of national policy making which affects it and ensures a consistent approach across all departments, and so there is no confrontational relationship between town hall and Whitehall, we call on the Prime Minister to accept the appointment of a Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government who is elected by the Local Government Association (LGA) through a democratic ballot process they organise of their members.  This person will sit in the Cabinet as a full Minister but will not be an MP or Peer, more likely a Councillor, but could alternatively be a retired Council Officer, former Councillor or other expert nominated by the LGA.  For stability the term of office could be for 5 years or whenever a General Election is held, whichever comes first. ",
