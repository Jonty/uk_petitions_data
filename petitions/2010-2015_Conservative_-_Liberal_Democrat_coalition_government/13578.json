        "additional_details": "In our lifetime our extravagant use of fossil fuels will be regarded as being irresponsible bordering on reckless.\r\n\r\nThere could hardly be a stronger demonstration of our commitment to reduce fossil fuel consumption and its associated green house gas emission than a policy of reducing leading to banning the recreational use of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nInitially, the Government should legislate to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel within 5 years in three convenient divisions:\r\n1.  Air:  For mico-lights, light-aircraft etc.\r\n2.  Sea:  For jet skis and motor launches etc.\r\n3.  Land:  For quad bikes, motocross and recreational 4x4s.\r\nCommercial recreational activities should be preserved for the short term but a significant green tax should be levied if they intend to continue trading beyond the 10 year point.\r\n\r\nEventually, legislation should be considerd for all recreational fuel burning.
