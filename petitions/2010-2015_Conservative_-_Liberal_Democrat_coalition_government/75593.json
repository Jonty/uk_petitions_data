        "additional_details": "Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian Leader of the Opposition was sentenced to jail for 5-years on 10 February on trumped-up charges for sodomy and a perverted due process that was a travesty of justice.\r\n\r\nAs Hugo Swire stated: \u201cMalaysia is an important partner and friend to the UK. We continue to believe that the integrity of the rule of law is a key part of its success, as are the values of moderation and tolerance.\u201d\r\n\r\nA multicultural, multi-religious Malaysia that practices Islam in peace within a nation that is a secular constitutional monarchy can be a vital key in the fight for hearts and minds against the scourge/threat of terrorism posed by those who claim to be fighting for Islam as Islamists.\r\n\r\nPlease use British policies and diplomacy to free Anwar Ibrahim as he is a true champion of democracy and rule of law and is supported by over 52% of the Malaysian electorate so we,  the British people, need him to be free just as much as the Malaysian people.",
