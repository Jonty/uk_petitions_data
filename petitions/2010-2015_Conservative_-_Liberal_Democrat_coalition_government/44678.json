        "additional_details": "Written communications from the TV licensing authority are accusatory, insulting and contain outright lies, for example:\r\n\r\n\"WHATEVER YOU'RE WATCHING,\r\nHOWEVER YOU'RE WATCHING IT,\r\nYOUR HOME NEEDS A TV LICENSE.\"\r\n\r\nThis is demanding money with menaces on the basis of a lie.\r\n\r\nMany examples exist in the media of licensing officers lying about their legal rights to gain access to properties, lying under oath to obtain search warrants, and lying about what they found during subsequent searches. They have been beaten in court for such activities several times. It is unaceptable that a company reresenting the UK Government employs such underhand tactics.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned ask that comprehensive government oversight be given to the activities of TV Licensing in order to bring their unnaceptable behaviour under control.",
