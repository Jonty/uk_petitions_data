        "additional_details": "New Guidelines state that women aged up to 42 should be offered one cycle of IVF as long as it is their first time and they have enough eggs. This applies irrespective of country of origin meaning that people can travel here and enjoy that liberty. However, any woman over the age of 42 must pay for fertility treatment even if she does not already have children. This fundamentally deprives her right to a family life and discriminates on the basis of age. Many working women who have contributed greatly to society are being denied access to the resources they have paid for. The guidelines should be extended to include anyone who is childless and healthy over the age of 42.\r\n",
