        "additional_details": "This will ensure that women who wear a niqab/ burqa will be able to stop worrying that the ban will come from france to england. Their religion is very important and if they wear the burqa it means that it is their form of protection, and to have this taken away from them this can make innocent women depressed and distressed. The UK has a long history of Islam being here and to make people restricted from their religion this is wrong and against human rights. Please let these women be and let them wear their burqa without worry.",
