        "additional_details": "There has been much talk of junk food taxes as of late, with the growing obesity epidemic in the UK (and around the world). Denmark has gone so far as to actually implement one. As to avoid upsetting our generous American sponsors of the 2012 Olympic Games with a global junk food tax that would incorporate soft drinks, I propose a simple, targeted change that would be a small step in the right direction: remove VAT free exemption status for cake.\r\n\r\nCake may have been a staple food in post-war Britain, when calories were hard to come by; in 21st century Britain, it is plainly a luxury, and a favourite treat amongst our ever growing obese population. Can health ministers honestly say that such a high sugar, high fat indulgence deserves VAT-free status today?",
