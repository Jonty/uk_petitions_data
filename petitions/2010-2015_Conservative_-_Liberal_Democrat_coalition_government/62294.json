        "additional_details": "Clause 119 of the Care Bill allows a hospital to be closed or downgraded if a neighbouring trust is struggling financially. It gives special administrators the power to make changes to neighbouring services while trying to rescue failing NHS trusts.This means that a hospital which is doing well both financially and clinically may be closed down or downgraded in order to save another nearby hospital which is doing not so well.\r\n\r\nThis clause is not only illogical but it is also placing patient lives at risk as it means the closure of local hospital and medical services.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons we wish the government to repeal Clause 119 of the Care Bill.
