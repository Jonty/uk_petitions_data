There is no justification for the criminal acts, but  of greater concern is the one pointed out by the Prime Minister, that is the type and level of criminality witnessed, epitomized by the robbery of a wounded kid and his aggressors pretending to help him. People must have access to a minimum of education, not only academic but civic, access to an honest work and to a moral life. Something has evidently gone very wrong and it should be reversed as soon as possible.",
