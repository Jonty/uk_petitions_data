I propose that we keep the number of vehicles on our roads to the amount registered as of now.  For new vehicles to be allowed onto the roads the government would have to monitor number of vehicles scrapped and also target vehicles with no insurance for scrap and then replace vehicles on a one for one basis. This would also apply to foreign vehicles on the roads only allowing a set number which would mean monitoring ports and docks.",
