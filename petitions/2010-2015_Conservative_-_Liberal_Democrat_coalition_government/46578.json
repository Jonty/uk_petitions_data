Because they are against bullying, they are also called \"anti-bullying laws\"\u009d for clarity. So far, there are only state laws about bullying, but people have suggested a national law. Bullying laws often focus on schools, which are the site of a large amount of bullying behaviour, with bullying being the most problematic during the secondary school years.\r\n\r\nBullying laws have pursued different programs and agendas. Laws may or may not criminalise bullying, some preferring to keep the handling of such situations in the realm of families and schools (when appropriate) rather than the courts. Laws may require reports of bullying by school personnel who witness it, and prescribe responses to bullying that includes investigation and imposing disciplinary measures, notification for parents, and support and counselling of targets.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource: http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/bullying-laws.html",
