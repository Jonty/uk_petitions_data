        "additional_details": "James Eary was assaulted within school ground no less than a month ago. He was attacked by a group of boys over a social mis-understanding. This left the boy in question needing hospital treatment as stitching in the mouth area. The school promised a SEVERE PUNISHMENT however only delivered a one day exclusion which is classed to many students as a nice 'day off'. This caries the same punishment as smoking on school property or damaging state owned facilities.\r\n\r\nBullying should not be accepted and should be punished, this therefore is not a petition for this sole case, but for bullying in our education system.",
