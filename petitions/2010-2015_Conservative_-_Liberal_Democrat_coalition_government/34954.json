        "additional_details": "Many herpetological shows have been obstructed by 'animal protection' agencies. They are legitimate shows, into which people have put a lot of time, money and effort. They are places for people with a passion for keeping reptiles to meet like-minded people and share their skills and experiences. The trading of animals at these shows between hobbyists ensures that captive bred reptiles are readily available to meet the demand, eliminating the need for wild caught animals to be traded, and lessens risk of infection/disease. Some groups go out of their way to stop these shows from taking place, including threats and deliberate acts of destruction.\r\nWe need to stop these agencies from preventing these shows and let us enjoy our hobby.\r\nWe want the Government to encourage local councils not to listen to the biased and unfounded claims of such 'agencies', and let us continue with our hobby!",
