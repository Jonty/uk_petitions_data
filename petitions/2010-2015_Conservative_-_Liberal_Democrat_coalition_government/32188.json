        "additional_details": "Because the Land Registry abondoned their role in listing new owners of Lord of the Manor Titles , in the year 2003, a new Civil Service controlled register of Manorial Titles is now required.                                                                                                                                                              Since 2003, when the Land Registry abondoned keeping records of ownership of  Lord of the Manor Titles, there is now no register of ownership for these titles.                                                                                                                                                                Some of these titles sell for between \u00a31,500 and up to \u00a340,000 , per item, and it is therefore esential that a new Manorial Register of ownership be established.   ",
