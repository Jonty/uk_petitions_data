Those of us, Scots included, who live in the remainder of the United Kingdom have no say in this critically important question.  If, like me, you are proud to be British and believe strongly that the answer to the referendum question should be NO, I urge you to sign this petition and send a message to our politicians who through self-interest and complacency have put our highly successful union at risk.\r\nAction required of the government: to note the support by British citizens outside Scotland for a NO vote in the Scottish referendum on independence.",
