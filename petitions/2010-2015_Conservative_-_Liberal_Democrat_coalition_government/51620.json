The licences should bear a photograph of a licensee and a unique serial number which can be verified by dialling a single national phone number or via a government website.\r\n\r\nAll licensees should adhere to a uniform statutory code of practice and licences should be revoked following breaches of the code or conviction for an acquisitive offence such as theft or burglary.\r\n",
