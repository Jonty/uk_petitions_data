        "additional_details": "Faith schools are unnecessary, potentially divisive and a risk to the fabric of British society.\r\n\r\nAt their best, they only perform a function that should be the aim of all schools- to provide a good, well-rounded education for children and young people.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Govt. to consider implementing the following:\r\n\r\n1. The banning of all faith schools, and a return to socially and religiously integrated education.\r\n\r\n2. In the meantime, the creation of a new inspectorate to monitor and regulate faith schools to ensure that the curriculum is properly adhered-to and that divisiveness is not promoted.\r\n\r\n3. A recognition that education is a secular matter, and that religion should be left out of the classroom - with the exception of religious education lessons that promote acceptance, tolerance and debate.",
