        "additional_details": "The CEO of Royal Bank of Scotland will receive bonuses totaling \u00a33m since being appointed in 2008. The UK tax payer is the majority shareholder (82%) in RBS, and as such is entitled to call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to review the current remuneration packages on offer to all Executives at RBS.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the Government to instruct UK Financial Investments (UKFI) to hold an EGM with the agenda of Reviewing the RBS Remuneration Process. UKFI, being the representative of the majority shareholders, are prescribed to speak on behalf of the UK tax payer and to voice the concerns and objections of their clients at the EGM. Thus, for the purposes of transparency, this petition also calls that the EGM be held within the public domain, with live broadcasts and transcripts of 'all matters arising' being made publicly available.",
