And if an offender trangresses during the sentence, time should be added on. There should also be mandatory minimums for all offences e.g. 30 years for armed robbery, 40 years for rape/sexual offence. And all a prisoner should get inside is a basic bed, basic food. No fancy gyms or activities of any sort.",
