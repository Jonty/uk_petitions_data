        "additional_details": "Tens of thousands of people every year become homeless and are forced to sleep on the streets.\r\nI was once one of them and endured 3 years of sleeping rough to escape long term abuse but there are so many other reasons why people find themselves isolated, vulnerable and scared with no-one to turn to.\r\nThis is a national scandal in the 21st century so I'm seeking a national study and allocation of funds to identify and help those currently in need but also to prevent homelessness being seen and chosen as the only alternative.\r\nPlease sign the petition so men, women and children no longer have to go through this ordeal.\r\nThank you,\r\nCJ de Mooi",
