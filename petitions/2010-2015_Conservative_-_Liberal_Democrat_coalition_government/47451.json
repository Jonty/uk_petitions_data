        "additional_details": "Gaza Aid Convoy\r\nThis convoy left the UK with large amounts of charity thanks to the British Public.  They have successfully traveled through all of the countries by road until Egypt.  This is the last country before their last stop in Palestine to deliver this aid.\r\nHowever they have been stopped by the Egyptian authorities.  They are in urgent need to keep moving.\r\nThe goal here is to get the aid as quickly as possible to the people of Gaza.  The Convoy representatives have been through a tough time and will continue their hardship in order to help these people. They have been held in very poor conditions in the border zone without access to even clean toilets for several days now.\r\nWe hope that the Egyptian authorities will allow them to continue and treat them better.   So please sign this petition to show your support.",
