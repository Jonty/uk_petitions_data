        "additional_details": "Greyhounds around the world are exploited for profit and entertainment and then abandoned and even killed by brutal methods at the end of their short race careers. They are often mutilated to prevent the owner being identified.\r\n\r\nGreyhound racing is recently being promoted in Asia where there are no laws for animal welfare and many greyhounds are being exported from around the world, including the UK, to meet the demand for racing dogs. Puppies that do not make the grade are either killed or if they're lucky, have a chance to be re-homed.\r\n\r\nThere are plans to expand in Asia and create more tracks and greyhound breeding farms in Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia, countries which are known for torturing dogs for human consumption.\r\n\r\nThe UK should stop the export of British and Irish bred Greyhounds for exploitation in Asian countries.",
