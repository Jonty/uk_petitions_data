The CSA calculates the amount of maintenance to be paid as a percentage of your NET wage, however the CMS calculates it on a percentage of GROSS wage (before tax and NI contributions). I personally find this ludicrous. How can you calculate anything on an amount that doesn't even get paid into your bank account? In no other circumstances is your GROSS wage used in this way. ",
