VWS is run by a Jonathan Powell who has no meteorological training, but tells journalists what they want to hear to make a good story. Exacta Weather does not use any form of meteorological or climatological models, but does suggest it looks at observations.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian has already helped to shut down Jonathan Powell's previous company Positive Weather Solutions by publishing the following article: http://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2012/jan/26/weather-forecasters-daily-mail\r\n\r\nIt is time that this nonsense was stopped all together. The Government needs to in place regulations which insure only qualified meteorologist are able to consult media companies so that all the facts can be laid bare.",
