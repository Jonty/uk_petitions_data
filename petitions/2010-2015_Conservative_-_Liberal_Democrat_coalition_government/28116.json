        "additional_details": "The recent Argentine and Chilean claims of sovereign British territory in the Southern Hemisphere, coupled with the events of the Falklands War, have shown how easily British land might be invaded and how grave the threat of invasion truly is. It is therefore necessary to prepare against the threat of foreign aggression. Accordingly, this petition humbly puts forward a suggestion that the Rothera Research Station be allotted a garrison and equipped with the facilities needed to maintain said garrison. Furthermore, it is also suggested that the runway at the aforementioned research station be properly maintained and expanded so as to be able to accommodate a variety of British military aircraft. If this task is completed, the British Antarctic Territory and any nearby sovereign British land shall be thoroughly and adequately protected against any foreign threats.",
