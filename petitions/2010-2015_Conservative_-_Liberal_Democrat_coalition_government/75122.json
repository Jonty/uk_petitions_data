        "additional_details": "The Human Rights Act is a vital piece of legislation. It protects everyone regardless of their background. It protects citizens, minorities and refugees.\r\n\r\nThere is not enough knowledge nor awareness of what the Human Rights Act does, who it protects and why it is so important.\r\n\r\nRefugees have been targeted by the media and political parties for a long time in negative ways, and this has not been mitigated enough.   As a result, refugees and asylum seekers \u201chave increasingly become tools for politicians\u201d  that demonize them,  making it easier to take away frameworks that protect them such as the Human Rights Act 1998.\r\n\r\nIf the Human Rights Act is repealed vulnerable groups such as refugees will suffer the consequences.\r\n\r\nSAVE THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT!",
