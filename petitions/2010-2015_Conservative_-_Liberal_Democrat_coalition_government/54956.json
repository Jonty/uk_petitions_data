        "additional_details": "Congestion on the A303 between Amesbury and the Wylie Junction with the A36 is a daily problem. The volume of traffic is simply too great for the current single carriageway. The recent changes around Stonehenge have made it worse. At a time when the Government is promoting H2S, it has no plans to upgrade the A303. The cost benefits of the upgrade are obvious, not to mention the environmental benefits for Stonehenge and Winterbourne Stoke. We call on the Government to upgrade the A303 to dual carriageway",
