        "additional_details": "We call on the energy secretary, Chris Huhne, to refuse consent for BP's proposed deep-water oil well off Shetland. As we have seen in the Gulf of Mexico, oil spills are catastrophic and devastating. Drilling in this area, which is home to the UK's richest seabird breeding grounds, would be unwise, dangerous and pose a serious threat to the surrounding wildlife. ",
