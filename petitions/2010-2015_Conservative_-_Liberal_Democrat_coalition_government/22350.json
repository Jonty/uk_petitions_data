Given the substantial rise in the cost of living, especially on such items as gas petrol and electricity, It is my opinion! that this would be a direct attack on those who are least able to sustain themselves! I would put it to the Government that this would be not only unfair, but in certain cases dangerous to health. I would therefore, ask the Government to reconsider this action. ",
