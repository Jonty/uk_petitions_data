        "additional_details": "I am asking the government to step in and stop the destruction of the cobbled pavements in Dunster, Somerset. These cobbles are part of our history and date from mediaeval times. Somerset County Council, in their stupidity, have decided and started to remove the cobbled pavements and relay them with grey paving slabs. I also think that SCC Councillors should pay, out of their own pockets, to have the cobbles put back in their rightful place. It is wrong that Dunster is loosing some of it's history and character.",
