        "additional_details": "\"Free ad\" sites allow a user to advertise their objects for sale.\r\n\r\nMany people use these sites to advertise the sale of puppies or kittens or other animals. Some people use this to rehome their animals.\r\n\r\nMany animals on free ad sites end up in bad homes, many of the puppies and kittens end up back on the site within weeks because people have taken them on without thinking about it.\r\n\r\nIf a person is serious about breeding they should not need to advertise their animals on a free ad website, they will be happy to spend money to advertise their animals and get the correct homes for them.\r\n\r\nThese advert websites are contributing to Back Yard Breeding and allowing people to make profit from inappropriate breeding.\r\n\r\nI believe these sites need to prohibit the sale of live animals, as they have no say in where the animals end up which is dangerous for the animals.\r\n",
