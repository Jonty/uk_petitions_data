        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the government to amend the Welfare Reform Act 2012 in order to repeal the changes to housing benefit, commonly known as the \"bedroom tax\". The bedroom tax is set to reduce the amount of housing benefit paid to low income households seen to be under occupying. Where a household is viewed to be underoccupying by one bedroom, housing benefit will be reduce by 11%. Where there are two or more bedrooms under occupied, housing benefit will be reduced by 25%. We call on the government to repeal this change which will cause great hardship for thousands of low income families.",
