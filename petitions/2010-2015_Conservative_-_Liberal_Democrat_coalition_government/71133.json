        "additional_details": "The Eurovision song contest is one of the most insidious examples of pan-European cooperation, with an enormous democratic deficit surrounding issues like turnout, numbers of phones per 1'000 population and the fact that you can literally vote twice.\r\n\r\nHowever, the British public were never given their say about whether to join Eurovision. Therefore the signatories of this petition ask that the Government hold a referendum on whether the British public should be given a say.",
