        "additional_details": "Mr Kane died on 13 September this year.  Over 40 years ago he revealed sex and security scandals in our intelligence gathering organisation which were suppressed by the authorities but later confirmed to have been right.  His actions prove the subterfuge amongst our intelligence services which thrive and survive to current times through the falsified Iraq dossier and recent revelations over illegal monitoring of citizens of this country.  He demonstrated braveness and morality lacking in our political leaders for decades and he MUST, even in death, be recognised for that.",
