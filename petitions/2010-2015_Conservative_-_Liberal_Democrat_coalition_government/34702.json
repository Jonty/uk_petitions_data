This often results in unsolicited contact via mail, telephone, email and SMS which individuals find annoying and even distressing. It is very difficult for individuals to trace, or be removed from, the many mailing lists which result from such data harvesting.\r\n\r\nI CALL UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO CHANGE THE LAW so that, unless an individual has specifically opted-in to receiving marketing and other such unsolicited information (by simply contacting a company or entity this does not automatically assume an opt-in), it is agreed that they have opted-out and no unsolicited contact is to be made.",
