        "additional_details": "The proposal to allow a transfer of \u00a3750 of unused tax allowance to one's spouse does not go far enough. The Government should allow the transfer of ALL unused tax allowance. This would allow a mother or father, if they wished, to remain at home to look after their children whilst giving a much needed boost to family finances and would remove the necessity to pay, and perhaps claim for, child minding costs. This would also have great socio-economic benefit to the community. Pensioners would also benefit greatly if, say, one spouse's income was above their tax allowance and they therefore paid tax on the balance but their partner's allowance was more than their income and so part of it was effectively wasted.\r\nThe economy would also be boosted by giving people more expendable income and spending is one of the ways to lift us out of this recession.",
