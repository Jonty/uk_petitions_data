        "additional_details": "I am astounded given the recent press, that anyone doesn't know how little home carers are paid. They're on zero hours contracts and not paid for travelling time given they could be out from seven in the morning until eleven at night for a few hours pay. those that drive don't even get their petrol refunded let alone a milage allowance, the others are expected to pay them out of their below minimum wages. I'm lucky, my father is severely disabled and his care is down to a wonderful team who work for peanuts. Sometimes it works out at not much more that \u00a32an hour. They come four times a day and clean him, change his nappies and turn him but they're also company for my mum who can't leave the house. but the care companies take advantage. That said, the biggest culprits are the councils who outsourse keeping to budgets on the face of it. They really do deserve more.",
