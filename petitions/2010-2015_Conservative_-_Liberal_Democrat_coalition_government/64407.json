        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the significant structural changes the NHS has experienced in recent times through the Health and Social Care Act 2012 are damaging the National Health Service in England.  It is time for a fresh debate on the  NHS, especially as there is growing political consensus that better integration of health services is important for the future.   Collaboration and not competition is more likely to allow a greater integration of community and hospital services.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the test for any health policy should be whether it benefits patients, and while no one wants to see money wasted again on another wholesale reorganisation, we call for the Act to be repealed in patients' best interests.",
