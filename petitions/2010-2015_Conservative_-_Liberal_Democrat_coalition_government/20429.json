        "additional_details": "The typical Briton earns an annual salary of \u00a323,244, which after tax leaves them with \u00a31,497 each month.\r\n\r\n15% of this equals \u00a3224.55. This is all one child is entitled to should one of their parents decide to leave the family home. This percentage increases slightly to 20% if you have 2 children and 25% if you have 3 or more children.\r\n\r\nThis level of maintenance is barely enough to cover childcare costs when the lone parent has to go back to work, or the cost of rent, food, heating and clothing. In this instance a lone parent would be forced to turn to the benefit system in order to help support themselves and their child. At a time when the government is making drastic cuts to many budgets, is it not reasonable to expect the absent parent to contribute more to their own child\u2019s welfare.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that the absent parent be expected to pay 30% of their monthly income after tax and that this increase to 35% for 2 children and 40% for 3 or more children.\r\n\r\n",
