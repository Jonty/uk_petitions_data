That is the key to econiomic recover - not cutting tax for the rich of cutting benefits for the disabled. The best ways to achieve this are cutting business rates, giving haulage companies a 25% rebate on fuel duty, cutting VAT etc. Yes these actions will reduce the revenue the government takes  in but you will be more than compensated for by the welfare bill quickly coming down.",
