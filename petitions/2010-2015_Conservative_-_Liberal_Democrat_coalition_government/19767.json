        "additional_details": "The Dartford toll fee was originally introduced to pay for the building of the crossings which were paid for many years ago by the tolls.\r\n\r\nHowever despite the Government of the time promising to drop the toll once the crossings were paid for we are still paying now.\r\n\r\nNot only is this dishonest on the part of the Government but also the toll causes massive delays virtually every day of the week year round.\r\n\r\nIt does nothing to reduce traffic but has a big effect on the UK economy due to the delays it causes particularly to commercial vehicles and also has a detrimental effect on the environment due to the fumes emitted from stationary traffic.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that the Government ends the toll bottleneck at the Dartford crossing  by removing the toll charge, booths and barriers and gets the traffic on this part of the M25 flowing again.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
