        "additional_details": "Fructose is a chronic toxin, metabolized only by the liver and responsible for insulin resistance\u2014the common denominator in Metabolic Syndrome, Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity. It is also believed that a link exists between Metabolic Syndrome and cancer.\r\n\r\nExcessive fructose intake is making us obese and sick.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this petition is to give UK the consumer clear information about how much fructose is in the food they eat by way of listing fructose as a distinct item of nutritional information instead of grouping it with total sugars. This is necessary because fructose is metabolised differently to other sugars and has long term toxic effects.",
