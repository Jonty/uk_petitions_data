        "additional_details": "The UK Offshore and Diving industry is busy, we need to give the available work to UK(EU) nationals first before any foreign workers take a position.\r\n\r\nSocial dumping of offshore workers and seafarers, using foreign labour; this includes anyone who is engaged working on a vessel needs to be addressed by Parliament.\r\n\r\nWe need the Government to act and close loopholes that allow them to pay little or no tax.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the Government act and enforce legislation that prevents a foreign worker taking a job that could be filled by a UK(EU) citizen.\r\n\r\nMany other countries restrict the amount of foreign labour they use (and rightly so) we need to reciprocate and enforce this issue.\r\n\r\nPlease help UK(EU) citizens to benefit from this current surge of activity and let our nation reap the benefits of income tax and boosting our own economy through spending our earnings.\r\n\r\nPlease sign our petition and let our country reap the rewards.",
