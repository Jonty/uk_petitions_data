        "additional_details": "The recent flooding following the heavy rain has demonstrated once again the folly of building on land that acts as flood-plains, soaking up massive amounts of water. New housing - and older housing - in such area's has been flooded yet again. There are plenty of brown-field sites that could be utilised for such purposes, such as industrial area's that are now redundant, having been closed down due to government policies over the last few decades. Please have the sense to use these instead.",
