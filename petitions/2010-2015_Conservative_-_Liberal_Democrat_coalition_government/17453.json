        "action": "Reset council tax single person discounts each year",
        "additional_details": "I am told that local councils accept an application for a 25% single person discount on council tax accounts but do not ask the citizens to re-certify their single person discount status. My suggestion is that all single person discounts should be reset each year and enforce those citizens to re-certify their single person discount eligibity. The reason for this petition is that in general people do not see that not mentioning their in-eligibility in change of status as unlawful as they havent directly lied, however people generally take a different view if they have to sign a form falsely stating their entitlement which includes a warning that a false declaration is against the law and they could be prosecuted.",
