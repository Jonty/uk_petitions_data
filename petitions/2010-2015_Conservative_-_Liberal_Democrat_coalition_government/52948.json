        "additional_details": "We would like the government to protect users who modify legally purchased gaming software e.g. PS3 games.\r\n\r\nThis includes modification and backing up a legally owned game.\r\n\r\nI and many users believe that modification enhances the gaming experience and the lifespan of a game. Modification of a game should be allowed even without the permission of the copyright holder.\r\n\r\nA perfect example is Rockstar \"GTA San Andreas\". Game was created in 2004 and yet after 9 years is still played by many users around the world due to the freedom of modification.\r\n\r\nWe believe that modding should only be ILLEGAL if\r\n\r\nA.The user has not legally purchased the gaming software.\r\nB. Does not financially benefit from modifications.\r\n\r\nLastly consumers should be allowed to upload videos showcasing modded games however not informing the viewer on how to achieve such modifications and not providing them with downloadable links. This should be considered fair use.",
