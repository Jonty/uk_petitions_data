        "additional_details": "Vehicle immobilisation is one side of the coin - obverse being irresponsible and selfish parking.    Outlawing clamping equates to a ban on speeding or the relaxation on the drink driving laws. Each would receive equal amount of rapture from those who flout the rules.  But the deterrent value of these laws provide for the greater good and 95% of the public would concur! I believe there is no civil deterrent with greater public awareness than clamping, the rules are clear, simple and conclusive. Labour's amendments to the Crime and Security act of 2010 (section 42, 43, and 44) gained Queens assent April 9th 2010 but fell days short of sanctioning the rules. I suggest the  government uses 'Tickets' for Misdemeanour's with a 50% discount. Clamps for trespass or breach of parking restrictions. (release fee capped) and Tow vehicles by request of the proprietor or  i.e. Fire, Emergency exits, Blockage, numbered or determined Spaces. Finally its 'One Penalty for One Offence' per 24 hours",
