        "additional_details": "Introduced by Home Secretary Theresa May on June 23 rd 2013, the program will target people coming to Britain on six-month visit visas from India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. They will only get the money back once they leave the country in a bid to cut immigration and abuse of system.\r\n\r\nThis cash bond scheme introduced by Home Office is absolutely biased, arbitrary and unlawful because it discriminates against certain category of immigrants. Also to single out these \u2018high risk\u2019 countries is an insult and abuse.\r\n\r\nThe government forgets the fact that the immigrants from these countries have helped the economy grow and British taxes are lower, spending is higher and the deficit is smaller.\r\n\r\nThis scheme is effective from November 2013.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Home Office to abolish the \u00a33000 cash bond scheme for Asians and African visitors to enter UK.\r\n",
