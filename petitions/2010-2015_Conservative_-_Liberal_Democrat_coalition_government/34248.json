Then the whole audience applauded their committment to keeping us safe. More public  opportunities in UK should be made to acknowledge the dedication and work the forces do. It would not cost anything, other than time and thought on behalf of Theatre productions, sporting events  organisers etc. All armed forces need to be positively acknowledged, not just when they return in coffins.",
