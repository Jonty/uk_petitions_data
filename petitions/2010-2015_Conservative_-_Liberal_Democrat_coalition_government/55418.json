        "additional_details": "When more and more women in their 30s & 40s are diagnosed with breast cancer having a mammogram before they are 50 is much more beneficial. The only way a woman can detect something is wrong is through self examination. But you do not always find a lump with breast cancer. So earlier mammograms could save lives. I myself only discovered my breast cancer at the age of 49 by finding a lump. If I had been given a mammogram at an earlier age it would have been detected earlier.",
