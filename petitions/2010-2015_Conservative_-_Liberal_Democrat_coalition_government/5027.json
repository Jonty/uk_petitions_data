        "additional_details": "Legalising regulated prostitution will help to protect the many vulnerable women involved. Additionally, this will detract from prostitution being driven underground, whereby women and children are forced into working as prostitutes, as well as being trafficked into the UK for this very purpose. Those who are forced into prostitution are unable to escape, and work as slaves. It is time we realised that prostitution will never cease to exist, and thus it is far better for it to be carried out in a safe and regulated environment.",
