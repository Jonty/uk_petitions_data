        "additional_details": "In these recessionary times the voluntary sector is under increased pressure through loss of funding from local and national government grants, and often increased demand for their services to the public.\r\nMany people already work as volunteers (unpaid), sometimes incurring personal expenses to do so.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is simply to allow unpiad volunteer workers* to include any such genuine work expenses in their income tax returns, to reduce their personal outlay and importantly widen the number of people who are able to afford to do voluntary work.\r\n\r\nThis would be a simple practical step that would show voters that the so-called \"Big Society\" is not just a Govt euphemism for public service cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n*  NB  This scheme would only apply to genuine voluntary work positions, not casual voluntary work like helping out at a charity, school trips, scouts etc. or indeed  any activity involving own family members.",
