These people understand the benefits and are keen to donate.\r\n\r\nIf the system does not work well enough to catch any illness's then it should be improved to ensure it can. There should be an individual risk assessment for all blood donor patients.\r\n\r\nBlood-borne viruses are increasing throughout the UK however the NHS could use this opportunity (through blood donation) to identify those individuals infected and provide necessary support.",
