        "additional_details": "Pfizer wish to buy, divide, and sale a great leader in medical research on a profit based quest that will see medical breakthroughs reduced as surplus profit takes centre stage. This imperialist company would hinder AstraZeneca and its continued succsess in science that benefits, and will continue to benefit humanity at large from further breakthroughs thus saving lives and prolonging lives of individuals. It is therefore necessary to keep Pfizer from destroying AstraZeneca which it clearly has no long term interest in as their motivations are based on capital and not the continuation of medical and scientific research. AstraZeneca...not for sale.",
