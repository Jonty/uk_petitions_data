        "additional_details": "Many people cannot afford to pay the huge monthly subscriptions to watch sports broadcasting which is unfairly monopolised by BSkyB. The current system makes it far too easy for large corporations to gain a monopoly on sports broadcasting, stifling competition and harming consumers. I propose that a law be passed requiring that all sports series (e.g. premiership football, F1 etc.) must be shared between broadcasters and that the rights to annual on-off's (e.g. The FA cup final) be rotated between broadcasters on an annual basis, subject to their ability to provide high-quality broadcasts. This would make it much easier for competing broadcasters to gain a fair share of the market, driving down prices.\r\n",
