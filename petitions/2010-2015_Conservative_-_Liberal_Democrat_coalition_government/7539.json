        "additional_details": "Ban or severely restrict the use of any head covering. Media coverage of the recent riot incidents in N. Ireland and England all share one common factor, the majority of perpetrators can be seen wearing various types of head coverings. Many coat and hood combinations have over generous proportions for the hood making them ideal to hide the wearer\u2019s identity. Controls are needed to restrict the design and availability of garments with combined hoods, unless such garments meet insulation requirements for very cold conditions. Insulated garments would be impractical except for use in other than cold weather. Consideration should be given to phase out existing garments. Crash Helmets etc. must be removed before the Rider or Driver moves than 1 metre from the vehicle. Face Masks worn for Rain, Dust or Allergy Protection should only be permitted by Medical Certification or in appropriate conditions and locations. Wearing Religious Garments must not be allowed to breach Public Safety. ",
