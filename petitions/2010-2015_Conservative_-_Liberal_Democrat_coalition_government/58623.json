        "additional_details": "Alan Turing was a British war hero and pioneer of modern computing. In 2009, he quite rightly received a posthumous apology from the Prime Minister, which expressed regret for the shocking way in which he was treated. In 2013, he was pardoned for his crime of \"Gross Indecency\" on the basis of his commendable efforts in shortening the War.\r\n\r\nWhilst these are steps in the right direction, they do not go far enough in righting the shameful way in which Alan Turing and an estimated 74,000 gay Britons were treated in the same period. Entering into a same-sex consensual relationship should never have been considered a crime, and the issuing of a pardon implies that an offence was committed for which the recipient is forgiven. This is not the case.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the signatories of this petition demand that the government issue a statement to the effect that Alan Turing and other Britons persecuted in the same way should never have been convicted of the crime of \"Gross Indecency\".",
