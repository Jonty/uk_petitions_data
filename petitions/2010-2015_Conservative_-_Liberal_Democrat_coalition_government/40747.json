        "additional_details": "With the scandal that has rocked the BBC TV service, I feel it is now time to close the BBC. The BBC has lost the faith of the British public. It is now obscene that the BBC requires a fee from the public in order to watch their terrible programmes.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I do not watch the BBC channels, but still have to pay.\r\n\r\nThis epetition is not about abolishing the licence fee, it is to CLOSE THE BBC FOR GOOD.\r\n\r\nThe Jimmy Saville scandal has destroyed the reputation of the corporation beyond repair and now more staff are being revealed as being involved.\r\n\r\nEnough is enough.\r\n\r\nClose it now. If it was any other business with widespread allegations of child abuse, they'd be closed down.\r\n\r\nClose it now. ",
