        "additional_details": "Anti-plagiarism software eg Turnitin doesn't  provide an accurate assessment regarding whether an assignment has been copied or to what extent.\r\nIt simply crawls the web looking for 'text snippets within a sentance' that have been written before. This is effectively attempting to 'Patent words and sentances'.\r\nA student can spend hours reading a report on the web to obtain the info they require, then put that into their own words. However, if just a small 'snippet' of their own work appears elsewhere, it is deemed copied... completely unacceptable!!\r\nFurthermore, rather than [correctly] taking an average of all simularities found across the web [i.e. 5% simularity is found on 20 websites should be regarded as 5% simularity], the software accumulates each & every 'percentage' for each website. So in my example, this would be regarded 100% in simularity which is clearly wrong!\r\nI would like the government to ban use of this software to check students works for my reasons stated above.\r\n",
