        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, register our opposition to the housing development now being pursued by landowners in respect of land contained within the lane known as The Loop or The Horseshoe, Audmore, Gnosall.\r\nWe believe that Gnosall has taken a more than fair allocation of the homes allocated to the Key Service Villages and that there is no need for these homes, which do not reflect the wishes of the residents in their Neighbourhood Plan consultation. We urge the landowners and developers to withdraw these plans and Stafford Borough Council to refuse permission should plans still be presented.",
