        "additional_details": "This campaign has been launched to raise awareness of current loopholes in the law, which put dental patients at risk. There is no legal requirement in the UK for a dentist to have professional liability insurance to cover his patients if something goes wrong with the dental treatment which he provides.\r\n  Dentists practise in this country uninsured, and the problems only come to light when it is too late \u2013 after members of the public have been harmed and there is no-one, and no insurance, to pick up the tab.\r\nWe support a change in the law to establish that dental professionals must have professional liability insurance or indemnity cover to cover their dental practice and provide reassurance to all dental patients.\r\nThe new legislation should also impose a statutory duty of co-operation with patients and patient representatives upon the insurers and indemnifiers of all dental care professionals to make sure that in the event of a claim, the interests of patients are protected.",
