        "additional_details": "In the UK a significant proprtion of revenue is paid out in numerous benefits.  Many of these benefits are paid to individuals who have made little or no contribution to UK taxes and often make it unviable for individuals to return to the world of work.\r\n\r\nWe would like parliament to limit the maximum amount of benefits paid to any household.  It is suggested this limit be set at the equivalent of 90% of average househould income.  Furthermore, any individual returning to work after a period of unemployment should be guaranteed that their income will be at least 120 percent of what they received while living on benefits.  This will help to ensure that work pays and that individuals will be incentivised to return to work.  It will also mean that substantial sums of money will be released for other more deservng causes, including reducing the amout of personal taxes. ",
