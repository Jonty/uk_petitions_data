Most of the jobs advertised have been proven to be false and non-existant in order to justify the figures.  fact - Jobcentre managers are rewarded a daily commission for getting people into work, or for penalising those people with sanctions over such pathetic excuses like a simple one-off mistake' of 'forgetting to bring a job diary in just one occassion''\r\n\r\nThe DWP have even admitted they set monthly benefit sanction quotas for each jobcentre to attain, even for no clear understandable reason.",
