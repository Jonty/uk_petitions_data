Some of the elderly people affected by this would have to sell their homes in order to pay for medication.  Without medication, elderly people could die sooner rather than later.  As the vast majority of elderly people have worked all their lives and, therefore, have paid into the system, they deserve better treatment from the powers that be in this country.",
