        "additional_details": "It is very important that staff in schools, especially upper/secondary schools are trained in Mental Health. 1 in 4 people suffer with a mental health problem and if you think about it in a school, that is a lot of people.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience the majority of school staff, including pastoral support staff do not know much about mental health and how to help students when they are struggling to cope. If they were trained in Mental Health I believe that it would have a massive impact on the students lives and futures. Being trained in Mental Health could even save a students life, it is that important.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe all staff should be trained in Mental Health no matter what their job role is. ",
