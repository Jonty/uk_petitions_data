        "additional_details": "We want to stop all tax being charged to women buying Tampons and Sanitary Towels for their monthly cycle of menstruation. Tax on Tampons and pads is robbing a woman because sanitary products are already exorbitantly and notoriously overpriced. Women, for years, have paid Tax on a product that is needed for them to carry on daily lives in comfort, this product is ESSENTIAL and not a luxury product like make-up or cream therefore why is it taxed? Government please get your bleeding tax off our tampons! ",
