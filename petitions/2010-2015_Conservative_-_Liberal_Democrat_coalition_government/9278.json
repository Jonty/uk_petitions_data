        "additional_details": "The Treasury should Zero Rate VAT on all medicines.\r\n\r\nCurrently all medicines purchased over the counter are subject to 20% VAT.  FP-10 Prescriptions are exempt from VAT, as are private prescriptions.  However NHS hospitals also have to pay VAT on all their medicines.\r\n\r\nZero Rating would:\r\n- Reduce the cost of self medication, encouraging patients not to use their GP when it is not necessary.\r\n- Reduce administrative burden for community pharmacies (and the Treasury) who have to reclaim VAT.\r\n- Reduce drug costs to NHS Hospitals by 20%, allowing NHS hospitals to compete with independant providers who do not have to pay VAT.",
