        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Government to allow rail users to vote on proposed fare increases.\r\n\r\nWe have heard them all - 3 months of the year it's too wet or we have the wrong leaves, 3 months of the year it's too hot; yet consistently, train companies increase fares without any noticeable increase in the ability of trains to operate in the tropical, giddy temperatures of 23 degrees.\r\n\r\nInstead of limiting rises to inflation plus a given amount, operators should only be allowed to increase prices based on satisfying voters according to surveys collected by either the DFT or ORR. Allowing price rises linked to inflation should only be permitted where there are insufficient survey responses.\r\n\r\nSurveys could be completed on a mobile app, online, through local newspapers, through the post: any method so desired by those using the railway.",
