Cancellation insurance doesn't cover all eventualities.\r\n\r\nWith transport workers being paid bonuses for doing their jobs surely those most deserving, our armed forces, should benefit too?\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron recently suggested that G4S should be made to repay some of the money they received from the Government. That money should be paid to the Soldiers forced to cover G4S' incompetence.",
