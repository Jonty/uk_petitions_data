        "additional_details": "This petition is for people who believe that Britain should be amongst the fore-runners of the world who take military action in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe British should not stand back and watch chemical weapons being used against any peoples. As we have the capability to specifically target chemical stockpiles without any direct risk of loss of British life we have a moral obligation to act in a proportionate way.\r\n\r\nAs in a British Court of Law it is 'beyond reasonable doubt' that the recent chemical attacks was carried out by Government forces. As a deterrent as well as a punishment a short period of military action is justified.\r\n\r\nA strike should occur from afar where possible to destroy chemical weapons stockpile or manufacturing facilities. After an attack the UK should then withdraw as soon as reasonably possible.Any strike would target military targets and avoid the potiential death of innocent Syrian civilians.",
