This move should be blocked immediately by parliamentary measures. This is yet another EU measure that will further erode British national identity.\r\n\r\nNo concession should be made to the EU on this issue and should be blocked immediately and an indepth review carried out as to how the country has arrived in a position where the EU can dictate these changes.\r\n ",
