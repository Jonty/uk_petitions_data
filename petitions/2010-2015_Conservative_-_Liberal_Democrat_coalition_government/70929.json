        "additional_details": "Parents who work full time often struggle to cope with childcare before and after school. Work commitments are further tested by having to provide childcare for the 13 weeks of annual holiday that children and teachers receive. What makes the situation worse however is the additional stress caused by extra 'Teacher Training Days' which could easily be taken in the 13 weeks of annual leave the teachers have. I'm not against teachers but when the average annual leave for workers in the UK is 5 weeks a year these extra 5 days are a significant issue that causes problems for hard working parents. I propose that the government makes it compulsory for schools to provide this training in existing holiday time to ease the burden on working parents.",
