        "additional_details": "My proposal is to break up Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and share it with surrounding councils. This in my view would save government money, cutting it's deficit in an easy and effective way.\r\n\r\nKnowsley Metropolitan Borough Council have been neglecting residents of Whiston, Prescot, Huyton, Halewood and Cronton for some time now. Kirkby only seem to be benefiting from any means of regeneration, where as the rest of Knowsley is being left to fester, rot and decay.\r\n\r\nMy plan:\r\n\r\nPrescot, Whiston and Cronton would join St Helens.\r\n\r\nKirkby and Knowsley Village would join Sefton.\r\n\r\nHuyton, Tarbock, Page Moss, Stockbridge and Halewood would join Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIf you are in favour of this proposal, please sign and let others know who you think would support this.\r\n\r\nPlease check out the Facebook page:\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/Abolish-Knowsley-Metropolitan-Borough-Council/217555561635285?fref=ts",
