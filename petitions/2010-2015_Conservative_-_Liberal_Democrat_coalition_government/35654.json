        "additional_details": "This is a campaign to establish April 21st as the official day to digitally celebrate the Queen\u2019s birthday. The day will consist of participants wishing the queen a happy birthday through whatever digital process they like to use.\r\n\r\nThe rise of technology and the prominence of social networks have created the custom of wishing someone a happy birthday through digital means. Breakthroughs in technology happen through improving on the traditional way; by building a more efficient process.\r\n\r\nWhile we respect the tradition of celebrating the Queen\u2019s birthday on a Saturday in June; the digital industry got where it is today by going against tradition; so it would be fitting for us to be allowed to celebrate on the date chosen, creating a digital tradition. We do not intend to take away from the public celebration as our birthday wishes will only exist in the digital world.\r\n",
