        "additional_details": "When road traffic accidents occur it is up to the police to ascertain the speeds (and other parameters) of the vehicles involved. This is done by measuring any witness marks on the road and other observations. In many cases these may be in dispute. A calibrated black box similar to those on aircraft, would overcome this problem and help resolve legal disputes.  The government should debate this with a view to their introduction on new vehicles.",
