A significant proportion of this could be diverted to regional airports , Northolt and Stanstead, thus freeing existing capacity for increased passenger traffic.\r\n\r\nThe modernisation and improvements to regional airports to take this traffic and the required road and rail infrastructure to serve them could take place with less disruption to the UK economy as a whole and increase the amount of regional investment.\r\n\r\nThe government should consider the practicalities of this option which, in the short term would require little legislation and much reduced disruption.\r\n\r\nIf acceptable this option could result in a much more immediate boost to the UK economy.\r\n",
