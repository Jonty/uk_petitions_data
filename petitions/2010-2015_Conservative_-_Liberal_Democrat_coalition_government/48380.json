        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for the immediate dismissal of PC Kelly Jones of Norfolk Police after her disgraceful actions regarding suing a business owner because she tripped over a kerb while attempting to gain rear access to a premise that was subject to a suspected break in.\r\nThis not being the first time she has jumped on the compensation bandwagon.\r\n\r\nFor a Police Officer to carry out actions like this completely undermines the constabulary\u2019s motto of \"Our Priority is You\"\r\nBy doing this, she is also risking the public fearing to report incidents in case the officer then sues them (the victim)\r\n",
