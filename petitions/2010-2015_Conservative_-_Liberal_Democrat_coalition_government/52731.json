        "additional_details": "It's important that patients are treated with care, compassion and that every attempt is made to preserve dignity at the end of their life. This is important for both a patient and their family.\r\n\r\nThe LCP is used in where medicine is unable to prevent a patient's deterioration and they are expected to die within the next 48-72 hours. It ensures symptoms which are predictable, and a natural part of dying are looked for and controlled to ease suffering at the end of their life.\r\n\r\nWithout the LCP at a time when families should be able to calmly reflect and celebrate the lives of their loved one in peace, instead patient's final days and hours will be transformed into a frenzied circus of futile interventions such as intravenous cannulae, nasoenteric feeding tubes, infusions of fluid, antibiotics and CPR.\r\n\r\nAllow patients to die in peace and enable our hospital staff to facilitate this as they have been doing since the inception of the Liverpool pathway.\r\n",
