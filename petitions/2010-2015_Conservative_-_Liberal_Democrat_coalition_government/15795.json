        "additional_details": "In the 1970s and 80s, the average school would start at seven/eight and end nearly two/three. Nowadays, children are facing school starting at eight and ending at, sometimes, five (including journey time it could be possible more)\r\n\r\nThis could make a child extremely exhausted and has been seen to lead to depression and stress. Give children their freedom and enjoyment, recommended by leading psychologists, back. Some of the most thriving (and happy) schools in the world such as those in India and Sri Lanka start slightly early and end slightly early.\r\n\r\nThis gives more time for children to study and this petition should most possible affect those in late primary school/early secondary school years.\r\n\r\n I would like to see a more fair and even distribution of the holidays.\r\n",
