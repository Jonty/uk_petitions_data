        "additional_details": "As a nation of animal lovers it is time NOW that we do something about the increasing problem of vicious dogs and irresponsible owners/breeders in this country. Dog licensing laws need to be set out and regulated properly to stop this wave of cruelty sweeping our nation. I understand it is an inconvenience to us responsible owners but I believe we also know something must be done.\r\nWe propose:\r\nAll dog owners to pay a for a licence to own a dog...this dog must be registered with an official vets and put on a nationally recognised owner register, micro chipped, vaccinated regularly, neutered/spayed (unless being used for breeding, for which further licensing rules/regulations would apply) and dogs must be kept on a lead in public areas if they have behavioural issues (see:yellowdoguk.co.uk)\r\nFees to go towards costs of owner education/training along with implementing dog wardens to investigate reports of irresponsible owners and take action where required to get them prosecuted heavily.",
