        "additional_details": "Drug Discovery in the pharmaceutical industry is in the midst of a big change: many UK companies are reducing internal research programs in therapeutic areas which are not economic. This petition proposes two changes to patent law:\r\n1 A greater emphasis on research into less tractable therapeutic areas, by providing a more equitable and transparent period for a return on investment.\r\n2 Adopting a \u201cpublication-conditioned grace period\" similar to a US law, where disclosure by the inventor, of a new idea doesn\u2019t destroy novelty, provided a patent is filed within 1 year.\r\nThese changes in patent law would drive growth in research in challenging disease areas like dementia, and provide a transparent and equitable reimbursement regime coupled with little impact on government budgets, makes the case compelling.\r\nThus we call on the government to revise patent laws:\r\n1 Start the period of exclusivity from time of marketing\r\n2 Adopt a USA style \u201cpublication-conditioned grace period\"",
