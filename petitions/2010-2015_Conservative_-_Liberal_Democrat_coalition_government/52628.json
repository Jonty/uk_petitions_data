        "additional_details": "In order to employ more doctors and nurses in NHS hospitals, slash the number of admin staff.  Also, drastically reduce the inflated salaries of the Chief Executive Officers of every NHS trust and take the 'company' cars away from them.  As all hospitals are computerized, do we need so many pen-pushers?  Also, do the pen-pushers have to walk around the hospital in twos?\r\n\r\nIf the at least half of the admin staff were sacked, the money saved from this could be used to employ more doctors and nurses.\r\n\r\nAlso, stop the top brass from all NHS trusts going abroad on fact finding missions abroad and taking the partners with them.  After all, there is the internet from which they could find out any facts they may need which is a lot cheaper.",
