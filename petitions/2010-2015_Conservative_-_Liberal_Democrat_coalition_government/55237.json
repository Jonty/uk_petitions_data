        "additional_details": "Under pension reforms firefighters are being forced to work as front line firefighters until they're 60 and then they may still not receive a full pension.\r\nContribution rates for the scheme currently stand at an average of 13.2% and are due to rise to at least 15%.\r\nThe governments own report claims that the recommended fitness standard for operational firefighters is unattainable for the majority of the population after the age of 55. This means that firefighters who have paid for their pension and have risked their lives selflessly, face the possibility of being sacked for failing fitness tests in their late 50s. This is turn means they lose all of their pension.\r\nAlternatively they can try to hide injuries etc to reach full pension age, putting themselves and the public and risk.\r\nFirefighters face working up to an extra 10 years, paying more in contributions and getting less in return; if they get anything at all.\r\nIs this any way to treat our heros? Surely it's wrong.",
