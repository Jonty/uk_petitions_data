        "additional_details": "Much art owned by the nation is rarely shown and kept in storage by the Galleries that have them.  By creating more gallery space to show these works permanently, you create jobs in the construction of the new galleries, jobs working at the galleries and income generated by sales and increased tourism.  Plus the nation gets to admire more art we'd otherwise not see.",
