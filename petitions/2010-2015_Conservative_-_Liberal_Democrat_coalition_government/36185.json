Many people with sports related injuries are poorly served by current NHS services.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to discuss increasing the provision of Sport & Exercise Medicine services in the NHS.\r\n\r\nIN DETAIL: The 2012 Olympic Games promised to deliver a \u2018Health Legacy\u2019 and encourage UK citizens to engage in more healthy exercise or sport. A direct result of the Olympic bid was the creation in 2005 of a new medical speciality called \u2018Sport & Exercise Medicine (SEM)\u2019 for the NHS. Currently these services are only available in very few NHS areas.\r\n\r\nMost people who do regular brisk walking, jogging, running or competitive sport will get an injury or illness at some point. We believe that everyone in the UK should have access to an SEM service via their GP or Emergency Department. ",
