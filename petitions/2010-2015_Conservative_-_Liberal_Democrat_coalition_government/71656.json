Despite these statistics, cigarette companies continue to package their products in a way that attracts young people.\r\n\r\nStandardising cigarette packaging would eliminate this. With around 600 children in the UK taking up smoking each day, the government need to act fast to ban advertising on cigarette boxes.",
