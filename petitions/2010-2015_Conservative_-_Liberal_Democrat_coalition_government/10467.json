        "additional_details": "It has now got to a stage where we have far too many police officers policing the police instead of being on the beat. We have the IPCC, also each force has a large public complaints department (professional standards) staffed by sergeants, inspectors and above this is sheer waste of public money and time. We do not want rotten apples but we are sick of the police being scared to do their job in case of complaints by the public. People found making false complaint should be charged with wasting police time as it stands you can make a false complaint against an officer and nothing is done when proven false this I feel this is unjust.",
