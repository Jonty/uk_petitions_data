        "additional_details": "Town centre businesses in North Lincolnshire are under fierce and often unfair, competition. from out-of-town shopping areas that provide shoppers with free parking. If OUR community centres in North Lincolnshire are to survive a concerted effort is  required to positively encourage shoppers to visit our town centres. Parking costs are off-putting and very often persuade shoppers to go elsewhere which costs our high street and local economy millions of pounds in lost revenue\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to help to raise this concern not just in National Government, but more importantly in Local Government, which is  to whom we pay our local taxes.\r\n\r\nAll  we ask is for, \"2 Hours Free Parking\", at any time of the day, in all car parks, 7 days a week so that we can compete on a fair and equal basis!!",
