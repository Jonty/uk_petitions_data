        "additional_details": "A charge for people who waste the time of the emergency services. People who seriously need an ambulance are sometimes not getting one within time that could save their life, as time wasters call for non serious conditions or simply think the ambulance service as a taxi firm. The government should introduce a compulsory charge on people that call an ambulance, which is then waived if the health service decides that the patient did actually require an ambulance. ",
