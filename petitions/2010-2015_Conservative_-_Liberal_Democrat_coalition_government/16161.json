In this time of austerity, more and more football fans are being priced out of attending matches. This is the country that gave football to the world yet football clubs are systematically increasing their prices and making the game unaffordable to a greater number of people than ever before. These constant price rises have to stop - Football fans are being held to ranson with very little sway or influence within the corridors of power to put a stop to this. The FA appear powerless to halt this so its time for the goverment to step in, take action and put a stop to it.",
