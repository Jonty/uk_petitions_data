        "action": "As a reserve currency the UK Government should have the same independent controls over Sterling as the EU Central Bank/Commission over the Euro",
        "additional_details": "The requirement for the UK not to join the Euro is enshrined in EU legislation. Sterling is the worlds 3rd revserve currency.\r\nTherefore the minimum requirement to meet this EU obligation and for the stability of Sterling (and the resultant effect on  the Euro) is that the UK Government (as the 2nd/3rd largest economy in the EU) must be free to take whatever independant legal and legislative measures are required (free from EU commission interference), of fiscal, monetary, banking and macro/micro economic to ensure the health and strength of  Sterling, (though obviously cognisant on the effects on the Euro and EU and visa versa).\r\nThis ability not only affects the growth of the UK but the EU as a whole. It must be a partnership of equal central banks. Along with the other central banks of the US, Japan and other G8 members.\r\nAll EU legislation must reflect this requirement.\r\nRef Jefferson's agreement to Assumption, Times 9/1/13",
