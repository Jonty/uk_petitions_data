        "additional_details": "Are you a student midwife or nurse? Have you had problems receiving the correct amount of bursary or not had your bursary paid due to the incompetence of the nhs bursary department? For too long students have not been listened to and not been paid their bursary on time due to paperwork being processed incorrectly or even lost. Many of us have families and rely solely on this money to survive. There is no way to speed the process up and this is unacceptable. They do not have any process in place to inform us when relevant paperwork is missing and the first we hear of it is when the money is not transferred into our accounts.It then takes up to 21 days to rectify the situation. How is this acceptable? We work hard and long hours for the benefit of others. Please sign this petition and let's see what we can do. We are the future of theNHS and we must be heard! ",
