The electorate was presented with a straight choice between \"yes\" or \"no\" to independence.\r\n\r\nSince the conclusion of the referendum result, there has been a flurry of intentions announced to deliver further devolution to Scotland \"as demanded by the people of Scotland\".\r\n\r\nThere is NO political mandate for pursuing a further devolution settlement.  As this option was left off the ballot paper, it should not be pursued when voters did not have the chance to vote in favour or against further devolution.  The Government must not pursue these proposals having failed to put them to the electorate.",
