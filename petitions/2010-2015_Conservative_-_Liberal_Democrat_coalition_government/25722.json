I believe that he managed to get a housing when he needed it, but he no longer needs a social housing. there are lots of families with low wages or no wages in need of a local social and has to get in debt or become homeless so they can get a social housing.  I would like that if your wages 5 times more than the social you should be receive a three-month notice from the social housing and get the help in the private market with your rent.",
