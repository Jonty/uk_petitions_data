Change the Air pistol Limit 12 FT LB of energy.\r\nLegalize bow hunting Vermin and Foxes if a bows drawl weight is 40 pounds and above. Allow .22 rim fire pistols under the Section One firearms. Legalize semi auto .243  calibre rifles under the section one firearms. Allow public land to be used as a hunting in appropriate areas.\r\nReasons...\r\nWith an 12 FT LB air rifle it is difficult to humanly kill rabbits and pests, I can understand you don't want dangerous hi powered air rifles but 18 FT LB can not\r\ncause fatal damage and there is no valid reason not to legalize this.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ",
