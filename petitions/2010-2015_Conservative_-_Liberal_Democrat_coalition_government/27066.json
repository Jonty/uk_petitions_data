        "additional_details": "This petition is opposing the proposed move of Aylestone library\r\nRichmond Road,\r\nLeicester,\r\nLE2 8BB\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nAylestone Leisure Centre,\r\n2 Knighton Lane East,\r\nLeicester,  LE2 6LU.\r\n\r\nAylestone library is a small, listed building which provides a fantastic facility for Aylestone residents. The proposal is to move the library and make a self-service room at Aylestone leisure centre.  The sports centre is a large, noisy building which has no atmosphere. A librarian and assistants will either face redundancy or have to move to another job within the council.\r\n",
