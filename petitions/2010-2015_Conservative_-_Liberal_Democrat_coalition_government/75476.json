        "additional_details": "Our anthem of our collective group of countries, principalities etc, is and should rightly remain \"God Save The Queen\".\r\n\r\nHowever, Wales, Scotland and the commonwealth all have indevidual anthems, that represent who they are as a nation, that can stir the collective conciousness. No anthem can compare to that of the Welsh \"Land of my fathers\"\r\n\r\nEngland is the only country that has no anthem it can call it's own, and my proposition is this; At sporting events our national song should be \"I Vow To Thee My Country\" a song that can bring the crowd together and get people going.\r\n\r\nIt's great that we all want to get behind Great Britain, but it's time to get behind England too.",
