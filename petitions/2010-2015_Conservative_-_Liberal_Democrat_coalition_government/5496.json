        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament at the earliest opportunity to legislate to legalise prostitution in England and instead to subject the world's oldest trade to a system of regulation through licencing, restriction and regular health checks.  The trade will never be entirely stamped out and so long as it remains illegal it will be mainly the route for desperate women with drug and alcohol addictions and other problems to desperately make money.  Legalisation allows for the trade to be cleaned up and made safer.  Prostitutes would only be allowed to work in identified red light districts, would have to obtain a licence from the local authority, would have to work indoors rather than in the street and would have to be subject to regular health checks in order keep the right to trade. They would be charged for their licence and be required to produce accounts and pay taxation.",
