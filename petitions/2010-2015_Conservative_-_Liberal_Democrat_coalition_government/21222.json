The public sector should not be provided pensions that are better than the private sector at the taxpayers expense.  The funding of public sector pensions should be brought in line with the general provisions in the private sector where pension benefits are directly related to employee contributions. Public sector pensions that are better than the private sector should be related to employee contributions rather than the taxpayer.",
