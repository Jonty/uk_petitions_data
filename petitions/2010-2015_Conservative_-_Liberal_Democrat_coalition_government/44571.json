        "additional_details": "The lottery is to double in price in the autumn to \u00a32 with only 47% of the income going to winners. More fat salaries for Camelot big wigs and restrictions on the bigger prizes. What a con and in a recession. The government, try not to laugh, should have handed it over to Richard Branson who would have run it as a non profit making company. But like all previous privatisations, think utility co's and transport, it has cost us a fortune. When will this and all future Governments learn lessons from the past ? Never I suspect.",
