        "additional_details": "The Goverment must not be allowed to stop smoking in personal vehicles. This is an infringement of our human rights. It is our space that we pay for and not a public space. As smokers we should not be treated as second class citizens and should have a choice. We are not criminals yet are treated like them. Made to feel like social outcasts and now they want to stop us in the privacy of our own vehicle! This is victimisation, compromise and not smoke if children are present but on a long solo journey then its our choice and we should have one!",
