        "additional_details": "Dear Sir/Madam my friend and I have came up with an ingenious idea of tackling riots in this country. Most of the problem with rioters is they feel invisible and are most likely to get away with it. So we have came up with using an adapted water cannon that sprays a dye pack or ink used on bank notes for bank robbery's. Whoever is caught within the spray radius shouldn't be there and then can positively be identified up to 4 or 5 days later because the inks and dyes are designed to soak into the skin for days. Can you imagine the possibility's, descent and normal people would notify the police within hours of suspected rioters.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nPaul Short\r\nMartyn Gilleece",
