        "additional_details": "To the House of Commons,\r\nThe petition created by Sarah Roberts declares that laws governing the protection of Raptors in the UK are not currently suitable to ensure the safety of such birds in private ownership. This may refer to those indulging in 'Falconry' or 'Hawk-keeping'.\r\nThe petitioner therefore requests that a license be created which requires such a person to undergo mandatory training before obtaining a bird in accordance with standards set down or advised by experts in this field e.g. The Hawk Board. This license would demonstrate that this person is aware of the responsibility they are taking on and are capable of looking after a Raptor. This would result in fewer birds being unintentionally harmed by misguided members of the public and also improve the safety of the handler.",
