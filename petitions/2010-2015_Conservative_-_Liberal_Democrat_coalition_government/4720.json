        "additional_details": "On August 1st 2011, 'Yorkshire Day' was the most typed thing in the whole of Britain, on the social networking site Twitter. This shows how the people of Yorkshire recognise it as their cultural day, just as the Scots & Welsh recognise St Andrew's & St David's day, respectively.\r\n\r\nAs such, we call on the government to recognise Yorkshire Day (August 1st) as the official day of Yorkshire & make it a bank holiday, within the accepted & historic boundaries of the county.",
