This is in breach of promise to all those who have been paying into pensions in the 38 years to the run-up to the first raid.\r\n\r\nThe courts, to their shame, have rubber stamped this raid.  It may be legal but it is not just after all this time of promising RPI.\r\n\r\nAnyone who trusts government as an employer after this raid needs their head examining.\r\n\r\nMy petition is to restore the RPI to those it was promised to as soon as it becomes possible to do so.\r\n\r\nI would not have complained if it were a temporary measure for the country\u2019s sake but to make it a permanent feature is theft.\r\n",
