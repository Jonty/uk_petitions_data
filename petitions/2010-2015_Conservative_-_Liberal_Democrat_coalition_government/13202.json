        "additional_details": "I would like to petition Parliament to debate the relationship between the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Atos Origin (Atos); in particular the largesse funded by Atos, either directly or through industry groups i.e. is it appropriate that senior DWP officials attend \"black tie\" and other events, and whether sufficient independent controls and audits are in place to prevent undue influence on the actions of the DWP.  Following the recent alleged undue influence of a large media company, I would like Parliament to debate whether there are sufficient checks in place to detect collusion between large suppliers in competing for government contracts. A recent Atos annual report claims that Atos makes the highest margin from the DWP in Europe.  Parliament should debate whether this is consistent with value for money objectives and to debate whether such claims should be reviewed and influence the drafting and awarding of subsequent contracts.",
