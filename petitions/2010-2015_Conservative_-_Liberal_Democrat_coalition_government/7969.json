We disagree wholeheartedly with the petition titled \"Convicted London rioters should loose all benefits\" and believe that to protect shops and homes in the long term, and understanding of the underlying issues instead of just vilifying communities must take place. We petition the Home Office to provide a detailed report into the decades of factors that have led to unrest and to put in place community regeneration schemes to ensure it doesn't happen again. We all believe that to give these communities what they want doesn't mean the rioters win, but only that they receive what they have deserved for decades already. If we are to paint everyone with the same brush when it comes to prosecution, we must also do the same when it comes to opportunity, to ensure we do not live in a bifurcated nation.",
