This has been a more pressing issue after the nights of violence seen in London and elsewhere in the country. For too long, discipline in this country has been far too ignored and the consequences of it has been played out in the mobs and thugs that terrorised our streets, businesses and public property. Every single young person should be made to do it. ",
