It was  signed by Mr Edward Heath MP as Prime Minister, he did so without the prior approval of the British people by means of a General election or Referendum in contravention of the British Constitution .Even though Harold Wilson tried to validate the signing of the European Communities Act by means of a post dated referendum, this cannot have any basis in law in view of the \"Wednesbury Reasonable protocol \"  where  Baron Diplock, KC, an English judge and Law Lord, stated that a decision that is \"So outrageous in its defiance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",
