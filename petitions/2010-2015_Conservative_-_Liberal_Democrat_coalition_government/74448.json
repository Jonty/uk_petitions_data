        "additional_details": "We call upon the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to ensure that Ex-Forces personnel are exempt from the Age-Related Limit on Housing Benefit.\r\nThe limit on housing benefit for people under the age of 35 is an unfair rule, which blatantly discriminates against single servicemen and woman, many of whom leave the forces and, through no fault of their own fall into homelessness. This is unjust, unfair and no way to treat people whom have laid their lives on the line for all of us.\r\nWe call upon the Secretary of State to amend the rule with immediate effect.",
