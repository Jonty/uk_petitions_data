        "additional_details": "Recent riots demonstrated that many youths in UK today lack moral fibre, discipline, ambition & goals in life; being anti-establishment, rebellious, feeling invincible, influenced by friends who commit crimes, under the influence of drugs & alcohol. Encouragement should also be given to educate youngsters (as soon as they are able to speak) to act responsibly, being accountable for their actions & deeds, being courteous, considerate & helpful towards others. HMG should facilitate educating schoolchildren with morality, responsibility, ambition, self-control, joys of hard work, diligence, thrift. Youths' upbringing nowadays are often lax, treating life as a big joke & for their own pleasures (including abusing alcohol & drugs) with no regard of the consequences and used to get their own ways without being responsible or being accountable. Of course to be ambitious also would require suitable role models & work.",
