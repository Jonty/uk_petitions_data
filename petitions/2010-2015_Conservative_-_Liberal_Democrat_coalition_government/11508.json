        "additional_details": "With the recent riots, upcoming olympics, ever increasing gang culture and future cuts in public welfare and services, this is not the time to reduce police numbers. To do so would be a false economy. The economic and social cost of crime would outweigh any cuts in the short term, but more seriously in the longer term it will leave a depended legacy of criminal culture. We have all felt reassured by the response of the police in showing they can effectively and publicly bring those who committed crime to justice. The knowledge has had a profound impact on those who may consider committing crime and reassuring the rest of us that we live in a just society. We do not need political rhetoric, we need an effective well funded police force and a judiciary that is willing to support them.",
