        "additional_details": "As followers/believers of various religions decrease, probably by negligible by the turn of the next millennium (22nd century), we should convert buildings and land owned by churches, temples, etc for other more fruitful purposes; like for drop-in centres, hostels, prisons, housing, theme parks, schools, industries, etc. Not everyone (or even every religion) believe in heaven and the afterlife. Britain is a secular society with many believers of many faiths or no faith (like agnostics or atheists). It is not necessary to state religious belief when admitted to hospital unless the patient so wishes. A person who has no faith also would often like to be buried with their brethren of the faith of their birth or of their fore parents, though. It is also true that a person can be claim affinity to a religion even if not a practising one. ",
