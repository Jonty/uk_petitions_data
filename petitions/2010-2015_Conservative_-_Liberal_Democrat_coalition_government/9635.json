        "additional_details": "Prisons are filled with benefit recipients or people who never work. Those people cannot lose anything because they do not own anything. Prison is of no punishment to them. Their actions are without consequences, therefore they repeat and continue to commit crime. There is no deterrent to prevent unwanted behavior in future. Society has no leverage on these people. The government cannot afford more prisoners at around \u00a330000 per head per annum. Prisons in the U.K are full. Sending rioters and serial offenders to prison will cost more than the damage they cause. China is the biggest supplier for consumer goods and will make these people work in a controlled environment, produce and therefore repay their debt to society humanely at a fraction of the cost they occur in the U.K..
