        "additional_details": "The 'strengthened' Eng Lit GCSE will ensure many learners are unable to succeed, even if they are sensitive readers. Closed book conditions will require candidates to remember a minimum of 15 poems in order to 'closely analyse' two of them in an exam. Ofqual needs to explain how close analysis is enabled by removing entirely from sight the object to be closely analysed. With 80% of marks available for this skill, it is clear that standards will be depressed. Worse, the draconian closed book ruling is set to drive another nail into the coffin of inclusive education. Ofqual must allow boards to address this before first teaching of the new GCSEs begins in 2015. If you care about access for all and English Literature the way it should be assessed, please sign.",
