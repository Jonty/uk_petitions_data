        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to put into plan a new bypass that links the M6 J18 to the heart of Cheshire without going through the middle of Middlewich town centre.\r\n\r\nThe traffic that congests this small town is horrendous and causes major problems for all the residents and people going about their daily lives. Air and noise pollution is very disruptive to everyone in the town and a new bypass which links the M6 to Winsford or the Chester Road (A54) would alleviate this problem instantaneously! ",
