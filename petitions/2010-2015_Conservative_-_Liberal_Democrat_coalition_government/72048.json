The older people of Gateshead need a voice and have people stand up for them. If the service is scrapped then they will not have know what to do. Older people like things to stay the same and don't like change and they get used to the same face which call to see them. A lot of these people don't have families and rely on neighbours and friends for help. They trust a council, when they provide a service like this.",
