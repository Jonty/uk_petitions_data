        "additional_details": "Domestic glue traps are currently on general sale throughout the UK, marketed as a DIY means of administering rodent pest control. Comprising of a simple cardboard or plastic strip coated in a strong adhesive, the glue trap is designed to ensnare mice and other small creatures, resulting in needless physical suffering and a cruel and lingering death. Glue traps have already been outlawed in the Republic of Ireland and a growing number of other countries, therefore we, the undersigned, request that the Government considers the introduction of an outright ban on the sale and use of glue traps in the United Kingdom.\r\n",
