        "additional_details": "The governments persistent interference with religion more particularly the Christian church is causing the church to loose both its identity and direction, I say that if government does not stop its attacks on the civilised Christian faith, its values, its morality and above all else its sanctity then the church should rise to the challenge and enter into government.\r\n\r\nSo many laws being passed in such great numbers nowadays cause problems for everybody, many also force the church to have to alter the Christian scriptures and teachings to suite certain mostly left wing extremist minority groups, who seem to all so commonly control both the government and the greater majority of the British people.\r\n\r\nIn short if the government does not stop its mindless meddling in matters of the church, then I suggest that the church should start meddling in the affairs of government by forming its own political party!\r\n\r\nPlease show your support for this petition, Thank you!",
