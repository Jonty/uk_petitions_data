Snafu has had to be relocated and is only a temporary fixture in Westgate chambers along with Jaxx and now Elliots is closing. Pretty soon there will be no night-life left in Rotherham as closing all these bars down will eventually have a detrimental effect on the remaining pubs and clubs so please do not close yet another much loved pub in Rotherham and make Rotherham even more of a ghost town.",
