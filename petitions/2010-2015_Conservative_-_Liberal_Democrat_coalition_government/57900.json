        "additional_details": "The government wants consumers to invest \u00a311bn in the Smart Meters for homes. There has been no public consultation. There are concerns about wireless emissions from Smart Meters but UK research isn\u2019t complete; worries about data security, hacking and grid security; about privacy and the future use of Smart Meter data as a basis for taxation and levies; concerns about Smart Meters cutting off or restricting supplies to homes.\r\n\r\nSmart Meters allow variable tariffs (prices per kWh). There\u2019s no guarantee that present tariffs will go on. DECC think Smart Meters might save consumers just 3%, perhaps 5%. For \u00a311bn ?\r\n\r\nThe Germans decided that Smart Meters simply aren\u2019t worth the money. This Government could make exactly the same decision.\r\n\r\nParliament must review this extravagant project, review the full facts and introduce regulatory safeguards for the consumer - especially on variable tariffs.\r\n",
