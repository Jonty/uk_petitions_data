        "additional_details": "The Traffic lights in Jackfield, Shropshire are dangerous, they are causing traffic chaos. School children have to wait in driveways to avoid being run over whilst motorists are racing through when the lights go green. The lights were put up as a safety measure as this road is being heavily used due to the Crown Hole on Ironbridge Road, they are far from safe and there will be a major incident. We would like to see the removal of the lights.",
