British citizenship CANNOT be so cheap that its rights may be conferred on somebody who might live here for one day and be gone the next.  We who ARE british citizens demand that our citizenship is treated with the respect it deserves and is NOT cheapened and degraded by the outlook of our political elite who see diversity as the ONLY solution, WHICH IT IS NOT.",
