        "additional_details": "National Insurance should be treated as a private insurance scheme. All contributions paid by an individual can only be used by that individual for any or all medical expenses,( Emergency or on going medical problems). Any costs incurred will be paid back from what has been put into the pot, or what you pay later on. Any funds that have been paid in also can be accsesed as part of a persons pension when retiring. Making this an actual insurance policy rather then a tax you might never need. If an individual chooses to pay into a private health plan,(Reducing costs to the NHS) then their NI conttributions are reduced. They still have to pay some, to cover any emergency treatment, ambulance etc, plus contributing to any who don't have insurance.",
