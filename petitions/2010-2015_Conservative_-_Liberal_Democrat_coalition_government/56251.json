        "additional_details": "I call upon the department of work and pensions to only provide financial support in the form of child benefit or the child element of Tax Credit for the maximum of 2 children.  Any subsequent children, the parents will have to support by making sacrifices like they did years ago before people got all these handouts for each child.  They managed than, so they'll manage now. Any parent or parents who have a large family, who is earning a low wage, then faIr enough, allow them to claim for all the children.  If anybody loses their job through no fault of their own, then allow them to claim for all chilren for up to the first 12 months.  Anybody who has never worked, then it stops after 2 children.  This is fairer for the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time and trouble to read this.",
