        "additional_details": "When I was younger, one of the things I loved about going to the seaside was my bag of fish and chips. Of course they were wrapped up in newspaper as was the tradition across the country.\r\n\r\nNow it is not allowed due to hygiene and issues with ink etc. contaminating your chips.\r\n\r\nThese days, you sometimes find food is now wrapped up in polystyrene packaging, which is toxic, which melts and sticks to your food, not to mention it takes years to break down when disposed of, unlike the typical newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe 'cleaner' things get for children, the longer it takes to build up their immune system, the more prone to illness and disease they become.\r\n\r\nBring back the newspaper wrapping and start looking at what is really contaminating our food and lives for a change!",
