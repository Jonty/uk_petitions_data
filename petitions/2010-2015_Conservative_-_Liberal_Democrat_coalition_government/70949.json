        "additional_details": "To bring sanctions against Japan by the United Kingdom until all whaling and hunting of cetaceans is stopped by Japan. Including the atrocities in Taiji Japan. Japan claim their hunting of cetaceans is tradition because of the dolphin and whale meat. The drive hunt is  about selling cetaceans into the captivity industry for marine parks etc.. The way the cetaceans are slaughtered is barbaric taking the cetaceans 20 to 30 minutes to die. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a ruling that Japan are NOT to go whaling in the Southern Ocean. However Japan have publicly stated they will continue. Governments globally including the UK government have officially condemned Japan's  yet still the Japanese government continue. The UK government must impose sanctions against Japan in order to make this cruelty stop.",
