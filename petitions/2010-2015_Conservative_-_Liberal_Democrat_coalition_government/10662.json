A combined  ID-NI card should be required in UK whenever someone is taking up new employment, seeking NHS treatment, schooling, seeking DWP benefits, when arrested etc. A merged NI and ID card should contain a biometric photo (like present passport) and contain details about nationality, the right to take up employment and use services like for NHS treatment. Such ID cards are also the best way to count foreign immigrants in and out of UK. People on student visas are not allowed to work full-time but many on student visas came to UK with the only intention of working. ID cards can check & identify that those on student visas (mainly studying), work permits (doing identified jobs) are observing the requirements of their visas.",
