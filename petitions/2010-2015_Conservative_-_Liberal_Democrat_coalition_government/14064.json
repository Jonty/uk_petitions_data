Thus, Turkey and Iran not only attack the territories of the sovereign state of Iraq and stand against the international norms, but also bring about a humanitarian catastrophe inside the territories of Iraqi Kurdistan Region in front of the eyes of the international community.\r\n\r\nFor the shocking images of the civilian victims of Turkey\u2019s air strike of 21st August 2011, please visit:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chatrpress.com/Detail.aspx?id=5647&LinkID=3",
