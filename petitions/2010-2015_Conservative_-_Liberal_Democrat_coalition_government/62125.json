        "additional_details": "I believe the current National Anthem does not show to the rest of the world how patriotic England can be. I think the monotonous chanting of 'God Save the Queen' does little to inspire anyone and I think it is of popular opinion that it should be changed. I do not think the song will be too long, countries such as South Africa and Ireland have national anthems just as long.\r\n\r\nPlease sign for change to our culture and more pride amongst English and British people",
