        "additional_details": "The Percentage Threshold Scheme (PTS) which enables small businesses to recover Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) has been removed from April 6th 2014. This could have catastrophic effects on small businesses as they will now have to foot the full burden of paying SSP. Plus they have to cover the cost of temporary staff. The PTS should be reinstated for small businesses. It will have negligible effect on government finances (\u00a350m per year) but may stop some businesses going bust",
