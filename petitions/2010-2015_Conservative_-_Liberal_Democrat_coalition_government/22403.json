Personally I think that this language is really beutiful and goes back such a long way, I also think it should become an extra subject that can be taken in the student's own time, maybe after school as a extra cirricular activite but they may choose to do it as a GCSE later on. this can also be said for Latin, Aincent Greek and many other dying out languges. although it would be a lovley idea, as i said before not many people can speak it now, therefore it would be  hard to find tutors, but it could be a worthwhi9le project, in my eyes.
