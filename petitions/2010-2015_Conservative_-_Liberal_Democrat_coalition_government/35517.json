        "additional_details": "Children of any age should not be removed from their loving birth parents, and should not face separation and Forced Adoption. In order to prevent False accusations becoming fact, which then go on to have devastating consequences and a detrimental impact on innocent children, who are our next generation, all allegations of significant harm should be investigated appropriately and dealt with accordingly. In such cases where Police do not have any evidence of possible convictions, and where no further action is required, children should not be removed from their parents. If there are any concerns then children and families should be supported by appropriate agencies, which would prevent any wrongful removal of children and Forced Adoptions. It is not appropriate at that stage to commence care proceedings which is currently what many families are exposed to. There is clear evidence in our care system that it is damaging our children within it, not protecting them.",
