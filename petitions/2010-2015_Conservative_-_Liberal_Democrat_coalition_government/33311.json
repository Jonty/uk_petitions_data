        "additional_details": "At present, footballers participating in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League will receive a one match suspension if they collect 3 yellow cards between Matchday 1 until the end of the tournament. This rule has resulted in the suspension of key players towards the latter stages of the tournament.\r\n\r\nOn average, 6 yellow cards are distributed per game in the in European matches, and as a result, teams striving to reach the Final are severely disadvantaged due to the low amount of cautions leading to a suspension.\r\n\r\nBy increasing the number of cautions leading to a one -match suspension to 5, both clubs and supporters will benefit from much more exciting matches with world class players on show, whilst players who, having collected 4 yellow cards, deserve to be suspended and will not feature.\r\n\r\nThis decision would be for the benefit of the game.",
