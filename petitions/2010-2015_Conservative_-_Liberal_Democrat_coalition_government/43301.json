        "additional_details": "Petition to introduce Amsterdam's cannabis law into the UK and give public house owners the option to rent out empty premises to Cannabis coffee shop managers.\r\nPublic houses are closing at a rate of 18 a week and empty pubs are being left to go derelict. One of the reasons is due to people no longer being able to smoke in pubs and another is that non-drinkers are being penalized in pubs by the price of soft drinks. A soft drink in this country costs an average of \u00a32 per bottle when you can buy a pint of alcohol for \u00a31.90.\r\nCoffee shops provide a place to socialize with other non-drinkers keeping young adults off the streets and away from crime.\r\nThere are 2.51 million unemployed people in the UK which this could provide many jobs for.\r\nPublic house owners would receive rent on their property and on sales of soft drinks.\r\nGovernment could moderate Cannabis use and also receive tax revenue from the businesses.",
