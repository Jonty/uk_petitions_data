        "additional_details": "As someone who is forced to endure Heart FM in the workplace, I am petitioning for legislation to ensure Heart FM offers the 'More Music Variety' that they trail. The Heart FM playlist has the narrowest choice of music and the most repetition I have ever heard on radio. They seem to play the same tracks throughout the day. They still have Blurred Lines and Get Lucky being played several times a day. This songs are well over 6 months old. Even when they play oldies they seem to play the same ones. Give It Up by KC & The Sunshine Band and Now That we've Found Love by Heavy D & The Boyz are played constantly.\r\n\r\nThis kind of repetition is mind numbing and not condusive to a good working enviroment. I suggest the Department for Culture, Media & Sport investigate this issue and step in to instigate changes.",
