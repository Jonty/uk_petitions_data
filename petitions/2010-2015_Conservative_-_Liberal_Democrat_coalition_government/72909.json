Me and my husband struggle to afford childcare for my son, I have cut down my hours at work to look after my son and my parents also help me. My son goes to a childminder 2 days a week as that is all we can afford.\r\n\r\nI have several friends with children who have cut down hours at work as childcare is so expensive.\r\n\r\nI believe 15hrs free childcare should be available to all parents of 2 years olds no matter what your circumstances are.\r\n\r\nFree childcare would enable all children to benefit and help many families benefit financially.",
