        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon the government to posthumously award Walter Tull the Military Cross for which he was recommended.\r\nWalter was the first black outfield player in football's top flight and the first black soldier to become an infantry officer in the British army.\r\n2nd Lieutenant Walter Daniel John Tull led his men on dangerous missions behind enemy lines and returned without loss or injury. For these acts of bravery, he was cited for his \"gallantry and coolness\" under fire by Major General Sir Sydney Lawford, his commanding officer and recommended for the Military Cross. Untypically, for officers with his service record and commendation, he never received it. Was it because he embodied a contradiction? The Manual of Military Law forbade men not of 'pure European descent' from becoming officers.\r\nPlease join us in demanding the government right this historical injustice by signing this e-petition to posthumously award Walter Daniel John Tull his Military Cross.\r\n",
