        "additional_details": "The Fox Hunting Ban should be reviewed because as the ban stands, neither party is satisfied, therefore it is currently ineffective. The Hunt and others that oppose the ban are still able to continue with their activities (although there are many changes) but can still be prosecuted, people opposing The Ban, are not satisfied because foxes are continuing to be killed within the boundaries of the law. Therefore, it is apparent that The Ban should be reviewed.",
