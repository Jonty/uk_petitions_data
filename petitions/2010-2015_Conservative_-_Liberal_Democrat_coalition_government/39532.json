It is one of the less known areas of abuse and people should know what warning signs to look out for.\r\n\r\n'Emotional abuse is the persistent emotional ill-treatment....It may involve conveying to children that they are worthless or unloved, inadequate, or valued only insofar as they meet the needs of another person. Some level of emotional abuse is involved in all types of ill treatment of a child, though it may occur alone'. (Department of Health et al, 1999, p.5-6)\r\n\r\nThis happens more than people realise so the government should make it clear through a new campaign what it actually means by emotional abuse.",
