However there is one side to this which is overlooked which I feel very strongly about.\r\n\r\nIt is an offence to neglect your children, and to be drunk in charge of a child, however it is not to be drunk whilst pregnant. I have seen heavily pregnant women stumbling out of clubs and falling unconscious on the group at four am, causing untold harm to their future child.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to make it illegal to be \"drunk whilst pregnant\" this would allow the police to step in with regards to situations like the above. It would act as a deterrent to irresponsible mothers and also flag them to social services, and the health service, before the child is born.\r\n\r\nI can think of no circumstances where it would be acceptable for an expecting mother to be drunk.",
