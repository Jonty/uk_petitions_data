        "additional_details": "I would like animal testing to be banned in the uk!\r\nWe are now in the 21st century, is there really any need to be testing on an innocent, defenceless life? The answer is no. Imagine being locked up in a cage, fed just enough food to keep you alive, and you get chemicals rubbed in your eyes or toxins shoved in your stomach so others can see your reaction. This is not medical research and it needs to stop NOW. Just because animals can't speak does not mean they don't feel pain, because they do! We now have to speak for them. If you ask why people test on animals they say \"because they are like us\", but if you ask them why is it right to test on animals they say \" because they're not like us\". I am ashamed to be living in a society where my people are testing on living creatures all for the sake of humanity. There are alternatives to this, lets ban animal testing for good.",
