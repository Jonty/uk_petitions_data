        "additional_details": "Right, basically this petition is vital, it is so important!\r\nThis petition is helping me have the ability to change the judicial system in the UK.\r\n\r\nNot all cases, but 99.9% of them are so very leniant and it is terrible.\r\n\r\nSexual offenders are walking around our streets, murderers, burglars. Our streets aren't safe any more, our children, family and friends are all at risk because the justice system is basically \"a joke\" at the moment to put it in a polite manner.\r\n\r\nI have been doing extencive reseach and I have carried out many studies and are continuing to do so.\r\n\r\nI want the goverment to support this and change the system we live in. The goverment is so money driven and it is terrible and needs to be changed because, because of them trying to save the cash, again, our streets are NOT safe any more.\r\n\r\nThe goverment needs to make a drastic change and fast.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition, it is so important.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
