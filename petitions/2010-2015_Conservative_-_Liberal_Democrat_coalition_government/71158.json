        "additional_details": "This is a petition to close down whipps cross hospital in east london. Due to their appalling service and hygiene issues. Don't see why the public have to invest more money into services that we can do with out. Here are some links on what's wrong with the nhs,\r\n\r\nhttp://news.sky.com/story/1128264/whipps-cross-hospital-unsafe-and-uncaring\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/dirty-and-unsafe-whipps-cross-hospital-told-it-must-make-urgent-changes-8760165.html\r\n\r\nIf you live in East London please sign this petition as our tax money could be spent on better things for our borough, rather than just injecting more money into an already failing nhs. We don't need to invest \u00a3500m into a.&e again, as this service does just not work.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
