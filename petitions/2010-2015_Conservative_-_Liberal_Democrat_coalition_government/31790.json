        "additional_details": "The Immigration Rules relating to Overseas Domestic Workers (ODW) are due to change on the 6 April 2012.\r\n\r\nODWs will only be granted entry clearance for a period of 6 months and they will not be eligible to extend the same.  Also they will not be permitted to change employers, apply for settlement and bring their dependants to the UK.  In essence, ODWs will be treated similarly to those in the UK as visitors save for the fact that they would be permitted to work as domestic workers for the 6 month period.\r\n\r\nThe above changes are unfair and unreasonable and shall lead to exploitation and abuse of ODWs.\r\n\r\nThe government is urged to stop these changes.\r\n",
