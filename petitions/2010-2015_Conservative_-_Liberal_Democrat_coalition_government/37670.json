        "additional_details": "In 2010 Wycombe General Hospital removed their much needed maternity ward to Stokemadeville, which is a 20 mile radius to travel from high Wycombe.\r\nAlthough there is a birthing centre that exists in the hospital to give birth naturally it does not have any other emergency services available or the correct equipment to ensure a safe delivery if the mother or baby needed this.\r\nAs a result babies have been born in ambulances, and cars and babies are at serious risk if they cannot get to Stoke Madeville quick enough.Not forgetting the snow, and icy roads isn't enough and the population growing in high wycombe. Please\r\n everyone sign this petition to bring it back. ",
