        "additional_details": "SAFETY CRITICAL:\r\n\r\nWHY there are no repeaters on roads where speed limit is changed at junction - there is sign immediately after junction but nothing after let's say 200+ yards. This creates hazard because most drivers fail to notice the limit - simply because they did not finish turning. Give time to finish the maneuver then time to notice the sign!!! (for example when turning right from 50mph road into 30mph one there is limit 30mph right at beginning - ca 20yards after junction (or less) but no repeater. there should be mandatory repeater after 200+ yards.\r\n",
