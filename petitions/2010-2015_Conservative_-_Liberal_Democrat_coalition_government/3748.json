        "additional_details": "The rising cost of gas and electric continues to force families and our elderly into fuel poverty. The rising cost of petrol/diesel not only effects motorists, but increases the cost of almost everything we buy. Gas/Electricity, Petrol/Diesel are fast becoming luxury items that no-one can afford.   Are we going to return to the days of people stealing wood to keep warm or going back to coal fires?.  Where would that leave our green footprint?\r\nThe general public have helped companies like British Gas, BP, EDF & Shell get to where they are today, it\u2019s time for them to give a little back to the people that helped them get so big. Cut our fuel bills NOW!\r\n",
