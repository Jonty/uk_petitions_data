Using hateful language and discriminatory remarks, Pope Benedict\u2019s hurtful and homophobic attacks portray LGBTQ people as second-class citizens.\r\n\r\nThe Pope called same-sex marriage a \u201cmanipulation of nature\u201d to be deplored and an attack on the \u201cessence of the human creature\u201d, and policies allowing gay marriage and families \u201cthreaten human dignity and the future of humanity itself.\u201d\r\n\r\nHate crime/incitement to hatred is a criminal offence when perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice based on a personal characteristic, including sexual orientation.\r\n\r\n\"'...we should be embracing each other\u2019s differences, not persecuting each other for them.\r\nTo abuse or attack someone because of who they are is inexcusable, it denies the most basic of rights \u2013 to live life as who you are.\" L Featherstone MP, Hate Crime 14/3/12",
