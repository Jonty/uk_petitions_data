        "additional_details": "Over the past few months there has been debate on various issues, but very little with regards to energy costs or cost of living.\r\n\r\nI believe that lower prices of products and services would do the economy the world of good. Lower VAT, fuel duty and NI. Not to be funded by high borrowing, but these measures would stimulate the economy and be self-funding. For example, if we can get money flowing through the economy and get people spending we can get the economy going. That means lower benefit payouts as, in theory, more people would have jobs.\r\n\r\nHowever, the main aim of this is to get MPs to debate the issue in parliament. The cost of living must be debated at the very least. ",
