At PhD level it is possible to get the funding to support yourself whilst you study (Annual stipend) but at the MSc or MRes level there is only a credit checked career development loan which is run through a bank and demands repayment after your course regardless of your employment status.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be more accessible funding for postgrad students, especially in science ad mathematics, to develop their academic careers and give them better employment prospects.\r\n",
