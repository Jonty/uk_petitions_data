        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned do declare that the muslim head dress known as the niqab be banned in the united kingdom. This item of clothing is not only a security risk because you cannot see who is underneath but also a divisive symbol of clothing and a means of a man to control women. No where in the Koran does it state that a muslim woman must cover head to foot, it does however say a woman should dress modestly to guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears. It is the muslim male that has twisted verses and forces a woman to dress this way. just ask yourself would a non muslim male be allowed to wear a balaclava in the street unchallenged by police even on a cold winters day?",
