The fact is the overwhelming majority dont, and why should they? They came here illegally in the first place.\r\n\r\nIts a complete waste of money and resources processing paperwork and achieving nothing when you arent physically detaining the person concerned. Much cheaper in the long run repurpose redundant Army/RAF bases as detention centres.\r\n\r\nNo passport is no excuse to be left free to roam and then use false identities to rape our already creaking benefits system.\r\n\r\nWe have something to learn from Australia's stance on these matters.\r\n\r\nWe want you to detect, detain immediately and repatriate within 48 hours.",
