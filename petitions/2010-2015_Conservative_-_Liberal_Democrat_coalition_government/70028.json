        "action": "Reform GCSE/A level examiner pay from commission to a fixed wage",
        "additional_details": "Over the years, there has been a degree of uncertainty over the quality of exam marking and consistency of attention put into each paper. This has resulted in many people both underachieving and overachieving in exams which are considered to be 'vital' in securing a respectable internship, job or university place.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons this could be happening is due to examiners being paid on commission; they are paid a set amount of money per paper they mark. This puts a certain pressure for these examiners to mark as many papers as possible in order to earn more money. This can cause many errors in marking that are costing people marks, or even grades which have a substantial effect on university places.\r\n\r\nThis is a petition for a reform of this method of pay to a more effective set wage, per hour to ensure a higher amount of quality in the papers being marked. Giving a more even playing field for all candidates.",
