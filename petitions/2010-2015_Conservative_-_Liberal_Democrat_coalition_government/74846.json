        "additional_details": "In 1903, St Patrick's Day become an official bank holiday in Ireland, and, as of 2007, St Andrew's day has been an official bank holiday in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn a poll conducted in 2006, it was found that 87% of the respondents were in favour of St David's day becoming a bank holiday in Wales. Later in 2007, the UK parliament rejected a petition from the Welsh Assembly to pass a bill to make St David's day a bank holiday in Wales, despite the fact that in the year 2000, the Welsh Assembly voted unanimously in favour of doing so.\r\n\r\nSince 2011, following a referendum, the Welsh Assembly has been granted further law making powers. However, powers relating to the designation of Bank and Public Holidays rest with the UK Government.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned urge the UK Government to reconsider making St David's day a bank holiday in Wales. Especially as the UK Government seeks to hear the voice of national parliaments more prominently. ",
