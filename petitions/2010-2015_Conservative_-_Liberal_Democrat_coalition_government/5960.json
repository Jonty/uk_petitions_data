        "additional_details": "The Government must shut the door on immigrants from all around the world. In the past immigration woked well as there was a high number of jobs available in the country. However, now that there is a low number of jobs in the country it is time to put our nation first and protect our own people before handing out jobs to other countries.\r\nFurthermore, Britain has lost its national identity and national pride as a result of the failed policy of multiculturalism.\r\nLiberals will say that people who support shutting the door on immigration are members of the far right. Yet just because people want to uphold Britain's traditional values to support our people before others does not mean that we are in any way, shape or form, racist or bigoted.",
