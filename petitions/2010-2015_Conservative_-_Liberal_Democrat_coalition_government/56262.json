        "additional_details": "I would like there to be mandatory health checks for children from birth to 5 years old. The checks should be appropriate for the stage of development of the particular child. If an appointment is missed, there should be a follow up call and if necessary a visit to the child's house. There should be triggers for additional support logged for the child and family if there are any causes for concern. I am aware of health checks from birth, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 7-9 months, 12 months, 18 months and 2 years and feel these should be mandatory for every child to ensure their health and happiness, which should be the priority for every parent and health professional.",
