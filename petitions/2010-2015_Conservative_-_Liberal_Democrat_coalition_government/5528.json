        "additional_details": "In this age of fundamentalism and of multi-culturism it is necessary, rather than attempt to defend multiple conflicting faiths and world-views, to require the state to entirely secularise it's activity. All laws pertaining to religion and faith based activity to be repealed, all schools to stop the teaching of religious texts and, obviously the cessation of an established church. In no way should religious practice be curtailed or condemned - just left to the churches and other faith organisations to carry the responsibility themselves rather than look to the state for support, defence or for validation.",
