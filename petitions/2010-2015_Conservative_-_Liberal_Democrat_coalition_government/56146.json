        "additional_details": "With essential living costs rising sharply on a regular basis, I feel it is discriminatory to the elderly that many of them are unable to keep their living expenses to a minimum, as they have no way of utilising the internet and the many tools it provides when working to keep costs down.\r\n\r\nI feel it would be fairer for utility companies to create a special 'Pensioner' tariff which would be cheaper or at least as cheap as the best value tariff they offer.\r\n\r\nI also feel that insurance companies and the like should ensure that pensioners pay the least possible for their needs on annual contracts and not automatically charge them ridiculously high auto-renew rates, when they are offering tech-savvy customers' rates that are considerably lower.\r\n\r\nI am petitioning the Government to make these recommendations compulsory to all companies that provide essential household services to all UK citizens in receipt of the State Pension.",
