Not at any point, unless you have declared certain medical conditions, do you have to take a retest, have a medical or even have an eyesight test,\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to introduce a re-test at age 70, some form of medical assessment and an eyesight test. This should happen every time you reapply and yearly eyesight tests once you reach age 80. Dof T stats show that per mile driven most accidents occur in people age 80+\r\n\r\nPlease see the article about Cassie McCord in Daily Mail on line 30th January 2013. Too many people have been killed by unfit drivers and self certification is no longer enough.\r\n ",
