        "additional_details": "Fareham Borough Council should organise a referendum, open to all residents of Fareham, on whether residents agree or disagree with their plans for Welborne \u2013 a New Town of 6,500 houses planned north of the town.\r\n\r\nThis should be a simple question this time with no biased wording from either side - I suggest simply \"Do you agree with Fareham Borough Council's plans for Welborne - 6,500 houses planned north of the town? Yes/ No/ Don't Know\"\r\n\r\nA full referendum would show once and for all whether there is overwhelming public backing for this scheme, or not, which is a highly contentious issue.\r\n\r\nAnswering this question would benefit all those involved in this, the Council and those opposing,  and put this issue to bed once and for all - allow us all to move on.\r\n",
