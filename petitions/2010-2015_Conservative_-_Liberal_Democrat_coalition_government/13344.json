        "additional_details": "It is time to address the imbalance in society. Many people are claiming benefits fraudulently because their communities are ignorant of their actions. If the people, and their benefits claimed, were known in a register accessible to the public, society could blow the whistle on known local fraudsters and help to stop the money haemorrhaging out of our economy as it does now. It is the public, taxpayers' money and therefore as the public, we should have the right to see where our money is being spent. Needy claimants obviously have the right to claim but if they refuse public listing, they also refuse our monetary assistance. Clearly, fraudsters will either refuse listing or face investigation and fines as appropriate.",
