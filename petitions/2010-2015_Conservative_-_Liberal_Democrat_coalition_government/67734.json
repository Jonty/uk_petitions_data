        "additional_details": "Certain Police forces fail to understand the devastating effect on victims lives. There's an inability to understand how stalkers minds work. Most stalkers have psychological problems, they don't think logically and lack common sense. It's all about what the stalker wants, with no empathy towards their victim, obsessive stalkers don't stop!\r\nWhen a stalking victim has been harmed or murdered and Police have repeatedly ignored requests for help, there needs to be a Charge of Negligence of Duty to Protect Victims.\r\nIn a civilised society no one should live in fear from stalkers intent on causing harm, mentally and physically. Each incident is a crime and Police are there to serve the Public.\r\n",
