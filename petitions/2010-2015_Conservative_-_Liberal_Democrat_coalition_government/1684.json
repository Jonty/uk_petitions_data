        "additional_details": "With Mortgages, for most of us, being the biggest financial commitment everyone should be entitled to have a 1 month mortgage payment break to help ease financial pressure. I understand this sits with the bank but pressure from the government to make law is required. After all money is what  makes the world go round and having the ability to take a 1 month break (once a year, or a defined periods) to catch up on \u2018other debt\u2019 or simply have some fun, take the family on holiday should be available.\r\n\r\nObviously nothing is free, as this would add a month to the term of the mortgage, which to be honest adding a single month to a 20, 30, etc year mortgage is nothing.\r\n\r\nHavening an agreed break would free up \u00a3100\u2019s for households, which will be spent in turn helping jump the economy into growth.\r\n",
