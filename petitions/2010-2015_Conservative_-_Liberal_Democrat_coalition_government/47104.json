Fig 3. highlights the decline of accidents since the introduction of HSWA 1974, the glaring error that data available from the 1930s showed accidents were already declining in the workplace, the HSE or its legislation have had no impact.\r\nJ.Adams. Showed how government legislation when passed, mandating people should wear seatbelts caused more harm for some time, as people changed their behaviour.\r\nHealth and safety represents a business overhead, this is inevitable a charge  passed on to the employee, without the individuals choice.\r\nEqually when a school is fined this simply punishes the children, as the school has less resources now, to focus on its core function; teaching. The HSE, a school, government, all paid for by taxpayers with legal fees lost in-between, is obscene.\r\nFreemarket innovation out performs arrogant central planning.",
