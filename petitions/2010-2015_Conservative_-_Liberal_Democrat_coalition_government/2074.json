        "additional_details": "The 2004 Act to ban hunting with hounds was a great step forward towards ridding our society of legalised animal cruelty. But subsequent prosecutions have illustrated that there are nuances in the law which can be exploited by those seeking to continue the practice. Indeed, the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Crown Prosecution Service, as well as police on the ground, have all intimated that the law lacks teeth. This is our chance to clarify and codify the law so that it puts a long overdue nail in the coffin of those who insist on killing for fun.",
