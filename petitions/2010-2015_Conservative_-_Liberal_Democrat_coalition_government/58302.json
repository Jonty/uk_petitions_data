        "additional_details": "In my opinion I feel that pet owners should all have a licence to own an animal and pay a  fee (which would be put to good use such as animal shelters!) to enable them to have a dog/pet. I think this could help prevent excessive breeding, stolen pets, dog fighting, abuse, neglect etc. All pets such as dogs/cats would be chipped & located to their owners on record (As it is at the moment) but it would help them to be tracked if any abuse or neglect was to take place.\r\n\r\nWith serious consequences to follow if this was the case such as a fine, arrest etc. It would be beneficial for this to mandatory to buckle down on over breeding money grabbers, dog fighters etc.\r\n\r\nNo household would be limited to an amount of animals as long as it is clear that they are cared for and managed.\r\n\r\nStolen pets would be easier to trace.",
