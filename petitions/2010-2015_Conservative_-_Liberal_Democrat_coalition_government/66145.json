        "additional_details": "Parents with equal care should not be held liable for CSA payments and the financial responsibility for the child should be borne equally between the parents. This decision has been accepted in the new Child Maintenance Service (CMS), but no changes have been made to CSA to reflect this discrepancy. This puts a double financial burden on (generally) the father who is required to pay CSA on top of paying equally for the care of their child and also provides another opportunity for the mother to retain control. Those in this situation should be moved instantly to the new CMS which would remove this ridiculous direction, and all matters should be moved to CMS at the earliest opportunity.",
