        "additional_details": "Obtain a license to by-pass bio-diversity laws to cull the seagull population in Cardiff, the largest urban population in the world. Current control measures are ineffective with increases year by year; this is an issue that will continue to worsen unless some hard-line action is taken. We acknowledge gull numbers are declining across European but this is NOT the case here, the quality of life for Cardiff residents is suffering as a result. The local authority react to reports of gull feeding and has introduced wheeled bins in as many locations as viable to avoid bags being attacked and filth strewn in streets but many terraced properties throughout the city can only be serviced with refuse sacks which are open to attack. It is well documented that gulls are aggressive, more so during nesting season with attacks on adults and children common and roosting birds adversely affecting businesses & residents with increased noise pollution and droppings as a result of such huge congregations.",
