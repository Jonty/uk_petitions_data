Many IPP Prisoners remain in prison long after the expiry of their tariff, due to insufficient courses to assess their suitability for release.  In September 2012, 6,020 prisoners were serving an IPP Sentence. 3,253 of these were held over their tariff date. Since 2005 only 502 serving IPP Prisoners have been released from custody.\r\nWe call upon the Government\r\nto ensure proper funding for courses for all IPP Prisoners\r\nto set realistic and appropriate targets for the needs of each prisoner\r\nto make the requirements achievable within the set tariff\r\nto Provide extra assistance to IPP Prisoners who have additional needs such as mental health problems, poor literacy, or welfare issues\r\n",
