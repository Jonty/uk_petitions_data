        "additional_details": "All convicted pedophiles should be chemically or surgically castrated. To reduce libido and sexual activity once released from prison to stop them from re-offending. Some consider this a breach of human rights, but did the pedophile consider this when commiting their offence? It is carried out in many countries and previous offenders have said that they have completely lost all sexual desires after several weeks of treatment. Surely this can only be a good thing. Please sign this petition if you want the Government to do the right thing by our children.",
