There is currently no voice of individuals younger and in poverty.\r\n\r\nMany young individuals do not know how to access support resources or do not want to speak to someone they see as an \"ageing politician\" All wards could see representation from 2 forces. One representative aged from 18 to 29 and one aged 30+. Responsibilities would be shared and younger representatives would in turn be mentored by the elder more experienced ones.\r\n\r\nThis in turn would enable wards to capture the views of a wider target audience and to create solutions collectively.
