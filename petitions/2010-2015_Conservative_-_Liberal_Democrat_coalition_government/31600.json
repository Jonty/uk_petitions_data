        "additional_details": "We keep hearing that large companies make billions in profits. Many of there workers are on minimum wage.\r\nThey have to claim tax credits.\r\nThis money is claimed from the government that tax-payers have paid into so in fact the workers of this country are paying the wages of the companies that are making billions in profits. If these companies paid a living wage there would be more money left in the treasury for other things.\r\nSome of these companies are off shore so dont pay enough tax anyway.\r\nAll money that is earned in this country should be taxed be they rock and film stars and Formula One drivers etc. If you earn it here pay your taxes as they do in Australia.",
