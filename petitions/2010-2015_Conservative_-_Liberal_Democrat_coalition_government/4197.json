        "additional_details": "All schools should be non-religious, this would eliminate any biases towards accepting children from specific religious backgrounds over others, creating a more equal selection system.\r\n\r\nScience should also be taught in schools without fear or persecution as science is the current understanding of what we know about the world and universe around us.  It is unbiased and simply is what it is.\r\n\r\nHow can we say that we have a great education system when many schools are biased religiously towards children and science subjects such as evolution are being abused and incorrectly taught due to religious doctrine?",
