        "additional_details": "We are Rossendale's community business of the year. We have invested hundreds of thousands of pounds in a state-of-the-art golf driving range, created 10 jobs, and are recognised by the Golf Foundation & England Golf for our work with children and minority groups. We have never asked for a penny from the public purse. All we want is for Lancs County Council to allow us to signpost our facility. Rossendale has amazing sporting facilities but people don't know about them because LCC won't allow signposts. Help us change their minds.",
