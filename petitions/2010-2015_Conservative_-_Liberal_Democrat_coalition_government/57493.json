For example, Visually Impaired students/people and students/people with learning difficulties such as Slow Processing Speed, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder, who cannot read or struggle to read, are still provided with few alternative means to access books and materials in accessible formats (e.g. text-to-speech). In the 21st Century, publishers should be doing this automatically. Until this time, such students/people will continue to struggle to reach and fulfill their potential. Please please help to rectify this problem NOW!",
