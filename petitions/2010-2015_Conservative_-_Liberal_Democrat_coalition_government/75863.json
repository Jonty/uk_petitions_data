        "additional_details": "I am 11 years old and I am already worrying about what my children will eat and grow up on. I find that healthy foods have ridiculously high prices and junk foods with ridiculously low prices. Another issue I find important is the lack of actual fruit and vegetable gardens. Although foods such as bananas and mangoes naturally grow in completely different climates to Britain, it is still entirely possible to grow tropical foods here with tropical gardens. As the population grows it may seem impossible to insert gardens all  over the UK but something as simple as a rooftop garden will easily suffice. This is something that is easily addressable but is never addressed. Please help me insure the eating habits of children change for the better. I don't want obesity as my children's role model. ",
