        "additional_details": "Bandwith caps are a tool for profiteering, they should be disallowed due to the inherent nature of being able to disconnect a user when an arbitrary amount has been reached then charging said user incredibly high rates for incredibly low amounts of bandwith when a typical ISP will pay for terabytes at a time.\r\n\r\nThis petition is calling for the government to stop ISPs from having capped connections for no reason especially when the UK is already falling behind in terms of global internet connections yet 85% of our population is online.",
