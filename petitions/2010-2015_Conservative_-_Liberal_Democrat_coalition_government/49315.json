        "additional_details": "On 12th May 2010, Michael Gove took the top job in education, Secretary of State. In April 2013, 2 he received a vote of no confidence as well as other unions asking why someone who is untrained as an educator can tell professionals in the education system how to do their job. The profession has been subject to a relentless tirade of \"it's not good enough\" \"you should have to work more hours\". It has been, through many consultations, identified that morale in the teaching profession is at an all time low. The Government need to appoint government ministers with either a qualification in education or continuing professional development (which we are all subject to) within an educational setting; not just visits to appear to support what we're doing. There have been, in a 3 year period, 4 u-turns on decisions in education; Michael Gove needs to think seriously about whether he should actually be running such a vital department.",
