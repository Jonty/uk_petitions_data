Since the postal vote was created it has led to  postal vote fraud which undermines democracy by allowing invisible people to vote. Also I propose that seeming as it is British democracy then we need to ensure that those that vote have the right to in issues that affect them. I propose the change should be:\r\nBan postal vote in favour of turning up to the hall where the election is being held as this will reduce voting fraud.\r\nOnly full British citizens can vote in British elections .\r\nTo increase voter turnout all those that do not vote without a sufficient excuse will be fined however there will be a option on the ballot paper to vote for noone.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every British citizen to vote in British elections.",
