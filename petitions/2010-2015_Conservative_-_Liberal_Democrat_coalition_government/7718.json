        "additional_details": "We call for the resignation of Theresa May, MP from the cabinet. The shrinkage of resources to and for both the morale and mobilisation of those who protect the innocent are a vitriolic endorsement to her incapacity. Further we call on the government to empower those who protect our lives, property and health with the remaining treasures of this nation and prioritise such spending above the needs of any other objective, national or international. We want first things first. These great service men and women are 'lions led by donkeys.'",
