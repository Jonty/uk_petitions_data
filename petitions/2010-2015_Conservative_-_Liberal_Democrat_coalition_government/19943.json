        "additional_details": "When the news broke about the dramatic increase in the profits of the big six companies that control our energy supplies, our Government suggested that we should monitor the prices we are charged and switch suppliers to get a better deal.\r\n\r\nThis is almost impossible to assess due to the complicated way that energy tariffs are presented with multiple fixed charges and price bands. Prices are displayed like this to make it as difficult as possible for the consumer to know whether a competitor would be cheaper.\r\n\r\nI propose that legislation should be introduced to enforce tariffs to have just two figures.\r\n\r\n1 - A common fixed charge for gas and one for electricity which is set by Ofgem.\r\n2 - One single rate per cubic metre of gas or kW of electricity.\r\n\r\nThis would provide totally clear pricing so every consumer could make direct comparisons between energy suppliers.",
