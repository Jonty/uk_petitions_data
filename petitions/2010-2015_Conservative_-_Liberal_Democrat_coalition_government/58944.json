        "additional_details": "The Highways Agency is proposing to introduce a speed limit of 60 mph 'for several years' between 7am and 7pm, 7 days a week on parts of the M1, for air quality reasons. Plans to extend the scheme to several other motorways, including the M3, M5, M6, M20, M23, M27 and M62, are already being considered for next year. This is just the tip of the iceberg which could lead to a national 60mph speed limit.\r\nTHESE PROPOSALS MUST BE STOPPED IMMEDIATELY. Motorways are a vital part of the nation\u2019s transport infrastructure. The cost to the economy would be huge \u2013 greater transport costs, longer journey times, more congestion, less willingness for companies to locate away from London, less willingness for international companies to locate here. In addition it is unfair: transport  accounts for just 20% of the UK's CO2 emissions, with cars responsible for just 11%. The motor industry has made enormous gains in recent years to reduce it\u2019s impact on the environment, with cleaner, less polluting cars.",
