        "additional_details": "Stop the various new employment schemes, a SME owner has to be a Tax, Finance & Employment law expert, now an employment schemes expert too. The schemes are large scale but for SMEs these are complex & essentially falsely inflating the value of employee market. The minimum wage (MW) was introduced to stop the exploitation of low paid staff during an extended period of growth, since then there have been huge changes in employment law & MW. If MW was lowered/removed current employees would not be affected, new employees taking on the same roles as existing employees will have to be paid the same. The true cost of employment & the erosion of all pay scales in SMEs have left many unable to employ a helping hand. MPs class full time as 35hrs pw, on JSA you get \u00a353.45 U25 (\u00a31.53ph)& \u00a367.50 25+ (\u00a31.82ph). It would be better for people to get back to employment at a lower level of pay \u00a33.50ph U25 & \u00a34.80ph 25+. This would decrease unemployment, increase tax revenues & reduce state dependence.",
