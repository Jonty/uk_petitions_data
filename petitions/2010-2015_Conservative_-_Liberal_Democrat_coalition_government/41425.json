        "additional_details": "In an interview on ITV's This morning program David Cameron said \"..a sort of er a sort of witchhunt particularly against people who are er gay\" when ambushed with a list of names from the internet by Philip Schofield; in itself a disgraceful act.\r\n\r\nAs a young boy I was sexually abused by two close male relatives, one of whom was married with children and the other who went on to marry and have two children.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience was that 100% of Peadophiles were heterosexual, as unscientific as David Camerons remarks but backed by experience.\r\n\r\nNobody is suggesting that there are no gay peadophiles, i'm certain there are.\r\n\r\nBut the Prime Minister should apologise from the despatch box for a comment made in the heat of the moment, which would suggest a direct link with peadophiles and gays.",
