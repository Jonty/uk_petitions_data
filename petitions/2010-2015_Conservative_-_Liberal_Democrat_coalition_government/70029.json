        "additional_details": "This is a petition to end Breed specific legislation.\r\n\r\nBreed specific legislation is basically racism, you can not class a dog to be dangerous just by their breed.\r\n\r\nI feel that the government is not correctly dealing with the real issue of \"dangerous dogs\" witch is dangerous owners. There are better ways to deal with this issue for example dog licences. Owners would be happy to pay for registration and to show that these \"pitbull breeds\" are not dangerous.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to have the government review this poorly put together law.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance ",
