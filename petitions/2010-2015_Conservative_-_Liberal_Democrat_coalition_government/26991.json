        "additional_details": "I wish to petition against the BBCs decision to axe  BBCs 2 Something For The Weekend programme. This programme is an extremely popular programme and the decision to axe this is confusing. I would like the government to force BBC to provide justified reasoning behind this decision and provide if necessary a breakdown of the accounting process which led to this decision. As a license fee payer I feel this decision has been hasty with significant consultations between relevant parties. The Facebook campaign is gaining steam and support from public and celebrities alike for the same cause to save the programme. ",
