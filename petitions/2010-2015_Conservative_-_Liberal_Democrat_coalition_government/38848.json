        "additional_details": "The Kyoto protocol ends as of 4pm on the 31st December 2012 (midnight Kyoto time). This removes any treaty obligation to cut CO2. With no warming for 14 years, few if any adverse trends such as increasing extreme weather and very little if any economic justification for action on CO2, we the undersigned call on the government to repeal or amend all legislation derived from the Kyoto protocol: the Climate Change Act, Energy Act, Scotland Act, etc. and remove any obligation relating to Kyoto as of 4pm on the 31st December 2012.",
