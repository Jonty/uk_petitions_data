        "additional_details": "Volunteer Allowance Benefits (VAB) will be welfare benefits paid to charity volunteers. Charities will pay volunteers \u00a315 per day, and then claim \u00a310.00 per day back from Social Security. The cost of VAB is thus split between the charity (\u00a35) and the government (\u00a310).\r\n\r\nThose who cannot compete for free market jobs are unemployed because of disability, low skills, or low education. They can volunteer for charity. VAB will directly benefit marginalised people and reduce social exclusion.\r\n\r\nTaxpayers who pay for the present benefits system will get far better value for money, instead of just paying people to do nothing. The taxpayer wins. The government wins. The charity sector grows stronger, reducing the cost and scope of government services. Unemployment is reduced.\r\n\r\nVolunteer expenses, other benefits and means testing will not be affected by VAB.\r\n\r\nFrancois Greeff\r\nwww.Good4you.org\r\n020 8123 4224\r\n\r\n",
