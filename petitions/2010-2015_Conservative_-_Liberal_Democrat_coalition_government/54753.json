        "additional_details": "Nationwide Building Society are closing our local branch in Caversham, Reading - despite keeping two branches open in neighbouring streets in the town centre.\r\n\r\nThis decision, will make it difficult for many Caversham Residents - including Children, The Vulnerable & The Elderly, to continue to bank with Nationwide as the residents wish to continue banking locally.  Although cheques are being less commonly used, there are still many people who rely on this service, and to remove a local facility would make things difficult for many people, forcing them to travel further & pay rising Parking costs.\r\n\r\nClosing the local branch may affect local commerce, where residents may have shopped in Caversham when they went to their bank they will now move further afield.\r\n\r\nI would like for the government to intervene & to try to keep this local bank open for the residents.
