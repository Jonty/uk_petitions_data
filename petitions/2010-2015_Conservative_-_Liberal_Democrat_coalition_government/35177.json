The media should not be regarded as the additional 4th separate independent body. Free press, NOT an uncountable, unregulated, bias press, is important in a democratic society. PCC action or inaction should be Judicially Reviewable. A media should not be allowed to support a political party but should be impartial (like BBC). Leaked information from \u2018moles\u2019, information covertly obtained, etc should only be used if certain public interest criteria are fulfilled, like exposing corruption, crimes, scams, incompetence, indiscretions, celebrity interests. Information obtained by breaking professional confidentiality, official secrets under the Official Secrets Act, harassment, etc should not be allowed. ",
