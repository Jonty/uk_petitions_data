It is clear that a minority of Councils actually agree to allow their Councillors to join and of those who do, there is a minority of Councillors who actually join.\r\n\r\nThe LGPS is clearly for employees and, by virtue that Councillors receive an allowance and NOT a salary, Councillors should be excluded from contributions made by Local Authorities on their behalf.",
