Expecially as most policies are new for old and require replacemmet valuations for nearly all items not even price paid valuations.\r\n\r\nThis makes the use of these clauses in my opinion unfair as the buyer is not really understanding the cover they would recieve in the event of a claim and is most likey to think they are fully covered up to the value they have insured for.\r\n\r\n",
