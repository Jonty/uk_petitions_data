Preston Skreens is a respite centre on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, which provides short breaks to disabled children, young people, and their families, in Medway and Swale. Short breaks are essential for the families and an enjoyable and useful activity for the child or young person. A large number of families rely on Preston Skreens, all the children who use the centre have medical and or learning difficulties and a number of children have autism and are unable to cope with change, therefore closing the provision would have a devastating effect upon both the children and their families and the children\u2019s emotional wellbeing would be severely affected.\r\n",
