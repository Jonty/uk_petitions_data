        "additional_details": "The sale of scrap metal should only be allowed under license. Licenses could be administered by local government but would be regularly checked to ensure only legally obtained metal is being sold. Very heavy financial penalties for selling scrap metal without due provenance should be imposed with the proceeds going directly to the local authority, along with the confiscated metal.\r\nThis should help remove the current rash of theft of cables etc. and be self financing. There should not be a need for a high charge for licenses so as not to deter legitimate dealers.",
