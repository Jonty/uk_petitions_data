        "additional_details": "Blake fowler tragically died due to being failed by numerous authorities and more importantly his mother and 'step father'. No one has been charged or prosecuted for the years of abuse, neglect which resulted ultimately in his tragic death.\r\nMany people failed Blake repeatedly the very ones who were supposed to protect him from his mother and 'step father' to the hospital, drs,police and social services. On many occasions this tragic incident could have been prevented and with this petition we aim to get justice for Blake and have the case re opened and for the mother and 'step father' of Blake to be charged and prosecuted for the neglect abuse and death of this  truly beautiful young boy. Please sign and share to help us be heard for Blake ",
