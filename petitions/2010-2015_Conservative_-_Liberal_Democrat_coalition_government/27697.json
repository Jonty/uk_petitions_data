        "additional_details": "It has emerged that the Medway Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Kent have ruled that nursing staff are to have their rest break times reduced.  Nursing staff who work a 12/13 hours shift will now be only able to have a 30 minute break for the entire day.  If they wish to continue to have 2x 15 min breaks and an hours lunch then they will have to then repay this time collectively by working it off at the end of the month.  According to the powers that be it is completely legal.  However it must be brought into question when, already over stretched staff are being made to worked such long hours with such a minimal break time of just 30 minutes.  As a possible patient of this hospital I would be concerned that my care could be compromised by over tired staff.  I feel that the change should be reviewed and reconsidered.  ",
