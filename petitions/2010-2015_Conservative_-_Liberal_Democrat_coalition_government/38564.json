        "additional_details": "Please oppose the further switching off of BBC Medium Wave Services (currently applicable to Merseyside, Nottingham, etc) for the following reasons :\r\n\r\n- DAB (Band 3) and FM (Band 2) reception frequently does not reach the whole local area, nor does it reach out of the local area (eg: I like to hear a Cardiff City commentary over the border, and keep in touch with Wales in general !)\r\n-The option of offering a separate coverage (eg: of football or whatever) is reduced\r\n-DAB radio has not reached enough listeners, and when the signal is weak it breaks up the audio completely !\r\n-The BBC is switching them off on a trial basis, and waiting for people to complain, and creating a self-fulfilling prophesy, as there is no obvious publicised way to complain, many who enjoy the services do not use the web\r\n-Please see related petitions in relation to Radio 4",
