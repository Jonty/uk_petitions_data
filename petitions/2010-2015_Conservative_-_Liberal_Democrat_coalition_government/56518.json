Yet many MP's are on a 3 figure salary from OUR taxes and have the cheek to introduce new taxes! The reason we apparently pay MP's so much is to avoid corruption, but this is a corrupt act. Recent news of a planned increase of politicians salaries is practically impudent in these times when poverty and malaise blight our generation. I am calling for MP's in this country to follow the example of Uruguayan President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who donates a majority of his salary to charity and cut the amount of money in their own back pockets.
