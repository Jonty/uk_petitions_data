        "additional_details": "We now live in the 21st century, not the 19th. All major police forces are now armed. Only the UK police are unarmed. Yet they prove increasingly unable to protect the public or even themselves. Outside the major cities it can take armed police up to 45 minutes to respond to a rogue gunman. How many innocent people would needlessly die in that time? We need to regain control of Britain for the law abiding people of our country. Criminals should be afraid to go out, not ordinary folk. Arming the police would be a first positive step.",
