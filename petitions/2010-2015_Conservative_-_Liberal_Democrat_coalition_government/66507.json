        "additional_details": "This is a call for the Government (Department of Health) to consider scrapping prescription charges for anti-depressants/anti-psychotic medication.\r\n\r\nIf you have a mental illness sometimes you don\u2019t believe that you need help or you may believe that what you are experiencing is \u2018real\u2019 and therefore why would you pay \u00a38.05 each week/month for something that you believe you don\u2019t need?\r\n By scrapping prescription charges for this medication I believe that people with mental health difficulties may be more willing to take the medication/seek help if someone is concerned about them, as they literally would have nothing to lose.\r\nThis could therefore potentially save the NHS millions by reducing costs to admitting people in crisis situations which could have been effectively managed/maintained through medication.\r\n",
