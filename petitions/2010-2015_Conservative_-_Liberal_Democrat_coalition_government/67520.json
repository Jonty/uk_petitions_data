        "additional_details": "For many years you have been able to access Dental treratment through Dentists private practise. Most Chiropody Treatments are carried out in Private Practise but it is very rare that it will be funded by the NHS. If you do get an appointment at your local NHS clinic the wait is very long and you may not even qualify. Therefore the government should make it compulsory that FREE NHS Chiropody treatment is available in Private Practises if the practitioner wants to offer this.",
