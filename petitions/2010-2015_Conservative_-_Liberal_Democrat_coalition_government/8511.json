It costs the Country billions it just doesn't have.\r\nOne stop riders, when before they would have walked. Many go out to pubs every night of the week, if they can afford the alcohol they can afford the bus fare.\r\nThere have been so many disability concessions issued, that you can get one for almost anything now, overweight, re-hab etc. This is not disability! Many a times they run faster than Linford Christie to catch the bus.\r\nIt is important to remember that in this current financial climate a: the country cannot afford it & b: the older generation have greater savings & are better off than most of us.
