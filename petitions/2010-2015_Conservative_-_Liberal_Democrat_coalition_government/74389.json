        "additional_details": "I think that if someone wishes to enter the UK they should be refused if they have a criminal record.  We already have enough criminals of our own without importing them.  Australia and the USA already have this rule, why are we so lenient.  When they commit a crime we have to pay to keep them in prison, it makes no sense.  I believe the only people who could object to this are those I am talking about.  Decent people would vote for this.",
