To take a simple example, the motorway speed limit. I have seen several petitions proposing to raise the speed limit but each petition chooses a different limit.\r\n\r\nThe petition should be 'to change the UK speed limit' and then each petitioner would be able to choose what they want it raised to by selecting from a set of predetermined choices.\r\n\r\nYou should also be able to disagee and suggest retaining or lowering it.\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis would then be able to tell the government what proportion of people wanted a change and what the largest proportion of people wanted it changed to. It would also allow people to suggest further modifications to the petition which could be voted on. ",
