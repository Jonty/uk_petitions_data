This petition is to make it so that politicians can have maximum two consecutive terms then they must then spend at least one term out of politics in the real world with a normal job before they stand again, this is so they can face and understand real life problems before they stand again.\r\n\r\nThe government at the next general election should hold a referendum to see if this is the will of the people they represent.
