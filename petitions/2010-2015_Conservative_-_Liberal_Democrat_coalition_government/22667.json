        "additional_details": "I call for a halt in the relentless development of vaccines and immunisations for just about every ailment, now to include arthritis and acne.  I argue that vaccines suppress the immune system by bypassing two major body defence systems: the skin and liver - giving the viruses and bacteria they contain early and direct access to the bloodstream. There is a huge economic argument for mass vaccination - it is very profitable too - as well as perceived health benefits BUT let's not let that outweigh common sense and natural approaches to ill health.",
