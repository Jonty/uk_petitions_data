        "additional_details": "We call upon the UK Government to recognise the hundreds of ordinary citizens from Birmingham who made a distinct and lasting impact upon the protection of UK borders by manufacturing the Supermarine Spitfire at Castle Bromwich. We believe that a fitting tribute to the sacrifice made by these people is the delivery of a Spitfire to the City, to be placed within the Tyburn Ward boundaries, in close proximity to the original Aircraft Factory (now Jaguar) and Castle Bromwich Aerodrome (now Castle Vale Housing Estate).",
