        "additional_details": "As most people have probably experienced by now, the new Bus Lane lay out along Lewes Road in Brighton is an absolute shambles and is causing havoc for most in our city. Even the bus users themselves because the access points to the bus lane are blocked by queuing traffic, meaning people are waiting for buses for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to organise a demonstration march, meeting at The Level in Brighton, marching in the bus lane, down to Brighton Town Hall. The aim of the march will be to express the frustration which people are experience whilst trying to travel around our city.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you're interested in attending. If there is enough interest, we will get the ball rolling.\r\n\r\nThanks. ",
