It took 6 weeks for me to be seen, and in that time I had nothing in terms of support. I don't want anyone else to go through the problems I have encountered. All I would like is a pledge from the government that all newly diagnosed patients with a brain tumor are given a relevant leaflet, so they are not left in limbo in that awful time between diagnosis and initial consultation.",
