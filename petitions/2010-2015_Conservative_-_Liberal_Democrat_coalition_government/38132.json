        "additional_details": "Tattoos have become very fashionable. Children are openly getting them done illegally in houses and some parlours, much to their parent's dismay.\r\n\r\nIt is illegal to tattoo anybody under the age of 18 regardless of parental consent. The problem arises when a 16 or 17 year old gets tattooed illegally. The police need them to give a statement against the tattooist which of course they're not going to do (as they wanted it and paid for it).\r\n\r\nI believe either the parent's should be allowed to press charges or the government needs to review the age of consent and the penalty! (which is only a \u00a360 fine)\r\n\r\nI believe these tattooists need to be stopped and responsible tattooists agree! ",
