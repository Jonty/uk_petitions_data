        "additional_details": "Hughes Syndrome AKA Antiphospholipid Syndrome - is a potentially life threatening blood clotting disorder. Sufferers often have to go through a variety of symptoms such as memory loss, overwhelming fatigue, hearing loss, vision problems and migraines. It causes a pre-disposition to blood clots, strokes, seizures and multiple pregnancy loss. This disease is not considered as significant enough to cause a person to be unable to work when in reality, they are often too ill to even get out of bed. This is in start contrast to the views of insurers (life, health, travel, etc) who often won't insure suffers due to the condition being life threatening. There needs to be better recognition for the condtion and related conditons such as Sjogren's Syndrome and SLE across the State departments and funding for further research to save or improve people's lives.
