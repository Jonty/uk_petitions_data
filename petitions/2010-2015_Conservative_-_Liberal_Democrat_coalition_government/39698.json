        "additional_details": "There has been plans to build a Sainsburys in Baildon Village on the Ian Clough Hall carpark. This is completely impractical and Baildon will be at a loss of parking spaces for the businesses in the area and as a result, more congestion of traffic!\r\nIt will de-value the properties surrounding the area as well and will cause major disruption to Baildon. Also, as it is a historic village, there is a graveyard next door to Ian Clough Hall that has been there for many decades. It would be disrespectful to destroy or damage it in any way.\r\nWe have 5 supermarkets within a 5 mile radius; 2 Co-ops in Baildon Village, Asda in Shipley, Morrisions in Guiseley, a B&M and Tesco Express on Otley Road.\r\n\r\nWe, as a village, do not need and certainly do want a Sainsbury! We want these discussions stopped and refused.  It will cause more harm than good to the Village of Baildon. Please sign this petition and make sure that the Sainsburys is not build and Baildon is left as it is!",
