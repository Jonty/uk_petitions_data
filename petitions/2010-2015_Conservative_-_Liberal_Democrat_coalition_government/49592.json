        "additional_details": "The Taxpayer Bailout of the Banks has cost Our Country, and the British People, Billions of Pounds. As will eventually happen, the Banks will recover and the share price will go up. I believe, and so does the Media, that the current Coalition Government will race to a reprivatisation of Taxpayer owned Banks. This will involve involve selling Tax Payer owned Shares at a Loss to the Rich Elite!. The British Taxpayer has a Legal Right to those Shares, and the Selling of those Shares at a Loss, for Political Gain is not Right or Fair. This Petition is Clear. No Selling Of Taxpayer Owned Shares, unless they show a Profit and a Full Return of Taxpayer Investment plus Interest.",
