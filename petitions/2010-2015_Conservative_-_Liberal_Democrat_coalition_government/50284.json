We, the youth, are the future of this country. If we are unable to educate ourselves further we cannot possibly keep taking this country forward or achieve our true potential.  And consequently, the whole country will suffer.\r\nTherefore I am calling for the government to reduce the maximum tuition fee to \u00a36000 per year.\r\n",
