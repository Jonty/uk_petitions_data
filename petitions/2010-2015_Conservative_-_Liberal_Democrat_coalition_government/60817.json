        "additional_details": "The education of our children and young people is paramount to the future success of our country. Education should not be a tool in political machinations or used as a vote winner. Initiatives and change should be developed and implemented by a cross party committee which avoids children's futures being compromised by the desires of an individual or their party. This would enable long term plans to be established and to go beyond the life of one parliament. Establish a cross party education department.",
