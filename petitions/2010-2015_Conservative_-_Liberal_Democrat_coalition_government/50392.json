        "additional_details": "My name is Hannah Ost. I am fourteen years of age and I am standing up for the health and welfare of the current generation of young people. I care about the wellbeing and intellect of people my age and I am concerned that we as a people are losing the ability to create,  to think, to be. The fault is with energy drinks. Caffine, taurine, glucose. Just three of the mind-destroying chemicals in the popular drink 'Red Bull'. Many brain cells are killed during the so called 'Energy High'. And did you know it is thought Taurine comes from Bull Urine or Semen? Now, I am not here to critisise the making of energy drinks. I am simply stating that we should not be terminating the brain power of our future prime ministers, doctors, and teachers. And if you won't sign for the sake of a terrified young girl, will you not sign for the future of your country?\r\nThank you.",
