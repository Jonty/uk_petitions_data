In turn this is causing unnecessary hardship for people.\r\n\r\nThe banks should be prevented from doing this and should decline a transaction on the account if the funds are not available.\r\n\r\nWe request the chancellor to bring in regulations to prevent banks from allowing customers\u2019 accounts to over the agreed limit only to charge a fee.\r\n",
