        "additional_details": "Human rights are basic rights and freedoms that all people are entitled to regardless of status.\r\n\r\nIn today's society, the internet is fundamental to many aspects of life.  A person whose access to the internet is restricted or denied would see them significantly disadvantaged in life.\r\n\r\nBlocking websites or banning a person from using the internet should never be used as a solution to a problem.  To do so would go against a person's right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  Additionaly, to do so would pose a grave risk to the future direction of the rights of British citizens.  It also represents the gradual imposition of state censorship on the general population.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to enshrine in law the right for people in Britain to access the internet without hindrance.  The government needs to ensure that private interests, and the government itself, are unable to undermine a person's freedom to use the internet.",
