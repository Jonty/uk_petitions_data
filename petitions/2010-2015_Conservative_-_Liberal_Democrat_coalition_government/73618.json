        "action": "Alignment of Sunday Trading Laws with Scotland",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, wish HM Government to update the laws on Sunday Trading in England and Wales to match those laws for Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the law does not have restrictions on large retailers opening on a Sunday. It also prohibits shops from compelling employees to work on a Sunday. This allows those who want to shop to do so but also protects the wishes of those who do not want to work on Sundays.\r\n\r\nShopping, or not, on a Sunday are lifestyle choices. The undersigned believe it is time that the law no longer discriminated one personal choice over another. This will help ease the pressures of modern life felt by many working families whose only time to shop is restricted to weekends.\r\n\r\nChanging the Sunday trading laws as described above will not have any detrimental effect to any individual\u2019s personal circumstances on how they wish to live their life. No one will be prejudiced. Nobody\u2019s liberties will be reduced. The undersigned believe this will only create more choice.\r\n",
