        "additional_details": "In light of recent events regarding the UK riots, it is sobering to think that the vast majority of the Police Officers used to help protect and serve the community in this time of need will be cut nationally. As a result of the proposed cuts, forces are loosing experienced officers and staff at an alarming rate. Those officers, who do remain, are now not being utilised effectively and are being used to fill back office roles. Morale has seriously reduced with 69% of Officers surveyed in the West Midlands Police saying their morale had seriously reduced as a result of the cuts.\r\n\r\nThe creation of this petition is to stop or freeze all Police forces nationally being subject to cuts from the Government. Many forces such as the West Midlands Police have already implemented sufficient measures to reduce their numbers and this should be replicated nationally. Methods such as a freeze on recruitment and the option of voluntary redundancy should be utilised to reduce expenditure. ",
