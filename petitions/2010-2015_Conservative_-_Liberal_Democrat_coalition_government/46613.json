Email allows the author to retain a copy of his/her correspondence AND to prove, when it proves necessary, that the correspondence was actually sent and received by the addressee.  In this day and age it can only be for their own deniability that the NHS does not allow email correspondence between patients and its organisations.  It is hugely more expensive for patients to be able to record telephone call conversations with the NHS than it is to keep email records.  WE MUST BE GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY.",
