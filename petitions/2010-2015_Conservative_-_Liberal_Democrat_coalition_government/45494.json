        "additional_details": "The Highways Agency, which manages England's motorways and strategic A roads on behalf of the Department for Transport has announced trial proposals to help tackle air pollution and congestion at the A417 Air Balloon roundabout in Gloucestershire. If these plans go ahead they may or may not help traffic moving from Gloucester to Cirencester but they will cause problems elsewhere. They will create problems for people trying to get to south Cheltenham from the A417, particularly the Leckhampton area. There is a high risk of increased congestion on the A46 Shurdington Road, A435 Cirencester Road and associated side roads in Leckhampton and Charlton Kings. The plans will also cause delays for those trying to get to the A417 from the A436 and Leckhampton Hill. We oppose this trial and ask that it does not go ahead in its current form. We urge the Department of Transport to ask the Highways Agency to rethink the proposals to take account of our concerns.",
