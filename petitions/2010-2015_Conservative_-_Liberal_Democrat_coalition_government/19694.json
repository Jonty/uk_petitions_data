They should be allowed to use regular pavements alongside pedestrians so long as people on foot are given priority.\r\n\r\nI am a cyclist as well as a vehicle driver. Cyclists on the road provide more of a risk, to both the cyclists themselves and to the driver and passengers vehicles coming up behind them, than any other form of transport other than motorbility scooters. Coming round a blind corner or chicane at any speed and having a cyclist appear in front of you causes you to slam on the brakes. Even with modern brake systems using the tyres to slow down instead of turning makes you slightly lose control, while also giving more opportunities for less attentive drivers to slam into the back of the slowing vehicle.",
