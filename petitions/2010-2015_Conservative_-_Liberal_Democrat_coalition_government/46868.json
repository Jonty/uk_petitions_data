They are ignoring UK laws and walking away to try again as soon as possible.\r\nThe Border Agency needs to identify these people so that if they are found in the UK they can be deported for breaking the law. Once they disappear, we have no idea who they are.\r\nIn this way we can limit the flow of unskilled immigrants who cannot contribute to the economy.",
