It appears unclear when it is acceptable for security forces and police to use force against those who commit violent or terrorist acts.\r\n\r\nMake it legal for security forces and police to shoot dead those who have endangered the public by for example having  fired a weapon or caused an explosion.\r\n\r\nLethal force is used seldom however there are situations where failure to use lethal force increases the risk to the public, increases fatalities etc.\r\n\r\nThis is not a carte blanch - the security forces and police need mechanisms by which they can bring the matter legally, quickly and conclusively under control.\r\n\r\nFrom matters which are now so often in the press it appears that there is no clear framework and that once a clear framework is established then communication to and,training & education of our forces is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
