        "additional_details": "Babies born with Anencephaly after 24 weeks gestation are recognised in thier own right due to being of 'viable' gestational age even after a medical termination. Babies born before 24 weeks are mearly put down as abortions for medical reasons therefore not recognising them in statistics or as a wanted baby.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to have this changed. A baby born with Anencephaly (at any gestation) should be recognised in its own right whether carried to term or medically terminated afterall the fate of the baby is the same.\r\n\r\nHaving an abortion is not the same thing as giving a baby it's angel wings early as these babies are wanted unlike pregnancies that are aborted.\r\n\r\nPlease Sign!!
