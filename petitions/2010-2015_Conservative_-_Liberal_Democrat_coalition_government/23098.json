        "additional_details": "British Summer Time finishes at the end of October, ( 2 months before the shortest day) and recommences at the end of March (3 months after the shortest day). Why not start British Summer Time at the end of February ? This would remove the problems with light in Scotland, as, if the current arrangement is acceptable to Scotland at the end of October, it should also be acceptable at the end of February.\r\nBenefits would include more exposure to Vitamin D through sunlight, higher well being, and a boost to the economy through longer hours for tourism and leisure.\r\nSo I am asking the government to start British Summer Time at the end of February. This may put us out of line with Europe, but that seems to have helped re the Euro. Regarding any can't-do arguments, it is 40 years since the moon landings. We should have the technology. ",
