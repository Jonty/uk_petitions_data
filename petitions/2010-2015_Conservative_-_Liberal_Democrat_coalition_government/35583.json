        "additional_details": "More than 2 million Freeview customers will face bills of up to \u00a3212  in order to pay for interference with signals that will be caused by the 4G mobile network. Estimates suggest that up to 3 million households \u2013 within 2km of 4G transmitters - face interference with their television pictures, with some losing their signals entirely. Many Freeview customers are elderly and some have only recently joined the service following the disruption of the switch off of the analogue broadcasting signal. The cost and installation of the filters needed should be borne by the phone companies who will make billions out of 4G. Help is needed and not just for those on benefits, but everybody who wants to get Freeview.",
