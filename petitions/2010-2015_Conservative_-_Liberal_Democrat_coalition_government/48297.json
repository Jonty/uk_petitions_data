        "additional_details": "The British Basketball League is currently broadcast on Sky Sports with minimal LIVE games and hype. The channel has pumped millions of pounds into live football coverage and over-hauling the 'Super' Rugby League, so why can't Basketball get in on the money? Sky already show NBA live weekly so why not so weekly BBL? The sport is expanding within the UK and with big cities (London, Manchester, Birmingham) all getting involved it appeals to a larger audience.  ",
