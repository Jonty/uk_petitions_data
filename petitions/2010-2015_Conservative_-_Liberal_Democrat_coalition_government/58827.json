As a way of thanks for service to Queen and Country, to be given help and advice where it is needed and to allow the services to be less time consuming than normal.\r\nIt seems this is not the case and the number of Veterans suffering from PTSD who take their own lives because they cannot get that help is disturbing, there are greater numbers of homeless Veterans than ever and Veterans in custody  - something MUST be done to protect the vulnerable and ensure the Covenant is adhered to.",
