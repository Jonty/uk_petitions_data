        "action": "Stop Robbing Pensions Funds and ISAs",
        "additional_details": "When Gordon Brown abolished advance corporation tax, it netted the Treasury over \u00a35 billion a year at the expense of pension funds and ISAs. As a result most of us have seen very little growth in our pension funds since then and are condemned to poverty in retirement.  Also many have stopped saving as a result. This will lead to a massive burden on the welfare system as those who would have been self sufficient in retirement will now have to claim benefits.  Therefore I propose that ACT be reinstated and pension funds and ISAs be allowed to reclaim tax credits on dividends in an attempt to reverse the damage done by the worst chancellor this country has ever seen..",
