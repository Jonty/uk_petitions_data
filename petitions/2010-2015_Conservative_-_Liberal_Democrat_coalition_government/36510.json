        "additional_details": "The existing Transport For London Oyster flat 'pay as you go' bus fares unfairly penalise those passengers making a short journey; e.g. a few stops to their local shops.\r\n\r\nThe government should replace this and other similar fare systems elsewhere in the UK, with a fairer system based upon distance, where stage points are set at specific points along a bus route to calculate the fare charged. If a journey travels across a stage point then the fare increases.\r\n\r\nThis would end the extremely unfair situation now where, for example, an Oyster card bus passenger in London travelling one stop is charged the same fare as someone travelling twenty stops.\r\n\r\nThese distance-based systems incorporating smart cards, such as an Oyster card, already exist in other Western countries including New Zealand and Australia.\r\n",
