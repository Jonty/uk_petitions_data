        "additional_details": "I'm petioning to have the current guidance on flexi schooling reviewed and clarified.  We the undersigned feel that the current legislation needs looked at so that the opportunities for flexi schooling are equal across the UK.  I feel it should not be decided by each local government where they stand on this I think proper clarification should come from the state.  Flexi schooling has successfully worked in many places for years but some places are very closed minded when it comes to this and it gives parents who wish to educate their children in this matter an unfair disadvantage. According to Section 28 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 ' so far as is compatible with the provision of suitable instruction and training and the avoidance of unreasonable public expenditure, pupils are to be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents' if that is the case why do parents have to put up such a fight to get their wishes granted? We need clarification on this matter!!",
