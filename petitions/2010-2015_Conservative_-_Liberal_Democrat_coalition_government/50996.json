        "additional_details": "East Riding Council are selling the land at the bottom of Allotment lane that provides access from Northfield Crescent. They have blocked car/disabled access using bollards. Many residents from the surrounding area use this to get to school and into town. The car park also takes many cars off the road. The council were refused permission to build on this land but they are selling it as suitable building land. Please register your opposition to the sale of this land - it belongs to local residents. I believe we all have prescriptive rights to park and pass across this land.",
