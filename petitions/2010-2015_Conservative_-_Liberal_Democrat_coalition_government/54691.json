        "additional_details": "Trading with China is destroying European culture built up over hundreds of years. We have to pay for our health, education, workers' rights, and other aspects of civilisation through higher wages and higher taxes. Chinese goods are cheap because they do not care for our values. Human life is cheap in China.\r\n\r\nThrough our trades unions, our education systems, and our respect for the arts and sciences we have built a sophisticated and person-friendly culture in Europe. Until Chinese human and societal values match ours, the government should:\r\na) introduce sanctions against Chinese goods and\r\nb) stop Chinese companies buying European companies\r\n",
