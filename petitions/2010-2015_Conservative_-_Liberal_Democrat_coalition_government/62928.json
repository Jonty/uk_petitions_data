        "additional_details": " To:  Chris Grayling, Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor\r\n\r\nRecent regulations mean that no prisoner may receive books from outside by friends or relatives.\r\n\r\nPrison libraries are generally poorly endowed, subject to the cuts imposed by the local government funding them and in need of more rather than fewer books. In addition, accessing the prison library within\r\na jail is now physically more difficult because of cuts to prison staff and thus fewer staff are available to accompany prisoners to the library.\r\n\r\nChris Grayling is urged in this petititon to remove this ban and to allow friends, relatives and the general public to send either to the prisoners or to the prison libraries their secondhand books.
