        "additional_details": "It's time for a national referendum on bringing back both capital and corporal punishment. There is not a sufficient deterent these days to make offenders think twice about causing serious harm, injury or loss to their fellow citizens. Politicians you know there are voters who want this subject debated you cannot ignore this issue and make decisions on behalf of the electorate believing they are not worthy to decide on this issue. Because life imprisonment no longer means life and there are many examples where murders are released to murder again and some times again and again.\r\nWe are not short of people the world is over populated and only the most deserving should be allowed to remain here. We need to make the world a safer place not a more dangerous politically correct haven for out of touch politicians to earn an easy living in, some of you are safe protected by armed police officers and living in the more afluent law abiding areas of the land.\r\n",
