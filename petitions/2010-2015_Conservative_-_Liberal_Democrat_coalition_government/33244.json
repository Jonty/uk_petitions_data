Let me propose: Two days given to receipt application and to notify candidate that application has been received. 7 days given to assess application. Once in recruitment process, both obligations and rights should be mentioned by the employer, this then repeated at the end, especially in an interview. Applicant to be notified of outcome within 7 days. Applicant should be given feedback and an opportunity to feedback to recruiter. Mandatory follow up to clarify feedback. Quality form sent to applicant, the contents of which set out in statute. Forms to be kept for two years and findings made public.
