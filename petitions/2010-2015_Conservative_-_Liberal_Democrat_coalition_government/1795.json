        "additional_details": "The situation where there are devolved Parliaments/Assemblies in different areas of the UK with different levels of power is a democratic shambles. We are left with the situation where MPs are voting on issues which they are not elected to vote on e.g. Scottish MPs voting on Healthcare.\r\n\r\nThis problem can be solved if the separate Parliaments in the different UK countries are granted equal powers. Perhaps a federal arrangement more in line with that of the US or Germany, where powers such as Defence and Foreign Affairs are left to central government, but others devolved to different states, would be more straight forward.",
