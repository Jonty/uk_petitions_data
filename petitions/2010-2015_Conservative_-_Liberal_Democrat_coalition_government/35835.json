        "additional_details": "Access to higher education is under threat from the government who want to discriminate against older people and start charging any over the age of 24 using a loan system. This will effectively kill the chances of mature people returning to education. It need to be discussed publicly rather than being sneaked through parliment. Access works, dont change it, education should be for everyone.",
