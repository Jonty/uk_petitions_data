        "additional_details": "The Conservative Party did not win even a majority in the general election. They - along with the Liberal Democrats - are now enforcing POLICIES that nobody voted for, such as educational and healthcare reforms which are extremely unpopular.\r\n\r\nThe only democracy they'll allow us is this phony petitions business, but instead of using it for silly things like capital punishment and leaving the EU, which would never be allowed to pass anyway, let us use this to show our opposition to the Tories, Liberals AND Labour Party.\r\n\r\nI hereby undersign this petition stating my opposition to all three mainstream parties, their mis-management of the economy for the past 30 years and their corruption, greed and ignorance of democracy. I demand the resignation of David Cameron as a beginning of the reinstatement of democracy in Britain. ",
