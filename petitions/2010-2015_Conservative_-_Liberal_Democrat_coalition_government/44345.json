        "additional_details": "It is clear that the amount of time British people spend at work negatively impacts upon the time they spend with their families and the interaction they have with their children and loved ones. It is also clear that long hours result in unhealthy eating habits and a lack of exercise for many people. Increasing leisure time by reducing working hours and, maybe even, reducing the length of the working week, will ensure improved mental and physical well-being.",
