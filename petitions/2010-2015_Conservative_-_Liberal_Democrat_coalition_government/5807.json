Half of that advice includes things like, \"Bondage, esp. where gags are used\" and is wholly inconsistent.\r\n\r\neg. \"Pulp Fiction\" where bondage with high standard ball gags being used.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples in our society where things set down in the CPS guidelines are now considered acceptable practice.\r\n\r\nWith exception of child issues and bestiality (which are adequately covered in other laws anyway) it is about time that the OPA was revisited and possibly struck from our books.",
