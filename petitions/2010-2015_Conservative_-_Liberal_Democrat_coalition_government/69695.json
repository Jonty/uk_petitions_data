        "additional_details": "During the lead up to the Scottish Referendum on leaving the UK on the 18th of September the BBC's media coverage has been horrifically biased against the Yes vote.\r\n\r\nThere have been consistent inaccuracies presented and misleading reporting that has been widely exposed.\r\n\r\nAs the premier News Provider in The United Kingdom the BBC should be obligated to present citizens of the UK with accurate facts.  Whilst we recognise there is some bias in all news coverage, the attempt to actively mislead the populace of the UK about such a serious issue represents a huge breach of trust.  As such, the government needs to appoint an independent inquiry into why the BBC has chosen to misrepresent the views of it's own Licence Fee payers.",
