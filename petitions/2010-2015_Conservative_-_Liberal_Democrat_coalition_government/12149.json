        "additional_details": "Farmers Guardian says that the UK is importing 51% of the food that is consumed here. To be dependent on overseas sources for more than half of our food needs is shocking. We have a population of nearly sixty-two millions and we haven't a hope in hell of feeding them without massive food imports which may not always be available. We expect all sorts of food - as well as those lovely filling station flowers - to be available all-year-round. Much comes from Africa, and by air. Many African countries cannot feed their own peoples. While Africans starve, we demand our mange tout. Do our people have no shame? Let's have our farmers increase our home food production.",
