However whether DVD\u2019S are subtitled is a lottery.\r\n\r\n*Online sellers don't bother letting consumers know if DVD\u2019s are subtitled on their websites; Do we buy or don\u2019t we.\r\n\r\n*A distribution company said if TV broadcasters  do  not  provide the subtitle file of the programmes it sells the rights to, this means the distribution company has to pay a fortune to have a file created and will not subtitle many programmes for that reason.\r\n\r\n*DVD's from Australia released here and previously broadcast on British TV are never subtitled.\r\n\r\n*There are foreign people whose grasp of accents would be helped by subtitles.\r\n\r\n The government talk about disability and access but millions are excluded from a simple enjoyment.\r\n\r\nPlease compel DVD distributors to provide subtitles by way of legislation and stop this mass exclusion\r\n",
