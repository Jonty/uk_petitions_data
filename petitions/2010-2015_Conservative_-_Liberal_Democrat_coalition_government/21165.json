        "additional_details": "To stop metal theft means stopping the means for selling it on. We need urgent reform to the outdated Scrap Metal Dealers Act 1964. This crime is costing lives and livelihoods, it is only a matter of time before an innocent life is lost as the result of the mindless actions of criminals. The significant impact of metal theft is damaging national infrastructure such as energy, telecommunications and transport networks. It is destroying our heritage and communities through attacks on churches, public art and even war memorials. There is a Bill before Parliament to amend the law introduced by Graham Jones MP. The Government must support this Bill. It will provide for a robust licensing regime with requirements on dealers to establish the origin of materials, greater police and Magistrate powers to close and prevent the re-opening of scrap metal dealers who do not conform to licence conditions and a cashless system for payments with requirement for proof of identity of seller and receiver.",
