In days gone by when disaster struck people could always light a fire to keep warm, boil a kettle and cook food - even if it meant burning the furniture! Houses built over the last 20 or 30 years have no fireplace nor chimney so that is not an option.  THIS SITUATION MUST BE REVERSED, AND QUICKLY.",
