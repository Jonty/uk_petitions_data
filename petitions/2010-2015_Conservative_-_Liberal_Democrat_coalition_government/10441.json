I believe that a council should be able to assign jobs to people on benefit for the good of the community. For example when a community event requires a large scale clean up, the workforce can be created from people on benefits. People who work hard at these jobs and stand out should then be offered opportunities to improve their situation.\r\nReward Hard Work and Communities.\r\n",
