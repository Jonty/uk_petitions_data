        "additional_details": "Given that the House of Commons has voted \"No\" to a referendum on Great Britains membership of the EEC and will merely be tinkering about with employment law (probably to the disadvantage of some of the workforce), and given that we are subject to EU laws making voting for an MP a waste of time as your MP will have no real say in EU legislation, it is suggested that we do away with the House of Commons thus saving all the M.P's salaries (the same can be applied to civil servants) which would be good for the country given the current financial situation. In this way M.P's will also experience being \"all in it together\" with many of their constituants in that they will be unemployed. It will then make them feel part of the \"Big Society\". ",
