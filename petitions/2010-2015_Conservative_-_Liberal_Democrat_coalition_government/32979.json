        "additional_details": "The navy is now smaller than it has been for 200 years. Its ships are scattered all over the world doing whatever the government asks of it. 1 ship here, 1 ship there is all it can manage at its current levels It even has Royal Auxillary ships helping out, they are so short of ships to do all the tasks asked of it. If, god forbid, they are called upon to fight, there is no allowance for attrition at all. The navy needs more ships asap. Too much is being asked of it. Build more ships!!",
