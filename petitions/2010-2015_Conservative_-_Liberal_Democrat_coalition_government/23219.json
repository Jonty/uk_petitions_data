        "additional_details": "I have seen many injuries in my line of work sustained from dangerous driving from mobility scooters. I regularly see dangerous driving resulting in near misses on pavements, in shops and shopping centres, and today my own daughter narrowly escaped serious injury by a mobility scooter reversing at an inappropriately high speed in a shopping centre.\r\n\r\nAs a result of all the above I feel that mobility scooter users should have compulsory training prior to using them, and certainly hold a licence just as regular road users do.\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly about this, then please sign this petition, then maybe we can make our streets and shopping centres a safer place for everyone, thankyou.
