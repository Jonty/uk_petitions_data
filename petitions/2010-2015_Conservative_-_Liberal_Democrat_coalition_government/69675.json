Surely acts of terroism from whatever group or religon against our proud nation and people warrants to be taken as just that. Treason. I'm, like many others, sick & tired of this threat. We, as a nation have a duty to protect our innocents and our shores. I propose bringing back the death penalty for those found 100% guilty of murder in the name of religion. Life meaning life for those uk citizens found guilty of conspiracy to murder plus non UK citizens, regardless of political sanctions ie. Origin of birth dangerous or other extradition rights based on misplaced humanity,wavered & said person sent back to their own place of birth where they can longer leech off of our benefits, good grace and tolerance which they crave but in the same breath scream they hate the west",
