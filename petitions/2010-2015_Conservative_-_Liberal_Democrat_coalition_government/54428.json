        "additional_details": "There is a line in the sand to NEVER use chemical weapons. This line has been crossed and children are being brutally murdered. The MORAL thing to do is to stop the systematic genocide of the Syrian people. I plead with the British government to stop the killing in Syria by using precision air strikes to eliminate the chemical weapons threat. I do not advise putting troops in but we must show our stance on chemical weapons and uphold our moral code which I fear may have been irreversibly damaged by our government's previous decision which I feel was not representative of the British people's views. To do nothing is a moral outrage against humanity and I am frankly DISGUSTED in my government for their lack of morals and I am ashamed to call myself British. There is a line in the sand and it has been crossed and we MUST act.",
