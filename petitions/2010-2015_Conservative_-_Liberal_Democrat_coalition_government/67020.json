        "additional_details": "A plaque for John Lilburne (1614-1657) is erected in recognition of the role played by the Levellers in general and John in particular, in the establishment of parliamentary freedom and democracy in this country.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Geoffrey Bindman said in 2010 \"John Lilburne's courage and passion for justice led to the establishment in law of some of our most cherished liberties\".\r\n\r\nThe lack of any official memorial for this great person, where people can pay their respects and acknowledge his contribution to our nation's history is a considerable oversight.\r\n\r\nThere are two suitable locations for a plaque. A prominent position somewhere on the House of Commons estate; or in close proximity to his original resting place in a churchyard in Bethlehem near Bishopsgate.\r\n",
