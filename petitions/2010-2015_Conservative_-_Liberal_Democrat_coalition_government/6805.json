        "additional_details": "Authorise a multidisciplinary team of medics, nurses, solicitors and capacity advocates to ensure euthanasia is carried out in a calm and controlled manner in the following cases:\r\n\r\n1. There is a diagnosed, incurable condition where the patient may choose to end their life at any time.\r\n\r\n2. There is a sudden and permanent deterioration in health beyond what is acceptable to the person but the person for whatever reason lacks capacity at the time to consent.\r\n\r\n3. This petition does not support and specifically excludes family members and single handed health care workers from carrying out euthanasia to ensure all decisions are in the patient's best interests and no competing interests exist.  It does not exclude their right to consultation over the decision making process. ",
