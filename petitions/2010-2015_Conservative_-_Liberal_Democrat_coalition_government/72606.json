        "additional_details": "There are many killers in the UK, but one of the top ones is there not being enough organs to give to the people that need them. Opt-out means that everyone is automatically donating their organs when they die, and you would have to sign a form to say you would NOT like to donate your organs after death. I would like it changed because it could be you who needs an organ, and if the system is changed when you need them, then you will have a high chance of surviving. If it isn't changed by then, then you will have a high chance of not surviving.\r\n\r\nThe action I would like them to take is to change the organ donation system from opt-in to opt-out. Help change the system, for a better future.",
