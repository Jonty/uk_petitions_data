        "additional_details": "I as a constituent wish to complain about the newly announced increase to rail fares for 2015.\r\n\r\nWe have the highest fares in Europe, yet all services are overcrowded which include safety concerns, frequently running late.\r\n\r\nWe understand the rail network is vital to our economy and environment, but there has been very little investment from the private train companies. Most investment has come from taxpayers and just alone over the last two years this exceeded \u00a34bn whilst the shareholders shared over 200m.\r\n\r\nIt is time to speak up and ensure we the public are treated fairly.\r\nPlease support this call for affordable railway under public ownership that puts people before profit.",
