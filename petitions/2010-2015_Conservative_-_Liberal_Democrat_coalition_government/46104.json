As there will be no English Parliament to conduct the negotiations this petition asks the UK government to adhere to these parameters:-\r\n\r\nNegotiations not be conducted by any Minister, M.P , or civil servant of Scottish parentage:\r\n\r\nNo currency union. No Scottish representation in the sterling central bank.\r\n\r\nNo subsidies of Scottish wind farms by taxpayers or consumers:\r\n\r\nNo further warship contracts for Scottish yards;\r\n\r\nNo shared state broadcaster;\r\n\r\nNo shared embassies;\r\n\r\nNo shared Post Office (so no English subsidy for Scottish deliveries);\r\n\r\nNo open border or common travel area;\r\n\r\nNo dual nationality option;\r\n\r\nNo government employment or elected office for those opting for Scottish nationality ;\r\n\r\nAll defence resources to be withdrawn from Scotland .\r\n\r\nIn short no \"best of both worlds\".\r\n",
