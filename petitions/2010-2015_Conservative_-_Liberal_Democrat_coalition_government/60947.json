        "additional_details": "Despite fraudulent elections, economic collapse, 60+ murders and kidnappings daily (the list goes on and on) incredibly, the British Government still considers Venezuela, with the largest proven oil reserves on the planet, to be a democracy with whom we should \"strengthen the relationship and deepen areas of mutual interest\". The last 12 years have provided copious opportunities and reasons to revise this view and even in the last few days, the unreported murder, persecution, assault, unlawful detention and torture of peaceful protesters, is apparently insufficient grounds to finally accept that we must not only end our support but condemn it as a repugnant dictatorship now. Venezuelans need our public support, showing that we care, that we are watching and that because we understand our duties as a privileged nation, we too are not afraid to fight for all that we stand for. This petition will drive my government to act on behalf of Venezuelans who can no longer do so in freedom.",
