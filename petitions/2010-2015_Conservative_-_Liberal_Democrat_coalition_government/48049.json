        "additional_details": "Compelling evidence shows that the brains of teenagers differs biologically to younger children and adults and benefit from sleeping in longer in the mornings. Concentration, exam results and less truancy are the reported benefits if teens start school one hour later in the mornings.\r\nSchools in the USA are starting to adopt this principle with success. One school in the UK in Newcastle has successfully trialled this idea.\r\nI would be extremely happy if, when my children are in their teens, school policy respects their biological needs, so they can get the best out of their education.",
