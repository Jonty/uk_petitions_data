These are all perfectly legal drugs that the majority of people can buy cheaply over a counter. Cannabis has killed 2 people ever in the world. The lowest figures out of any known drug. Yet its a class B, frowned upon pass-time in this country. Many parts of the world have decriminalised cannabis and it is proven to decrease drug crime by over 50%.
