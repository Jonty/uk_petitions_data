        "additional_details": "As part of Mr Cameron's Big Society initiative a move must be made to ensure employers are educated to embrace and employ over 50's. The recent riots have proved that our society is lacking in discipline, integrity and politeness; this needs to change  by tapping into the wealth of unemployed over 50's, where there is an overwhelming source of energy, knowledge, integrity and professionalism. I ask you to please proffer your vote to ensure Mr Cameron is held accountable for his promises on instilling discipline, integrity and most importantly politeness back into our British Society.\r\n\r\nPlease vote and as a 59-year unemployed female with over 40 years experience as an HR Professional, believe me I know first-hand what I am talking about.  I am sick and tired of being INVISIBLE and not having a voice in today's society. Lets gets matters moving and stop this spiral before it is too late!",
