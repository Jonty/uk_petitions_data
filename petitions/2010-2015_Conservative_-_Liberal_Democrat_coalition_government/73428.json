        "additional_details": "Most hamsters are kept in cages that are too small, very much under the RSPCA's 80x50cm continuous floor space minimum.\r\n\r\nModular cages are marketed as permanent living dwellings, yet they often can not even accommodate the right wheel size for a Syrian and are so small that they can cause chronic stress.\r\n\r\nHamsters of all species need at least 80x50cm. This is what the RSPCA minimum recommends for a\r\nSyrian.\r\n\r\nUpon measuring my old \"large\" plastic hamster home from Pets at Home, I discovered that it is around 50x30cm - too small\r\n\r\nThe government needs to do something about this animal abuse. Any cages that do not feature at least 80x50cm of continuous floor space must be marketed as extension cages. Having any hamster living in a cage below 80x50cm (or the equivalent, such as 79x51) should be a criminal offense. A cage marketed as large must be at least 160x100cm. 80x50 must be called small cages. Also, pet stores MUST market cages to what they can be used for.",
