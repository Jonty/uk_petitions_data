It should be outlawed as it seeks to establish a woman's marital status and if Ms is chosen it implies divorce or strident feminism!.\r\nIt is a symptom of the struggle women continue to have for equality in public life.\r\nAbolish it.\r\n\r\nIt is no laughing matter but a civil liberties issue that has NOT gone away. So please introduce a law that requires that there is only one title for women and that be MS\r\n",
