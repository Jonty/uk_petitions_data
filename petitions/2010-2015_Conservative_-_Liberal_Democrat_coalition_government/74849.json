As it stands at the moment and I quote from your own website \"The person will be recorded as missing and their details made available to other UK police forces within 48 hours.\" This is an horrendous amount of time. Given the power of social media I would like this law to be changed so that details should be released as soon as possible after the occurrence. Perhaps by setting up a central website that could be updated by all authorities I firmly believe that this slight variation could help solve many more cases quickly and save many more lives. We are seeing many more cases where the nasty element in society are using social media in a bad way, perhaps it's time to change the negative to a positive by harnessing that power for good.",
