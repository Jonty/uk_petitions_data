        "additional_details": "For too long now, the British media have been able to publicly name and print personal photographs and details of anyone arrested of a crime.\r\n\r\nIn the past year alone, we have seen the lives of Chris Jefferies and Rebecca Leighton ruined by the mainstream British media and tabloids who have published photographs and personal details of them, allowing vicious and vindictive witch-hunts to be conducted on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, calling for their deaths and worse. These people were then released without charge, left to a life in a world where they are spat at in the street. And for what reason?\r\n\r\nWhy has this country dropped the 'innocent until proven guilty' mantra? The press are NOT exempt. We hereby call for the media to be restricted from naming and publishing details of suspects until they have received a fair trial and been proven guilty.",
