        "additional_details": "Speed-limited vehicles such as lorries regularly take up to several minutes to pass each other on the motorway, due to a refusal of the vehicle in front to slow down and allow the other to pass.  This can lead to long queues and dangerous driving among the vehicles following.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests the introduction of a law requiring speed-limited vehicles to act in a similar manner to time-trial cyclists when overtaking.  Overtaking manouevres will be required to be completed within 30 seconds, and the leading vehicle will be required to temporarily slow down in order to accomodate this if necessary.",
