        "additional_details": "As the overall international situation deteriorates it is  essential that the UK provides itself with the ability to protect its interests and project its values across the world - and the best way to do this is by rebuilding the strength of the Royal Navy. Furthermore, if we do this using our existing capacity for Naval shipbuilding we will also redirect public expenditure into high tech manufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nAs a first step every ship that we can get to sea must be got to sea, and we should re-negotiate all existing contracts to get 50% more Ships for 30% more cost - three Queen Elizabeth class carriers not two, nine type 45 Destroyers not six, ten or twelve Astute class submarines not seven - the Carriers with full air wings, the warships with a full weapons fit. During this Parliament the Royal Navy needs to start to grow to a hundred or more ships, not fall to thirty or less.\r\n\r\n",
