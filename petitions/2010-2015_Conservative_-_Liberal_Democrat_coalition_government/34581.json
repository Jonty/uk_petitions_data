        "additional_details": "We require assistance in pursuing Knowsley council in kirkby liverpool in the reasons as to why they are delaying talks and planning permission with sonae about a large investment and rebuild of its plant after a large fire .This delay tactic will eventually give sonae no alternative but to withdraw millions of pounds worth of investment to the site and closure causing 250 plus redundancies and collapse of small local buisinesses due to this so we would like support in people signing e-petition to force the local council to take up talks with sonae.",
