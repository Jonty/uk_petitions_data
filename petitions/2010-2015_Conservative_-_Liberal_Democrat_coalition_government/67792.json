        "additional_details": "We would like the government to help us gain funding and support us to make a better facility for the ever growing and thriving alternative sports scene in the town. We think that the skate-park should be a reflection of the excellent skateboarding scene in the town and a reflection of how good Mote Park is. We believe it would have a positive effect on Maidstone and give young people in the area more space to enjoy there sport safely. In its current state the skate-park becomes dangerously overcrowded during peak times which has become more of an issue over the last couple of years.",
