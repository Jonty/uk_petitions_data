        "additional_details": "The country needs people to be working rather than claiming benefit but the biggest obstacle to this is affordable child care. Schools have all the required facilities and often have support staff that have the required skills to supervise children. Allow the country to get back to work but providing provision in all schools to drop kids off from 6am and allow collection until 6pm. This would reduce the need for additional benefits to cover extortionate child care bills, allow more people to work and may provide additional education. The money saved from benefits payments to private child care provision could be used to fund this provision.",
