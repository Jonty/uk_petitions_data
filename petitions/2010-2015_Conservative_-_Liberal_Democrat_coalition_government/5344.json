However, abortion, which is the wilful killing of the most defenceless members of the human race - unborn children - is considered permissible, surely this is a contradiction?\r\nMost abortions in this country are performed in NHS hospitals. This means that public money is being used to murder children, in places where lives are supposed to be saved.\r\nResearch shows that the termination of pregnancy is more likely to cause mental health problems than carrying the child to term, even in the case of rape. This shows that mental health cannot be used to justify abortion.\r\nThere are many married couples who are ready to raise children but who cannot conceive and go to great lengths, at taxpayers' expense, to artificially conceive, often without success. Surely the cheaper, more moral option would be for children the parents cannot raise to be put up for adoption by those who can.",
