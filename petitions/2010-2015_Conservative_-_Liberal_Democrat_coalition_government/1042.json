        "additional_details": "BSKYB base their subscription for pubs and clubs on rateable value which takes no account of actual size of likely audiences. Sports clubs suffer badly under this system which can result in quite out of proportion charges. The music people PRS have a sensible policy that reflects size of actual seating area with estimate number of people. BBC only charge their normal licence fee and are now at a considerable disadvantage for access to funds to bid for large events such as the recent Formula 1. The amounts of money involved in TV rights for Sport are now at a level where politicians need to step in and protect the public interest?  BSKYB is a monopoly and their charging policy for pubs and clubs is unfair and needs to be debated and changed.",
