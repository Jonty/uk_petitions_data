The individual would be sacked and labelled a disgrace, and rightly so.\r\n\r\nDianne Abbotts comments were ignorant, whether she has been somehow taken out of context (and it is difficult to see how this could happen) or not, the blunder is enough to have a bi election called.\r\n\r\nIn recent times:\r\n\r\n-Ann Winterton was sacked for telling a racist joke and rightly so.\r\n-Labour have called for Aidan Burley to be gotten rid of for attending a party with 'potential' nazi themed fancy dress.\r\n\r\nYet Dianne abbott is given 'a severe dressing down'.\r\n\r\nIf she doesn't resign she should be sacked, as she should not be in a position of trust as an MP and clearly cannot represent the views of the country or her constituents any longer.",
