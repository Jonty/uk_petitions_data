Illegals with no passport should be fully detained until they obtain a passport and legal authorisation to remain in the UK. Without knowing the an illegal immigrants identity we are being placed in danger, they may have previous criminal history, they could be murderers or paedophiles or rapists, our government should be protecting the UK population from this, not allowing this to happen as this situation could be happening in the UK now with this current system.",
