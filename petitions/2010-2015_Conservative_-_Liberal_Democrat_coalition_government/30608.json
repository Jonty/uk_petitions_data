        "additional_details": "This petition is designed to put pressure on the Department of Health to investigate the DePuy ASR Hip device and the medical and human costs many victims are suffering because of the problems associated with it. It is also designed to force the Government to insist Johnson and Johnson compensates victims adequately.\r\n\r\nSome victims with a recalled Johnson & Johnson DePuy ASR hip replacement are suffering from severe pain, toxic metal poisoning, loose hip joints, and many have already gone through a 2nd or 3rd major surgery to replace the recalled hip implant.\r\n\r\nWe are asking Johnson & Johnson to do the right thing by immediately compensating the victims of the DePuy ASR hip recall. Please sign this petition now to show your support for those victims across the United Kingdom.",
