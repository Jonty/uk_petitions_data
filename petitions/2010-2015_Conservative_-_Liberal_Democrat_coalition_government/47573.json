(eg. food, drugs, crime etc.)\r\n\r\nIf people are given the methods for learning to control their minds, they have a chance of becoming better citizens. They will also become happier people.\r\n\r\nThere are many scientific studies proving the health benefits of meditation, both mentally & physically.\r\n\r\nMeditation makes people more peaceful by harmonizing their brainwaves.\r\n\r\nWhy don't we start teaching meditation in schools?\r\n\r\n",
