        "additional_details": "We want a General Election as this government does not have a mandate to be making decisions which are harmful to our lives, and to those of generations to come. The coalition has lost all credibility and is damaging our country. It is completely unfair that those of us who voted for the Liberal Democrats have unwillingly placed the Conservatives in power. The two parties clearly have opposing ideological values, and as a result should have no business being locked into a coalition in which one party is dominant above the other. We ask that the House of Commons should call for a General Election as soon as possible so that we can install a Government which has the support of the majority of voters. After all, that is surely what democracy is about.",
