        "additional_details": "It is disgusting that so many people in our country are in poverty and there are so many cuts taking place in areas such as education, care and health, as we are apparently in a lot of debt! However, OUR government deem it appropriate to spend \u00a315 billion over the next few years on developing roads in England. How can this be justified? Additionally, we are trying to reduce traffic and our impact on the environment, would this money not be better spent on reducing our carbon footprint and supporting the members of our communities more effectively? Please help to raise this issue in parliament and make them rethink this ridiculous decision!",
