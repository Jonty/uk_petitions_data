        "additional_details": "The BBC Trust have seen it fit to pay off the ex Director General \u00a3400,000 of license fee payers money. The man was in the job for just 3 months, and in that time our world famous and respected broadcasting corporation has been brought into disrepute. If the BBC Trust push ahead with this ridiculous pay off we as the people that fund this will lose \u00a3400,000 that could have been put to better use. If you are happy with this then don't add your name, however in these times of austerity if you believe that we should not allow this to happen by withholding our next year license fee then please sign and let those that hold the power know that we as the public will not stand for wastage of our hard earned cash.",
