        "additional_details": "In place of prison sentences of say, up to 4 weeks, allow defendants an elective choice of say 10 strokes of a cane, as per Singapore etc. This would significantly reduce prison costs and the huge costs costs associated with family support whilst someone's incarcerated for relatively minor offences. Public denial of the opportunity not to go to prison will show so-called 'tough-nuts and their immediate friends and family just how cowardly the offender is, thus reducing his or her so called 'street cred'. On further 'minor' convictions the number of strokes can be raised and or enforced. A little pain and public humiliation may also provide moral recompense for  victims of minor crimes.",
