It is also contrary to public interests, wishes and liberties.\r\n\r\nContrary to what the government wishes people to believe, the government is answerable to the public when it comes to national security, information it collects, who the information is provided to, and how it spends peoples taxes.\r\n\r\nAlthough Snowden is mainly implicated in issues in the USA, this has had some fall out in the UK, as prism data has been collected from USA companies operating through the UK.",
