        "additional_details": "Proposal:\r\nThe government creates a public Register of Ministerial Accountabilities.\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nThere is an obvious misunderstanding by the vast majority of government ministers about the difference between accountability and responsibility.  There seems to be a lack of willingness to be held accountable for actions.  The creation of a register will clearly identify the scope of accountability of each ministerial and cabinet post which will ensure that a fully meshed set of accountabilities are seen by the electorate and understood by the post holders.  This will eliminate dubiety over \"shared\" accountabilities and also help identify gaps in overall accountability that should cascade from Prime Minister downwards.\r\n\r\nThese accountabilites should be legally enforcable, as they are within industry.  They should be reviewed whenever there is an organisational change.  They will also facilitate impact assessments for new post holders.",
