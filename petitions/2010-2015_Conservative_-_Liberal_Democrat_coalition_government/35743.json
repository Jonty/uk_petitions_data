        "additional_details": "From 9 July 2012 the Government will set the income threshold of \u00a318,600 for sponsoring the settlement in the UK of a spouse or fianc\u00e9(e) of non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationality. There is an even higher threshold for any children also sponsored; \u00a322,400 for one child and an additional \u00a32,400 for each further child.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the income requirement was in line with UK income support levels therefore approximately \u00a36,000 for a couple and \u00a38,500 for a couple with a dependent child.\r\n\r\nThis new policy means that a UK national who marry Non-EEA national will have to earn approximately 3 times more now than he/she would have had to under the old system.\r\n\r\nWe want a full and open debate of this policy in Parliament and for the Home Office to review this new threshold.",
