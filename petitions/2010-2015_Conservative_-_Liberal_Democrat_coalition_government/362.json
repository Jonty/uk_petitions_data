        "additional_details": "We want the Government to require all Local Councils to publish full details of their Organisation and Management Structures, Staffing Levels, Job Descriptions and Costs. The resultant information should be published in a form that permits direct comparison of any selected Council against any other Council.\r\n\r\nCouncil Tax Payers will be better able to assess Council performance and value for money. Legislation arising from this petition will promote increased productivity and cost savings within most Local Council Authorities.\r\n\r\nPresently it seems that some Councils do not know who does what within their organisation, possibly this information may not exist?\r\n\r\nFrom a Central Government viewpoint this will help determine where guidance or, in some cases, intervention is needed.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that this will lead to a reduction in public expenditure, help to reduce the financial deficit and create savings for all Council Tax Payers.\r\n",
