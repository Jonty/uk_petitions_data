        "additional_details": "It is unfair on those children and adults who were given HMV vouchers or gift cards for Christmas 2012 only to be unable to use them in stores because the business has gone into liquidation.  These were gifts BOUGHT AND PAID FOR by friends and relatives in good faith.  HMV should have been aware of their financial difficulties in the run-up to Christmas but continued to allow the sale of gift vouchers and gift cards \u2013 this is totally irresponsible.  The undersigned petitioners call on the government to debate this in Parliament with a view to changing the laws and/or rules of liquidation so this cannot happen again.",
