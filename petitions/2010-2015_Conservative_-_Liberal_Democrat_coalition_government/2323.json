        "additional_details": "Parliament should debate whether MPs constituency work duplicates functions of local councillors & local government & whether or not MPs should sit fully in Westminster.\r\nIf MPs were fully committed to advocacy & law making at Westminster taking relevant instructions & agenda from elected local councillors & local authorities rather than constituents then they would be obliged to act under mandate and make them accountable makng the political system more representative of public interest, more business-like & professional and leaving constituency issues to local councillors rather than duplicating the role and move away from stale party political divisions to a basis of informed representative government/ Arguably this would be more cost effective, more representative and a better division of labour.\r\n",
