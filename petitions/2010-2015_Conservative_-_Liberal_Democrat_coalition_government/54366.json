        "additional_details": "For many years, Rolf Harris has been a unique face in the entertainment industry of the UK and Australia.\r\n\r\nRecently, it has been announced by the CPS that he is to face a total of 9 charges of Child Abuse, comprising 6 of Sexual Assault, and 3 of making indecent images of children.\r\n\r\nHe has received multiple honours from HM Queen Elizabeth II, including MBE, OBE, CBE and being made an Officer of the Order of Australia - the highest single honour which can be bestowed upon an Australian.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these charges, we, the undersigned, feel it is appropriate and respectful to Mr Harris' victims, that the honours are removed.\r\n\r\nNo person should be allowed to keep such privileged honours, when this kind of material lays in their past.",
