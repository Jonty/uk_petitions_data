        "additional_details": "Punishment for people who commit crime should be harsher especially for repeat offenders.\r\nWhen released from prison any benefits received should be capped for a period of time.  Cuts are being made all over the country on everything possible yet millions is still paid out to criminals to reintroduce them into society.\r\nIf this isn\u2019t working for the individuals reoffending then this support should be stopped then longer prison sentence would be better for society with fewer criminals on the street.\r\nPrisons shouldn\u2019t have all of the luxuries such as TVs.  Any luxury items should be sold off to raise money - money to be used for crime prevention or to help people affected by crime etc.  A prison cell should be a bed, toilet and sink. Prison should be a punishment.  It is shown in many interviews people who have served time in our prisons they say it is not a deterrent and that it isn\u2019t something that would deter from crime in the future.  This needs to change if we aim to tackle crime.",
