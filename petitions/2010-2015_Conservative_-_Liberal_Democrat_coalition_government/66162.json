        "additional_details": "In the UK, some animals are now slaughtered in a manner not liked by all the population.  Labels on meat bought in supermarkets gives the public information on nutrition, the rearing, any freedoms the animal may have had prior to death, nationality, yet nothing on how the animal meets its end. It is the same for meat used in food production, or sold in public places for immediate consumption.\r\nThe general public has a right to know exactly what it is buying and eating.  Ministers seem to think that ignorance is bliss.  The public has a strong enough constitution to cope with facts, and facts should be in the public domain. Knowing how an animal is slaughtered should be made openly available and visible at the point of purchase, be that in a retail site or eatery.  Ministers should give this some serious thought.",
