        "additional_details": "We believe the introduction of short term tenancies will be detrimental to social housing, destroying the very intention of system.  Having a negative impact in the following areas -\r\n\r\n1) Tenants will no longer have the incentive to invest in the upkeep of their homes.\r\n\r\n2) Sustainable Communites - short term lets will not allow communities to build.\r\n\r\n3) Mobility of Tenants - New tenants may not have the right to exchange, thus reducing the opportunities for self sought moves and increasing the need for applications for rehousing.\r\n\r\n4) Removing the LA's duty to consider all applications will result in a large number of our existing society being excluded from the Social Housing, whilst those granted asylum would become immediately eligible for assistance under homeless legislation - unfair treatment!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
