        "additional_details": "Many of our country roads have speed restrictions of 60mph.   In well-lit towns with pavements and wider lanes vehicles are generally restricted to 30mph.  It makes no sense at all that on roads where pedestrians, horses, farm vehicles etc have to walk on the road itself which is unlit, narrow and often with blind corners we allow vehicles to travel up to 60mph. It is no suprise at all that these roads are 11 times more deadly than motorways.  People would be safer walking on the road in a town, but we would never allow that to happen and there is also no need. This seems to be an historical anomally that has not been corrected.    ",
