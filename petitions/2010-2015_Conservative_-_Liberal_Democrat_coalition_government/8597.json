Exceptions only to be made when doing so is required to ensure personal safety such as riding a motorbike.\r\n\r\nIt is easily perceived as threatening and antisocial to have the face covered (e.g. recent thieves and rioters) and hinders identification of those engaging in criminal acts.\r\n\r\nThis is not a ban on the face veil specifically and should not be considered an attack on any race, creed or religion.\r\n\r\n",
