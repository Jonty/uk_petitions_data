        "additional_details": "Myammar or Burma has been killing innocent Muslim citizens since 1990, and voices has been raised around the World. It is unfortunate ,that neither our media nor any Political leader have raised voice against this brutal act against the Government of Burma, according to human rights group of Burma , more then 60,000 innocent human are killed in Burma ,since 1990. But now a days its getting worst, a report from Muslim Council of Mymmar has been circulated, where it has been reported that over 20, villages in north with Muslim population are burnt dawn by rival groups backed by local Army. It is a shocking story, hopefully political Leaders from civilized countries around the World should raise this issue internationally ,and ask to stop violence against humanity. Indeed it will give a good name to peoples who work for peace irrespect of what religion they are.",
