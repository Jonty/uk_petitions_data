        "additional_details": "Currently the law states that you can lop a tree that overhangs your property to the boundary provided you return the branch to the owner. This puts an unfair onus on the neighbour as the overhang may be only reachable with difficulty from that side of the boundary and the owner may have planted it too close to the boundary. The law shoul be amended to force the owner of the tree to trim it back to the boundary or to get agreement from the neighbour that the overhang is acceptable. The penalty should be that the neighbour can get 2 quotes and charge the owner for the work.\r\n",
