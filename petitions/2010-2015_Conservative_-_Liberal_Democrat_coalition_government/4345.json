        "action": "Now is the time for a complete overhaul of the personal taxation system",
        "additional_details": "The existing personal tax system is broken down into 3 slices, income tax, employees national insurance and employers national insurance. Each segment is calculated in a completely different way using differing percentages, rates, cut-offs and rules. Income tax is accruable whereas NI is not. If you have two jobs you get two NI allowances but not with tax. This is further exacerbated with the multitude of codes and differing rates for the self employed etc.\r\nThe system for calculating this correctly is ridiculously complicated and archaic. The cost to this country is massive and needs a total overall to make the system fairer, clearer, more manageable and efficient.\r\n",
