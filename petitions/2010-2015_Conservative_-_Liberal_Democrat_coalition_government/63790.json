        "additional_details": "It's estimated that every year in England and Wales, there are around 60,000-90,000 victims of rape (an estimate generated from data collected for the past 3 years from the BCS), many of which are not reported. If, between the 60,000 and 90,000 estimate 78,000 rapes happened in one year, only around 1,000 get convicted each year. If that does not worry us I don't know what will.\r\n\r\nEnough with the statistics - what is worrying is that women, and men, who are victims of rape (which is a crime on the increase year by year) are not getting the support they need. Time and time again victims are made to feel as if they are the criminals, making them feel alone and helpless. We need to do more for victims of rape, both male and female, of all ages, to offer better support to the real victims and move on from the victim blaming culture and stop making victims feel like they are not believed.
