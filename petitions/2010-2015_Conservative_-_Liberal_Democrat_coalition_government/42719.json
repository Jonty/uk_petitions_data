I have contacted them only to be told my contract came to an end so it automatically reverted back to a standard tarif.\r\n\r\nThey have my mobile phone number which they regularly send texts to sell me tickets etc, they have my e-mail address, they have my home address they are in the communication industry but they don't feel it necessary to contact me once to inform me my contract is coming to an end!\r\n\r\nThat is just barmy! I want to force a debate in parliament to create a Bill forcing these companies to contact their loyal customers prior to the end of a contract so that this can no longer happen.",
