        "action": "Change in UK food standards to ensure all fresh food is organically produced.",
        "additional_details": "Food is what fuels us, it helps us grow, provides us with the nutrients we need to live.  Common sense right?  So what happens if we consume food which contains toxins and chemicals daily?  Changes to our genetic make up, ill health, cancer even??\r\n\r\nThere is a need for a review of food standards in this country (and worldwide, but one step at a time!).\r\n\r\nThe benefits of organic farming are numerous, both from a health perspective and economically.  Smoking and alcohol are often cited as being bad for our health, but isn't it double standards to then have chemical ridden foods in the shops?\r\n\r\nLet's ask for the Government to seriously consider reviewing this issue including larger subsidies for farmers growing organically, legislation which ensures supermarkets etc. have to provide a higher percentage of organic food in their shops and high scale publicity of the health benefits of eating organically...five a day, but chemical free!\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and signing!\r\n\r\n",
