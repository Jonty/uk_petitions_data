        "additional_details": "In less than 3 months, NICE have rejected the use of 2 new Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer treatments, (Everolimus (Afinitor) and Pertuzemab (Perjeta); both of which could delay disease progression and prolong a woman's life, due to their cost.\r\nAs a young woman (39), and a mother living with metastatic breast cancer I am extremely disappointed by their decisions. Any treatments that could extend my life has to be worth the cost.\r\nI ask that the Government consider the moral issues involved here, not just the financial ones. To value life as I do, and as all the other women out there living with this disease. For NICE to say we are not worth it is a disgrace and you, as a Government, should challenge their decision. After all, when breast cancer affects 50,000 women a year and kills 1000 every month, if it was you, your mother, your wife or your daughter would you not want to know that every possible chance to fight the disease, or prolong the life, has been given?\r\n",
