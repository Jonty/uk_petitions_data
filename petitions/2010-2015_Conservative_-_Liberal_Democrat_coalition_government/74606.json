        "additional_details": "The 'strengthened' Eng Lit GCSE will ensure many learners are unable to succeed, even if they are sensitive readers. Closed book conditions will require candidates to remember a minimum of 15 poems in order to 'closely analyse' two of them in an exam. It is impossibe to see how analysis will be enabled by removing entirely from sight the object to be closely analysed. With 80% of marks available for this skill, it is clear that standards will be depressed. Worse, the draconian closed book ruling is set to drive another nail into the coffin of inclusive education. Government must instruct Ofqual to repeal the ruling that all components of the exam are 'closed book' before teaching of new GCSEs begins next summer. ",
