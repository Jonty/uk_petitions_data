        "action": "Stop age discrimination against young people.",
        "additional_details": "The Equality Act 2010 provides commendable legislation regarding ageism in the UK. Unfortunately the government thinks that ageism disproportionately affects older people, rather than younger people. This is not true. Ageism against young people is enshrined in UK law. Examples include: four different minimum wages dependent on age, five different rates of jobseeker's allowance dependent on age and exclusion of under 25s from working tax credit. Most young people don't know, or understand, \"the system\" and as such, their voices are not heard. They just accept this discrimination because they don't know what to do. This petition calls for an end to ageism against young people, by giving the same entitlement to benefits and pay, regardless of age.",
