Consider extending this protection to inheritance tax assessment, preserving the ISA wrapper for the executors/executrices.\r\n\r\nThe purpose is to allow those looking after the affairs of someone needing nursing care some sort of option to move \u00a35000 a year into so that it isn't lost. At present the only option is to spend the person's money on solicitors to fight the NHS.\r\n\r\nMore than \u00a35000 a year could be put into a fund for growth (with perhaps 30% of it 'at risk') helping the country out of the depression.",
