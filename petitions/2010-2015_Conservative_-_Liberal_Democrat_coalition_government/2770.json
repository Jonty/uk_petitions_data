Others ask that English citizens views should be solicited in street interviews and that more jobs are given to us, the domiciled licence payers, not fly-by-night foreigners, who are simply here to make a buck. What about the numbers of has-been sports people jetting around the world to give us inane commentaries, e.g. on golf, tennis, athletics, formula one and most of all football. This list is only restricted by your own imagination. I SAY, PRIVATISE IT.\r\n",
