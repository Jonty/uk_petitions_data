        "additional_details": "The people of Shaw, Oldham want a safe crossing area where three roads converge into main road (Linney Lane, Salts Street, Milnrow Road and Crompton Way) to avoid another tragic accident like the one that occurred yesterday (17/12/13) killing a 12 year old girl and seriously injuring an 11 year old girl.  This is a black spot in Shaw where a lady was killed approximately 12 month's ago and still nothing has been done. How many more families have to be left devastated before something is done. ",
