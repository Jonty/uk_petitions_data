        "additional_details": "I fully support the petition to put Alan Turing on the new \u00a310 banknote, but feel that Tommy Flowers should also be recognised for his achievements at Bletchley Park. His work alongside Turing and invention of Colossus was integral to the codebreaking successes, in particular the breaking of the Lorenz cypher. Putting two people on the reverse of the banknote instead of just one would also be an additional security feature. ",
