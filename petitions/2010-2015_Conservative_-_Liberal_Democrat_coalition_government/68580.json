        "action": "The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers (DRIP) Act",
        "additional_details": "DRIP contains sweeping surveillance powers that will affect EVERYONE in UK. It contains the powers for Government to mandate the blanket retention of the communications data of the whole population for 12 months.  This is in direct contradiction of a Court judgment which held that this breached human rights. The Act also contains new and unprecedented powers for the UK Government to require overseas companies to comply with interception warrants and communications data acquisition requests and mandate companies to build interception capabilities in to their infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThese provisions expand interception powers appearing to enable the Government to issue interception warrants mandating mass surveillance outside of the United Kingdom. This Act shows utter contempt for the Rule of Law by attempting to overrule, rather than comply with, a Court judgment.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, would like this legislation reversed.\r\n",
