With the domain defaulting to, being advertised as and primary links going to the domain WITHOUT the www. prefix.\r\n\r\nPopular Web browsers assume the HTTP protocol, the software prepends the 'http://' onto the requested URL and automatically connect to the HTTP server on port 80. Why then do many servers require their websites to communicate through the www subdomain? Web servers should allow access to their pages though the main domain unless a particular subdomain is required. Succinctly, use of the www subdomain is redundant and time consuming to communicate.\r\n\r\n",
