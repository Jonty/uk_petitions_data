        "additional_details": "From before we are born, to living, to after we die the law affects everything! However, it is never mentioned in schools nor is it mentioned how we could apply the law through our businesses, institutions, authorities and courts. Religion is taught and that is fundamentally based on a legal concept i.e. murder, theft, lying (misrepresentation), proportionality, reasonableness, etc.\r\nPeople are not taught their rights or due process. Due process involves using the law and established system to find resolution with minimum effort or cost. People are afraid of the law and due process; it is not part of their education. This is a deliberate fundamental flaw in the National Curriculum.\r\nTort, Contract, Constitutional, Property, Succession, International and Human Rights law - and how to apply it as legal reasoning before or in court - should be taught from primary to secondary school to help children/people understand how to help themselves and each other.\r\n\r\n",
