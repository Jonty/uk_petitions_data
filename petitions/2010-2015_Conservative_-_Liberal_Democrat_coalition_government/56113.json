Surely the costs of such partisan events (even if permissible) and such fees should be the responsibility of the beneficiaries (the Conservative Party; the Bankers in question) rather than the Nation as a whole? Alternatively, such events and fee-settlements should be open to the Nation at large, since all would be paying for them.   ",
