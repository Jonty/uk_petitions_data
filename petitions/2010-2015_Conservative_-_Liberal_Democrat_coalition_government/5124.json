Establish greater control for individuals to opt out of emailing and telephoning by third parties by imposing greater sanctions against those not adhering to preference services registrations or initial or periodic opt-ins/opt-outs. Establish controls of collection and use of data in sites like google/email providers.\r\n\r\nData Protection Act and Preference Services moved us forwards last century but need to be updated for  the internet, email and mobile networking age where it is cheaper and easier to contact 100s of people for little cost in seconds.",
