        "additional_details": "Smoking should be banned within all prisons across the UK due to the health problems that it causes. Secondary smoke is dangerous to others, mainly the prison guards and other prison officials. These people have no choice whether they inhale the second hand smoke when dealing with an inmate. Along with that, smoking is a priviledge, just like freedom. These days, smokers are banned from smoking in certain areas, these include bus stops, childrens parks and medical institutions (among many others), this should really expand to the prisons too!",
