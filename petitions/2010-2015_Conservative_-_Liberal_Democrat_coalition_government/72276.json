        "additional_details": "Popular sports and entertainment events sell out on primary ticket seller websites within seconds of general release and within less than a few minutes are offered for re-sale on secondary sale websites owned by the same companies.The Government should impose a restriction in terms of when tickets can be re-sold and advertised for sale. If this was closer to the event date, it would allow people who have a change in plans to sell tickets if they cannot attend and at the same time it would deter the cottage industry of people buying tickets with the specific intention of instantly placing them for re-sale. It is simply not fair for consumers attempting to buy tickets through primary ticket sellers to be informed they are sold out as soon as they are available for sale, only for the same companies to advertise immediately that they are available (more often than not) at above face-value prices via their re-sale arms.",
