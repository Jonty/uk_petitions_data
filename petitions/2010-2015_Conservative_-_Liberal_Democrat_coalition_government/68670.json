As a result of negligent pedestrians, and other drivers.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of these cases the accused does not inform the vehicle owner of his action, thus leaving the owner to pay for the cost of repairing dents, scratches, wing mirrors, and headlights.\r\n\r\nBy introducing a legal requirement to have CCTV in car parks, it is thought this would increase the chances of successful civil recovery and/or prosecution.",
