It is an exercise to defile, cause offence, incite hatred and racism to the very country that houses them and in some cases have given them sanctuary and safety to live their daily lives. Do these radicals not realise that we would not have the multi-cultural society of today\u2019s Briton without the sacrifice of our war dead.\r\n\r\nIt is a fundemental right and tradition within the British culture to remember and show respect to our fallen, in peace without the threat of poppy burning protests.\r\n\r\nThis abomination should be stopped with the full power and support of the British government!
