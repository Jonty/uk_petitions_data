In addition, I would like legislation introduced that ensures that all private sector employees are entitled to defined benefit pension scheme benefits that are accrued and calculated on exactly the same terms as those currently being proposed by the coalition government as being fair and reasonable to public service employees. I would also like legislation introduced that dictates that the additional cost to private sector employers of providing these benefits should be borne by the public purse.",
