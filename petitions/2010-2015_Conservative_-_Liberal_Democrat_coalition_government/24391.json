The West End's business economy will be under threat and abolishing the free single yellow lines after 18:30 on weekdays and free parking on Sundays will be seen as a deterrent to the public. The cost of living for an average person in London has increased enormously-this is adding to the problem us Londoners face. Let our voices be heard.",
