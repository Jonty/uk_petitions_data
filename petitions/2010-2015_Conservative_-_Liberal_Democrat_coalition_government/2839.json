        "additional_details": "The UK Insurance industry is currently regulated and bound by laws that can lead to and encourage motoring and insurance fraud.  We demand more transparency by considering implementing the following steps:\r\n\r\n1) Licence Insurance Agents, regulate them via the finance industry, Liability is a huge responsibility and employees of brokers can lack competency and or capacity to make proper recommendations for cover.\r\n\r\n2) Allow aspects of the DVLA system to be open to licensed agents/insurers for a number of reasons:\r\n2a) Insurers can check drivers are licenced to drive lawfully.\r\n2b) Insurers can report cancel non-paid policies via the DVLA, allowing other insurers to check the DVLA database before issuing cover; this will contribute to creating financial responsibility on part of the insurer and insured.\r\n\r\nBy instituting US style insurance regulations, those who defraud the insurance market will find it increasingly more difficult to drive without proper documentation.",
