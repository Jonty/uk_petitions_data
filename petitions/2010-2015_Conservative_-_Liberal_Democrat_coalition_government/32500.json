        "additional_details": "This is a petition to scrap the Driver CPC. In no other occupation do you have to pay every 5 years to continue to work. The average age of a lorry driver being around 55 means in 10 years there will be a huge cut in the number of drivers. No-one is willing to pay out the amount it costs to obtain a Cat C+E license never mind the \u00a3300 for Driver CPC. Scrap it to avoid a drop in driver numbers.",
