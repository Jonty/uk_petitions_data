        "additional_details": "The Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson MP, is considering granting permission to destroy ancient woodlands to build houses if new trees are planted. These woodlands have been planted for 400 years or more. Many of them are home to rare species, are SSSIs or have some historical or social importance: this cannot be replaced simply by planting elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis is a petition to the Government to drop these plans irrevocably, to show sense and respect in nurturing, cherishing and encouraging the growth of these endangered and beautiful places, and to rehabilitate land instead of destroying more greenfield sites.",
