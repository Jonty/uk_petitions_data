They are quite freely being allowed to to do so as there is no mandatory law set in place, using the CSA for many, many women has proven unsucessful or cases such as years of non or very little payments.  I want the governmet to change the whole system as this is a huge (and growing) problem, which is leaving children in many cases, underpriveledged, missing out on activities, school trips, outings, clothing, food, the upkeep of a warm and well looked home etc.  When a couple unfortunately splits, the child should be cared and paid for directly down the middle.  I would like to see  a set % of  the fathers wage taken out of what they earn, wether they be on benifits or work the same rule applys to all whatever their situation.  Everybody in this country should be made to pay for their responsibilities in life.       ",
