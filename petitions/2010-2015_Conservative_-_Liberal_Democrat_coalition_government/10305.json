If those persons are breaking the law(s) of this country then they should not be protected by it. What if someone did something against the law which is/was very terrible they are protected if on the day of their hearing they were a day short of their 18th birthday. This is not correct. Even children know when they are doing wrong so therefore they should also be named. It is not proper that their indentities are protected to not injure their sensitivities.",
