        "additional_details": "Have the Government spend \u00a31bn, buying upto 20000 houses, that are currently on the market, starting in the North East, where housing is cheapest. This will allow those currently living in these houses a chance to move into new housing, giving the housing market a boost. It would also make these 20000 houses available as council houses, raising \u00a35.6m per month based on \u00a3280p/m rent. In 3 and a half years, the country would have made their money back, and have \u00a31bn worth of assets. I would also suggest that a \u00a35000 budget is set aside for each house prior to making the house available for rent to make the house habitable. This would pay for new kitchens, bathrooms and carpets, all supplied by local businesses, helping local joiners, plumbers, carpenters and other trademen. We are spending Billions every year with no return. Why not spend some money and have a guaranteed return, and give local businesses a chance, while hepling out the poorest with social housing at the same time? ",
