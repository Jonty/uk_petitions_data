        "additional_details": "The EU is good for the UK markets.  The unchecked movement of persons from the EU into this country is not.  At a time when money for public services is in limited supply, compounded by the fact that both housing and jobs are sparse, it is no longer acceptable to continue a open doors policy for EU citizens.  It is time to resume a selective approach to UK entry.  Skilled people in areas we lack manpower should be the only criteria we accept.  Dont seal the border but at least stem the flow.  If we cant have a referendum on EU membership at least consider this proposal.  Remove the right of freedom of movement to the UK from the EU.   ",
