        "additional_details": "MPs are considering introducing a nine-hour school day and cutting holidays to seven weeks a year.\r\nThe new plans would see youngsters in school from 9am to 6pm and holidays cut from 13 weeks to seven. It would affect all children aged five to 18.\r\nA move towards nine-hour school days and longer terms could leave many children exhausted and too tired to learn, it has been suggested.\r\nFrom September next year it is proposed that this will be extended to schools still under local council control.\r\nSome teaching unions have also argued that school staff and pupils already spend long hours in the classroom.\r\nMoves to change term times and lengthen school days have already proved controversial.\r\nDo you really want your child having to spend even longer at school everyday?\r\nI know that I don't.\r\nSo if you are with me, and do not want nine hour school days for our children. Please sign this e-petition\r\n\r\n\r\n",
