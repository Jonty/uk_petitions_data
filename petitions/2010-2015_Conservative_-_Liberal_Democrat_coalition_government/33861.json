In the Daily Mail,  10/5/12 Iain Duncan Smith states \"Our plans for a simple,decent,single-tier state pension will mean that , finally,it pays to save, and those who work hard and do the right thing will be rewarded. Further on in the article, Malcolm Mclean, a pensions expert at actuaries Barnett Waddingham said,\" It is a pity of course, that existing pensioners will not be included, and that in consequence we will have two systems running side by side for many years to come, which defeats the object. This is very unfair, as it means that a couple who retires in Dec.2014, will get, (going on my own circumstances) \u00a3100 less than someone who retires Jan.2015. I think the Government should take another look at the situation and make all pensioners the same in 2015",
