        "additional_details": "Basically today there are a number of youths un-happy, and it has come to my attention, that if nothing better is put in place, to keep them a little more happier within life itself, then in theory, with the amount of growth/population, the number of job loss's, the number of youths attending to crime as thier ''motive'', with the measurement and time and the combination of thought, thier will, or is a chance that thier could be an uproar, if the situation isn't dealt with correctly i calculate that this could happen within the next 2-5 years, maybe even sooner, my approach would be to look at what todays youths are wanting, as it is now thier time and we as british citizens should respect the needs of them as it is now thier time to learn and expand into the world, it is now thier time to find out who they are, as a person, we should be helping these guys, so that they dont make the same mistakes as we have and maybe only then can we change this such thing called a ''cycle'' PEACE",
