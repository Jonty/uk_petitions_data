        "additional_details": "The Government should remove the TV Licence Fee for users that DO NOT have any way of viewing BBC/Terrestrial channels.\r\n\r\nUsers who only have SKY TV cannot view any BBC or Terrestrial TV if they have no TV Aerial for viewing, they can only view it using their SKY box which they already pay a subscription for.\r\n\r\nWhy does our Government allow users to pay twice, once to the BBC and again to SKY?   If you DO NOT have an aerial you CANNOT view any BBC channels. Therefore, the removal of TV Licence costs are a fair way for users that pay a SKY subscription.",
