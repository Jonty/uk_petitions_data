        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for the government to ban the tactic of containment (kettling) of demonstrations, where there is not the threat of violence between conflicting groups of protesters, as it damages the community\u2019s trust in the police and confidence in the right to protest.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th November 2010 demonstrators were kettled by the Metropolitan Police in Whitehall for up to 9 hours. These demonstrators were prevented from marching to Parliament and were in effect imprisoned and punished for attending a protest. In contrast on the 30th November protesters evaded the police no damage was caused and the protest remained peaceful until it was kettled.\r\n\r\nWhen police kettle demonstrations they damage the community\u2019s trust in the police and confidence in the right to protest. We call on the government to ban the tactic of containment (kettling) to restore confidence in the police.\r\n\r\nThis petition is on behalf of the Young Greens (www.younggreens.org.uk)",
