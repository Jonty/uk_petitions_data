        "additional_details": "Currently there\u2019s no protection against cowboy builders, who can rip people off with impunity.\r\n\r\nMany cowboys operate outside of the law. They may seem respectable and trustworthy, but often deliver shoddy, unfinished, or over priced work, resulting in huge bills for their innocent victims. Whilst it\u2019s possible, for some expense, to get a County Court Judgement against these rogues, this is all but impossible to enforce, especially if the rogue has taken the simple precaution of having no assets in their name. Further there are no effective trade bodies to register or check the reliability of builders. All in all it\u2019s a free for all for the cowboys.\r\n\r\nIn Australia they have mandatory building insurance. Effectively a premium on the cost of a building job of c4%, but the result is every single building job is insured against the cowboys. Such a simple system could save stress and financial hardship, whilst ensuring the whole building industry operates to a higher standard.\r\n",
