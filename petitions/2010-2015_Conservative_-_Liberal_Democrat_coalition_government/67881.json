        "additional_details": "Certain people within our government want to close down Cadet contingents around the UK. And quite frankly, I can't and won't stand for it.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to stop this at once or at least review ALL options.\r\n\r\n At my CCF (Combined Cadet Force) we aren't 'like' a family, we are a family, which as I'm sure, is the same with every other contingent. And what right does anyone have to take away someone's family? None. So I'm personally asking you to help me and 100's of thousands of others like me, to save my our families.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
