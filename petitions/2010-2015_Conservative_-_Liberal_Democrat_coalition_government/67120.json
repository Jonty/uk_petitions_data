It also only takes one person to make such a request.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Rolf Harris the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
