We pay our council tax and we should have the right to lit footpaths and to be able to go to and from work without the fear of what could easily be lurking in the pitch black alley ways and unlit public footpaths such as the little stoke path that follows all the way around little stoke. Some of us even work nightshifts and no longer have the security of street lights to find us safely to our front doors.\r\nWe want to feel safe! Give us back our street lighting at night!",
