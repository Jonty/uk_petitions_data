Many people are struggling to find employment (or go self employed) in UK due to accessibility issues with modern banking.  Many employers are currently not willing to offer any other payment method to employees and many people end up becoming unemployed almost immediately after they've found work because they cannot obtain a bank account.  It should be compulsory for employers to offer an alternative method of payment.",
