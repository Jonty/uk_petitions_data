        "additional_details": "Petition to cap the rate of interest charged on credit cards as although the lenders are in the business of making money with money in these times of financial hardship world wide We suggest that the lenders should be monitored with regards to the amount of interest charged on credit cards to customers to no more than 10 % above the rate that the lender has borrowed the money from the Bank of England thus still giving the lender a reasonable profit on the credit card loans but also enabling the borrowing customer to have a little more cash available to either clear some of the outstanding debt on the account or to spend in the high street thus helping the economy and retail sales to get back on track.. We are told we are in this together so let's get the lenders to do their bit to help us all out of this financial mess !",
