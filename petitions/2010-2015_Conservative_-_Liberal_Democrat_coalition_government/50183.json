        "additional_details": "Only 17% of women work in the technology sector, and as a woman of the 21st century, I see this as a let down for a country that was one of the first to be governed by a female Prime Minister.\r\n The government isn't pushing girls to learn to code and choose subjects like \"Computer Science\" or \"ICT\" at GCSE and GCE.\r\n This means the technology industry is monopolized by men, yet recent surveys have shown that women dominate social networking sites and buy more smartphones than men. Women shouldn't just consume technology but turn around and push it in to a new \"Era of Enlightenment\".\r\nI believe that if technology scholarships, aimed at girls, were introduced, the percentage would increase steadily.\r\nGranted, this may not be a possibility so if the Department of Education isn't happy to do this, they could hopefully channel more money into technology and resources given to schools.\r\nWe will change the future by being the flap of the butterfly's wings and then the hurricane of change.",
