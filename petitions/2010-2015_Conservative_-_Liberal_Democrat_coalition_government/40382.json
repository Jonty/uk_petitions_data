We are more familiar with the cruel culls undertaken in Canada but hundreds of seals are killed in the United Kingdom each year\r\nThings are about to get worse, on September 12th 2012, the EU voted to allow thousands more seals to be culled and their crime? eating fish.  We know that seals and sea birds are not responsible for the depletion of fish stocks, it is the result of overfishing in our waters after our fishing rights were given away to the rest of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
