        "additional_details": "Workers that perform the same tasks, have the same level of experience and work the same number of hours should be paid the same.\r\nSince the financial crisis, a number of employers (to their advantage) have unnecessarily introduced a second rate of pay for new starters which they remain on for the full duration of their employment.\r\nThis second rate is usually significantly less. In my case approximately \u00a36000 less annually. I have to work an estimated 22 hours p/w or the equivalent of an extra 150 days per year to receive the same salary as my colleagues. Surely this is borderline modern slavery? There's no practical basis for employers to do this other than to reduce operating costs at their employees expense.\r\nThis is detrimental to the economy and to pensions.\r\n\u00a36000 is quite substantial. This is money I could be paying income tax on, Money I could be putting into local goods and services. Money I could be saving for  retirement. Instead it's money going into my employers coffers",
