        "additional_details": "How is it fair for women who have already worked 40 years not being allowed to retire with a state pension at 60, many of these women are those who have worked as manual labourers in UK factories and have put their bodies through extreme work, many have also been full time mothers and now they face this injustice of working 45+years to be able to retire. This is an injustice and anyone not accepting of this has no respect for the women who have bought them into this world.\r\n\r\nPensions for women reaching 60 should be means tested, if these law abiding citizens have payed 40 years worth of tax and national insurance into this country they should be allowed to retire with dignity at 60...not 65 / 66.",
