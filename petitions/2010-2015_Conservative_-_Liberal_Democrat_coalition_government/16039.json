        "additional_details": "I have written this petition because I am so disgraced that our country signed a treaty with Libya to send terroist suspects to their country to be tortured. What makes it even more disgusting was that it was kept from public view by \"top secret\" red tape. This is not acceptable. MI6 and the government should release all non-high level top secret information for country wide viewing with immediate effect including any and all treaties with other countries that are not already available to us.\r\n\r\nI believe this treaty went against the values of democracy. To make such a treaty without the peoples consent which represents our country as a whole is wrong. Add your signature if you think so too.",
