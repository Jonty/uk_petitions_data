        "action": "Option blocks to be removed from High School education systems",
        "additional_details": "Students all over Britain are being forced at GCSE to not study the subjects they desire to study. The Government created \"option blocks\" for schools all over the UK, which quite clearly defeats the object of them being called \"options\".\r\nSchools want students to think for themselves and be independent and unique, yet are limited to what subjects in school they are allowed to study. These blocks are selfish and quite ridiculous because of this.\r\nStudents should have the right to take complete control over their GCSEs in order to get to the colleges, universities, apprenticeships, jobs and careers they want in the future, but cannot get these due to the restrictions on their subjects set by the Government itself.\r\nSign this petition so that these option blocks will be removed. It only affects students, their future and their families, not the schools or the Government.\r\nThank you. ",
