        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to stop the proposed development of a \"Super Dairy\"  for over 1000 cows in the small village of Leighton near Welshpool, Powys, Mid Wales. Concerns and objections are based on:\r\n- the close proximity (less than 100 yards) and thus threatened closure of the only primary school and community centre in the village;\r\n- the detrimental effect on the health of the dairy herd and the local residents\r\n- the visual impact/increased traffic and pollution of a dairy farm that is nine-times larger than the UK average;\r\nhttp://www.support-calfe.org.uk/our-campaign/",
