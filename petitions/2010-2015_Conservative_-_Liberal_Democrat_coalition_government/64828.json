If the DfT wanted to replace the  SeaKing's  with modern capabilities, the costs would be far less.\r\n\r\nWe should be supporting our own industry rather than fuelling another, Bristow may have newer technologies compared to the forces however, due to cuts in funding the forces cannot afford to at least upgrade their current ones. The RN/RAF do a brilliant job as it is, this may jeopardise the jobs of those who've been doing this service from the 1940's.  ",
