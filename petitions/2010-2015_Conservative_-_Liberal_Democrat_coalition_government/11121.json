PLEASE SIGN THIS IT IS URGENT THAT CUT TO CHILDREN FAMILY AND YOUTH SERVICES STOP OR ARE REINSTATED, ALSO GOVERNMENT NEED TO GIVE POWERS BACK TO PARENTS AND SCHOOLS, for instance Sure Start which is at the core of the community, on some of the toughest areas, it has had cut backs this is the start of childrens lives, this is not good. I have seen many young people with potential being wasted, for example a gymnastics offering low cost training for all ages from young children to young adults place in my area closed down by local council, THEY NEED TO STOP FORCING PARENTS OUT TO WORK AND LET THEM FOCUS ON THERE CHILDREN.
