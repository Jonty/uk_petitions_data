        "additional_details": "Chief executives of local councils are paid more than the job is worth. Chief Executive pay (including bonuses and pension enhancements) ought to be capped at \u00a380,000 per annum. Front line services need to be protected. Capping the pay of local government executives or even reducing executive posts would not have any negative effect on services and the money saved could be better spent.",
