        "additional_details": "i propose that all foreign aid as it stands is abolished, and replaced with a much lower figure which is used to fund the specialist charities actually working in, and delivering in, the deprived areas that need the aid.Too much money is being given to corrupt governments and despots with no check on its use.If the money were given to charities that specialize in building wells/irrigation, schools/teaching, health projects such as cataract eye operations/malaria nets/cleft palate operations,( for example ) we would be assured that aid was being given and no money diverted to politicians, their families,their armed forces etc.Halve the figure for aid now, and give it to those that will use it properly for the benefit of those that need it.",
