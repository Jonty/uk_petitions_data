        "additional_details": "The Airport development fee was introduced in 2007 to raise \u00a318million pounds towards the development of the airport.\r\n\r\nThis fee was introduced at a rate of \u00a33, raised to \u00a35 and has now on 3rd January 2011 doubled to \u00a310 per person.\r\n\r\nThese charges are in addition to any air taxes that are payable.\r\n\r\nThe fee when introduced accounted for 8% of the airport's revenue (approximately \u00a3700,000) and with the doubling of the charge will equate to approximately \u00a31.4 Million per annum.\r\n\r\nIt is the view of the signatories that this fee is completely unfair.\r\n\r\nWe feel that business development costs should be funded by the shareholders of the airport not by means of an additional levy at point of departure on passengers and that the development fee must be withdrawn immediately.\r\n",
