        "additional_details": "Using animals to test cosmetics, medicines and for gaining understanding about the human body is inaccurate and unnecessary. Many of the animals have been taken from the wild, torn from their families, some are born into the hellish life of the laboratory. The animals used in scientific experiments are sentenced to pain and miserably, and are exempt from the Animal Welfare Act 06 to allow this bizarre abuse.\r\n\r\n Using innocent animals to increase our knowledge is crazy and cruel.\r\n\r\nIf the testing must be done I propose the alternative be using criminals (pleading guilty) serving life. With a real punishment at stake there are likely to be fewer crimes committed, saving the government money which could be spent to pay members of the public who volunteer their services as 'guinea pigs'.
