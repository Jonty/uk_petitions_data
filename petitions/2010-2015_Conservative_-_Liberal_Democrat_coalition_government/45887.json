        "additional_details": "The Government plans to reduce staff-to-child ratios in early years settings and for childminders in England.\r\n\r\nNursery and pre-school staff could be expected to look after six two-year-old children (up from the current limit of four) and four babies aged one or under (up from three). Childminders could be expected to care for four children under five (up from three) and two babies under one (up from one).\r\n\r\nThis will impact:\r\n\r\nCHILD SAFETY: With more children to look after, staff will undoubtedly have less time to keep an eye on your child, posing a real risk to their physical wellbeing.\r\n\r\nCHILD SUPPORT: Staff will have less time to engage with your child on a one-to-one basis. This is of particular concern for children with additional needs, who may require extra care and attention.\r\n\r\nAlthough the changes are voluntary, market pressures will force many childcarers to move to the new ratios, creating a two-tier childcare sector, which will lower overall quality.\r\n",
