        "additional_details": " Bring in Legislation that regulates and restircts B2L ownership, Private or Commercial to a maximum of 2 properties.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to discourage B2L ownership proliferation through regulation, taxation and controls and ensure a level playing field for home ownership, 1st time buyers and halt the decimation of supply to the younger generations.\r\n\r\n40-50% of B2L properties are 1st time buyer homes!\r\n\r\nRents are Rising, due to lack of homes and supply, impacted due to policy and financial advantages to take housing supply out of the market. Forcing Rents up for profit and House prices to unaffordable levels, a more indebted dpopulation.\r\n\r\nPrivate B2L owners can have 1000 homes++, there are no limits. Commercial landlords have the financial resources to own more. Taxation is not used to discourage B2L but increase it. With all the related housing supply issues created.\r\n\r\nGovt must act to change the massive inbalance between Private/Commercial B2L and the general population.",
