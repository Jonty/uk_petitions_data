        "additional_details": "Expand the London train travel zones to cover a greater area of outer London and surrounding areas. This will enable and encourage people to buy affordable homes out of London and be able to afford to commute into work rather than being penalised for living and working in London and being forced to pay high rent or not being able to buy a sufficient sized family home in the Capital. This way it will still be affordable for people to commute in and will encourage growth in the housing market.",
