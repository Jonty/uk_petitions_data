        "additional_details": "According to the Dogs Trust as many as 33% of the 111,986 dogs picked up by Local Authorities across the UK in 2013 required rehoming either by local authorities or welfare organisations.  That's 92 dogs every day.\r\nWhilst data shows these figures to be better than in some previous years this petition calls for the Government to take further action to tackle the problem.\r\nIn signing this petition\r\nYou agree that too many dogs are being abandoned; that it is unacceptable and preventable.\r\nYou agree that too many people take on dogs without realising the real costs of providing them with a happy, healthy life\r\nYou agree that more could be done to make prospective owners of dogs aware of the real costs of ownership.\r\nYou agree that legislation is not far reaching enough and it has become too easy to take on and discard dogs.\r\nYou call on Government to debate how legislation and education can reduce the negligent sale and ownership of dogs so that less will be abandoned in the future.",
