        "additional_details": "The government should revise the way in which it gives out benefits to those that are on job-seekers allowance. Benefits are one of the best things about this country, however many people misuse the money that has been given to them.\r\n\r\nSo that this change does not punish those that use the money for genuine purposes, a new system should be introduced so that the money goes to paying for utility bills (direct from the government to the supplier), issuing food vouchers and giving out transport tickets for job interviews. Obviously a more refined system will be devised, but this is a small example of the sort of systems that should be in place.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Students getting money from the government to pay their fees for University, get their money as a loan of which they have to pay back when they are earning. This should apply to the benefits system. If people get benefits, they should have to pay them back when they are earning, just like a student has to.",
