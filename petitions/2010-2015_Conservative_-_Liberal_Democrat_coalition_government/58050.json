This finishes in January 2014.\r\n\r\nThere is a requirement for 100,000 signatures for generating a debate in the House of Commons so this is your opportunity of agreeing with our party leaders and giving them the boost that they need to have the matter properly debated and agreed in the Commons and not agreed by unelected ladies and gents from the higher echelons of our society who actually know what a duck house is!",
