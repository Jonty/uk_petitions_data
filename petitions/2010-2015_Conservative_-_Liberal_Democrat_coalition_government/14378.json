        "additional_details": "People argue that Cannabis is a \"gateway\" drug, because people buying it off dealers are sometimes tempted in to buying other illegal substances. What if Cannabis was sold in coffee shops? What if people had the right to grow it in their homes? Would this problem even exist? Cannabis can not only be used recreationally but it can be used to treat a number of medical conditions or even as a cheap alternative to fuel. As a recreational drug, it's effects leave users relaxed and mellow. Why is it considered a Class B drug? You cannot overdose and die from it, neither does it harm the body as much as Alcohol abuse, which is legal. I would like the government to discuss the decriminalisation of Cannabis and the industry that could be created around it to boost the country's economy, also the amount of spending that would be saved policing it.
