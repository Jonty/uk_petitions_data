At six months, other foods should complement breastfeeding for up to two years or more'\r\nNHS;\r\n'Exclusive breastfeeding (with no other food or drink) is recommended for around the first six months of a baby's life. After this, breastfeed alongside other foods for as long as you and your baby wish. This might be into their second year or beyond.'\r\n",
