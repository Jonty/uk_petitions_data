        "additional_details": "I needed to call an ambulance so dialled 999. The ambulance took over 3 hours to arrive and when it finally did, it was from a different area. The driver couldn't use his emergency siren as he didn't know the area and had to ask my uncle if he could follow him in his car to the hospital because his sat-nav wasn't working and he didn't know the way. When asked why it'd taken so long, the driver mentioned a paitent who'd called 999 for an ambulance for an ingrowing toe nail that'd started bleeding and another who'd dialled 999 for a lift to an appointment at the hospital because he couldn't afford a taxi and didn't have a car. These non-emergency cases are causing major delays and quite literally costing lives. We want to see harsh financial penalties levied against those misusing the 999 emergency services number for ambulances that are quite clearly not emergencies.",
