That is because the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary have changed the definition of \"literally\" - so it can now be used in a similar way to \"metaphorically.\"\r\n\r\nSenior OED editor Fiona MacPherson told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast: \"If enough people use a word in a particular way... it will find its way into the dictionary.\"\r\n\r\n",
