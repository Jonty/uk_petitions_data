        "additional_details": "As a gift i sent \u00a3100 (five 20 pound Bank of Scotland notes) to family in Germany. My relative then took this to her bank in Germany in order to exchange it for Euros. You can imagime her surprise and disbelief when she was told by her bank (the second largest in germany) that since October 2014 (just after the referendum.....hmmmm) ALL EUROPEAN BANKS HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE BANK OF ENGLAND NOT TO ACCEPT SCOTTISH BANK NOTES AND ONLY TO ACCEPT THEIR OWN!!\r\nIs this even legal?? How dare they do this to my country and not even have the common decency to put it in the public domain to be judged by the general public.\r\nIf you, as i do, believe this matter needs to be addressed, explained and REPEALED pls,pls sign this. I dont want my daughter growing up in a country where the composite parts of a supposed fair union routinely marginalise and misrepresent one part of that union.\r\n",
