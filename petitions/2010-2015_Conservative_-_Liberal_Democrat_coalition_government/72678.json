        "additional_details": "Revise the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amendments to the 2003 Communications Act\r\n\r\nThis has just gone in to effect banning English company's (and people) for selling/distributing and watching certain types of porn:\r\n\r\nSpanking\r\nCaning\r\nAggressive whipping\r\nPenetration by any object \"associated with violence\"\r\nPhysical or verbal abuse (regardless of  if consensual)\r\nUrolagnia (known as \"water sports\")\r\nFemale ejaculation\r\nStrangulation\r\nFacesitting\r\nFisting\r\n\r\nNot only is this sexist eg: Facesitting banned but Facefucking is still OK, it is incredibly short sighted and ignorant with other BDSM activity's such as Blood play and Emetophilia AKA: vomit fetish Still allowed which makes no sense.\r\n\r\nIn short: not only are these changes Sexist and ignorant but also very worrying. Once censorship starts where does it stop?\r\nThis wrong must be put right.\r\n\r\nAnd so I petition the Government to take a look at this Act and undo the amendments made.",
