        "additional_details": "The British government has recently been thinking about incorporating elements of Sharia Law into the British legal system, in particular with regards to inheritance.\r\n\r\nTo give you an example of what this may entail, Sharia inheritance will mean that those who wish to do so will be allowed to prohibit any woman from their inheritance, and this is just one example.\r\n\r\nThis is Britain not the Middle East and it is unacceptable for a British government to even consider such a measure. This law is in direct violation of the human rights of women and is also in violation of the Magna Carta, the British common law.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask the British government to immediately drop this backward, uncivilised proposal and to end any talk of such a bill or reform!",
