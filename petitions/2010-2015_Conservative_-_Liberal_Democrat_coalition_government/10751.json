Otherwise they are aware that nothing will be done as they are underage.  Currently they are likely to be given days out to theme parks; tennis lessons etc all paid for by the tax payer.  They have to be made to do some work to instill a work ethic; be part of the community; feel some self worth and occupy some of their time as these children are generally bored and see crime as the only way forward.  There has to be proper consequences of their actions but also positive action.",
