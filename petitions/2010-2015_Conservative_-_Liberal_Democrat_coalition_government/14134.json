        "additional_details": "School children should be encouraged, via their school, to become more integrated into their society. By helping out at local retirement homes, visiting local rehab clinics and learning about local issues, etc, our future generations will understand the importance of their community in their lives.\r\n\r\nThese activities already exist in some schools, e.g via Citizenship lessons (which are compulsory), but these only teach on a general (national) basis. By localising and personalising these issues and making it compulsory in all schools, we hope that our youth will connect with their communities better and prevent events such as the 2011 riots.",
