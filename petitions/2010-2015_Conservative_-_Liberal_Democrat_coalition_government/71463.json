        "additional_details": "We the people of shirebrook would like to get the support from National Government to get a long overdue swimming facility for Shirebrook, this request is following numerous attempts from Shirebrooks communities to get a pool since the 1960's. Various people have offered to assist in the cost of this facility with one local business man even offering to give land for this purpose.Many local communities have been given this type of facility but due to the travelling distances it negates both Single Parents and Families on low incomes using the same, Shirebrook is centrally located and has many forms of access from other local villages and towns it also has adequate areas of land for redevelopment for this purpose.",
