        "additional_details": "As a 17 year old female, i have been suffering a mental illness for the past 14 months, which has gotten worse and due to not getting enough help i have now got depression.\r\nI think it is disgraceful that there is such little help, especially for young adults my age. I feel that the NHS needs to invest more money into helping people with all types of mental illness.. Also i feel that more awareness and support needs to be made about mental health.",
