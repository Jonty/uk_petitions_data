        "additional_details": "A spin off of infamous 'Dingle Show', The Andy Loft Show had previously been aired on ITV Midlands from 1982 until 1997, when the rights were sold to Channel 4.\r\n\r\nThe show had an infamous cult following amongst those in society with an IQ of less than 70. However, due to a rise in cases of abuse of Dingles in the West Midlands area the show was eventually pulled, being replaced with the less popular Adventures of Rubber Dingy Rapids staring Victoria B'oh.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to get the program reinstated with the assistance of government funding. The nation NEEDs to know what form of transport Andy Loft has been takin, what girls he has been stalking and above all... we need to know just how much he misses Terry Connor.",
