        "additional_details": "We mums, dads and future parents call on the Government to take forward it's excellent proposals to let parents share paid baby leave after the mother's initial 18 weeks of maternity leave.\r\n\r\nThese reforms are vital to give couples the freedom to choose how to organise their families, will support fathers to build stronger relationships with their children and are crucial for promoting greater gender equality in the home and workplace. We do not believe that introducing the possibility of sharing leave from this point, with employment rights which mirror current maternity leave entitlements, poses any threat to equality or women's health.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that these changes are put in place before 2015 as indicated in the Queens's speech and are not kicked into the long grass.",
