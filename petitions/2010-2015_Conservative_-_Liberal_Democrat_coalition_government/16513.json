        "additional_details": "My ex-wife and I have a shared residency order. Our children spend a week with me, then a week with her and so on. We both work full-time and all costs are shared equally.\r\n\r\nHowever, because she claims the Child Benefit, she is allowed to (and does) claim against me for child support. She also claims the Tax Credit allowance for our children.\r\n\r\nTo put it simply, she has her own and her new partners full-time wages coming in and the other benefits, but she is also allowed to claim a portion of my wage.\r\n\r\nThis is completely unfair and needs urgent reform, please sign my petition.",
