The introduction of African and Afro-Caribbean history in the national school curriculum for Primary school would go a long way to combat racism in the future.\r\n\r\nWe believe that teaching the younger generation African and Afro-Caribbean history would not only lead to better understanding and acceptance of diversity in our society, but could also potentially have a domino effect on ethnic minorities, giving them the confidence that they need to be successful in their education (having the belief and feeling that they are equal and have the same opportunities as everyone else in society)\r\n\r\nWe want a national primary school curriculum that incorporates African and Afro-Caribbean history which would be examined.
