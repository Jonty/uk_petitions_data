        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to promote awareness of pelvic organ prolapse by highlighting risk factors in order to minimise risk and possible prevention. To promote pelvic floor strengthening exercise. To also promote pelvic floor safe exercise. This can be done through education of women, health professionals, fitness instructors, personal trainers, PE teachers.  Posters and leaflets in leisure centres, gyms, health centres, hospitals (i.e. maternity, gynaecology, physiotherapy departments). This affects approximately 50% of women across a wide age range to a greater or lesser degree (men may also be at risk).  Pelvic organ prolapse has a huge impact on physical functions (bladder & bowel), physical functioning (i.e. employment restrictions, exercise restrictions, domestic restrictions) and mental health (distress, anxiety, depression).",
