        "additional_details": "There is a pressing need for offenders to be sentenced in a manner that will make them think twice about committing the same offence again. In short, the offender must work with prison services to prevent recidivism. For most, the denial of their liberty and social inclusion, the removal of rights of citizenship and franchise would be enough, at least, to suggest or promote an impetus for change. Not so, the Daily Mail reader (or, indeed, the reader of The Sun, Express etc.); their shared belief in the removal of priveleges, opportunity for education/ recreation should be reflected in the sentencing of said individuals. It is the only way that they will learn.",
