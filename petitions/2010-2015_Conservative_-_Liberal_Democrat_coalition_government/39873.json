        "additional_details": "The taxpayer has, in the past, been royally screwed by senior civil servants and ex cabinet ministers who maximise their personal gains by using contacts gained during their time in government when the current ONE year embargo on them expires.  It is apparent that too much insider knowledge is being used to the extreme detriment of the national security of the country and the future financial robustness of our economy by people who have recently been in political positions who are now using contacts gained in those positions to their own HUGE personal advantage, regardless of the cost to the taxpayer.  The length of time barring these people from using information and contacts gained in public or political office MUST be extended to TEN YEARS from the day of leaving office. ",
