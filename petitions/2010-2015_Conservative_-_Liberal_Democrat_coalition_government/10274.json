        "additional_details": "The government is handing over approximately \u00a383 million of our money to the RPF govt of Rwanda, regardless of the fact that human rights organisations, researchers and activists have claimed with proof that this money is being used to purchase weapons and means that are used to suppress the population and kill off any chance of a pluralistic political system where the regime is held to account.\r\nThere is also growing proof the President and the people around him have enriched themselves from the theft of State resources. There is further proof of political assassinations and attempted assassinations in and out of Rwanda, including one that was suspected and halted here in the UK. Not in our name should this continue. Not with our money! We call upon our govt to adopt an ethical policy and stop sending money. We need not use the excuse that we are working with the lesser of the evils, because we are continually being indirectly responsible for crimes against innocent people of Rwanda.",
