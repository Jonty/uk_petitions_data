        "additional_details": "The books, \u2018Ten little N*ggers\u2019 and \u2018Ten little n*gger boys\u2019 are insults.\r\n\r\nThese books should not be sold especially on Amazon and other websites in the UK. They are blatantly racist books which should have no place in a multi-cultural society.\r\n\r\nHere are a few lines from one of these books:\r\n\r\nTen little n*gger boys went out to dine;\r\nOne choked his little self and then there were Nine\u2026\r\n\r\nTwo little n*gger boys sitting in the sun;\r\nOne got frizzled up and then there was One.\r\nOne little n*gger boy left all alone;\r\nHe went out and hanged himself and then there were None\r\n\r\nWe ask the Home Office to ban the distribution of these books in the UK. This petition aims to highlight the impact of these books and discourage support of ignorant, racist views. Hopefully the result will be an eventual banning on the sale of these books.\r\n\r\nThese books are extremely offensive.\r\n",
