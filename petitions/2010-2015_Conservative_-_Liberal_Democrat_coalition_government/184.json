Sky TV are to take over full coverage on there Sky Sports channels, meaning there will be a  necessity to subscibe to receive coverage.\r\nThis decision should be immediately reversed.\r\nThe recent BBC coverage has received extremely favourable reviews and viewing figures, catering for a large base of Formula enthusiasts in the UK, showcasing a largely UK based industry.\r\nAny required savings within the BBC to support this should be made by the non continuation of less popular programming, typically shown on the BBC3 and BBC4 channels",
