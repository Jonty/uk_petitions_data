        "additional_details": "The introduction of colonial history in school curriculum at primary level could be an aid to combat racism in the future by educating children of the different colonies that once made up the British Empire before gaining their independence.\r\n\r\nThere has been a small number of incidents in recent years which has gone 'viral' on social networking sites, of verbal abuse on public transport aimed at ethnic minorities. It is our belief that such incidents would be fewer in number if people understood colonial history.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this would not eliminate racism completely, nor in the near future, however it would educate the younger generation who will grow to accept the diversity of Britain, and most importantly understand some of the reasons why Britain is so culturally diverse.",
