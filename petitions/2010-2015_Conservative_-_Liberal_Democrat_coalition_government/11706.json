        "additional_details": "The UK foreign aid bill is absolutely enormous. We generously give millions in aid to independant countries such as Pakistan and India and even China. India even has it's OWN foreign aid, nuclear and space programmes! What I propose is to ask the government to perhaps draw up a balance sheet. On one side, the yearly amount of aid we set aside to foreign countries, the other side, a list of all the things the British people need but can't get because of the shortage of funds. For example, if a children's hospital in Derby needs three new scanners, take and use the money from the 'foreign aid list'   When all hospitals, schools, cancer patients, road improvements, new prisons etc. are all paid for using cash from the 'aid list', perhaps we can then help foreigners and they can have what's left, not until.Britain must come first, always.",
