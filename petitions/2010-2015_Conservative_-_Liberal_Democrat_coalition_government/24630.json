        "additional_details": "When these estates were built they were for the over 65's, some for the over 70's, the majority are now for the over 55's.  We have pull cords after all.  We pay a basic rent of \u00a379.93 per week.  But on top of this are the following:   A contribution towards court manager's costs of \u00a324301 which includes salary, rent, heating, electricity and water plus NI contribution, plus a contribution towards \u00a34,501 repairs to the court,    The weekly rent of \u00a379.33 increased to an amount payable of \u00a3119.22 for the tax year 2011/12  - dispensing with the live in manager would save council tax payers of the UK thousands of pounds per year.\r\n",
