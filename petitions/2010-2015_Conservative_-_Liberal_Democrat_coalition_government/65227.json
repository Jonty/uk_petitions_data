        "additional_details": "The amendments to the Dangerous Dogs Act brought in, in May 2014 are very subjective. To say that someone 'only has to feel threatened' is very subjective on the part of the individual person. For instance if a dog barked at me I wouldn't be worried but a person frightened of dogs may be. As dog owners we do not want anyone to feel threatened or frightened of our dogs but dogs bark and jump up, especially in their own homes. I want the Government to clarify 'feeling threatened' and also to acknowledge that this new legislation is open to misuse by dog haters, malicious people and compensation claimers.",
