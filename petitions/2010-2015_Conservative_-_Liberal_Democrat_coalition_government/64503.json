        "additional_details": "The Defence Secretary is calling for an end to alcohol subsidies on military installations to curb excessive drinking. Government departments, including the Houses of Parliament heavily subsidise alcohol and food at taxpayers\u2019 expense. In an effort to lead by example, curb detrimental effects of Ministers health and in part due to recent publicised bad behaviour by ministers whilst drunk, all food and alcohol subsidies in Ministerial facilities should be cut. Those ministers partaking in consuming alcohol should pay full price for their food and drink.",
