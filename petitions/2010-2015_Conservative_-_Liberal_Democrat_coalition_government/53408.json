However, it also means that department budgets can take into account the projected income from fines, meaning that there is an incentive for fining people, so that people committing offences is in some way a positive thing for those departments.\r\n\r\nIf when issued a fine, the offender could select which government department receives the money, then this could democratise how the money is spent.\r\n\r\nAn addition to this could also be the option of specifying a registered charity number, however this would perhaps be better as a separate e-petition.",
