        "additional_details": "I'm a 15 year old boy from Yorkshire. I, like many of my schoolmates, have used the term 'gay' to describe when something's bad, disgusting, boring etc.\r\nOne only needs to look on a social networking site, such as Facebook, to realise that this isn't an uncommon synonym.\r\nI propose that my generation, and the ones which follow, should be educated better about sexual orientation, about love between two people and most, of all, that they should be who they want to be.\r\nOne of the main problems is that most people are labelled as either 'gay' or 'straight'. I realise that this is most likely to have been influenced by the media. They imply that everyone fits into one of these categories.\r\nNot everything is black and white, however, there are so many shades in between and I think it's about time people began to realise this.",
