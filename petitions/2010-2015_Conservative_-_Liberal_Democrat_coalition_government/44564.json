Sparkling wine should be separate and shouldn\u2019t be a or to spirits.\r\n\r\nThe other goods should be increased to \u00a31,000. If you have gone on a holiday outside the EU you have saved hard for that trip and would want to bring back a few gifts for friends and family along with something nice for yourself. \u00a3390 these days does not get you far especially as the exchange rate at the moment is so poor.\r\n\r\nIf you are travelling alone these limits can be very restricted.
