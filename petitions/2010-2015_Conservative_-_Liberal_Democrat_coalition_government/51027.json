        "additional_details": "UK taxpayers are no longer eligible to access the fund so it is now no more than a tax which goes to fund convicted criminals and foreigners within and without the UK (including other EU nationals) - who do not contribute to it - to sue the UK government who then take MORE money from the taxpayer to pay the compensation ordered to be handed over.  That is a HUGE double whammy which has to be a gross violation of UK taxpayers' human right to equal treatment and the fund MUST therefore be closed down",
