This is at odds with The Armed Forces Covenant. It also fails to recognise the support that spouses give to members of the armed forces and the  disadvantages suffered  of things such as loss of own career and accruement of a pension in their own right.\r\nWe require that the Government introduce a common rule for all service widows (male and female) entitling them to a pension and honouring the true spirit of The Service Covenant.\r\n",
