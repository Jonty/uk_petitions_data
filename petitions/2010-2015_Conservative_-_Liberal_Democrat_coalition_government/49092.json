        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon Her Majesty's Government to reject the EU Directive which seeks to implement a cap on bankers bonuses of 100% of annual salary and 200% if agreed by shareholders.\r\n\r\nThis would be an unacceptable intrusion by the state into the affairs of the banks and would have serious repercussions upon the City of London which the Eurozone is seeking to attack.\r\n\r\nThe government should reject the directive outright and refuse to implement it.
