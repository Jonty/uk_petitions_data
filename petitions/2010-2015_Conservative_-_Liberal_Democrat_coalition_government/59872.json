        "additional_details": "We need the publics help to oppose Cleveland  fire brigade's proposals.\r\nThese include:\r\n- 130 firefighter jobs to go\r\n- 2nd full time fire engines to be staffed by part time (retained) adding 5 to 10 minutes onto the turn out time to attend an incident. Leaving 1 fire engine to cover a whole town - approx 5 firefighters at any one time to take care of 90,000 - 100,000 people's safety.\r\n- 1 fire station closure\r\n- you as a tax payer will still pay the SAME. Amount of tax even though your fire cover will have been reduced by half.\r\n\r\nwe need As many people as possible to sign this petition to prevent these cuts from happening. It is not just for firefighters benefit it is for you, your family and friends safety so we can provide the best service possible.\r\n",
