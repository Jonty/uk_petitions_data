        "additional_details": "I believe its time for change in the family proceedings courts of England& wales.Time for both parents to have the same legal right with out fear of one or the other breaking court orders,recieving mental and physical abuse,serious harassment.Its about time children stopped being used as weapons against each other.children need both parents in there lives.The country is in fear of damaging our childrens futures due to years of court battles.Its time for change.court proceedings could start taking less time if both parents started getting the same rights and courts started clamping down on breach of court orders and abuse claims.\r\n\r\nIf agreed sign the petition and lets get this matter brought forward.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
