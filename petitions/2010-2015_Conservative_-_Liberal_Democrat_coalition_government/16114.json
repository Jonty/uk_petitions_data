        "additional_details": "During the 1960s the British government deported the entire native population of the Chagos Islands (British Indian Ocean Territory) to make way for an American naval base. Since then the Chagossians have not been allowed to return to resettle their homeland despite winning a High Court case against the British government in 2006. Please sign this petition so this cause can be heard in Parliament, and hopefully pave the way for the Chagossians to return home. ",
