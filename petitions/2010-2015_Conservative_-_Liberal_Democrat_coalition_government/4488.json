        "additional_details": "when an addict is caught committing a crime it is my view that they should be imprisoned for a minimum of 3months in prisons with closed visiting facilities and anti drug staff,with no access to methadone as this just keeps them ticking over until they are released .  and the whole situation starts again. methodology,going cold turkey will be extremely hard but by the end of the three months they should be clean enough to rejoin society and i am sure a majority of addicts would be thankful to get there lives back into some sort of order.if after release they re-offend again in persuit of addictive drugs,then back to prison,but upon release be given a mandatory implant to stop the effects of drug abuse.experimental prison should be set up and that this would be far cheaper and more effective than the present round and round in circles policy we see at this time.",
