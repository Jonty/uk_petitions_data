He's won the event recently, he's a great rider, and Sky signed him to ride for them.\r\nIt's up to Sky to sort out any personality issues between Froome and Wiggins.  It would be contrary to natural justice to leave Wiggins out of team (and more so given his age and therefore limited Tours left for him).\r\nWe want to see Brad ride in Yorkshire. It will be a great sporting contest, can Brad outride Froome, what will the dynamics be like, it will greatly enhance the event! ",
