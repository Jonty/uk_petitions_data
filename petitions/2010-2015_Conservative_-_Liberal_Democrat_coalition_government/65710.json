        "additional_details": "Its obvious that the UK cannot make US laws, but what they can do is, using the relationship between the two countries, apply pressure to the US to make steps to ban guns.\r\n\r\nAmericans think it is their right to possess a gun, based on an age old second ammendment, despite mass shootings occurring at least once every couple of months in the country.\r\n\r\nPresident Obama has already said he will act, yet he has done nothing. Pressure is required to ensure the US government overcomes gun lobbyists. Should it not be possible to ban them completely, more stringent checks must be put in place (it is currently possible to buy a gun from a shop, not much different from a supermarket, where they are banned from selling kinder eggs due to the risk of choking from small parts, yet have guns to buy hanging from the walls).\r\n\r\nA country without guns is a safer country. Lets petition to put pressure on the US to ban them.",
