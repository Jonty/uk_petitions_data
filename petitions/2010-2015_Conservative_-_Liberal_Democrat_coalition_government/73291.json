        "additional_details": "The current measures to 'protect' gamblers involve a player \"self excluding\" from an operator's services. This is an ineffective measure. The player resorts to this measure by recognising that he or she doesn't have the self control to not gamble. That this player can then within seconds register for another one of thousands of gambling websites isn't acceptable. Create a shared database, that all operators must subscribe to, where a player can exclude themselves from all websites. This could be done relatively cheaply given the money operators supposedly already spend \"tackling\" problem gambling. After all, it's just a database. The reason it already hasn't been done? Problem gamblers are where the industry makes it's big profits. Why isn't the government intervening? Tax? Make this happen. Protect problem players, and stop the industry taking advantage of them whilst putting on a caring front. This is a real solution, one the industry won't care for.",
