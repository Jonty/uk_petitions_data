        "additional_details": "No other person, in the entire history of humankind, has been proven to be more accurate when forecasting the future, as he did in 1968, for which he has been vilified.  Recently two VERY senior current politicians have repeated his statements by confirming, publicly, that immigration has been bad for Britain - which is exactly what Mr Powell was saying it was going to be in 1968.  It is time for David Cameron to stop being an anti-white racist and acknowledge they (his class) were badly wrong and make a grovelling apology on their behalf to his memory.  The people of this country knew Mr Powell was right, all along, so they have no apology to make.",
