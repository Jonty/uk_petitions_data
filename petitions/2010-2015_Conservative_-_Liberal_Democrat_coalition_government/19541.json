        "additional_details": "According to reports in the press, Liam Fox is to be paid \u00a317,000 in severance pay. He has been forced to resign in disgrace for seriously breaching the ministerial code in particular by arranging payments to his friend from defence contractors.  On the 15th October, Rifleman Vijay Rai of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles. was killed in an attack on the checkpoint he was guarding in Afghanistan. It is profoundly offensive that Fox gets \u00a317,000 when such fine men give so much.",
