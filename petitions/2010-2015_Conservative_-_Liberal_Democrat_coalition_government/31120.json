Governments could change laws regarding use of land by building in \"protected zone\" covenants applicable to all agricultural and industrial use. Such environmental laws could be imposed on existing land users by way of initial grant funding to initiate and encourage replanting. For example, a 20 yard swathe of woodland around agricultural perimeters would make a difference on a global scale.\r\nNew conveyances could include the new environmental laws as mandatory legislation\r\n\r\n",
