        "action": "Abolish VAT on Sanitary Products",
        "additional_details": "We are petitioning to abolish tax on female sanitary products, as items such as men's razors are tax free but women's sanitary products are not considered luxury products. This law was frozen in 1973, when the UK Parliament was very male dominated, so we are petitioning to further equal rights between men and women. Although the tax has been reduced to 5%, even with this reduction sanitary towels will cost a woman over \u00a31400 in her lifetime.\r\nWe hope for there to be more awareness around this issue and we want the government to bring the issue up in the European Community, as they have the power to change this law.",
