        "additional_details": "Since the beginning of June 2012, over 28,000 Rohingya Muslims have been killed in the Arkan province of Burma. Yet no media coverage of these atrocities have been shown to the mass public. We were quick to condemn Syria, and Gaddafi, but why are we silent when it comes to the Rohingya muslims. We are requesting the UK Government to make a public statement condemning these clear acts of terror and genocide and impose various sanctions against the Burmese government to try and halt this horrific campaign of violence. Finally we would like you to bring this story in the mainstream media so the UK public is aware of the situation.",
