        "additional_details": "The Serious Organised Crime Agency has classified the names of an undisclosed number blue chip companies, law firms and individuals, who are believed to have commissioned PIs to perform illegal activities.  These activities included the hacking of people's phones and computers with a means to gain commercially from the information on their competitors.  SOCA claims that the publishing of these names could \"substantially undermine the financial viability of major organisations\" but for that reason alone the accused, many of which SOCA's certain are guilty, will not answer fully for their actions.  Sign to reverse SOCA's efforts to politicise the legal system in this country.\r\n",
