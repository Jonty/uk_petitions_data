        "additional_details": "The Corsellis  Brain Collection is a large brain bank in England and\r\none of the largest in the world, comprising\r\nmore than 6,000 specimens.\r\nStarted in the early 1950s by Professor John Corsellis at Runwell\r\nHospital, the collection is now managed and maintained by an English hospital.\r\n The collection contains a number of brains from patients who\r\nhad psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases but also a series of\r\nbrains from patients who were not affected by mental illness and who's brains\r\nprovide a control population.\r\nIn light of the Alderhey case which involved the organs of children being kept in hospitals and the distress it caused their families, it may be right to return these brains to their families for a decent burial.",
