        "additional_details": "Every household pays a Council Tax\r\nThis Tax is used to pay for local services i.e. Bin Men, Schools, Police and Fire Brigade but to name a few.\r\nRecently there have been strikes by some of these services.\r\nThey do not receive pay when they strike and yet what happens to this money. We do not receive a refund in our Council Rates.\r\nIts time that people should get what they pay for, not just pay for something that is demanded of us. Refunds should be issued if Service men and women do not work. ",
