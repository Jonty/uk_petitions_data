I believe that there should be an option on every Ballot paper at General and Local elections.\r\nNone of the Above , A box below the parties but a counted vote announced with every other result in every constituency . It Would be a simple change to our voting system that would mean those of us who feel unrepresented in any way finally have a voice.\r\nIf Democracy is to be truly representative then giving people the chance to say this is essential.\r\nPolitical parties would then have constant awareness that in fact there is a majority out there who didn't vote for them and therefore they need to think more deeply and with a wider and more long term view to policy and its repercussions to us all..",
