Have you ever been in a position where you feel your not treated fairly? Well what if you could leave feedback on your policing experience, wouldn't you feel much happier if you knew an incompetent officer would face the consequences? What I propose is a system whereby you can leave feedback either via the internet or post on a specific officer anonymously and if an officer falls below a standard of excellence then they face the consequences of being fired or trained to be of an higher standard.
