This lower house proposes changes to how the citizens of the United Kingdom are governed and controlled. This will be by fundamentally altering the upper house into an elected chamber.\r\nThe undersigned propose that a referendum is carried by the government, in order for the citizens to express their views on this most important of matters. If the citizens do not want the way the laws are made to change, they should have the opportunity to say so.",
