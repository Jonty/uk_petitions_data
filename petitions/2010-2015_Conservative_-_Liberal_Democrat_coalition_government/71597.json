We believe not only is this unfair but also unproductive for the British public.\r\n\r\nWe are requesting an additional two bank holidays throughout the year, the first should be the Queen's birthday which most other commonwealth countries have as a bank holiday anyway.  The second should either be around the 5th November or St George's Day.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't matter about corporations and money.  It is about a celebration of our national heritage and time off for hard working families.\r\n",
