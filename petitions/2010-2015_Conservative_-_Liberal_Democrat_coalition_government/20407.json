        "additional_details": "I would like to propose a Bill in Parliament to control the development of Residential back garden land in circumstances where there is strong local residential opposition.\r\n\r\nThe proposal has the following elements.\r\n\r\nOne: to restrict the use of residential garden land for new housing development to require local community involvement, as outlined in the Communities Bill now before Parliament.\r\n\r\nTwo: to limit the number of occasions that a developer can appeal plans for such developments previously refused by the Local Authority Planning Committee and Planning Officers to two submissions, even where such appeals contain for revised detail.\r\n\r\nThree: to disallow the presentation of revised developments and plans following refusals where there is local resident opposition. The opposition to any such scheme should be judged by the number of residents who are likely to be affected by such a proposal.",
