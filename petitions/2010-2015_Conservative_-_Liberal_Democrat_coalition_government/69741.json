Irrespective of the merits of their political argument for an independent Scotland, they have proven themselves worthy of this recognition by stimulating a political debate that the whole of the UK will eventually benefit from. They have literally re-invigorated the notion of politics to many UK citizens and reminded everyone on both sides how it can be utilized for the benefit of society.",
