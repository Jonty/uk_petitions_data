        "additional_details": "Having all of the UK schoolchildren on holiday at the same encourages bored children to enter the gang culture. This may be factor in recent riots and criminal behaviour.\r\nThe cost of family holidays rises sharply during the fixed school holiday period. The rules on taking children out of school during term time are not clear and vary from school to school.\r\nFixed school holiday dates are not always convenient for the parent's work commitments or childminding arrangements.\r\nThe govt, should introduce an allowance of flexible holidays that can be taken in addition to a much reduced period of fixed holiday dates.\r\nChildren who are constantly disruptive in school, fail to attend regularly, or who are involved in criminal acts during holiday periods might have their allowance cut as a punishment causing parents to be more responsible or face losing their holiday dates.\r\n",
