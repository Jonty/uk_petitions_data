        "additional_details": "Currently there is no onus on insurance companies to keep an accurate record of your no claims entitlement. Thus (as in my case) if you take a policy with one company with 8 years no claims and their system only records 5, then when you leave they only record that you have 5, loosing 4 years (8 + 1 year = 9). This increases the cost of new policies.\r\nAll insurance companies should be compelled to honour and keep your full no claims entitlement.\r\n",
