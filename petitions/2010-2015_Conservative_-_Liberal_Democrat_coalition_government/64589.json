        "additional_details": "The decision has been made to close many of Crawley's existing services at the children and family centres and make them only available to those classed as 'Vulnerable' meaning a large proportion of people will be unable to attend.\r\n\r\nThese groups are a life line to many new parents, helping make new friends, gain reassurance and allowing their babies to socialise with other babies their age.\r\n\r\nMany privatised groups run locally however are not so age specific or specifically targeted for new parents.\r\n\r\nBeing a new parent can be massively overwhelming and support is vital and I do believe that the removal of these groups will lead to a increase in post natal health conditions, such as post natal depression, putting more pressure on the already over stretched NHS.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to reconsider their decision to make these facilities only available to the 'vulnerable' and perhaps compromise if the issue is related to cost.",
