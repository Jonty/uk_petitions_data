        "additional_details": "The government is planning to end the present Armed Forces pension schemes. Presently, a serviceman receives an immediate pension after completing a full career in their respective Force. Under the new scheme, they will not receive this until they are 60.\r\n\r\nTHIS AFFECTS SERVING AND FUTURE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN.\r\n\r\nDespite doing a unique and at times deadly job for the country, the government is still planning to take their pensions from them, replacing it with a more civilian style pension, that starts a mere 5 years earlier than a civil servant's.\r\n\r\nAfter anything between 22-37 years service, an ex servicemen tends to struggle to readjust to regular working life. The pension helps them cope with a drastic change in their life, especially if their career has taken its toll on their health.\r\n\r\n\u00a0It is a breaking of the armed forces covenant. It is creating an imbalance between what our service personnel do for the nation and what the nation does for our service personnel.",
