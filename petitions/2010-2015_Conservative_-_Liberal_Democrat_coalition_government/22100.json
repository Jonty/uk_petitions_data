Not just for Scotland but for all UK citizens, logic dictates therefore that in a democratic society, those uk citizens outside of Scotland who would be effected equally, should be able to vote on the issue and should have the right (as Scottish citizens will) to self-determination.\r\n\r\nScottish independence is a separation of Scotland from the UK which scottish citizens a right to vote for, and it is also a separation of the UK from Scotland and so UK citizens should have the right to vote on the issue.\r\n\r\nSurely the decision to break up the united kingdom should be in the hands of all of the citizens of the united kingdom, not just a select few.
