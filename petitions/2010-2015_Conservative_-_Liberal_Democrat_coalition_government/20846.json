        "additional_details": "Grimsby Council (North East Lincolnshire) From April 2012 are going to start a free of \u00a325 a year for brown bin collections which is for garden waste, grass cutting, and any think from garden and boxes even. All the waste out of the brown bins can be sold on so why should we pay for usage of brown bins. Please join us in telling them re call it, or if they go head send your bins back and refuse to take part. How can it run if not many people pay the free. Thank you for your support.",
