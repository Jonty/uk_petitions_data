        "additional_details": "As a firefighter I have seen the devestation that drink driving causes to famillies & the community. I feel that there needs to be a clear & severe deterrent to those that knowingly put the lives of other road users and pedestrians at risk. By introducing a law that bans drivers who are caught with over twice the legal limit of alcohol in their system. The introduction of this regulation at 70 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath; or 160 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood; or 214 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of urine would target those who have knowingly & not by \"error\" got in to their vehicle and driven whilst under the influence. I believe this ban would be an effective deterrent & also protect people from being killed / injured by this particular group of drink drivers.",
