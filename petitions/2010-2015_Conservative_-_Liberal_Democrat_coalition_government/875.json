Being unemployed in late 30's is actually become a strugle let alone finding out that most of the new shops for instance bring in own staff and outsiders. Surely figures will prove how many unemployed in this area single, married and single parents who want to work local mainly because now the pay is so low in majority of retail work. I just think that job-centres should put forward there clients who live in that specific area for the jobs first to help local moral and community. Please feel free to join this and get noticed for the right reasons for your AREA ",
