Over the past few days, the Hong Kong government has brutally suppressed peaceful student demonstration by means of riot police, rubber bullets and tear gas. These students are all unarmed and we are fearful of a second coming of Thiemann Square massacre. We are fighting for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, which was promised in the Hong Kong Basic Law and in the Sino- British joint declaration.\r\n\r\nI hereby ask for your support to remind the UK government of its duty to support and oversee a healthy democratic development in Hong Kong that was promised 15 years ago. I call for the UK government to protect the lives and interest of British nationals in Hong Kong and its citizens by means of economic sanctions towards China and Hong Kong.",
