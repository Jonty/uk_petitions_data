        "additional_details": "Make Britain a duty-free area to attract investors and abolish all current taxes and implement new tax of 2.5% on networth with some exempt investment and wealth so that richest pay their fair share and the poor who dont have the minimum exempt investment and wealth to receive their fair share in one bulk payment so that they can start a business and be taxable in future instead of a weekly handout which is hand to mouth payment and not enough to start a small business. This will eventually give an opportunity to the poor to establish in business and be liable to tax in the future which will kick start the economy and bring in more tax. It will also reduce inflation in the long run which will make our handout go further and help the poor live a better life than now with less money.\r\n",
