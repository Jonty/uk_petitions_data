        "additional_details": "Each year thousands of students come out of university and look for jobs in the degree they've graduated in. Yet these students wait for a very long time to find a job despite their qualifications being higher than the masses. The problem is that everyone requires experience and the job prospects for newly graduated students is bleak. This petition is for the government to realize that graduates are the future and need jobs/apprenticeships to stop sitting around on benefits or on jobs that greatly undermines their degree potential.",
