        "additional_details": "Driving is almost a necessity for most, and we invest all of that money into getting that pink licence... and then you look at the insurance figures. Some new drivers, particularly youths, get quoted up to \u00a34000 on a car worth almost \u00a3200. Furthermore, as the economy crashes, and jobs are minimal, parents of young driver can't afford to pay - and the pay for under 21 further reduces the ability to pay. I propose the Government cap premiums for all young/student drivers and make it fair for all. How can the economy ever improve if the future workers of the country can't afford to travel? Student's can't afford to get to higher educational institutions. And all of this is on top of the student fees! Sign this petition. Make Government consider the future generation!",
