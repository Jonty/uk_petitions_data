        "additional_details": "It is sickening that so many people get away with taking advantage of the current welfare system, whilst hard working members of the British public have to pay for people who refuse to do any form of employment.\r\n\r\nThere are clearly people who are deserving of state benefits and who should be protected, but the staggering abuse of the system makes a mockery of what the Welfare State was originally set up to do. That is why Ian Duncan-Smith's work to reform this is to be applauded. The ministers who have voted against this Bill do not represent how the majority of British people feel about this issue.\r\n\r\nI implore the Coalition Government to do what is right for all who have to work hard every day and ensure that this Bill becomes law.",
