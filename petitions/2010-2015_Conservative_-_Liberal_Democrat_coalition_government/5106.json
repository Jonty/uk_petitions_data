        "additional_details": "It is against the law for estate agents to leave their boards outside a property longer than 14 days after it has been let (or sold). However, this law is widely flouted, almost never enforced and many agents leave boards outside properties in perpetuity. These are ugly and add to a sense of transience that can undermine the sense of community that neighbourhoods should enjoy. The law should be enforced and could be done so at local authority-level with relative ease without involving the police, simply by councils sending local estate agents letters that inform them of their responsibilities.",
