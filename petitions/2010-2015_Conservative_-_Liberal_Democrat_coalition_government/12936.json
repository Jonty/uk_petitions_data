        "additional_details": "With the recent passing of the 75th anniversary of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and with only 4 surviving British veterans of the International Brigadiers, it is time for the families of these heroes to receive a formal apology from the Prime Minister for the policy of the British Government of the time.\r\nThe circa 4,000+ British men answered the appeal to support loyalists of the democratically elected established Government of Spain, against the rebel forces of General Franco backed by Hitler and Mussulini, received no help from the British Government of the day who adhered to a broader policy of appeasment of Fascist dictatorships. British International Brigade veterans were perversely subject to survelliance of the British secret services into the 1950s. This shameful policy should be apologised for to recognise the heroism and democratic dignity of these veterans.",
