        "additional_details": "The current census asks \"What is your religion?\". However, this question is inadequate for the following reason. The majority of people in this country select \"Christian - CofE\" as their religion, but the fact is that a significant number of such people are not actually practising Christians, but just happened to have been baptised as a Christian. Although there is an \"Atheist\" option, that requires someone to have made a positive decision to identify themself as an Atheist - and only a minority actually do so.\r\n\r\nFar better to ask firstly: \"Are you a practising religious person?\" - and then only if the answer is yes, to ask which religion is practised.",
