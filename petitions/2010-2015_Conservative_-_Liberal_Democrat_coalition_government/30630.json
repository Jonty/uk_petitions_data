        "additional_details": "More than enough evidence has now come to light to revoke News International's license to publish in this country.  At the very least they should be forced to suspend their publishing activities until both the parliamentary and judicial investigations are complete, with their right to publish restored only if their name is cleared.\r\n\r\n\r\nDozens of journalists, editors and executives have been implicated in phone hacking, email hacking, perjury, police corruption, perverting the course of justice, harrassment, etc.   News International's senior management has proven itself unfit to run any kind of business here.\r\n\r\nWe should not allow NewsCorp to affect the outcome of the inquiries through shaping public opinion with their newspapers. Let's send a message that freedom of the press does not include freedom from the law.",
