Not only does this party attempt to block efforts to repair and rebuild the economy of this country, it also seeks to deny and repress public opinion on other important matters such as immigration, membership of the EU, foreign aid and crime.  Its ideology seems to be based on ever increasing taxation to pay for expensive and ineffective schemes particularly in regard to the production of energy.\r\nWe call upon those in Government, and to all MPs, to heed public opinion.  To listen, to set aside party differences and ideologies, and to work together to restore this country.",
