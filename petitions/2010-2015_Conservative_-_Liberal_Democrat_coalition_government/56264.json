        "additional_details": "The BBC have recently stopped broadcasting a National Weather Forecast after the 10 o'clock news.  The weather forecast now takes the form of curious mix of local and national maps.  Apart being interesting to see what the weather in the rest of the country was like it also helped with travel plans.  More often than not  the national forecast was more accurate and up to date.  I would like the DCMS to persuade the BBC to bring back the National Forecast.  ",
