We feel that 28 days is too much and it should be reduced, are opinion is that one week is the ideal time. The reason we feel that 28 days is too long is if that a person is proved innocent that's a month of their life taken away. A week is also more than enough time for the police to gather enough evidence to mount a case against the individual. Are opinion is that 28 day breaches your right to freedom.\r\nArticle 2.\r\n\u2022Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.
