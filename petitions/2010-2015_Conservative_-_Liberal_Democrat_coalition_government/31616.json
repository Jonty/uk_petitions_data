        "additional_details": "Suicide. Probably the worst thing that can be produced by offenders verbally abusing innocent people behind their computer screens. In this society, I feel as if we allow these so called 'trolls' to mindless bully innocent victims, simply because it is on line and not face to face.  I understand that it may be difficult for prosecution to happen, but it would be an improvement if people were made aware of the consequences they can face if they abuse on line, especially children and teenagers. People should no longer feel like they have no one to turn to because the abuse is behind a computer screen. It's morally wrong, and a problem that is severely worsening. Some action needs to be taken about this growing problem in our society. Please sign this petition to make our government aware of this horrific behaviour which can seriously effect victim's lives.",
