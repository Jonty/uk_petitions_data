        "additional_details": "I would like any HGV to be banned from overtaking on motorways and A roads during the hours of 7.00am-7.00pm. To overtake at 1 mile an hour more can create huge tailbacks and alot of congestion. This frustrates many other drivers and can lead to dangerous and erratic driving to make up the time lost. To compensate, the government could provide tax breaks to haulage companies and keep the country moving!",
