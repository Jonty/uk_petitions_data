        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that the recent reduction in winter fuel allowance from \u00a3250 to \u00a3200 for all beyond retirement age is recalled immediately and revised to increase winter fuel allowance to those on pension credit to \u00a3300.00 and reduced to \u00a3150.00 for those who do not require pension credit.The government has ignored or failed to understand the catastrophic financial and health related effects of the simultaneous excessive increase in cost of energy and reduction of the winter fuel allowance on the group of pensioners in receipt of pension credit relative to the modest effect of those retired with additional pension of investment income.",
