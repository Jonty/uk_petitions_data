        "additional_details": "It is IMPERATIVE that we delay opening the borders to Romania & Bulgaria in 2014. There is a very high incidence of Multi Drug Resistant Tuberculosis in these countries and we currently have no effective vaccines. BCG will not protect the adult population in most cases. Vaccines are in development but will not be available until at least 2018. We must not lift the block on mass migration until we have a defense against this disease.",
