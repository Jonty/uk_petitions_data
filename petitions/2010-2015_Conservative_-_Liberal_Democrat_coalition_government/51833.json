        "additional_details": "This petition is to get the Essex government to recreate one of Colchesters Amphitheatres over the ruins of the originals ones from the Roman period.\r\n\r\nThis amphitheatre would bring back to life a piece of our Roman heritage. Plays and other performances would be held there, and it would create jobs.\r\n\r\nThe government would only have to provide the funding for a team or archeologists to find where the Amphitheatre had previously layed, and then hire a building contractors to have the Theatre reconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe Theatre would be made to look exactly as it did when first made, the only difference being any security systems, such as CCTV cameras.",
