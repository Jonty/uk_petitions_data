        "additional_details": "Mobile phone insurance is added to all new mobile phones, even if you did not ask for it, want it or need it.\r\nYou are not allowed to shop around for a cheaper rate.\r\nYou are pressured into buying it at point of sale.\r\nIt must be direct debit.\r\nIt is made difficult to cancel.\r\nYou are never told that it automatically continues well after the phone handset contract expires. So you end up paying for years after you no longer own the handset.\r\nThe information you do receive, is in such a small font size, it becomes illegible.\r\nIt is never re-valued to match the latest value of the handset (so is no longer fit for purpose).\r\nIf PPI is mis-sold then this must be.\r\nSo the Ministry of Justice must look into this.",
