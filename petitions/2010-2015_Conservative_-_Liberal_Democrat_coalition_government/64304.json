With fundings for housing and business development little is done to promote and create green space. We need to have our streets brightened with plant life and not brick. he high streets are littered with business after business but there is nothing that promotes a sense of well-being. Plants are extremely important for the environment and it seems that less and less are being found in London. The government needs to look into introducing an intiative in which the local councils can adopt a way of introducing plant life along our roads. ",
