        "additional_details": "Piers Morgan has made a negative contribution to British culture over his time here. As such it would be for the betterment of the nation if his citizenship were revoked and he be barred from future entry.\r\n\r\nSince Piers Morgan may soon be expelled from his current domicile, the United States of America, we urge the government to act quickly. The signatories of this petition feel an ideal situation would be to leave Mr. Morgan in the middle of the Atlantic.",
