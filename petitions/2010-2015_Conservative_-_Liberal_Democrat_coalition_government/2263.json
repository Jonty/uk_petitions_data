        "additional_details": "In the 21st century there is no need to use metal and paper for payments. Cheques waste everyone's money and cash is only of value to tax evaders, drug dealers, money launderers and corrupt politicians (and you can't use it online). Getting rid of cash would boost GDP by around 0.5% immediately. If electronic payments mean that everyone pays their fair share of tax, then honest taxpayer's bills will fall.\r\n\r\nLet's stop harking back to the 1950s and form a vision for the future instead. We don't need these Jacobean instruments in an age of mobile phones.",
