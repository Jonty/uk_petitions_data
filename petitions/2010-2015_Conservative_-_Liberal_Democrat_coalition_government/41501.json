Pets don't understand fireworks & the noise which can cause distress & different behaviour. It is only a moral obligation for people to advise neighbours of private firework displays many people appear unwilling to provide the courtesy of advising neighbours that they are carrying out a private display which upsets & angers neighbours as it causes such distress to pets.\r\nResponsible pet owners need to make suitable arrangements for their pets while firework displays are taking place such as closing windows, obtaining a pheromone plug-in device to calm pets, covering hutches and drawing curtains therefore need time to allow for these. It should be a legal obligation for people to advise neighbours of displays. ",
