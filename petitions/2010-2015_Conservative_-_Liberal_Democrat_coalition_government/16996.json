They further employ WAGS (wives and girlfriends) not to mention sons and daughters of WAGS as 'staff' This cannot be 'right' i comment as a point of concern for their general health as every M.P from whatever party seem to develop increasingly heavier jowls during terms of office manage to pay off mortgages on more than one property and appear to be lifelong 'public servants' however many scandals they become embroiled in en route.They have prison sentences shortened in a manner that doesn't bear scrutiny and return to the fold to rapturous applause. Why? We taxpayers are the SLAVES of government...investigate that and justify not commuting from your constituencies to London in today's age this would be possible by air by train etc: like the rest of us have to; or stay in bed& breakfast why do we pay for groceries to two houses while public services are curtailed.",
