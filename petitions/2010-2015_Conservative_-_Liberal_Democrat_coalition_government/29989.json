Now we must pick up the campaign to see all sanitary products (including sanitary towels; sanitary pads; panty liners; tampons; keepers and maternity pads) be reduced to the zero rate (0%) alongside most food items, books, newspapers, magazines and children's clothes.\r\n\r\nThey are very necessary items and rates on them disproportionately hit women the most. Some common sense on behalf of the government is needed. ",
