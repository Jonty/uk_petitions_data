        "additional_details": "I want the government to sanction and stop benefit payments when individuals are charged with an offence or even cautioned. Not only this, I deem it necessary for the parents should also bare the brunt of this unacceptable behaviour. I suggest that if under 18 or living under their parents roof, then they too should be sanctioned in order to promote a society that takes responsibility for those who commit crime. I feel that community payback will be a suitable final punishment to deter from committing the crime in the first place or make parents enforce rules in the home.",
