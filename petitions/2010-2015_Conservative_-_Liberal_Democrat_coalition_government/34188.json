        "additional_details": "This campaign has been launched to raise awareness of current loopholes in the law, which put dental patients at risk.  There is no legal requirement in the UK for a dentist to have professional liability insurance to cover his patients if something goes wrong with the dental treatment which he provides. So a dentist can register with the General Dental Council to practise dentistry in the UK, but he does not have to demonstrate that he has made adequate insurance provision.\r\nThis means that some dentists practise in this country uninsured, and the problems only come to light when it is too late \u2013 after members of the public have been harmed and there is no-one, and no insurance, to pick up the tab.\r\n  Together we can change the law - join us today by signing our petition.\r\n\r\n",
