        "additional_details": "I believe that people with dementia should have a lasting and permanent right to vote even when they are not able to vote for themselves, losing the ability to rationalize how they would wish to vote, a lasting intent of voting should be allowed.\r\n\r\n800,000 people in the UK have dementia. The recent move by the present government doubling the research budget to \u00a3100 million is dwarfed by a single donation our nation made to help inoculate people from disease abroad. Let them donate their vote to the Alzheimer's society, governments would take a block vote far more seriously.The tragic consequences of someone succumb to the effects of dementia and the knock on effect it has on family and friends who are powerless to help seems to hold such low priority in our political system. People in prison have more rights to vote than someone dying of dementia by default. This cannot be right surely?",
