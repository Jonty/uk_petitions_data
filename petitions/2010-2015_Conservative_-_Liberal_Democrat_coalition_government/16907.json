        "additional_details": "We petition the government to review all treaties and international commitments which may inhibit the ability of Parliament to restore capital punishment. Following this review, the Ministry of Justice should map out the necessary legislative steps which will be required to restore the death penalty for the murder of any person on UK Territory. The findings of the review and the necessary substantive legislation to be presented to House of Commons for debate no later than 12 months after this petition passes the acceptance threshold.\r\n\r\nWe feel that in order to restore society and moral values that the death penalty should be restored but used only where DNA evidence is sufficient to enable a secure conviction. Miscarriages of justice have occurred with use of the death penalty in times gone by but the tolerance for mistakes has been eradicated with the advent of DNA analysis.",
