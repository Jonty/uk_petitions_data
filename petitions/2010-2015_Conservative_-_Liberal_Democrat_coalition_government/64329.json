        "additional_details": "Bradford-on-Avon is a small town in west Wiltshire, which over recent years has seen a big increase in housing developments, and yet little to no infrastructure improvement.\r\n\r\nThis itself should be reason enough for housing developments on the outskirts of the town to be severely limited, but now local council has approved a new housing development on the green belt land east of the town, in the fields adjacent to the Holt road up until the cemetery. The development will be done in stages over several years, causing significant impacts to both local wildlife and the town\u2019s already strained traffic problems and lack of public services.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to put a stop to this development specifically, and revise the policy on building on green belt land in this area more generally.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree that this land and the wildlife should be protected, and the rights of local residents and those within the town respected.\r\n\r\nThank-you.",
