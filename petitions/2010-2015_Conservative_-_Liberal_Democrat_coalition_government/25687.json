The levels of communication between the care homes, the local authority, adult social services, the resident and their families need to be improved and reviewed. Procedures for when such a situation arises need to be made transparent and clear for all with a time frame of what will happen in the event of a care home closure. This is to include an open and honest discourse between all the stakeholders and consultations; even when the resident makes partial contributions.  ",
