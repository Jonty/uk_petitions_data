        "additional_details": "Due to Governmental cuts, Newcastle City Council is planning to close its City Pool as part of its spending cuts, leaving City of Newcastle Amateur Swimming Club without anywhere to train. The club has produced 3 Olympians, many national swimmers and has represented Great Britain in international events. It's closure would be devastating to the Club, but also to the region. It is a grade II listed building and heavily used by people throughout the region, not to mention for over 5hrs daily by City of Newcastle ASC. Please show your support in opposition of this closure.
