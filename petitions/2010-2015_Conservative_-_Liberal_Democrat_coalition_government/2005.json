Taxpayers should not have to fund their spending on anything other than other than necessities. Benefit payments should be in the form of a debit card that can only be used to purchase essential items such as food, clothing and toiletries. All other purchases on the proposed card would be prohibited. It is right for taxpayers to assist those in need, however taxpayers should not have to give up a significant percentage of their income to fund anybody else's lifestyle choices.",
