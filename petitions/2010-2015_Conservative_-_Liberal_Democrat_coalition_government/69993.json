The people have had no say in the \" powers\" that Westminster promised to hand over.\r\nWe, the people of Scotland, demand Devo Max to obtain full fiscal autonomy where the Scottish Parliament would receive all tax levied in Scottish land and waters. The Scottish Parliament would be responsible for most of the spending in Scotland but would make payments to the UK government to cover Scotland's share of UK-wide services to include defence and foreign relations.
