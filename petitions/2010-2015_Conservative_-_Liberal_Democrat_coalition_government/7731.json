        "additional_details": "Current policy does not work - there are clearly still drugs about. Decriminalising will stop needless crime and involvement in criminal activity for harmless acts. Recreational drugs really only damage the user and are less damaging to society than alcohol. They are mainly damaging to the user due to a lack of control - if regulated and sold by licence, quality could be controlled - no more strong skunk/poisened batches of ecstacy. They could be highly taxed - revenue for the government rather than from the drug gangs. \"Soft drugs lead to other drugs\" - only if you have to go to a heroin dealer to get them. \"Skunk is too strong\" - monitor production and avoid this. Stop the imprisonment and destruction of the lives of those who get caught up in this cycle - it only worsens it.",
