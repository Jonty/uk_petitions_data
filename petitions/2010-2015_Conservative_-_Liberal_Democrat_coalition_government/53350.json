        "additional_details": "Following the selection of yet another white British icon to appear on the ten pound note, Jane Austin, isn't it about time in modern Multicultural Britain to have some recognition of the diverse and rich culture that actually makes up Britain today.\r\n\r\nI would like to nominate Doreen Lawrence who has become an icon of this age through a tragic event. Her diginity, determination and respect has seen her selected for numerous honours most recently to become a peer in the house of Lords.\r\n\r\nI find it unbeleivable that in a liberal cosmopolitan society there is not and evidence of any other ethnic group other than white British on items such as currency.\r\n\r\nThe role currency plays in culture is huge and I urge you to sign this epetition to see a modern day Hero Doreen Lawrence to appear on the next twenty pound note.",
