        "additional_details": "China and other countries which have cheap labour, cheap land, rates and work in less humane conditions than Europe and North America have an unfair capability to manufacture cheap and simple goods. My idea would be to turn long term prisoners into a useful asset to the country rather than just being a financial burden on society. This could be done by creating manufacturing units attached to prisons, the free labour would make the input costs of UK products competitive, give essential skills to prisoners, create a useful work ethic and turn a large cost into a profit.",
