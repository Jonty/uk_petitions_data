        "additional_details": "Clarification of Controlled Drug legislation potentially means that any Hospital Pharmacy supplying Controlled drugs to other Hospitals, charities, hospices and private hospitals will need a Home Office Controlled drugs licence.  Hospitals have undertaken these transactions, in the interest of patient care and not for profit, for many years without any issues.  Clarification of the law now means that organisations undertaking these transactions require a Home Office CD licence for each schedule of CD supplied which may lead to costs of \u00a315k per trust.  These costs will inevitably be passed onto their dependent organisations which means these mainly charity organisations have less money to spend on patients.  Hospital pharmacies are regulated and monitored by CQC, and some by GPhC and MHRA. Therefore the addition of an another regulator serves no purpose other than to extract money which should be spent on patient care to subsidize a Government department.  The law should be changed. ",
