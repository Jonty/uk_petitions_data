        "additional_details": "Drug abuse, alcohol related problems and obesity in our society are costing the NHS billions every year. Ambulance services in some parts of the country such as Newcastle are overloaded with alcohol related incidents and have less time to deal with real emergencies. Drug users, obese people, alcoholics and binge drinkers normally only have themselves to blame for their problems and the only reason why they manage to get away with it is because they get free health care. I propose that those people should start taking responsibility for their own actions by making them pay at least 60% of the medical bills that they have incurred. That should teach them a lesson and deter such people who think that the rest of us will always pick up the pieces for them.",
