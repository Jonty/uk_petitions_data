        "additional_details": "We the under signed request the UK GOVERNMENT prevent companies scamming us by falsifying charging extra for beef products now that the horse meat scandal has been uncovered. This is due to the fact that we the British public have already been over charged paying for what we thought to be beef products in the first place. Also local butchers etc.. will have been using beef products and charging beef product prices to begin with and therefore have no need to charge extra. We ask the UK Government to act in a decent and appropriate manner.",
