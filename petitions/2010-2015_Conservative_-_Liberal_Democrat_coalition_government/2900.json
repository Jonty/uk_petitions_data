        "additional_details": "Please ban the sale of fireworks to the general public. This is due to the health and safety issues and anti social behaviour. There can be licensed, organised and properly staffed displays. These will then be advertised so that people will know exactly when and where the displays are taking place. Many animals suffer each year by the noise trauma and injuries caused either directly by the fireworks or fleeing from the noise. Also each year humans suffer injuries from fireworks in the home and from the anti social behaviour from yobs. Sadly in this day and age there is also the risk of someone making a 'dirty' firework. Once the fireworks are in shops for sale it can cause many months of misery and risk. Please ban the general sale of fireworks immediately thank you.",
