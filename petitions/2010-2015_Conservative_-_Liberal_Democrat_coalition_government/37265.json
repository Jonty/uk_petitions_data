        "additional_details": "This is not necessarily a petition to protect Julian Assange, but it is certainly inspired by the case.\r\n\r\nOn 16/08/12 we have heard reported news that the United Kingdom may be willing to revoke the embassy status for the Ecuadorian office in London in order to seize and extradite Julian Assange. The law, which dates to 1987, allows the government to revoke Embassy status, removing international legal protections, but the law never had been used for this purpose. I would like to tell the Government that they should not.\r\n\r\nThis law should remain to protect our country, and the embassy's people in times of national security and human rights violations. It should not be used to bolster political ties with other countries. Our soil must remain a safe place for embassies- our standing in the political geography of the world is reliant on it.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ask the Government to respect embasies' diplomatic rights where national security and human rights are jot at risk.",
