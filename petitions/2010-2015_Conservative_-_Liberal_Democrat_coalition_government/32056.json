        "additional_details": "In the 2012 budget, the Chancellor proposed removing the zero rating of VAT on alterations to listed buildings.  This will add up to 20% extra cost on every listed building that wants to upgrade, and so will threaten the future of our nation's heritage.\r\n\r\nFor Wakefield Cathedral at an early stage of work in a restoration project of national significance, it is a disaster.  It imposes a cost we cannot meet and work will have to end.\r\n\r\nThis is a small-minded change from a Big Society Government and must be stopped.  Please join us to help preserve our heritage and sign this petition now.",
