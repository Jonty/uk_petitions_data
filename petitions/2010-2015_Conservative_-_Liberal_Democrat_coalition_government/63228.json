        "additional_details": "Call on the UK Government to adopt a similar system to that in Germany so that dogs and other animals will only be euthanized due to severe illness and if they pose severe danger to others.\r\n\r\nAnimals are being put down due to lack of space and funding and they can only be kept in pounds for 7 days, after that time has passed they will be euthanized. The current system is disgusting and quite frankly it's murder of innocent animals.\r\n\r\nWe have one planet and it's not just ours, we all have one life so what justifies this type of treatment for pets and animals?",
