        "additional_details": "There are many political movements promising the freedom of the UK from EU interference but a referendum is one more promise that is unlikely to be delivered.\r\n\r\nThe economic arguments of europhile fanatics are dubious. Companies will not just cease trade with us if we leave the Union. No company would turn down an opportunity to make a profit, and British workers would be able to take home a pay packet to support their family. The notion of political unity in Europe is outdated.\r\n\r\nWe demand that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union with immediate effect without the need for a referendum.",
