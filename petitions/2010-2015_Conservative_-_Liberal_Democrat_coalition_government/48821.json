        "additional_details": "The most expensive items most people own are homes & cars; ball games played on public roads and close to private property can easily cause hundreds of pounds of damage to both of these. Garden plants and windows are easily broken by balls and; although, in some areas police provide \"soft footballs\", these still collect dirt and grit which scratches expensive paintwork. It also causes unnecessary noise and arguments between neighbours. Also, if you allow football then why not cricket? ",
