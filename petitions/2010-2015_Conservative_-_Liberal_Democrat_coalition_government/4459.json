        "additional_details": "In the interest of security, justice and in some cases personal safety and integration, the government should ban all face covering in public, including anyone attending a demonstration or  protest.   In a civilised society everyone should be compelled to reveal their identity in public places.  If they do not they have something to hide and can justifiably be regarded as a threat to the state.  Only the police on riot duty and motor cyclists on the road be permitted to wear safety helmets or cyclists allowed to wear protection masks whilst on the road for health reasons and these could easily be manufactured transparent if necessary.",
