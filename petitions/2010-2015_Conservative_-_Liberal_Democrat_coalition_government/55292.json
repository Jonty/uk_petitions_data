        "additional_details": "Internet hate is a growing epidemic. The UK should set an example by giving out tough sentences to people sending internet hate, death threats and threats of rape and sexual assault. Measures to be implemented should be full internet bans (ISP's not to provide service to users, mobile contracts to shut off internet use), and real money fines if they break the ban, full house bans including parents if the offender is underage.\r\n\r\nIt may seem harsh, but the 'sticks and stones' attitude is more damaging than anything before, keyboard warriors get away with far too much. We need to send a message that they cannot escape the real life consequences of their words and actions online.",
