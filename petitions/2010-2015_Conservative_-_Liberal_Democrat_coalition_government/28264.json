        "additional_details": "The UK exports armaments to repressive governments and despotic regimes with little  consideration of how they will be used.  In recent conflicts, British soldiers have fought against regimes armed by Britain. Its armaments exports have often been used to suppress human rights and democracy.\r\n\r\n I call on the government to re-assess its armaments exports policy, to reduce public subsidy for armaments manufacture and export and to place greater priority on the ethical and moral considerations of supplying armaments to governments and regimes who flout UN Resolutions and are in defiance of international law.",
