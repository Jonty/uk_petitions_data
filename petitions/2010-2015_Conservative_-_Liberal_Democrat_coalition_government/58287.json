        "additional_details": "We would like nappy sacks to be made safer so babies stop dying because of them.\r\n\r\nIn March 2013 I lost my 7 month old son, Maison,  affer he suffocated on a nappy sack.\r\nThe coroners office said they had seen this happen before because they are made from a flimsy materia, attractive to babies and are easily breathed in.\r\n\r\nNappy sacks made on a roll are much safer and we feel that they should be sold in an container that has a child proof lock so children cant get into them.\r\n\r\nIn the past 10 years the number of babies dying from suffocation on these bags is increasing. Parents get told they are a nursery essential when really they are very dangerous.\r\n\r\nAs no specific law is in place to say how nappy sacks are produced we ask for this to be looked at.",
