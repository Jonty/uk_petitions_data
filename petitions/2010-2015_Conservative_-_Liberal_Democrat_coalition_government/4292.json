        "additional_details": "The current illegality of cannabis is costing the UK in many ways. The main harm to the user comes from the fact it is illegal, and one can recieve a criminal record, preventing them from fully contributing to society. A completely legal and regulated system would prevent police funds being poured down the drain, while at the same time protect under 18s from obtaining it. Most Cannabis smokers would rather buy legally from a shop or dispensary than hand money to a drug dealer, money which can then be laundered and not reinvested in the economy.",
