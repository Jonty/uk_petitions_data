It must be debated and the spin used by Central Government, Local Authorities and even some of our elected representatives must be stopped. The risks must be shown to those communities as part of the planning process and we must be allowed to have a say.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome consequences are so great that no matter what the probability, the risks cannot be justified, especially if the economic benefit to the decision makers is actually driving the poor application of the risk assessment tool,\r\n\r\nPlease sign this and forward it to as many of your friends and family as possible, your community could be next as the demand for LNG grows",
