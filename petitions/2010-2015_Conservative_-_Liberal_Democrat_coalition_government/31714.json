        "additional_details": "FOR SOME TIME, THE RAIL CARRIERS HAVE BANNED DISABLED/INFIRM USERS OF 4 WHEEL ELECTRIC MOBILITY SCOOTERS FROM ALL TRAINS. THEY WILL ALLOW SMALL LIGHTWEIGHT FOLDING SCOOTERS BUT REQUIRE THESE TO BE FOLDED AND PLACED IN THE LUGGAGE AREA AND THE USER TO TRANSFER TO A SEAT. THIS IS CLEARLY AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE DDA  ETC IF NOT THE LETTER. TO ACHIEVE THIS DISCRIMINATION THEY HIDE BEHIND HEALTH AND SAFETY.\r\nALL THAT WE THE DISABLED ASK IS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM TO TRAVEL BY TRAIN AND THE CARRIERS BE HELD TO ACCOUNT AND MADE TO ENSURE FULL ACCESS TO ALL THEIR SERVICES. PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION. THANKYOU",
