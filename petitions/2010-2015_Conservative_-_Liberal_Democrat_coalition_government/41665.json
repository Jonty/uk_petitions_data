Details are available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda_Anti-Homosexuality_Bill\r\n\r\nThe signors of this petition request that the UK Government not only state their displeasure at this bill as they have already done, but to also attach real consequences to the passing of this bill in the form of loss of trade status and foreign aid. We would also request that the government petition the UN to have the security council vote on international sanctions. We feel that this gross human rights violation requires no less of a response.",
