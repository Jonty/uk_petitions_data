Blood is donated by individuals as an act of charity and should NOT be used to generate profits which will not be returned to the healthcare system.\r\n2. The profit impetus may compel any company taking over services to cut corners in order to make return. This could have devastating consequences for patient safety should contaminated, poorly packaged or improperly labelled products reach frontline healthcare services.",
