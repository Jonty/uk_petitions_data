        "additional_details": "The closure of the four stations serving Leigh (Lancs) in the 1950's and 60's has left the town, the site of one of the first passenger railways (Leigh - Bolton C.1831), without a rail link.\r\nThe proposed route for the High Speed rail link (HS2) between London and the North has been published.  It shows the rail line passing very close to us.  Transport for Leigh, a community interest group, believe this provides an excellent opportunity for the re-instatement of a rail link serving our local region by way of a new interchange located in our area. This new interchange proposal will bring considerable investment, jobs, economic growth and increased mobility.\r\nWe urge the government to consider the reinstatement of a rail link for the town and it's future integration with HS2 as a regional hub for the North West of England.",
