        "additional_details": "Following the untimely death of our daughter Rhianna Rawding on 25th December 2012 due to a junior doctor not spotting vital signs, we are now campaigning to ensure that it becomes law that every child entering a paediatric accident and emergency department is seen by a senior doctor personally to be checked before being discharged. We are campaigning to make sure this is compulsory 24 hrs a day including weekends and bank holidays.\r\nThis would ensure correct diagnosis and treatment and would help enormously to prevent unnecessary deaths.\r\n\r\nPlease get behind this petition and sign it as it does affect us all whether it be your children , grandchildren , nieces and nephews.",
