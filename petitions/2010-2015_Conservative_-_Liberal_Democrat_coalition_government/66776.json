        "additional_details": "Stop cyclists using the A50 (bypassing Uttoxeter) for competition races. 2 years ago a HGV took down a cyclist which led to the cyclists death and the driver sentenced, I'm sure this is not the first or last time you'll hear similar incidents involving cyclists on main roads. Cyclists struggle to cycle in straight lines when extremely tired in competitions and tend to vier all over the dual carriageway where heavy traffic is travelling at 70mph. Cyclists don't stand a chance with their minimal protection from a potentially fatal RTA. General traffic end up having near miss accidents when trying to avoid them too. There is a perfectly good cycle path away from the A50 dual carriageway so alter the competition route for everyone's safety. Cyclists on dual carriageways should be banned unless the routes are closed off which would cause chaos on this particular road. So please sign this petition to ban cyclist from the A50 dual carriageway (Derbys/Staffs) which will help to save lives!",
