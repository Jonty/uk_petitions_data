        "additional_details": "Families, carers and providers of services to vulnerable people must act now.  The social care workforce are critical in safeguarding the most vulnerable groups of our society yet are one of the lowest paid groups of workers.  The Government is prosecuting employers for failure to pay National Minimum Wage at a time when social care funding is decreasing by 5% but the NMW increasing by 2%.  Sleepover shifts also attract NMW but will there be any compensatory increase in funding for this?  We request the government commission a health and social care task force to look at how we can better protect societies most vulnerable groups by investing in, valuing and developing the socialcare workforce.",
