        "additional_details": "The Air Ambulances across the country provide a vital role in rapid response to incidents and people with potentially life threatening injuries. Take the Yorkshire Air Ambulance - they rely on private funding and funding from fundraising to stay in the air. Part of the area in which they cover is the Yorkshire Dales which is ultimately a rural environment. Land ambulance cannot always reach places which the air ambulances can for e.g. On the side of one of the three peaks. The air ambulance is an invaluable service all over the country which should ultimately be financially supported by the government.",
