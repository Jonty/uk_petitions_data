We are asking that Splash Park be removed from potential list of spending cuts for the year 2015/16 to enable to community to unite and present a viable solution.\r\n\r\nThe Splash Park is a free resource that enables fully integrated play for children from all walks of life, social situations and disabilities. It would be a travesty if the site, which has been a water park for over 100 years, was ripped out of the ground without full and open discussion and financial investigation. ",
