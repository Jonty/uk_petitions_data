        "additional_details": "Rescues all across the UK are fit to bursting with animals that have been abandoned. Hundreds of healthy animals are put to sleep everyday due to abandonment and mistreatment by their owners. I am urging the government to do something about people breeding their animal when they have no experience and when its completely unethical. The government need to stop allowing anyone being able to breed anything with a pulse. I would like to government to recognize this crisis and put a new law in place to help the poor animals being killed everyday due to overcrowding in rescue centres. I suggest licensing for ALL ANIMAL OWNERS. I think that you should need to hold a license to own a pet and in order to obtain the license the owner should sit a course about how to treat and care for animals. This would also stop people buying on impulse and putting it up for sale 2 days later.\r\nThis is only my suggestion, I would like the government to look at this and help in any way they can. Thank you.",
