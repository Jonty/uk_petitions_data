        "additional_details": "The government should change the personal tax structure to allow unused tax allowances to be transferred between family members living in the same household. If one parent chooses to stay at home to raise the children, the family should not be unfairly penalised by losing those lower rate tax allowances which is currently the case.\r\n\r\nTo protect familiy values, to give children the best start in life with care coming from a parent rather than off to a childminder for 12 hours a day and to stop the nonsense where couples are financially better off apart than together this would be an important step in reforming our broken benefit system.",
