        "additional_details": "A reversal of the Beeching act. The Beeching act caused the loss of over 4,000 miles (6,400 km) of railway and 3,000 stations, a reduction of 25 per cent of route miles and 50 per cent of stations. This is not just about restoring our transport links, but our heritage. By reversing the previous Beeching act, we can relay previously destroyed lines and reopen previously closed stations or create alternate new stations, bringing communities previously isolated or cut off, back together. It's understandable that it will be extremely costly, some cumpolsory purchases will be made and alot of planning and asessing will need to be discussed and implemented. Recovering every previously closed railway is unrealistic, but what can be ressurected, should be done so. It's about recreating the links we previously had, and becoming united once again on our railways.",
