        "additional_details": " I would like to propose for the regulation, or abolition of the \"Booking Fee\" when you buy concert tickets. For example, I bought 2 tickets to see Paul Mc Cartney yesterday, & was charged a total of \u00a312:36, for simply booking them. While I accept postage may be required such charges are surley unresasonable, excessive, & should be either stopped, or regulated.\r\n  If you bought a tin of beans in your supermarket, & was then chatged an additional fee by the proprietor because he sold you them, you would be outraged. If Supermarkets can offer free delivery on groceries, then concert venues can do the same when they sell you a ticket!",
