Anyone else can take whatever they want from it.\r\n\r\nWe are always told to 'reduce, reuse, then recycle as a last resort', but current 'recycling' centres encourage recycling as the only option. By adding this option it would make it easier for people to reuse items that are still working.\r\n\r\nThis would be low cost, and by telling people that anything they take is at their own risk, it should be OK for H&S.\r\n\r\n",
