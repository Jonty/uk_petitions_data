        "action": "Limit Legal Aid for Appeals Against Sentence or Conviction",
        "additional_details": " The decision on Whole Life prison terms will undoubtedly cause those sentenced to Appeal their sentences to the highest possible level. In cases such as the killers of Lee Rigby this is likely to have to be funded by Legal Aid and benefit nobody. Of course people should have the right to Appeal but the public purse should not be a bottomless source of money to fund the process. If one Appeal has been thrown out by our Courts then unless new evidence can be clearly seen to have been produced all subsequent Appeals should be funded by the person(s) making that Appeal. If successful their legal costs could be reimbursed, but the British public should not have to pay for a string of failed Appeals. ",
