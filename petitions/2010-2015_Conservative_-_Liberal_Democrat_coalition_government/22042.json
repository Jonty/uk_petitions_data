        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like the UK Government to research and develop the field of Hydrogen Fuel Cell Power as a means of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThe H-Cell is able to convert hydrogen to energy while producing water as its only emission.  It is becoming a credible power source for cars.\r\n\r\nHowever we would like to see this technology developed in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe renewable energy industry is in its infancy, if the UK could take advantage of this emerging market we could be world leaders in just a few years\u2019 time.  This would greatly benefit the economy and help us, as a nation, to meet (and possibly exceed) our targets for the reduction of carbon emissions.",
