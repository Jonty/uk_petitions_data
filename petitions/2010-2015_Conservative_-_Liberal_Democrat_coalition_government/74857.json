        "additional_details": "On 4th February 2015 i was shocked to see how many of my Facebook friends' had shared  the picture saying \"February 4th, is World Cancer Day. I light this candle in honour of all cancer survivors, fighters and those who have lost their life to cancer. Share this to show your support\"  I'm sure many people know the image I'm talking about. And yet how sad, that we have 'World Cancer Day' as if its something great like Christmas or New Year...when really Cancer is the one thing that can single handedly ruin so many of our lives.\r\nFull body Cancer screening should be available on perhaps a 6/12monthly basis for EVERYONE. We shouldn't have to live on edge looking out for the signs and symptoms of cancer, we should be looking for ways to catch it early and stop it in its tracks!\r\nIt takes just 2 minutes to sign this petition...\r\nTogether we WILL beat cancer!
