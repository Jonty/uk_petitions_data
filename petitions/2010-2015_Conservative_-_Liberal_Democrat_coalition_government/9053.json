        "additional_details": "If my petition is successful the government should take immediate action to abolish the 3 line whip as a method of forcing MP's and Peers into voting one way or the other. Under the three line whip, a party member who votes against the whip may be punished by suspension or expulsion from the parliamentary party. Though it is perfectly acceptable for a party to issue advice for it's members on the official 'line', there should be no formal punishment for a representative standing by his or her beliefs and constituents as it is tantamount to coercion. We are granted freedom of speech, freedom of expression, freedom to vote for whom ever or in favour of what ever issue we want as members of a democracy without fear of reprisals. Why is this not true for our elected officials? Support freedom of speech for all, support accountability for our elected officials and support this petition.",
