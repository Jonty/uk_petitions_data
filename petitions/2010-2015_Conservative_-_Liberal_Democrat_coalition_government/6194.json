        "additional_details": "This is a petition asking the British government, as the government of a nuclear state, to take a central role in helping eradicate nuclear arms. The nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki must never be forgotten. Even to this day, this horrible event lingers as a reminder of just how devastating nuclear weapons are, and how we, as a nation, should help stop the monstrosity of nuclear arms before a global nuclear war. Nuclear energy should be used for peaceful purposes only, if we are to advance as a country, and if we are to advance globally, without the fear of nuclear war. ",
