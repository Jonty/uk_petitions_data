The UK populace was never consulted on the sale or indeed the same member's elevation to the position of First Lord of the Treasury. This petition requests that a statutory provision be introduced so that HM Government could seek to pursue the voters of Kirkcaldy for the aforementioned losses. In current calculations this would mean each voter be in line to discharge a sum of \u00a3473,629.01. ",
