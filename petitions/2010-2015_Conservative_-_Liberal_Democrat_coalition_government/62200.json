        "additional_details": "As David Cameron had said back in November during a visit to Sri Lanka during CHOGM \"Let me be very clear, if that investigation is not completed by March then I will use our position on the UN human rights council to work with the UN human rights commissioner and call for a full credible and independent international inquiry.\" and after seeing a very disappointing draft resolution alongside USA at the UNHRC, we would like to urge the British Government to use its position in the UNHRC to call for an international enquiry like they have requested.\r\n\r\nWith more and more shocking evidence being revealed and years have gone past since the devastating war which had left 1000s of innocent civilians dead during the final stages of it.\r\n\r\nThe tamils and other ethnic minorities of Sri Lanka should gain justice. The only way in which justice can be gained is with an International Independent Enquiry.",
