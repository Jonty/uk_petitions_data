This may ensure a fair and public hearing for the person they may be issued on and the people who want them issued.\r\nAt present the police are issuing fixed penalties, cautions and harassment warnings for claims that may be tenuous against the recipient and not enough for the complainant, thus denying both their rights to a fair and public hearing under the Human Rights Act 1998.\r\nWe therefore call for the UK Government to review fixed penalties, harassment warnings and other cautions, as they have done with ASBOs, to provide a way for both complainants and recipients to have a fair and public hearing, as is their right under the Human Rights Act 1998. This may include making greater use of the civil courts or similar tribunals.",
