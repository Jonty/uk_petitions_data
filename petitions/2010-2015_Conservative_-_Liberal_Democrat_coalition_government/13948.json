(These people are not in a position of authority to do this).\r\nThis Legislation is causing Pubs to close (My own has now closed).\r\nIt is also causing a nuisance to residents as smokers stand outside pubs making a noise and out of landlord control.\r\nIt also causes problems at government controlled building (colleges etc) as they are imposing a blanket ban on all the premises including the car parks. (Not as the legislation intended).\r\nOverall it is undemocratic and violates what should be personal freedoms.\r\nThere are also alternatives, \"Smoking Areas\" and \"Extraction\" etc that have not been considered before this ill conceived idea was introduced.",
