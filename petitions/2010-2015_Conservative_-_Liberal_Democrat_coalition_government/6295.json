        "additional_details": "We should build more prisons and actually give appropriate sentencing for serious offences!!\r\nIt is clear in the current economic climate, there is no funding available, so we should go into partnership with private sector manufacturing businesses and gain investment to build new prisons with a working manufacturing unit attached.\r\nThe prisoners could work, gain qualifications and maybe get a full time job after their sentence is complete.The business would benefit from a low cost Workforce, allowing them to compete.\r\nTake a look at America, it is not just number plates they make! The federal prison industry produces 100% of all military helmets, ammunition belts, bullet-proof vests, 93% of paints and paintbrushes; 36% of home appliances and much more!\r\nPlus points: 1 Courts can give out sentences for offences the public wants! 2 Economy boost to UK manufacturing industry! 3 Skills, education and reform for prisoners to reduce reoffending. Negative points: None!",
