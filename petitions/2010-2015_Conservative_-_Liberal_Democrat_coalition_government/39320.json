This could potentially lose millions of pounds for the economy over companies losing customers. It should be split fairly so every phone and every user gets the opportunity. I feel it is completely wrong that phone giants such as O2 and Vodafone should miss out. I therefore create an epetition to oppose Ofcoms decision and hand the frequencies to all companies instea of using it to gain money!",
