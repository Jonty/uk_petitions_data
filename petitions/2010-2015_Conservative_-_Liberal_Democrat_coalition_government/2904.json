        "action": "Vote to Raise Interest Rates and Stop QE",
        "additional_details": "The combination of quantitative easing and the record low interest rate of 0.5% set by the bank of england's monetary policy committee is allowing inflation to remain dangerously high (CPI is at approximately 4.5%-5%) whilst savers get neglible rates of interest on their savings/pensions etc. Combined these greatly reduce the spending power of UK citizens. They are further fuelling a dangerous speculative bubble and climate of malinvestment that hinders the efforts to rebalance the economy and keeps our economy tied in to the boom and bust cycle.\r\n\r\nWe call for the 4 members of the MPC appointed by the chancellor to vote at the next meeting to raise interest rates from their record low of 0.5% to 1% and to cut the quantitative easing program from \u00a3200bn to \u00a3100bn with a view to stop it entirely at the following meeting - they should also make the argument to the committees other members and encourage them to do the same.",
