He has harassed political organizations opposed to his and his governments policies. Moreover, his government has lied about us all being together in the economic sence of the big society. In addition to violating the Constitution by intervening in Libya also, he has damaged the people trust. Due to the severity of these crimes, we call for the immediate resignation of David Cameron.",
