        "additional_details": "Government ministers have absolutely no idea what the public wants or doesn't want and none of them have any interest in public opinion, anyway (that's what hubris syndrome is all about!) because none of them bother to attempt to find out. Many of the people I know profess that they suddenly feel like vomiting when they hear our dishonourables state such blatant untruths without blushing or being struck down by a bolt from the sky. There should be a log of those ministers who have used the term so that when the revolution comes there is every justification for immediate affirmative action against them for lying in a public office.",
