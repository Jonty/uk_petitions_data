For a few minutes on the phone to be told I should call 999 - this cost me around \u00a310.\r\n\r\nWhy are we paying for the service in this way? It should not be a service that only people with lots of disposable income can use and should be 0800 Freephone or at least 0300 local rate to allow more people to use the service. ",
