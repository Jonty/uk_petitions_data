And all of the Sure Starts in our Wirral area have been effected. The Sure start nurseries are a fantastic support in every area, giving support across the board, to any parent or carers.\r\n\r\nWhat do i want the Governement to do:\r\nYou have been recently talking about parents requiring flexability with new borns, young families etc. I have my own business and i dont have as much flexbility as i would like, but i know that Sure Start offer an amazing service and i would like to think that the budgets can be reviewed again to Save our Sure Start nurseries, that are the heart of supportive centres within the effected areas. Please help us SAVE OUR SURE START NURSERIES.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time in this matter.",
