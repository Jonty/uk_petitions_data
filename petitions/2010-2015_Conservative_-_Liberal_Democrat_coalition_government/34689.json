        "additional_details": "The Diamond Jubilee celebrations have clearly shown once again that given the opportunity the UK population embraces and celebrates the privilege of being British. They happily participate in events in sheer numbers that exceed predictions, regardless of the weather. The sad reality is that this only happens at a landmark event such as a jubilee or royal wedding.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call on the authorities to create an additonal bank holiday in June each year to be called Brittania Day. This day would not simply be another bank holiday to be seen as a day off work, but a day to celebrate Britain and Britishness. Let's roll out the bunting, have a street party, have a cavalry parade and a river pageant, showcase the Royal family, promote buying British for one day, bring tourists to Britain so they can see our teadition, pomp and pageantry. Let's have a concert full of British singers.\r\n\r\nIt's a great place to live, we know this, and we would like one dedicated day to allow us to show it",
