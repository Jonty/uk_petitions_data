The referendum question could be \u2018Should Scotland leave the UK to become an totally independent country of her own\u2019? The question at the referendum should be one direct ambiguous question about whether Scotland should leave the UK, requiring \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answers. This is because asking woolly questions, requiring woolly answers (like \u2018but\u2019, \u2018if\u2019, \u2018maybe\u2019, \u2018perhaps\u2019) would be open to wide interpretation and would be fudging the issue.",
