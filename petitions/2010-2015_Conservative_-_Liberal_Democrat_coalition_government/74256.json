        "additional_details": "\r\nThe NHS and the welfare system are seemingly continually chopped, changed and reordered after each General Election.\r\n\r\nNothing and nobody can thrive in a state of constant financial and political flux and it's getting tiring hearing the major political parties agree that the NHS needs help but failing to align on how, where and in what form that help should be given.\r\n\r\nThe NHS should be protected from being used as a political tool to garner votes in order to ensure that the best help, given by the best people, in the best facilities is there for anyone who can and needs to access the service.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that all major political parties should agree to back a 10 year plan, independently defined by the NHS and supported, regardless of whoever is in power, over that 10 year period.",
