        "additional_details": "When a child is fostered our someone has taken over guardianship of a vulnerable child they are often supported by the government through local councils, meanwhile the people who created these children do not have to pay a penny towards their upbringing. If Joe Bloggs has a child, splits up with his partner and doesn't work, the CSA take money out of benefits and if the dad works he has to give up 15% of his wage. Why does the same not apply to the above situation? It might put an end to all these people having kids and then putting them into foster care or guardianship, with no impact on their life whatsoever! I suggest a review of the system should take place and get some money back into the system from people who constantly suck the goodness out of society and hard working people. Thank you in anticipation. ",
