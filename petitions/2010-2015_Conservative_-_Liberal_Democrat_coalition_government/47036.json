        "additional_details": "UK Prisoners currently pay extortionate costs 4 phone calls.\r\nBT did reduce the cost of calls from prison payphones in England & Wales following a successful complaint issued to the regulator Ofcom in 2008.\r\nBut cost are still too high @ 10p/min to a landline.\r\nIt has been stated that maintaining communication between prisoners & their families benefits both them & society more generally.\r\nThe high cost of prison phone calls makes family contact much harder, even though family support is a lifeline for some prisoners & those who do keep in touch are less likely to reoffend.\r\nWe want prison telephone costs to fall in line with today\u2019s climate.\r\nMany prisoners family members are living on an already tight budget & on average prisoners pay is low.\r\nResearch suggests that prisoners are 6 times less likely to reoffend if they have a supportive family network to return to when they come out, and that almost 1/2 of people in prison lose contact with their families during their sentence.\r\n",
