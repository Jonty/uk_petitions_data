        "additional_details": "In the spending review of 2010, it was clearly stated that 'Sure Start services will be maintained in cash terms....'\r\nSince then there have been savage cuts and many closures. The Government may claim that they have passed the decision to local authorities, but they are not maintaining Sure Start services as they promised.\r\nAt a time when we are able to bail out banks and spend hundreds of millions of pounds on debt interest, how can it be that our Government is cutting the investment in the children of tomorrow? This can't be right and it should be stopped. Our Government should be an expression of our collective will and it should not be reducing the life chances of some of the neediest families in our country. Sign this petition and lets get funding for Sure Start services guaranteed.\r\n",
