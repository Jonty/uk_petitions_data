        "additional_details": "Many people are unaware that families of victims of murder have NO rights after a trial, other than to ask the Attorney General within 28 days to look at the sentence if it is too lenient.\r\nIf lies are told in the court or your loved one is blamed for His/Her death and the prosecution does nothing and allows your loved ones character to be assassinated by His/Her killer, you can do nothing. This is totally unfair, the killer can get legal aid and instruct a lawyer to help Him/Her to fight the conviction if they feel they were wronged.\r\nAs a victim I believe we should have the same rights as the offender and when we know things have gone wrong we should be able to fight it too with the help of legal aid and lawyers.\r\nAll we victims want is to have a fair justice system where we have the same rights as the defendants.\r\nJudges, Barristers, CPS, Police are fallible, but when they make mistakes it is us who serve the life sentence, not the perpetrators.",
