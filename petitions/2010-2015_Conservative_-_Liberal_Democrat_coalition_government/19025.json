        "additional_details": "I propose we support a reduction in the Age of Consent (sexual) to be more in line with our Scandinavian Neighbors, not only is crime relating to infringement of this law a lot less, but crime of a sexual nature is a lot less prolific as well. I also propose the age of consent for the purchase of pornography be reduced. Both to the Age of 15 in line with Germany and Denmark.\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to consider that someone can get married at 16, but can not view porn until they are 18.\r\n\r\nThe action this petition wants is an active change of the law to con inside with the above views.",
