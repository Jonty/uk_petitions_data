        "additional_details": "A National Insurance number is required to work in the UK.  It's common sense that, to work in a country you need an adequate grasp of the language.  This is not currently enforced and DWP spend a small fortune conducting interpreted interviews on behalf of HMRC\r\n\r\nIntroducing a fluency requirement would reduce the outlay for interpreters by DWP.  It would also ensure that the UK has a workforce with a common language - meaning that the workforce becomes more flexible and fitted to the needs of the UK.\r\n\r\nEnsuring that new migrant workers have the ability to speak this country's main language will also help with community cohesion, as people who can speak to each other can more easily be absorbed into communities,",
