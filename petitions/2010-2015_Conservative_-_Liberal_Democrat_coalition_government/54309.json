        "additional_details": "My e-petition is simple and distinctly different to the others on the website. The UK and other western military should only be mobilised if a unanimous UN resolution is obtained. We do not need a repeat of Iraq's supposed WMD fiasco in Syria,  the high cost in human  casualties due to misplaced artillery / missiles and, to be blunt, the high cost financially which no western country can really afford anymore. If they can then the various Western governments have been lying about how bad their respective economies have been the last 5 years.",
