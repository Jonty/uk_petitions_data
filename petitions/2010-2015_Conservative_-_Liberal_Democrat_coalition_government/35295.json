        "additional_details": "The current system of state payments for children is overly generous and ensures that parents do not need to assume financial responsibility for their children. A low income family with two children can expect to receive \u00a3130 per week from the state. Once you get to seven or eight children then the incentive to work vanishes. Immigrant and low income family birth rates are soaring. Limit State payments to two children. Exceptions for adoption and fostering of course",
