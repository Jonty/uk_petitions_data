        "additional_details": "currently, the govt and council guidelines advise to reject 'annual' exceptional leave to parents to take kids off - ie. govt advises schools to reject if requests become annual and of a recognisable pattern. but his adversely impacts the religious freedom of the religious minority migrants from other countries to celebrate religious ritual festivals with extended families and pilgrimage.\r\n1. please can the guidelines include that for above religious reason 5-10 days annual exceptional leave be approved?\r\n2. also the criteria that child's attendance is 95% to be eligible for exceptional leave is unfair. as illness is beyond anyone's control. so can this guideline be changed to '95% attendance excluding illnesses'.\r\n\r\n3. also the children who are high achievers, regular to school, study and achieve well and participate in all school activities and their parents are dedicated, should be allowed annual religious exceptional leave of upto 5-10 days.\r\n\r\n",
