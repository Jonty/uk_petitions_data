Just look on youtube and you'll see countless videos of the police abusing their authority and making false arrests and\r\nallegations. The police think they can say and do whatever they want because they're in a position of authority. It stops now. please sign if you're in favour of the government imposing stricter rules on what the police can and cant do. Thankyou.",
