        "additional_details": "Local authorities often use parking regulations primarily for revenue-raising rather than for any benefit to road users, and they enforce the payment of penalties by means of clamps and tow-away trucks. This is an abuse of power which brings the authorities into disrepute. Car clamping by local authorities should be illegal. And it should only be lawful for them to tow away a vehicle where they have evidence that it is causing danger or an obstruction.",
