        "additional_details": "I feel its time more councils across the country got the SIA trained officials aka \"Door Supervisors\" tested regularly aswell as getting more monitoring going on in towns and pubs to prevent these \"trained officials\" from taking part in illegal activities and actually making the public feel safe instead of being so imtimidating and getting away with it. There are too many door supervisors who are using illegal drugs as well as referring to themselfs as \"Above the Law\". there should be safety measures introduced to bring \"Going to the pub\" as enjoyable as it was a few years ago without the intimidation!",
