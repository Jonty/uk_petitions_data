        "additional_details": "There is a high number of unfair penalties being issued to disabled drivers because of non-display of blue badges, even if the badge has fallen from the dashboard and the vehicle is obviously used for disabled purposes.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the DVLA should issue Blue \"Disabled Vehicle Tax Discs\" as easily identifiable for parking purposes.\r\n\r\nDisabled vehicles supplied by the motability scheme already have disabled tax discs, but still require a blue badge for parking\r\n\r\nThis is doing the same job twice and costing needless money and manhours, as well as false penalties for the wrong reasons.\r\n\r\nI believe this would save on the number of false penalties, appeals and work by several departments of government, thuis saving money.\r\n\r\nThe blue badge scheme should be continued for non owner/driver disabled people.",
