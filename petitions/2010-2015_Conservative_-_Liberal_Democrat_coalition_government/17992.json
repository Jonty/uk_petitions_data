        "additional_details": "I think that parents should be able to give consent to confirm whether they're child can wear piercings, makeup, nail vanish or jewelry to school, and piercings close up during the day, this causes pain to re-pierce it and because some students touch it to remove/repierce it so often, it sometimes gets infected. I don't think the way you look should be a concern in school, things such as abstract hair colour, piercings etc should not be a problem, this is for the students that agree, or the parents that have to buy nail vanish remover, retainers for piercings, hair dye or specific shoes etc",
