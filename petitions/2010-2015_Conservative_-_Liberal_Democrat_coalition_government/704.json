It is a huge deterrent, as well as thoroughly discriminatory, for single people to have to pay anything up to 76% pp more of the listed fare for their accommodation.\r\nI would like the Government to litigate for all holiday accommodation to be based on single occupancy, so that additional occupants pay extra - say 75%.",
