It is only proper that in their old age - we return their love and be there for them when they need us the most.Home office has made it nearly impossible for dependant parents (who are not EU citizens) to join their adult tax-paying children in Britain.\r\n\r\nHence we appeal to the UK Home office to make its policies for sponsoring such parents less restrictive. In order to avoid misuse of the system - UK can introduce safeguards such as a)No access to public funds for parents b) Sponsoring British Citizen to be fully responsible for financially supporting parents (In Australia sponsoring children provide a $5000 bond c) Compulsary private medical insurance for 3-5 years so that there is no reliance on NHS for expensive treatment d) User charges to access NHS for non-emergency treatment.",
