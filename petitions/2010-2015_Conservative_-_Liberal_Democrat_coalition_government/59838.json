        "additional_details": "Joanna Lumley has worked tirelessly for 15 years to get this project off the ground, and the 'Garden Bridge' will finally open in 2018, bringing a stunning new landmark to the capital. An open space spanning the Thames, a place of relaxation and tranquility in the heart of the city, all because of one woman's vision. And she's a National Treasure - the least we can all do is name her dream after her.\r\n\r\nTherefore we propose that the official name of the new bridge be 'Lumley Bridge'.",
