I propose a set NMW just for night shift workers I propose night shift workers should always be \u00a32 ahead of set NMW rises.\r\nI also believe that we should receive a extra week in holiday pay to help regulate our bodies after sufficient damage to our natural body clocks. It is well documented in the medical world that night shift workers are more acceptable to mental illness, heart failure and strokes so why is it we get paid the the lowest wage in the country. The care and health industry need us desperately but we do not get rewarded for our commitment and the harm caused to our mental and physical state. It is time our hard work is recognised   ",
