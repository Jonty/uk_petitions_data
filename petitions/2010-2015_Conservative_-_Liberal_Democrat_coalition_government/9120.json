        "additional_details": "The policies that relate to minimum wage were underwritten and executed prior to the birth of the internet.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not about exploitation but seeing sense on how we can once again become a nation that has allowed itself to work alongside technology in the age of the internet and as an economy, start to grow.\r\n\r\nHelp us by signing my e-petition because I believe that this action will regenerate our economy. What we want is to be able to passing a bill that lowers the minimum wage to an acceptable market level.\r\n\r\nThe action should open doors for many employers to be able greater job opportunities and thus help the market find it's own value in today\u2019s economic climate.\r\n\r\nTo combat this, I suggest the current minimum wage rate be reduced in line with the real market value.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to educate on what makes business sense.\r\n",
