We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nThe BBC have demonstrated, over recent years, that it has been institutionally corrupt over its cover up of rampant highly paid child abusers and the unfettered remuneration of high level executives who have been encouraged by Trustees to write their own severance cheques, regardless of performance, which has later been proved to be complete failure, at all levels.  This is not evidence to support any opinion that the BBC is the right organisation to be given permission by the government to move from being an entertainment and media provider to being a political activitist, using money it has been provided with for the production of entertainment and media.  IT MUST BE PREVENTED FROM TAKING A STANCE ON THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM.  IF IT WISHES TO DO THAT THEN IT MUST BE PRIVATISED AND ALL LICENCE TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE REFUNDED THEIR MONEY.",
