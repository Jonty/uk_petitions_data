We may have a new baby we do not wish to disturb; we may be old or alone and afraid of opening the door to strangers.  It might just be the case that we don't want to take on board yet another American import!  On any other day of the year, demanding something with the threat of reprisals if no \"treat\" is forthcoming would result in a visit from the Police.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to introduce \"opt-in\" legislation so that householders who wish to receive trick or treaters should display a sign on their windows or doors.  Houses not displaying a sign should simply not be visited.  Ideally, groups of children should also be accompanied by a responsible adult.",
