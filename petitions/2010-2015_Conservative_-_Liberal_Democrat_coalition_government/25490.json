        "additional_details": "With the widening of motorways to four lanes across the country, the roads are still being choked by HGV type traffic.  We are now getting scenarios of three lorries abreast (on hills!) leaving only lane 4 for faster moving vehicles.  This is therefore still causing hold-ups for other motorists.  We the undersigned call upon the Government to enforce a weight limit of any third lane of a four lane motorway to a maximum of 7.5 tonnes.",
