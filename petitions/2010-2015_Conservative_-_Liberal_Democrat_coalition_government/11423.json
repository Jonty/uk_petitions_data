        "additional_details": "At times when oil prices are falling, petrol companies always seem to have a reason why they don't bring down forecourt petrol prices for consumers.\r\nUsually we're told that the petrol companies have pre-bought oil at high prices, so price drops at the forecourt get delayed or more often than not don't happen.\r\nSince April to today (August 13th 2011) the price of crude oil has dropped 18%, yet the price of unleaded petrol has increased 1.8%.\r\nHow is this fair, ethical or legal?\r\nI want to see the law changed so that petrol companies are forced to drop forecourt petrol prices in line with and linked to the % drop of crude oil.\r\nI.e. Once crude oil drops by more than 2%, consumers see forecourt petrol prices drop by the same percentage.",
