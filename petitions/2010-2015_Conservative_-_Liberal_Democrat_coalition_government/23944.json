To overhaul these rights will undermine what has been done by previous generations we must not permit this change it will give to much ground to employers to abuse and misuse authority.  The one year period is already long enough for employees to attain the right to go to tribunal if unlawfully dismissed it would make sense to shorten the period not to prolong it to 2 years sign for your rights in the work place.",
