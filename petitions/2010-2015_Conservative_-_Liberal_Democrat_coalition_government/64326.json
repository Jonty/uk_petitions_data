        "additional_details": "High-unwarranted bonuses are regularly passed at AGMs of public limited companies by virtue of large blocks of proxy votes from other plc boards. Of course reciprocal voting occurs and as a result the gap between the highest and lowest paid in the UK is perpetuated. For example, the bonus pools for banks can be measured in billions of pounds, with individuals awarding themselves amounts that can be measured in tens of millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nThis is undesirable for a harmonious society.\r\n\r\nTo stop this, this petition proposes that, blocks of proxy votes for the purposes of remuneration (salary, bonuses, benefits, rewards) should be unlawful.\r\n",
