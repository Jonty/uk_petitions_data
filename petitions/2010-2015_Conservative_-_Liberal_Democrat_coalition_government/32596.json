Reduce the cuts in social benefits and public services, reduce vat and taxes slightly to enable people to go out and spend boosting the economy, and most importantly for all MP's, Cabinet Ministers, The Speaker and the PM to take a wage cut as they do little to justify the salary they get. They go on and on about making cuts here and there to make savings, when not once have they said they'll take a cut in salary. The government say that people that are on the dole, in particular JSA require \u00a353.45 or whatever it was, increasing to just over \u00a356 in April a week to live off, I for one would like to see these politicians try and live on this amount for a month or two and see how they survive.
