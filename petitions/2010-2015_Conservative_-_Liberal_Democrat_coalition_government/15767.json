        "additional_details": "The NHS spends an enormity of resources and funding on patients who have been binge-drinking or abusing of substances and feel they can do this without any consequences to their actions. I would like to call on the Government to address issues of social responsibility in our health system by imposing charges or fees to those patients who require hospital services when under the influence. These fees could go into reinvesting in our health system in a proactive manner to reduce waiting times and concentrate more on providing a national, universal quality of service to the unhealthy. We must stop accepting the alcohol problem in this country as a cultural trait and cuddling the irresponsible, they are abusing the system and taking up resources that should go to people who really need it. Make a hangover really hurt where it hurts most, the wallet- which will be less full so that they can't go out and be under the influence as often as they like and end up in our hospitals again.",
