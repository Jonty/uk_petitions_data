        "additional_details": "The way insurance companies are run should be investigated to make things fairer for the consumer.\r\n\r\nInsurance companies make it more and more expensive to insure your car/home/possessions etc, and when it comes to coughing up the money they try everything to get out of paying the money or delaying paying. The fact that these companies are making huge profits year on year surely suggests justice isn't being done.\r\n\r\nI read today about a couple who couldn't insure their home as it was too old. What would happen to their mortgage if they couldn't get insured? What would happen if their house burned down?\r\n\r\nShould insurance companies be allowed to choose not to insure people / cars / buildings? Should insurance companies be government run? As its such a profitable venture this could help the settle the debts of our country. All questions that need to be raised and more.\r\n\r\n",
