        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that because of devolution in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the democratic process in the UK is unbalanced. In order to repair this we propose that a National Assembly for England is established, and that all four national governments have equal powers. And that in order to keep the United Kingdom together Parliament passes a Statute describing the UK as a \"Federation\" and describes what powers will be held by the national governments in each of the home nations, and which powers are held by the UK government.",
