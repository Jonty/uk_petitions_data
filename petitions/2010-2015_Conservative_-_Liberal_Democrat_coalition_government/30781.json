At present if a person continues to work their allowances are automatiaclly deducted in excess of \u00a32000 (for a man).\r\nIn view of the fact that he or she has worked and paid taxes all their life, surely they should be eligble for the full tax allowance. Instead they are penalised. This obviously disincentivies people and could be a source of people claiming additional benefits!\r\nThis needs changing by the government.",
