Statistics and data can be very misinterpreted and money spent in areas which wont challenge the problems young people face.\r\n\r\nA set of young people from diverse communities need to deliver ideas and create action plans to tackle the rise in drugs, drink and underage sex.\r\n\r\nOnly people from such generations, in areas where this takes place can fully understand where society is failing.\r\n\r\n<--The Solution-->\r\nThe petition involves setting up quarterly meetings with people from around all areas of the UK, and then sending its findings to the government to discuss.",
