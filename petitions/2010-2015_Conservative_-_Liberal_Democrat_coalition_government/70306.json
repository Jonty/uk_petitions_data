Most people earning over their allowance, pay 20% tax on earnings up to just over \u00a331000, and above that figure, pay 40% up to \u00a3150000. We should be pqying 20% up to \u00a340,000, 40% up to \u00a375000, 50% up to \u00a3150,000, and 75% above that figure.  Most people are in tbis country because the tax system here is better than elsewhere, and there is not a better system elsewhere, even at the suggested tax levels above. Let the better off pay their fair share, and bring in the above tax rates!",
