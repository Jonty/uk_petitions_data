He was pandering to public opinion when he sacked this high level employee, when he could reasonably have been expected to know of the labour laws covering unfair dismissal.  He chose, for political gain, to ignore those laws and acted illegally anyway, relying upon the complacency of future governments to protect him.  Taxpayers have a human right to be protected from the consequences of criminal, illegal acts committed by elected politicians who have NEVER been authorised to commit crimes on behalf of the electorate of this country.",
