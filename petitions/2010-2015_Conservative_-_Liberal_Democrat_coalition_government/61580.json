With the new data sharing system, data will be extracted from our GP systems which will include family history, vaccinations, referrals for treatments, diagnoses and prescription information. Additionally our personal confidential data identifiers will also be extracted which include our date of birth, post code, NHS patient number and gender. So just ask yourself the question, would you trust a company that has such disregard for people who have disabilities?. I for one simply can not. ",
