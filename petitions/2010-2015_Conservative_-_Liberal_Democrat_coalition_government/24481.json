Is that not my job as a parent?\r\n\r\nThis 'country' is going too far and we have to draw the line somewhere and its here!\r\n\r\nI, and those signing this petition are not asking for a right, we're saying it is our right to collect memories of an electronic or any other kind and those who abuse that right should be punished for the abuse severely.  Its not for me to suffer, its for those who irresponcible, and not in Community service or months in prision, it should be a year in Solitary Confinment for every minute of film from start to finish for every film.",
