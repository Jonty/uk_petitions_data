        "additional_details": "In September 2013 a Beautician was found guilty of performing illegal tooth whitening. Her fine for this crime was \u00a3350.\r\nThis petition is to set a minimum fine for performing illegal tooth whitening as the fine imposed in this case would not discourage this activity as the profits involved would more than cover the imposed fine. The suggested minimum fine would be \u00a310000.\r\nThe aim of this petition is to discourage non dental professionals from carrying out potentially damaging tooth whitening on the public.",
