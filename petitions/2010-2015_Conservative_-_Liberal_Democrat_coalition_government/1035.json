        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, are concerned about the ongoing crisis at the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan. Germany, Italy and Switzerland have all decided to reject nuclear power. Germany's decision to exit nuclear power is based on a plan to use combined heat and power technology until enough renewable energy infrastructure is in place to provide for a truly sustainable future. We call on the UK government to follow Germany's lead by abandoning plans for ten new nuclear reactors in the UK and making arrangements to shut down all existing UK nuclear power stations as soon as possible.",
