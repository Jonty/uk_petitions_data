Some people have been having trouble paying off extortionate credit card bills but have never defaulted on their mortgage . A default against a credit card means banks are not giving the best new rate on a new mortgage deal when a fixed rate comes to an end and this is causing people to lose their homes and not be able to pay. This is so wrong and needs to be changed.",
