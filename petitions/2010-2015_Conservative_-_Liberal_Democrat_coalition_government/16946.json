        "additional_details": "Retirement age is being raised. This is unfair to those having worked their life thinking they retire at  60/65. Their minds and bodies are weary.\r\nThere are replacements waiting - many young adults  collecting  job seekers allowance want to work for their future. Many others are  idle and want benefits  to support a lazy lifestyle, an attitude seeping into future generations. There needs to remain a constant stream of youth into the workforce with the older ones retiring.\r\n  I want the government to lower the retirement age to 58 and replace retirees with those claiming job seekers  benefits. It needs to be on an apprenticeship like basis so a  transfer of skills occurs. The younger employee learns the olders skills but brings in more modern skills too.\r\nThe apprentice receives the job seekers  payment whilst on the skill transfer only.  ",
