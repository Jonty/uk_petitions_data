This is WRONG!\r\n\r\nUsing sun protection products is a necessity, and therefore should attract a much lower rate of VAT - preferably zero rated or exempt.\r\n\r\nBy reducing the cost of these expensive products, more people could afford to use them, which in turn would reduce the chances of skin cancer, and save the taxpayer money by avoiding NHS treatment.\r\n\r\nPrevention is always cheaper than cure!",
