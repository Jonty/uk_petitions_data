To provide a non judgmental forum through which victims of sexual abuse can submit testimony in person or by other means to enable their voices to be heard and the harm they suffered acknowledged and responded to.\r\n\r\n2. To evaluate the damage caused to victims of sexual abuse over their lifetime, and to quantify its true cost to individuals and to our society.\r\n\r\n3. To develop and effect the delivery of comprehensive therapeutic intervention and support programme that will enable victims to reach a nationally recognised and measurable standard for recovery.\r\n   ",
