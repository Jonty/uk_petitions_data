        "additional_details": "As has been revealed by recent scandals, some MPs have been severely abusing the power given to them by voters.\r\n\r\nThis clearly shows that MPs need to be far more  accountable to the people who vote for them, so that they are forced to act in the interests of those they represent, and not only in their own interests.\r\n\r\nSo we the undersigned, demand that the government introduces a recall system for MPs, which would mean that if 20% of people eligible to vote in a constituency signed a petition, a by-election would be held in that constituency, allowing the people to decide if they wanted to continue to be represented by the same MP",
