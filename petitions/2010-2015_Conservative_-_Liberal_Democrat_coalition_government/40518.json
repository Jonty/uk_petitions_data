I emailed Downing Street and received a reply a couple of weeks later from Nick Harvey on Government letter headed paper. He said \"I can assure you as stated in the House, that there will be NO LOSS OF INFANTRY BATTALIONS, and that P.M. David Cameron had explicitly stated that no Infantry Battalions would be lost, axed or merged.\"  Now in the past few months in Scotland alone The Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders were to be reduced to ceremonial duties (tin soldiers basically) and yesterday the announcement that 2nd Battalion RRF were to be axed.  Enough, this MUST BE STOPPED NOW PLEASE HELP OUR HEROES BY SIGNING THIS PETITION  Thank you.  A Serving Infantry Soldier's Mother",
