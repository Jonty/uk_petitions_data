        "action": "No publicly-funded funeral for Baroness Thatcher",
        "additional_details": "We demand that no public funds are used to meet the costs of Margaret Thatcher's funeral. The huge raft of spending cuts undertaken by the government clearly demonstrates that public finances are stretched to the limit and we cannot afford to pay any of the costs associated with her funeral.\r\n\r\nIt should also be taken into account that Baroness Thatcher was a public figure who divided the nation, and to accord her the same level of funeral as the Queen Mother and Princess Diana would be hugely insensitive to those millions who suffered as a direct result of the policies which her successive governments implemented in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nWe request that all of the costs for her funeral with full military honours are borne by her family and by private individuals - this includes the cost of policing for the funeral procession and the cost of diverting our armed forces from their duties to attend the funeral.",
