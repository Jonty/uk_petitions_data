So why dilute our language with Americanism and slang? Why sensationalise issues of little merit and ignore subjects of importance? Why not use our media to educate people, not only in terms of information, but in language.\r\n\r\nWe want the media to be held up as an example of how our language can be beautiful. We want our media to be impervious to criticism, not because they are too powerful, but because they are right. We want our newspapers to write the date the British way and keep the u in colour!\r\n",
