All families have a right to a family life without interference from a Public Authority.\r\nThe fines are an extra stealth tax on hardworking  middle income families who are increasingly finding it harder for both parents to get time off at the same time in school holidays due the downsizing of workforces in the harsh economic climate.\r\nThe DFE states there is evidence that proves taking children out of school is disruptive to education. They are disregarding the learning and education benefits often gained from holidays. ",
