        "additional_details": "With the UK Government putting in \u00a3530m into the broadband fund suppliers should be forced to charge customers based on the speed they deliver.\r\n\r\nCurrently major suppliers advertise up to 20Mbps if the deliver less then the monthly fee should be pro rata. I live in a city in the UK and get less than 1Mbps. as such only 1 person at a time can use it and iplayer (I wished).\r\n\r\nI understand the concept of paying for what you use but should I pay for what others use. My morals say paying tax allows the government to help those who can not help themselves, but broadband does not come into that category.",
