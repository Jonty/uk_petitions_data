They are undemocratic and unjust and the current economic crisis which began in the US resulted directly from them.\r\n\r\nNo one is immune from this system and the IMF and World Bank embody it as well\r\n\r\nHM govt like most is enormously in debt and the US debt is the biggest the world has ever known.\r\n\r\nHM govt has a sovereign duty to free itself and our people from this failed, corrupt and outworn system, to hand us back our rights and free us of enslavement to the banks and financiers who wrongfully control us.\r\n\r\nPetition wrongly rejected as duplicate\r\n\r\n1   Often more than one petition on the site about the same issue\r\n\r\n2   It addresses issue in different, comprehensive and clear way\r\n\r\n3   Issue is vital and needs to be addressed  from more than one angle\r\n\r\nAs such not a duplicate ",
