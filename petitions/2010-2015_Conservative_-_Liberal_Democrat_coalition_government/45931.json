        "additional_details": "The NHS culture needs to change we all know it and we all hear it from the recent Francis public enquiry. It will only change if individuals look themselves in the mirror and change. Bullying is rife, yes, but for staff to accept it and do what they are told when they know it is wrong or think it may be wrong, is a large part of the problem. The culture will change by those of us doing what is right and keep doing it and saying no when needed and pointing out what is right when needed, that wil become fashionable I would like to start a revolution from the bottom up but it will take too long and patients will continue to suffer harms.  Whilst we progress, let's look at more serious levels of responsibility and of real accountability, quickly.  If someone dies as a result of harm, make it manslaughter, open and transparanet - that will change the attitudes of those that need to change.",
