        "additional_details": "I am starting this petition to try and get a bridge from the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland so that people are able to drive there. Northern Ireland is a part of the UK and I feel we should try and make more effort towards them. I have emailed the prime minister before now requesting this and I have been referred to the department of Transport multiple times with no response so I have resorted to a public vote.",
