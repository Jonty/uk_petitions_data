        "additional_details": "Sheffield is slowly but surely losing most of its sporting venues. Such as the plans for the new Don Valley Stadium have basically been thrown out and plans for a school to be built there is unacceptable. Sheffield is losing its capability to host events such as the student games and the like. With careful planning and development, ski village could be turned into something for teenagers and families alike to enjoy and have fun at. Also the development of the quite large snow dome for ski village would mean that people from our city would no longer have to travel to other cities and areas of the country to enjoy winter sports. Also this would boost, if done correctly, Sheffield's tourist numbers. The government must consider building such a venue to prevent sheffield losing all it's sporting abilities. ",
