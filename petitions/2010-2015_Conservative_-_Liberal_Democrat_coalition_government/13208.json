        "additional_details": "MP's get too much paid holiday and far too generous allowances and expenses. It is time for MP's to lead by example and to work within the same rules as the working masses. Most businesses do not allow employees to be away from work for more than two weeks at a time in order to continue to be able to provide a service to the public.However, our parliament has a summer recess in excess of 3 months. During the riots our political leaders were all on holiday. Not one politician deemed the unrest serious enough to come home on Sunday. Only when pressure mounted was parliament recalled - for one day. The tax payer will foot the bill for MP's coming back to London and then recommencing their holidays. I propose that MP's leave, pensions, sickness pay, allowances, fees are bought in line with the terms and conditions of those imposed on public sector workers in for example Hertfordshire. ",
