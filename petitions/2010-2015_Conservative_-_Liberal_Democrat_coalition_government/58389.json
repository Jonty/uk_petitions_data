        "additional_details": "At this time the POLICE traffic units fail to get to grips with: Boy racers who cause NOISE by fitting large bore EXHAUSTS which do nothing except cause noise issues, 74db, it is an offence to make a car louder than first produced, a section 59 which is an ASBO and then crushed should be enforced, there are insurance issues as a number would void there insurance on none legal changes, lighting is another with the law saying only white at the front and red rear with amber turning, Mobile phones are another with more and more doing it.\r\n\r\nThe FINES are not high enough to hurt peoples pockets and need to be raised even more with the police dealing with the above in a more strict way, make our roads safer and give piece and quiet back to the people.\r\n\r\nThanks",
