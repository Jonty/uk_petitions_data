        "additional_details": "I start the year to stories of how the government has capped rail fare increases only to find south west trains have increased car parking charges by 20% in the past year.\r\n\r\nStation car parks are a monopoly and are being exploited by train companies to extract money from commuters who have no right of reply.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to regulate price rises for car parking at stations in the same way rail fairs are regulated. Prices should not be allowed to increase faster than inflation.\r\n\r\nCommuters have had enough of funding train company profits through the back door.  F you agree please publicise this petition.",
