Without this, we spend our lives in a constant search for happiness, when happiness is found in the momentary experiential knowledge that we are always connected to everything, and we are nothing without everything (Everything is equally reliant on everything else to exist)\r\n\r\nThese basic principles are vital for growth in the areas of self-government, true civility, logic and love. With them, we no longer need the current institutions attempting to create, or force, civility; government, law and money.\r\n\r\nThank you, and love to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
