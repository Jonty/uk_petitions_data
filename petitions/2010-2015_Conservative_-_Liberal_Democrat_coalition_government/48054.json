        "additional_details": "By Increasing the legal minimum on the UK motorway network to 200mph, we would cut congestion, decrease journey times, and increase tax revenue from the extra fuel duty needed to maintain 200+ mph speeds. With less vehicles on the road the accident rate would fall, leaving medical services less stressed, and increase sales of hypercars from the small companies that make them, helping the job market too.",
