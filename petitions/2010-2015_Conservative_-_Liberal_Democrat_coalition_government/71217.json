        "additional_details": "I believe as a country we are not doing enough to ensure the public are informed on the dangers of swimming in open water. It is not an age related issue as very young children have lost their lives along with many old people. My son lost his life in open water he was a very fit and capable swimmer like so many others whom have also lost their lives in this way., Since my son lost his life I have been in many schools trying to spread awareness. I am ALWAYS shocked at the lack of knowledge from both students and teachers.(People can only know what they have been taught) Dying in outside water is the 2nd cause of accidental death in the UK  after Road Traffic Accidents. I am asking for warning adverts to be  shown age related. In  Memory of my son Dylan and in the memory of so many others that have been taken to soon in this way. ",
