They would of beheaded him and made a public display! David Cameron should also face charges for sending our troops their and telling them to fight! That is mass murder on a major scale! He should also be sacked for gross misconduct! When public services are being stretched to the max and budgets are being cut! But yet we still provide foreign aid! We all suffer pay freezes when they demand above inflation pay rises! No longer should we be silent! Stand up & be heard!",
