        "additional_details": "It has already been suggested that 'flexible' paternity leave could give men time off work if the mother chooses to return to work. However, I believe that men should have paternity leave in their own right. There are many ways to do this, such as the shared leave model used in Sweden whereby parents can share parental leave. I request that this issue be discussed.",
