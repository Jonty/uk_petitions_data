        "additional_details": "There should be a law which make it illegal to park either on or partly on the pavement. This is a growing problem and the police appear to turn a blind eye.  Possibly because of the paperwork involved. The arrogance and disregard for People with disabilities and Parents with prams are particularly at risk when having to step into the road in order to side-step a blocked walkway.  It should also be an offence to park where the kerb drops drown and white lines are painted for wheelchair user, mobility scooters and parents with prams.  Mobility scooter riders have to rely on these areas where the kerb drops drown.  If it is blocked, the scooter rider has to search for a place where they can safely cross.  Fines and other measures for those who continually abuse the rules should be implemented.\r\nPlease support this petition.",
