        "additional_details": "Whereas the Speaker John Bercow has on 20/02/2013 at Vilnius University, and on 29/05/2013 at the Romanian Parliament, and on numerous other occasions broken his oath of office, and parliamentary convention to remain neutral and impartial by publicly commenting on political and highly contentious matters; and\r\n\r\nwhereas it has become apparent that he is incapable of remaining impartial and neutral in public as required to do so in his role, and cares more for his own self image, ego and political agenda than to uphold his duty as Speaker; and\r\n\r\nwhereas he is abusing his office, acting dishonourably, and has been misusing taxpayers money to fund his jet-setter lifestyle, while ordinary people suffer; and\r\n\r\nWhereas it is not the role or duty of the Speaker to dictate or suggest how British people should or will vote.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it noted that\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned\r\n\r\ncall for the Speaker to resign or be removed from his position forcefully by the will of the people.",
