        "additional_details": "Customers of insurance policies should not be charged interest on periodic (monthly/quarterly) payment plans as they are NOT loans.  They are paid up front whether that be for a month or a year.\r\n\r\nMany insurance companies are charging around 20% APR for direct debit payments of their insurance policies as many households find a single payment onerous.\r\n\r\nInsurance policies are mandatory requirements for the majority of home and car owners.  Policies are often reviewed and renewed annually and a contract agreed to.\r\n\r\nHowever, insurance policies are pro rata paid over days or months as can be seen by the repayment of the policy fees in the event of a cancellation.\r\n\r\nThe practice of charging any level APR for a service (coverage for the future) that has not been yet provided should be banned.\r\n",
