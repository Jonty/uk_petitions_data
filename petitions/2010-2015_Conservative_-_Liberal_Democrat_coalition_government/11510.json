        "additional_details": "Most people don\u2019t realise the huge disparity between extortionate legal fees and the very low compensation awarded to victims of accident or negligence, and other cases. The electorate would be outraged if the government published a list of cases with the compensation awarded and legal fees paid to lawyers on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe government should take all necessary steps to protect the vulnerable while significantly reducing legal aid payments.\r\n\r\nIt could start by requiring the National Health Service and other government bodies to honestly admit liability and pay compensation on a set scale to avoid recourse to the courts.  Enough case law exists, built up over decades, to generate a scale of compensation and/or formulae very easily.\r\n",
