        "additional_details": "The British Armed Forces are the envy of many a great nation. For centuries they have served with distinction where ever they have been ordered to go. They have indeed protected our rights, civil liberties and general freedom on multiple occasions. However the government has never really supported the MoD, not fully; they have not listened to the military commanders and have demanded more than could realistically be delivered due to operational constraints. In years to come, the Armed Forces may not be strong enough to protect the United Kingdom in it's hour of need.\r\n\r\nWe therefore require that the Armed Forces be spared cuts and indeed that more money is invested in increasing numbers and capability so that Britain may truly be safe from anyone who would do her harm.
