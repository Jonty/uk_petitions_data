        "additional_details": "The BBC is a politically biased organisation funded entirely by the general public. It doesn't matter if you agree with their \"message\", if you own a television you have to pay. Those who do not pay for a television licence are visited, and their premises searched for a television. If a television is found they are prosecuted, and many are jailed as a result. We demand that the BBC becomes self reliant, in the same way as other media and broadcasting companies. Let them be forced to compete for their funds by delivering programs good enough to attract advertisers. We the undersigned want to see a completely independent network of television broadcasters, and an end to the imprisonment of those who refuse to pay for their own enforced political indoctrination by the liberal elite.",
