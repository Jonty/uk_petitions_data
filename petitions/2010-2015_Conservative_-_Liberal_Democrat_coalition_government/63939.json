        "additional_details": "On 26th March 2014 the EU banned the import of Alphonso mangoes from May 2014. The Government MUST lift the ban in the interests of consumers and the UK economy.\r\n\r\nThe ban is due to a fruit fly found in less than 5% of all imports from India. It is NOT hazardous to human health in any way. The EU has declared that there is a just a possible but UNPROVEN impact on agriculture. The ban is excessively severe and a  disproportionate step.\r\n\r\nThe UK has a huge market for Alphonso mangoes.. The ban will severely impact importers and distributors in the UK and for some it will render their entire trade unfeasible. For many growers and exporters in India the ban means the end of their business. Growing for the season has commenced and so vast quantities of mangoes will be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe ban has been undertaken hastily. Proven treatments have not been considered before an outright ban (eg hot water treatment, irradiation which is approved for import into the USA and vapour heat treatments).",
