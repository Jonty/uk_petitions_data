        "additional_details": "I would like the government to make career level and skilled jobs available for those who dont want to go to university. Make apprentiships more available for young women, (not every woman wants to work behind a desk), bring back specialist colleges such as teaching and nursing. There are more options it seems for men as apprentices but a clear lack for women. As a 19 year old female with good A-levels but no desire to go to university and rack up a debt, but a wish to be successfull and start my working life at my age. Its impossible to do this the way things currently are. If university is not an option financially or for home circumstances, there is no where to go to train elsewhere for skilled work. Its as though my future is gone before i had a chance to start it. We need to see specialists colleges back to give us a chance to earn a skill without having to go to university. Help us young people, we are the future, help us succeed, dont hold us back.",
