        "additional_details": "The house of commons should instruct the Treasury to launch a review into which areas of tax reduction would be most beneficial to economic growth and which areas of spending could be cut with the least harmful effects - then the Treasury and the Chancelllor should make spending and tax plans based on these findings in 2012's budget.\r\n\r\nAreas that should be considered include, but are not limited to, National Insurance - which stops businesses from hiring staff - Corporation Tax - which discourages global businesses basing here and so costs jobs and other economic benefits - and the 50% tax rate - which a study by the taxpayers' alliance has found makes no net difference to treasury revenues and damages the competiveness of British firms\r\n\r\nIf you want lower taxes and spending to increase wealth without burdening future generations with debt then sign this petition.",
