It was in fact a move against criminals as all who lived there survived on the proceeds of crime.I was a victim who made many complaints,even polce were afraid of entering these areas.How do the unemployed and homeless afford an air ticket to uk onless with the proceeds of crime.It is thus the UK became Zimbabwes penal colony.These people are a drain on social services and should be repatriated",
