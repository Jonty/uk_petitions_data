        "additional_details": "I would like to create this petition to give Police the power to use Rubber Bullets,Tear gas,Water cannons or any Other \"weapon\" to fight against Heavy Rioting when it arises.\r\n\r\nDuring the Current (09/08/11) London Riots all the police can so is use Shield and Baton,Mounted section and Dog section to push back the crowds,Although this is useful in smaller situations On this scale it is useless.1 Water cannon can control many more \"rioters\" than multiple police officers.\r\n\r\nAlso the use of tear gas and Rubber Bullets (or at least the fear of usage of them) will clear a lot of the loiterers/opportunists making life a lot easier for the Police.\r\n\r\n",
