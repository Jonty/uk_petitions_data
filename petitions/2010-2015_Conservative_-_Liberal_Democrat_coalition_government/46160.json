        "additional_details": "This Park is a wonderful place for dog walkers and families to visit, but its use is being threatened by the local university as it is planning on taking over the car park for dual use for their facilities. This will mean that there will be a higher demand for uses of the spaces, and with the university only planning on adding 11 spaces it will not prove to accommodate for the increase in use.\r\n\r\nThe people that use the carpark already have to fight for spaces with UEA students at present when the parking sign says \"This car park is provided to visitors of Earlham park\"\r\n\r\nWith this it is also likely for the parks cafe to suffer as if no one can park due to UEA students it will not be possible for any of the cafes customers who do not live locally to be able to get to the park let alone the cafe.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to protect this parks car park and small local businesses.",
