Odds are identical.\r\n\r\nCurrently\r\nOutgoings - 104, return - 10, - loss 94 pounds.\r\nProposed\r\nOutgoings - 208, return - 25, - loss 183 pounds.\r\ndifference - 99 pounds.\r\n\r\nWhilst the price increases by 150 percent, the odds remain the same, as does the likely win ratio.\r\n\r\nHow many people can afford to lose an extra 99 pounds a year?\r\n\r\nOne draw - one pound, once a week, live BBC at 8pm, not after Strictly or Merlin.. Scrap all the other games which have National lottery branding.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
