        "additional_details": "Danger Mouse is a fundamental part of our heritage. He represents everything great about being English and is the forebearer of every great cartoon whose humour operates on different levels. Loved by adults and children alike.\r\n\r\nHe needs no reboot, no new characters or change in voice actors. To do so is to crush the last bastion of English traditions. If he'd existed in the 60's then The Kinks would have sang about him. Where James Bond has been whored out globally and changed with the times his mousy peer need not bow to such pressures.\r\n\r\nI urge you to vote for this to be discussed in Parliament before it is too late.\r\n\r\nLet the Scots reclaim their country, but let the English keep their Danger Mouse. Untarnished, unsullied and unchanged, because he's the greatest and wherever there is trouble he will be there!!!!!",
