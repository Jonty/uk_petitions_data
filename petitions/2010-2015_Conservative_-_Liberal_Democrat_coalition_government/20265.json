        "additional_details": "Womble was trading on the A34 for 2months before being moved on, because of a technical error. His licence was for the county of Winchester but the layby fell under the council of Basingstoke. Though applying for a licence from them he has been told they do not give them out, hence the petition.\r\n\r\nAll enjoyed his food and banter, and in keeping the layby clear of rubbish he was doing a service to the community.One such customer was a 81 yr old man who a few months earlier he had resuscitated.\r\n\r\nWomble loves being around people and loved his layby proud to be doing a service with out ripping off the public.",
