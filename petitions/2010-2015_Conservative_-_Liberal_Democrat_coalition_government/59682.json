        "additional_details": "Many payments awarded by employment tribunals go unpaid by employers because they are not enforceable by law. The government has changed employment law to charge claimants wishing to pursue claims at employment tribunals. How can it be fair and just to charge people for a service that can pass a judgement that can be blatantly ignored? The government have deliberately ignored the fact that many awards go unpaid. It is time that the government made the change that is required and made the awards of employment tribunals enforceable by law.",
