        "additional_details": "Institute an embargo on the sale or lease of vessels and maritime equipment to the Australian Government and its agents until the Australian government ceases Operation Sovereign Borders and the mandatory detention of asylum seekers.\r\n\r\nThe vessel RV Triton has been used to carry out \u2018tow-backs\u2019 of vessels carrying asylum seekers. The asylum seekers are placed on an underpowered life raft and towed into Indonesian waters, then cast off, placing them at great risk of injury or death.\r\n\r\nRV Triton can be seen conducting a \u2018tow-back\u2019 in this video: http://goo.gl/k4BNbU\r\n\r\nRV Triton and ACV Ashmore Guardian are leased to Australia by the UK company Gardline. Under the embargo, this lease would be cancelled with compensation to Gardline. The UK should not provide the Australian government with equipment which enables violations of international law and abrogation of its responsibilities under the Refugee Convention.",
