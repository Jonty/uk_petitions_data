This unfortunate reality has persisted long enough in the absence of an accordingly strong disincentive for such this reckless and selfish behaviour. We want this government to take the above action and impose a suitably stiff penalty for this disregard for the safety of others. Namely: fixed penalty of \u00a3500 and 6 points on driver's license.",
