        "additional_details": "I want the government to help the ban of international football friendlies during club seasons. This is becoming a rather alarming issue for football fans as their best players are constantly becoming injured during these matches. I also reflects badly on the national team as club managers sometimes do not wish for their players to play in these friendlies therefore some players do not wish to represent their country.",
