        "additional_details": "Create equality and fairness within the field of child maintenance by:\r\n\r\na) recognising shared parenting by changing the current calculation from 1/7 reduction to 1/3.5 reduction such that 50/50 care results in no maintenance being paid.\r\n\r\nb) introduce accountability so that the parent with care has to prove where the maintenance is being spent, or introduce a voucher system limiting the use of child maintenance payments.\r\n\r\nc) take steps to prevent the parent with care making vexacious approaches to the CSA in order to cause distress to the NRP\r\n\r\nd) positively recognise those NRPs who are correctly contributing child maintenance rather than have a system that alienates NRPs regardless. Let the system focus on those who are not upholding their responsibilities.\r\n\r\ne) make child maintenance payments tax deductable for the NRP and taxable income for the parent with care.",
