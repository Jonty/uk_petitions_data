        "additional_details": "The police may take a person's mobile phone for evidence or inquiry. However, there seems to be no law or restriction on how long they can hold the phone. Even as a victim of crime a person's mobile can be held indefinitely. This needs to change because mobiles are a very personal item and are usually very expensive. I propose that a time limit be set as to when the phone must be returned. ",
