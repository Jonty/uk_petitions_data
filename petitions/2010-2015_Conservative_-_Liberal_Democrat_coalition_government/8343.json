Whether it's a depressive illness or psychotic illness, the government needs to do more to support the mental health field and psychiatric services. Antidepressants and other psychiatric drugs are on the increase along with psychiatric diagnoses's. We are pledging for the government to create more NHS jobs and services in the mental health field where anyone can access them and to also provide more funding into psychiatric research which could find out more information or even cures on more complex mental illness's which is putting people under such stress everyday and reduce the amount of suicides and psychiatric illness's. More funding should also be given out to charities such as MIND, RETHINK and SANE to help them with the assistance in making the world a better place for those with mental health problems and to better educate the public about them to prevent discrimination and other issues.",
