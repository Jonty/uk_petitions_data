Because these people shouldn't have gone through this dramatic trauma.\r\n\r\nAlso, it may imply that by doing this it could make the bullies feel guilty for what they have done also, it could lead to them to stop bullying. This is very important because this will not only effect the people who are getting bullied it will put an end to bullying in some way.\r\n\r\nA memorial will not only remember the people who have died but will also give the bullies an opportunity to rectify their  mistakes. This is a very important day and will be remembered through out history. This will also give the victims an opportunity to be more confident and speak out to people if they are getting bullied.\r\n",
