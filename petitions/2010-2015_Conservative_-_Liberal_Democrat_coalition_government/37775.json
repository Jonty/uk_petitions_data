Has been running on a Franchise system, where the teams buy their way into the league based on the financial situation within the club. This may seem perfect for the likes of Wigan Warriors & St Helens, but for smaller clubs there will never be a chance at top flight Rugby League. Recent events at Bradford Bulls, has proved this system does not work and only bankrupts clubs. Bring back the older promotion/relegation system to all of the Leagues within the sport and do not let money play with our sport!",
