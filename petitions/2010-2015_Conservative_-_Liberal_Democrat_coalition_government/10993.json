        "additional_details": "Why should UK Tax payers pay to feed and clothe these leeches ? These people travel here to abuse the system, they commit crimes against the very people that show them hospitality, they bite the hands that feed them. Show them no mercy, kick them out of the country. No-one here cares where they go, whether they can prove where they have come from or not. They have had to travel through MANY other EU member states to get here, MAKE these countries accountable for the actions of the people THEY let through their borders. I absolutely guarantee that, suddenly, the amount of of asylum seekers hitting our borders will decrease when EU member states have to recompense the UK for the damage these people cause.",
