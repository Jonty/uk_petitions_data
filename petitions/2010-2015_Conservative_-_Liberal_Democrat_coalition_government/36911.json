        "additional_details": "As a result of the sanctions placed on Iran, innocent woman and children are dying because medicine imports have been banned in Iran. I fully respect the governments commitment to preventing a nuclear Iran. However, the sanction on medicine hurts the Iranian people, not the regime. It creates a hatred of Iranians towards us.\r\nI would like to see the government drop it's political stance and show a human side in this case and drop these horrific sanctions against Iran. No sanctions are acceptable, let alone ones which are this cruel.",
