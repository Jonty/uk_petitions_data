        "additional_details": "There is an overriding need for a Muslim burial ground which adheres to all Islamic bereavement values and laws. There has been an increase in the Black and Asian Minority Ethnic (BAME) population in the borough \u2013 a 108 per cent rise between 2001 and 2011. We have an ageing population and plots are filling up. The nearest Muslim cemetery is Handsworth and it can be extremely difficult for relatives to visit their loved ones.There are few existing burial sites able to facilitate full Muslim burials in accordance with the practice of Sharia Law. Any concerns over increased traffic are misplaced. It is discriminatory to grant planning permission for the building of a dogs home on the same site but refused to grant the same for a Muslim Burial site. ",
