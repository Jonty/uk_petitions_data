        "additional_details": "Introduce a replica of the Swedish system. Which works like this: when you employ a builder, painter, gardener, electrician etc to work on your primary residence, you can claim a tax reduction of 50% of the labour costs, up to \u00a35000 per year per homeowner. Introduced as a temporary measure to stimulate the economy, they soon realised it was self funding as it made cash-in-hand almost obsolete.\r\nEveryone benefits. Cheaper services for homeowners, more jobs for tradesmen, and a huge reduction in undeclared transactions meaning more tax revenue for the government.",
