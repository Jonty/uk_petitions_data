The same type of funeral accorded Princess Diana and the Queen Mother,Nelson and Wellington.\r\nThe Queen Mother and Princess Diana were not politicians, nor did they set out out policy which was devisive.Thatcher set in motion the Free Market for which we all are now paying the penalty and will for many many years to come. She was elected to serve the people of this Nation ,she served a few, causing deep division which is still being felt today.\r\nEven in death she is causing division.\r\nThe Establishment are promoting this Funeral even though they are well aware there would be objections from the people of this Nation",
