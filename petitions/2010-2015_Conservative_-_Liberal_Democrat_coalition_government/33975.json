        "additional_details": "Workplace bullying & harassment is on the rise yet I am told that, \"The Government does not believe that further legislation ... would be the most appropriate way forward to deal with this issue\u201d. It is self-evident that current legislation is insufficient. Stressed targets often develop depression or anxiety disorders. Why allow workplace morale and productivity to plummet while staff turnover soars?\r\nPreventative measures need to be taken, such as compulsory staff training. There is also a desperate need for the establishment of an independent body, but it must have the necessary expertise and resources to mediate at the earliest stages when someone makes a complaint about workplace abuse, thereby avoiding complicated official channels. It should have the powers to provide advice and recommendations to hopefully prevent the complainant having to go through the traumatic experience of legal action.\r\nPlease sign this petition. We need urgent action so that no more lives are blighted.",
