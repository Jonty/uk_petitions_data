        "additional_details": "Leeds city council may have been right to remove the centuries old maypole due to safety concerns but the way they have gone about it is wrong. After the incident in which a rotten flagpole breaking and landing on a young girl I believe the council made the correct decision toremove when signs of rot where found on Otleys iconic maypole. But to not consult with otley councillors or residents before removing is not acceptible. Leeds city council have given no explanation as to whether they plan on replacing the maypole, weathervain and plaque which has left a lot of otley residents upset and angered. Please sign this petition and share to help get our historic otley maypole, weathervain and plaque back to our lovely town and local councillors and residents kept in the loop by Leeds city council as to what their plans may be.",
