        "additional_details": "Paper copies of books, newspapers and magazines are subject to a VAT rate of 0%. It is anomalous that electronic copies of these same items are subject to the current standard rate of VAT (20%). The effect of this tax is to make, in many cases, the e-book version of literature more expensive than the paper copy despite being less expensive to produce and requiring almost zero shipping costs.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of printed paper products requires thousands of tons of raw materials and an enormous amount of energy in production and transport each year. The public is reluctant to pay more for an electronic copy than for a paper copy. Many look for a less expensive and often 'pirate' source.\r\n\r\nBy charging VAT on e-publications the government is encouraging piracy, squandering raw materials and adding to fossil fuel use.\r\n\r\nWe request that the VAT rate on e-books be set to 0%",
