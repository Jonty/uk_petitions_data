Wealthy individuals donate huge sums of money to parties and consequently get the opportunity to wine and dine ministers, write reports for the government and influence party policy.\r\n\r\nWith Ed Miliband seemingly willing to address trade union influence over the Labour party, it is now time that all parties agreed on a suitable cap for donations by any individual or organisation to one political party.\r\n\r\nGovernment policy should be influenced by who the public vote for en masse, not who the privileged minority open their chequebooks to.\r\n\r\nThe government should cap donations by any individual or organisation, to any one political party at \u00a35,000 per year, and stop the rich from buying power in our politics NOW",
