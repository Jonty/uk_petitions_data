        "additional_details": "The NHS Act 1946 quite clearly states that UK citizens are supposed to receive care 'free at the point of need'.\r\nYet eligibility criteria is applied, often meaning that the sick and vulnerable have to pay the fees.  The NHS frequently cite that the care needed is 'social and personal' as opposed to healthcare.\r\nA High Court declared that social and personal care ARE healthcare when they arise as a result of illness or disability, and therefore the sole responsibility of the NHS.  Such a ruling set a precedent for other cases, and cannot be overruled.\r\nFurther, if the NHS refuses to pay for such care, then the onus is on them to quote the legislation that releases them from their responsibilities. Rulings by ministers, and DoH \"guidance\" is NOT the law!\r\nThe arrogance of the Government and the NHS is that we cannot fight this - but we can, collectively!\r\n",
