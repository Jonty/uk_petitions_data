        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the UK government to acknowledge its responsibility in the world through its sale and profiteering of arms to countries at war, greatly advantaging one side and creating devastating humanitarian divisions and war crimes. We have a responsibility as a so-called 'civilised' nation not to fuel wars in the world but to encourage peace.\r\n\r\nThe British people's taxpayer money is being abused as blood money for the profit of a minority, and the suffering of millions. The arms trade leads to Western governments reluctance to promote peace for the regions it is funding and taking clear sides in wars. This is not the answer to the world's problems, but the selfish actions of a minority.\r\n\r\nHumanity is at a tipping point, and it is critical we take action on this. If not, then a leadership that is serious about a peaceful future for humanity.",
