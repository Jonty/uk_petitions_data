        "additional_details": "In the modern day, we are seeing a growing use of the reformed English of the United States. Children's TV is filled with programmes and shows from the USA, and the use of computers and the internet in schools is also a main issue. All of these things use US English, and the future generation will believe the US version to be correct. In fact, when I wrote \"programmes\" in this description, it told me I was wrong! This is because even this description box uses US English rather than our own. My point is, however, that it is even worsening school exam-takers' grades in English. When I was in school, most of my English class, while approaching our GCSEs, kept getting spelling mistake marks because they were using US English, but they didn't know - they thought it was right! I believe UK English should be protected by schools and more strongly enforced by teachers to ensure that British-English survives and does not go extinct.\r\nThank you.",
