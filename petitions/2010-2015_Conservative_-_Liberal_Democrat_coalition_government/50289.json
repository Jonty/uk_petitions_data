        "additional_details": "The British Government should duplicate the Australian Migration System. Australia is a gigantic country with only 23 million people! Therefore, the Aussie's enjoy space, a fantastic quality of life and vibrant and unified culture.\r\n\r\nPlease Sign the petition if you want our Government to raise the standards of who they allow to become Brits! This would mean only allowing people able to support themselves in this country. People who are highly skilled in a profession which NEEDS to be filled (therefore, creating no competition). As well as, only allowing people who speak fluent English into England... And people who will be able to ADAPT and CONSUME the great British culture and traditions. This would induce the idea of people with 'good character' and having an equal amount of migration in and out of our country.\r\n\r\nLets Make Britain Great.\r\n\r\n",
