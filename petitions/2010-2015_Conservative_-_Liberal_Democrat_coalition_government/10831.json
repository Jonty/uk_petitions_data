I firmly believe that the possibility of being \"flogged\" will act as more of a detterent to the mindless elements of our society who continue to blight our communities. The laughably soft sentences that our courts have the power to use now are not dettering people from commiting these offences. This will also free up valuable space in our clogged up prison system.",
