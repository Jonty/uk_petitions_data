Every effort must be made to ensure that each decision to separate a child from its family is right.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to implement the following measures:\r\n\r\n1. Child protection decisions to be made using evidence based on fact\r\n\r\n2. Parents to be informed of the case against them\r\n\r\n3. Experts providing evidence to meet the families before finalising their opinion\r\n\r\nThese measures will reduce the number of children wrongly removed from their families, freeing up Local Authority resources for the most vulnerable children.
