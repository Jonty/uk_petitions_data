        "additional_details": "The Coalition said that only in \"exceptional\" cases would tuition fees of more than \u00a36,000 a year be charged. Now more than half of all universities are charging above this quantity. Instead, of rethinking, the government is threatening to reduce the numbers of places. I think that the public deserves to know what the current costs will be and the costs in 2012 and afterwards. Then, the bill should be changed and re-voted on or be dropped permanently with the current charges being maintained, at minimum.",
