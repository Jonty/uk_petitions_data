        "additional_details": "I would like to see the requirement to re-take the Compulsory Bike Training every two years removed. It is pointless to have to retake training, when the learning process is continued by the Rider once he or she is given the initial pass certificate by the test centre. Further training is unnecessary, as the learning process is part of riding the bike. Once the initial skills are learned, nothing more can be gained from further re-testing. This is just a licence for the testing centres to print money. At approximately \u00a3100 every 2 years, this is a cost that is hard to bear for some young Motorcyclists, and is putting people off riding a cheap environmentally friendly form of transport.",
