Perhaps an anonymous website where perpetrators could actually say why they felt the need to do what they did, and how they would like the government to improve. And what THEY feel that they need in order to be a more upstanding member of our society.\r\n\r\nI think second guessing why youths are so unruly is dangerous, and I think they are not being listened to, creating a \"them and us\" division.",
