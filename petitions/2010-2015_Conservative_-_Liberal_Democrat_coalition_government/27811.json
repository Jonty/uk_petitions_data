        "additional_details": "It had been suggested that the nation gives Queen Elizabeth II an \u00a380 million yacht to mark her Diamond Jubilee as she has served 60 years on the throne. I find the suggestion offensive and highly misguided given the state of the economy and the austerity measures being taken by the present Coalition government.When many children in this country do not have access to a decent standard of living or fair education; when sociable mobility is so low that it harks back to earlier centuries; when unemployment is rising, to give the queen a \"gift\" of this nature, which will have to be funded one way or another by the British tax payer, is utterly repugnant.I am asking the people of this country to petition against the idea of yacht or indeed any such expensive gift.",
