        "additional_details": "Met Office weather forecasting has become increasingly wrong in the short term (even hourly basis), long term, locally and nationally. The effect on business, organisations and individuals is detrimental and costly. The inaccuracies are due to over reliance on computer modelling instead of so-called old fashioned methods. Until such time as the standard of forecasting radically improves, all Government funding of the Met Office should be withdrawn.",
