        "additional_details": "The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 has banned the presentation of female ejaculation, and other acts, in all British-made on-demand pornography. The change especially targets acts that provide sexual pleasure for women, such as facesitting, and even goes as far as to ban the completely natural act of female ejaculation itself. BDSM and urolagnia have also been targeted, despite these being valid fetishes enjoyed by a minority of British people. Furthermore British-made porn now faces a severe threat, forcing the industry to leave the UK.\r\nThe government is banning this content for everybody to protect the under-18s, instead of restricting access to websites and improving the farce that is British sexual education. We call upon the government to repeal the unfair, sexist and ill-thought-out 'Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014'.",
