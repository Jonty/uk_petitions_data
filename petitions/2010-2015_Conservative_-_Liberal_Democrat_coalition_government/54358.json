The popularity of the internet means we can investigate for ourselves some issues which the common person would expect our politcians to be helping us understand. I find it hard to understand why I dont know more of \"our\" side of the stories.  A few examples being the problems or not with gm crops and the role of agrochemical companies in the decline in bee populations. A real debate on the pros and cons of fracking. What is the plan for our environment. What is a terrorist and does the david miranda story suggest we all treated as potential terrorists as the cost of security?\r\n\r\nIts not the point of this petition for you to answer these questions. I would like to know how much you trust the uk public to be informed and if we could perhaps be a bit more involved in the debate.",
