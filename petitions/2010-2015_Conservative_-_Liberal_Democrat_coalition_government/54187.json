        "additional_details": "The monarchy today is in some respects an outdated institution. The idea of maintaining an unelected head of state for a democratic nation seems paradoxical. A regular referendum on the position of the monarchy within the United kingdom would however greatly strengthen our democracy. The government should hold a referendum on the monarchy every decade and before each coronation. No person fully committed to parliamentary democracy could be opposed to the spirit of this petition.
