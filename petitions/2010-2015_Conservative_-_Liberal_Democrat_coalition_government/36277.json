        "additional_details": "Police Services in the United Kingdom often use Horses to control riots and protests.  This means that Horses are often subjected to very frightening scenes, and they are often targeted by the public.\r\n\r\nThere has been several cases, where Horses have been injured and attacked, due to the public and Police conflict.  Horses are easily scared, the slightest incident can make a horse petrified.\r\n\r\nHorses do receive some 'Amour', they wear plastic eye shields, leg armour and nose guards.  But even these methods of protection can not compete with the scale of missiles through in some Riots.\r\n\r\nIn a past student protest, Horses charged into the crowd to disperse and separate them.  This resulted in injuries to humans, as well as scaring some innocent civilians.\r\n\r\nThe only way we can be sure that horses are not injured during protests and riots; is to exclude them from current and future Police Methods of riot control.",
