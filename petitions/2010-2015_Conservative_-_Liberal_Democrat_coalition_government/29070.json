        "additional_details": "I think that the patenting system should be completely abolished. It doesn't serve its original purpose, it's being abused. Patents were used to encourage innovation But now it seems that people are stepping away from the drawing board and heading into the courtroom instead.\r\n\r\nSome referred to as \"pattent trolls\" cease to even make products but just buy patents and wait to sue the unlucky company that infringe them.\r\n\r\nI reccomend that you abolish the patent system or reform it so the courtrooms are not overrun by petty companies who want to wage war on their competitors.\r\n\r\nIf you debate this and come to the conclusion that this is ridiculous considder putting a time limit on patents that go unused.",
