The condition affects the sufferer's whole life and their loved ones.\r\nTinnitus is a continual noise in the head, 24/7, you can not escape the noise. Trying to lead a normal life is very difficult, sometimes impossible.\r\nThis petition is to draw attention to the severity of the condition and have it recognized as a disability.\r\nPlease support.",
