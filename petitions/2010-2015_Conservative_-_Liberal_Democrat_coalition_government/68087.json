We, the undersigned, in the light of Mr Ruffley's caution for assault on his girlfriend beleive if the government wants to do more than pay lip service to ending violence against women and girls that an MP having admitted to assault and accepted a caution from police is not fit for public office. It is wholly inappropriate for Mr Ruffley to represent those of his constituents who have suffered or are suffering from domestic abuse. He should step down immediately and let the people of his constituency choose someone who is suitable for public office.\r\n ",
