He refuses to take heed of the concerns of some of the world's top economic experts, refuses to acknowledge the damage his policies are doing, and has neither the good grace nor the humility to admit when he is wrong.\r\nAs a public servant he is accountable to the UK people and as such we demand that he be removed from office before further irrerparable damage is done to our econonomy and our country.
