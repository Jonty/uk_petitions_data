        "additional_details": "The way we vote in the 2015 general election needs to be seriously reviewed. I propose abolishing the outdated first past the post voting system and adopting a proportional representation vote which will make it fairer for all parties to have the same chance of winning seats in the House of Commons. This way of voting seems the only fair way to give the people of this country a government they feel comfortable with running the country.",
