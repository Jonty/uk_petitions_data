        "additional_details": "When public sector workers strike many extra costs are incurred by already hard pressed private sector workers. There should be a mechanism in place to compensated for these extra costs.\r\n\r\nCompensation should cover, loss of work and earnings, child care, disrupted and extra travel costs, extra care allowances etc and should be paid by the body directly involved in the strike action.\r\n\r\nThe government should implement this to dissuade anyone from striking in times of great hardship by people who are often much better off than the private sector workers they disrupt\r\n",
