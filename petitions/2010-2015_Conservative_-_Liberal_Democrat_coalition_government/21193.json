        "additional_details": "Keep Britain Tidy believes that the Government's proposed reduction to feed-in tariffs for solar power will damage the Eco-Schools solar programme.\r\n\r\nKeep Britain Tidy has recently set up a scheme for schools to have solar panels installed at no cost to themselves or their local authority. Each school could save some 25 tonnes of carbon every year, reduce their energy bill by an average 13.5% and save up to \u00a35,000 a year.\r\n\r\nParticipating Eco-Schools gain by saving money and will be supported to realise further savings through the implementation of whole school energy reduction activities linked to the curriculum and accredited through the Eco-Schools Award programme. Local authorities gain from the carbon reduction to their building stock. We call on the Government to delay the implementation of the changes, as originally planned, until 1 April 2012 and from then to introduce an enhanced feed-in tariff for schools and public buildings.\r\n",
