Energy providers (electric and gas) have the technology to ensure every household can access an hours supply a day irrespective of debt and personal circumstance - this means if prepayment meters have no credit fuel would still be available for one hour everyday - we suggest between 12 noon and 1 pm. The residential supply of water can not be legally disconnected whereas fuel is increasingly disconnected to the poorest families in our society - this is wrong - profit making energy companies need to show social responsibility - now!",
