Since gun ownership is a privilege in this country, and not a right, we urge the government to tighten licensing procedures to ensure that:-\r\n\r\n1.  People with criminal convictions, or a history of domestic violence, or mental instability, or alcohol or other substance abuse, are barred from owning firearms\r\n\r\n2.  An enduring marker appears on gun owners\u2019 medical records and relevant information regarding gun owners is shared between police, licensing authorities and health professionals\r\n\r\n3.  A single, rigorous licensing system is introduced which includes shotguns and Sec 1 firearms and which requires a good reason for the possession of each and every weapon\r\n",
