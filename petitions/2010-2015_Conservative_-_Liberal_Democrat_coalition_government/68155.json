        "additional_details": "Arturo is a Polar Bear living in unfit conditions at Mendoza Zoo in Argentina. Despite unofficial petitions reaching hundreds of thousands of signatures, nothing is being done to save this poor bear. He is clearly being held to aid the profits of the Zoo with no regard for his health and well-being.\r\n\r\nThis petition is asking for the UK Government to bring the matter directly to the government of Argentina and Mendoza Zoo and highlighting the need for resolution.\r\n\r\nWith the UK being the head of the Commonwealth of Nations it would make perfect sense to support a bid by a willing Canadian Zoo or establishment so that Arturo could be moved to a climate more suitable for his species.",
