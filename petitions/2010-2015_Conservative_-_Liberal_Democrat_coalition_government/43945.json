Under his stewardship we have witnessed the collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and Northern Rock, Libor rigging, the PPI scandal, and interest rate swap misselling.\r\n\r\nIf the Honours Secretariat allow this knighthood through, it will make a mockery of the system that purports to recognise those \"who have made great achievements in public life and people who\u2019ve committed themselves to serving Britain. They will usually have made life better for other people or been outstanding at what they do.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlease reverse this disgraceful decision. ",
