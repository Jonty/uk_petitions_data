        "action": "Ban the sale, use, possession and distribution of Paan, Areca/Betel Nut and affiliated mix",
        "additional_details": "The blotches of paan spittal did not exist in the UK 5 years ago, but since then it has become rampant, leading to the unsightly scene of what looks like dried or indeed wet blood all over town and cities in the UK, the awful smell caused by the spat waste product, increase in tuberculoses and other diseases transferred through spit, the damage to teeth and tongue leading to an increase in poor oral hygiene and oral cancer and general anti-social behaviour which is an end result must be addressed. The signatories of this petition believe it is time for the government and relevant gov departments to have legislation implemented in the UK to address this problem: 1) The sale, use, possession and distribution of Paan, Areca/Betel Nut and affiliated mix Illegal. 2) A Strong Penalty for the sale, use, possession and distribution of Point 1. 3) A Massive UK Cleanup operation of Paan Spittle areas.",
