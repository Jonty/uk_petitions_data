        "additional_details": "Kings Dyke railway crossing is located on the main road (A605) into Whittlesey.\r\nThe crossing comes down around 10 times an hour and this is due to increase when freight traffic increases as we have already been advised is about to happen.\r\nWhen North Bank and/or the B1040 is closed due to flooding, which happens often, traffic backs up 2 miles back into Whittlesey and at evening rush hour, at least a mile back towards Stanground.\r\nThis is unacceptable and makes Whittlesey and it's many good bars and restaurants a no go zone for visitors.\r\nIt is hard to encourage new residents to Whittlesey because of the time it can take to travel such a short distance.\r\nA bridge is long overdue.\r\n",
