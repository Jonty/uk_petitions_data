        "additional_details": "Currently the three year doctorate in Educational Psychology is going through a transition in funding.  This should not detract from the essential work that trained educational psychologists do and to that end we need more trainees to go through the system.  We especially need a more ethnically diverse EP population to reflect the growing range of issues and people requiring their support.  I would therefore call for the government to review the intake and selection procedures of universities. I would ask that they allow trainees to make a reasonable contribution towards costs in the first year of training if that will support the programme.  I would also ask that they support an increase in the number of trainees taken on each year.",
