The world is not what it was a decade ago, and now is more dangerous with terrorists & Millionare criminals at loose. The Police have a hard time catching & proving guilt today. The honest public should not have anything to fear from this Bill.  The Internet especially is full of criminals making themselves rich, and depriving businesses of profit.",
