        "additional_details": "For the consideration of The Rt. Hon. Kenneth Clarke Secretary of State for Justice, AND whosoever it may concern,\r\n\r\nThe current legal penalties for the possession of cannabis are more damaging to a person than the drug itself. This is cruel and deplorable to any persons seeking to undertake this drug. Great deals of these persons would otherwise be considered harmonious and flawless law abiding citizens, but because of the law as it stands, they are labelled criminals.\r\n\r\nCannabis is the most natural drug in the world and has been used in its natural form for centuries by millions of people worldwide. I am astonished at the fact that alcohol and tobacco are the cause of so many fatalities and medical conditions; yet we are allowed, without legal hindrance, to limitlessly possess and poison our bodies with them.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, hereby petition the Secretary of State for Justice to decriminalize the possession of cannabis in quantities justly deemed to be for mere personal use.",
