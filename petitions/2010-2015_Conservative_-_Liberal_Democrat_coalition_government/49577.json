        "additional_details": "We the people are governed by consent, and yet there is no lawful means of removing our consent to be governed. Refusal to sign the electoral roll carries a \u00a31,000 fine, and yet, many of us consider this an act of civil disobedience that should not carry such a penalty. The council and central government still know who we all are for purposes of Council Tax, and the Benefits Offices / National Health Service / other government agencies all have our details on file.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the undersigned feel that not wanting to participate in the so-called \"democratic process\" should NOT incur a \u00a31,000 fine just for dissenting to the system in its entirety, and we ask that the fines for not signing onto the Electoral Roll should be rescinded and removed.",
