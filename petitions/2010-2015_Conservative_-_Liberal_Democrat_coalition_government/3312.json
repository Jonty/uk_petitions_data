        "additional_details": "It is a fact that during the debates of the 2010 general elections more time was spent debating winter fuel allowance and free bus passes for pensioners than on children and education.\r\n\r\nThat reflects a problem in our society, the age group in the UK which has the highest percentage of voters are the ones in there 70's.\r\n\r\nThis means that to get elected politicians feel they should cater for the old and too often the young are sidelined.\r\n\r\nIt is the role of government to protect our most vulnerable. BUT we should remember that our young are vulnerable and they don't have a say.\r\n\r\nWe should give parents of children under the ages of 18 an extra vote so that children who cannot vote vote have some representation in the commons.\r\n\r\nChildren are our future, they will pay our pensions, they will feed use, they will have to solve the problems of tomorrow.\r\n\r\nGive children and parents a voice!\r\n\r\nThank you ",
