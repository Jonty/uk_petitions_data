        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, ask the government to investigate illegal practices undertaken by Paypal, including facilitating fraud by allowing criminals to purchase items and falsely claim chargebacks, allowing them to keep purchased items and also money paid to the seller. Another element of this is that they also remove unauthorised amounts of monies from the seller's bank account if they choose to make a purchase whilst said chargebacks are being investigated, as if confirming that the seller will not win the case. The government needs to enforce proper regulation to avoid letting Paypal continue in this manner.",
