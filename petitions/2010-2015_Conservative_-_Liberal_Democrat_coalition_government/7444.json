        "additional_details": "To ban the Burkha in public places, it is hard to identify individuals, posing a problem for the police and the general public. It is threatening and intimidating, youths with 'hoodies' are prohibited from wearing them in public places, because of identification issues, so why should people who wear Burkhas be treated any differently? I believe that women are forced into submission to wear them be aggressive husbands as it has been declared that they are not part of the Muslim religion. Therefore I would like MPs to do what has already been established in France and Belgium, and to ban the Burkha in public areas as they are unnecessary and a threat to public security, regarding identification and intimidating behaviour.",
