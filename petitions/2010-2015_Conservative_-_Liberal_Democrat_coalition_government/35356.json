        "additional_details": "Netting on buildings is causing death and injury to many birds but mainly to pigeons who get trapped in and behind the nets and suffer a slow and agonising death. There are other ways of keeping them off of buildings other than netting which soon gets holes in it and is rarely maintained by the organisation that fits it. Seeing trapped and dead and dying pigeons causes distress to a lot of people who are unable to do anything to help. It takes a lot of chasing up to get those responsible for the nets to get someone out to release the birds, and that is needed on a regular basis so a ban on these nets would not just save lives but also save on cost of releases. Every creature deserves the right to a life without danger and prejudice from human beings. ",
