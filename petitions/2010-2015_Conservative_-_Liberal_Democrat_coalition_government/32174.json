We can no longer sit back and allow our tap water to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids.\r\n\r\nOver the last few hundred years, the quality of water available has been gradually increasing to the point where we can now get Ultra Pure Water, as defined in SEMI F63.\r\n\r\nIt is only sensible that the government pursue the policy of allowing every home in the country to have ultrapure water, straight from the taps by ensuring any water treatment facility is equipped to deliver ultrapure water to the mains. It can only be good for health, and the taste of the water will be improved.\r\n\r\n",
