These transactions are\r\noften conducted in a few milliseconds and can be referred to as\r\nhigh frequency, low latency or algorithmic trading.\r\n\r\nThis short timescale discriminates against geographically distant\r\nmarket participants, it may also increase volatility or allow price\r\nmanipulation.\r\n\r\nThe Government should regulate or legislate as necessary to prevent any\r\nexchange or similar entity from offering this form of trading until the\r\nbenefits are proven by a consensus of independent research and controlled\r\ntrials.\r\n",
