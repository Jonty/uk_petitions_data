Results will then go to GPs.\r\nYou can now get blood tests back in a hour using the in house system at Southend and Basildon Hospitals  but under the new scheme it could take days, wasting valuable time.\r\nThe Echo campaign asks for the pathology testing to remain within south Essex to provide the best service to patients.\r\nSign to show your support for our campaign.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
