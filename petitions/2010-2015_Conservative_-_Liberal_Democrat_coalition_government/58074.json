        "additional_details": "Currently the coastline is managed by 8 different bodies; some of which are underfunded and some have developped unusable and discriminative plans which do not protect vulnerable Coastline Communities.This was very evident during the North Sea surge on Thursday 05/12/13 when chaos was the norm for this well forecast and publicised event.The fact that there are 8 individual managing bodies is wasteful and expensive to operate and because any funding is divided; this means that poorly funded and more vulnerable areas to coastal erosion do not get the necessary funding required to ensure longetivety for the coastal dwellers who are always at risk where there are insufficient or inadequate sea defences.Removing wasteful management operations will redirect funding to increase  sustainable sea defences in these vulnerable coastal communities and help prevent and reduce the hopelessness which is being administered to these coastal communities nationally.",
