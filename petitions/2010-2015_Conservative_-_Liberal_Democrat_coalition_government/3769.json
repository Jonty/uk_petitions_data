        "additional_details": "Nowadays a lot more jobs are \"temporary\" than used to be the case, forcing people into this way of working. There are currently no rights for temporary workers who have work cancelled the day before they are supposed to work, but the economy is balanced such that these people often have little choice about working on a temporary basis. If shifts are cancelled late, it is often difficult for the worker to find other employment, and for jobs on the minimum wage there is little \"give\" in their earnings to cover this loss.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to introduce a minimum cancellation time for temporary shift work, on the penalty of paying the employee for the full shift if it is cancelled later than this.",
