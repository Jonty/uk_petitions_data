They have human rights but it looks like the government don't care they are being forced out and forced to travel away. When council say \"we are a community\", well they not because they accept people. The England  is a multicultural country... Well we need to act like it!.\r\nI want the government to create areas gypsies are\r\nallowed to stay but for a price. People are exploiting them, they are in a free country and should be treated as humans. I'm not a gypsies but I know our rights!.  ",
