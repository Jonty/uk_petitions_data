        "additional_details": "Since the sell off of school playing fields the young people have no involvement and direction in their spare time, which results in no appreciation of authority, team building and participatory activities. They need to be involved in supervised constructive endeavours.\r\nThe government should make it compulsory for all youths of 14 - 18 years old to be a member of an approved youth scheme, club or society and to participate at least once per week. These would be extra curricula and funded by local and national government and run by staff and volunteers.",
