        "additional_details": "Flouride is harmful, this is why some countries do not add fluoride to consumables. Yet, in the UK,  it is added to water, babies' powdered milk formulas, toothpaste and mouthwash, to name a few consumables. We want the government to take effective action to BAN fluoride from all consumables.\r\n\r\nFlouride facilitates the movement of aluminium from the stomach to the brain which is thought to be the main cause of dementia. What's more we have no idea of the damage done to babies brains. Given our country's ever increasing dementia population, this issue should be top priority for government action. Why no action has been taken, so far, is extremely baffling.\r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with the harmful effects of fluoride, internet search engines are useful for research.\r\n\r\nPlease, please sign the petition for all our sakes.\r\nThank you.\r\n ",
