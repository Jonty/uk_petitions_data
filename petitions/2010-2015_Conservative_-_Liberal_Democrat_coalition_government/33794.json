The Staff helped students me included to acheive to the maximum of our abilities.  The staff are a rare breed as they are commited to their students and to bringing new diverse talent into media; they are a highly skilled, talented bunch of proffessional, dynamic individuals who work well as a team.\r\n\r\nIt would be unthinkable to end this course as it would close opportunities to many and create one less route for success,  another door shut in the face of aspiring students creating lack of opportunity rather than focused driven students who unfailingly do well after this course.",
