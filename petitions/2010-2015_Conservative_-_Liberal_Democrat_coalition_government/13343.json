        "additional_details": "Indiscriminate use of pesticide in UK gardens is destroying food sources for larger animals such as birds, hedgehogs and other small animals.  Furthermore it is evident that these pesticides drain into underground water courses and then into rivers.  Once in rivers and oceans these pesticides pollute and cause mutations in fish and other marine animals.\r\n\r\nA reduction in pesticide use will lead to an increase in the UK wildlife population.\r\n\r\nPesticides should be used only in strictly controlled circumstances under license.\r\n\r\nThis issue should be debated in Parliament.",
