Not only to help the people, your voters, but also to help the gulls and other wildlife as this is encouraging them to attack humans.\r\nWe are constantly being told of cutbacks and as to how important the environment and wildlife is. By supplying wheelie bins and remedying this situation you will be cutting costs as the weekly refuse collection will be less time consuming, the local environment will not be littered and the wildlife will not be in danger. How does this make sense? It does not. We want action now!",
