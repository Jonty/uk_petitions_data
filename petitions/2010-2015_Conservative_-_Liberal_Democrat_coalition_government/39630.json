Suggested limits may be that if driving  5 mph or more below the legal limit and a queue of four or more vehicles has formed behind, the lead vehicle is required to pull over as soon as possible to let the traffic clear.\r\nThis could be enforced as an offence under driving without due care and attention.\r\nSimilar requirements exist as recommendations but would benefit from being codified into law.",
