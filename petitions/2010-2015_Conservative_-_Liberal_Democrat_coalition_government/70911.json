IPP numbers mushroomed, with many in jail well past their minimum terms.\r\nIPP has now been abolished, more than 5,500 IPP prisoners remain within the system, with nearly two-thirds over their tariff. IPP prisoners appear to be at a significantly higher risk of mental health problems than other prisoners, according to the Centre for Mental Health.In a study it carried out in 2008, it found that one in 10 IPP prisoners were seeking psychiatric help in prison, double the rate in the general prison population.",
