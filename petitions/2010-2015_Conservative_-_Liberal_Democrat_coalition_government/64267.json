Children who breathe in secondhand smoke have an increased risk of:\r\n\r\n- cot death (sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS)\r\n- developing asthma (smoking can also trigger asthma attacks in children who already have the condition),\r\n- serious respiratory (breathing) conditions such as bronchitis and pneumonia\r\n- meningitis\r\n- more susceptible to coughs and colds\r\n\r\nIn July 2007, smoking in public places such as bars, restaurants and workplaces was made illegal to protect non-smokers from the health risks associated with passive smoking - WE MUST EXTEND THIS TO OUR SCHOOLS AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN!",
