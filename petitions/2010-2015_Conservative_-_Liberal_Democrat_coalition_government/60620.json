        "additional_details": "I would like for the government to take seriously the sale of pets (dogs, cats or any other animal) for free on websites that promote online sales and offer for animals free to good homes. This opens a huge gap in the promotion of dog baiting, (due to animals being offered for free and then used in illegal activities) , this just does not include dogs it also includes cats. Cats are stolen and dogs are stolen to be used in illegal sports. The offering of free pets on certain major selling websites is becoming the norm.... it is an open market... and a paradise for people involved in illegal activities... to use these animals in a horrific way. If the sales of animals on online sights were banned from offering \"for free\" it may at least deter some people of gaining animals for illegal activities. The government needs to ban certain online sites from offering free pets. ",
