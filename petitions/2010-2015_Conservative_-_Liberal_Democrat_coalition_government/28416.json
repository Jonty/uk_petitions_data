        "action": "Petition against the proposal that HMRC will close 3 local offices within Sunderland which will have devastating effects on the fragile economy",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to oppose the Government's planned closure of Shackleton House and Gilbridge House in Sunderland and Weardale House in Washington.\r\nAlthough the government says no-one will be made redundant they will be hit in other ways. Increased spending on petrol and bus fares, payments to child care due to extended journey times and the effect on staff of having to leave an office most have been in for many years and friends and co-workers they're familiar with.\r\nIf this plan goes ahead it will not only effect the staff working in these buildings but the businesses in the surrounding areas, these workers put a lot of money into the local economy - spending money in the local cafes, sandwich shops, restaurants and bars.\r\nThis is yet again another example of the Tory led government heaping misery on the North of the country at a time when people are already struggling.",
