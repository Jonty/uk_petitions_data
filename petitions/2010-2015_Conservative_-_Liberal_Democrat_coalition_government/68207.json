        "additional_details": "This is the totally unnecessary euthanising of perfectly healthy dogs. Common reasons are because of behavioural problems, because they're simply no longer wanted, because the owner is moving abroad, or because the owner can no longer afford the dog. In our opinion, by choosing to own an animal, pet owners are obligated to care for it. When proper care is no longer an option, there must be other alternatives to euthanasia.\r\n\r\nWe don't believe any pet should be euthanised just like that; no rehoming, no rescue centre, no adoption, no behavioural or medical assessment, just because the owner doesn't want the dog any more.\r\n\r\nSupport our 'Education not Execution' campaign.\r\n",
