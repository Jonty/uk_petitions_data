With a suggestion that Individuals who have just passed their test regardless of age should re-take a refresher test each year for 5 years. Everyone should have to re-take their test every 10 years and everyone over 70 should re-take their test each year until unable to drive. If individuals pass their re-test first time the cost should be covered by the Department of Transport.",
