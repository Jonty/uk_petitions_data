        "additional_details": "We ask that the police be banned from using social media to make statements to the public.\r\n\r\nThe police have a position of authority which makes their sometimes irresponsible use of social media dangerous and likely to prejudice justice.\r\n\r\nUnsubstantiated accusations of criminality or tweets about justice being served are undignified and inflammatory and should have no place in official statements by the police force.\r\n\r\nThere is no justification for the time and money spent paying staff to update twitter. Given the harm it causes, we ask that the police be banned from using social media for public relations so that their resources can be put to better use.",
