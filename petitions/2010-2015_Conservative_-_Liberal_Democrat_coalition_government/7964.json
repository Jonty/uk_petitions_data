        "additional_details": "Its time to bring back the National pride and put the kids on track. If they aren't in school doing higher education then from 18 onwards for 2 years they should serve National Service till they are 20.\r\n\r\nWhilst in National Service they can work with local communities, a tour of duty in one of our many growing conflicts that seem to serve no purpose. Learn the differences between right and wrong and get some pride in being british.\r\n\r\nIf they fail to serve they will goto jail - put it to a national referendum you will see what the country wants soon enough.",
