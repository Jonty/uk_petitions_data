This Act is rarely implemented and could bring much needed revenue to the government whilst upholding the protection of the Environment. In this day and age there is no excuse for pollution of our Environment and industries who are damaging the world we live should be brought to justice. Please act to save our planet using the legislation you have to hand.",
