        "additional_details": "As in London, bus travel is for free for under 16's I hear. I would like under 16's in Birmingham to have this opportunity also as it would be ideally good for school travel, less carbon emissions, global warming and many more. Many parents are finding it hard to pay up for petrol and afford a new car because of fewer job availability and the high petrol increase. If the government funded in this investment of making bus travel free many under 16 s would find it easier to travel to school, work experience , jobs and youth clubs. Bus fares are increasing day by day in 2011 the average rate for a short hop on the bus was 65-75p it has now risen by 10-20p at 85p.",
