In practice this results in strikes being called on a very low turnout, sometimes with less than 20% of the total membership voting in favour of strike action.\r\nTherefore I propose that current legislation should be altered to require over 50% of the total membership of a union to vote in favour of industrial action before a strike can be legally called.\r\n",
