        "additional_details": "For 200 years the UK survived perfectly well without awarding bonuses to public sector employees and quasi-governmental agencies like Network Rail. Considering that average public sector pay now exceeds that in the private sector in addition to more holiday time and better pensions, bonuses are immoral and the taxpayer cannot afford them. Bonuses are for the private sector -- reward accompanies risk. When did you ever hear of a Civil Service or Local Government employee being sacked for doing a bad job? That's the difference.",
