        "additional_details": "Following the ECHR ruling upholding France\u2019s ban on face-masking, the UK must follow suit. Muslims are misled by Wahhabi-Salafi-Deobandi-TJ-JI sects that the burqa/niqab is integral to Islam. It is untrue.\r\n\r\nThis archaic tribal rag is pre-Islamic, non-Qur'anic and unMuslim. Female anonymity is a Saudi-Afghan fad. It should be resisted on theological, social, health, security and equality grounds so that Britain\u2019s character is preserved.\r\n\r\nWe must oppose this latest salvo from theological fanatics for the hearts and minds of UK\u2019s Muslims.\r\n\r\nAs integrated British Muslims, we ask HMG to initiate a national debate so that the public is not duped by zealots claiming that face-masking is Islamic. If this Trojan shari\u2019ah horse is not routed, we set a dangerous precedent that will imperil Britain\u2019s democracy and liberty.\r\n\r\nWe call upon everyone to join us in abolishing this patriarchal fallacy.\r\n",
