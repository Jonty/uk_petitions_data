        "additional_details": "Cords4life UK is Charlie's Legacy. Set up by the parents of Charlie Harris Beard, after he himself underwent a stem cell transplant when he was 14 months old. His donor came from the USA. The search for a donor highlighted a major shortage here in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to increase availability of  umbilical cord donation to all pregnant women so on the day they give birth, they can give life twice. By increasing availability, more cord blood can be collected. The blood in the cord and placenta is rich in stem cells, valuable medicine for leukaemia, serious blood disorders and a wide range of degenerative diseases\r\nSee our website  for more information www.cords4life.co.uk",
