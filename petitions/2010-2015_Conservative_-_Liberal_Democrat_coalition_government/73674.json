Charging for prescriptions is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nIt's time to fight for this fight for the small things that will make a huge difference to us all.\r\n\r\nTo have a dramatic reduction and for it to stay at that price or for it to be abolished would be my aim in this petition.\r\n\r\nPlease support me with this - TO GET HER WE ARE STRONGER.",
