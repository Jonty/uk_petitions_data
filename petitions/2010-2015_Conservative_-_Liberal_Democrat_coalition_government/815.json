Thus saving approximately \u00a37billion pa in direct transfers from the UK tax payer to the EU. Other benefits would be ower food prices, rebuilding fish stocks and enable the rebirth of fishing communities,effectively policing our own borders and lessening illegal migration, reducing the attendant social costs, abolishing 'climate change' obligations we would save industry uneccessary costs and lower fuel prices, restoring judicial sovereignty, this country would no longer be guided by the decisions of judges of foreign powers. Most of this country's trade is once again with countries outside the EU.  The countries of the EU will want to continue trading with us due to our deficits with them, they will not wish to incur sanctions from the WTO by imposing illegal tariffs.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to lose and everything to gain.",
