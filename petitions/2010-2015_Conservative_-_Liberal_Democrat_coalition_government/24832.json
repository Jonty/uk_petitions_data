It makes a mockery of the e-petition process.\r\n\r\nYour grounds for rejection (The IOC has sole responsibility for negotiations concerning worldwide Olympic sponsors) are a fabrication as this was clearly a local negotiation with the funding going to LOCOG. It may well be that Dow Chemicals are global sponsors, as negotiated by the IOC, but that is wholly irrelevant.\r\n\r\nI am sure that most observers would expect our ministers to welcome a means of avoiding this embarrassing 'banana skin' (of its own making) based on public support from petitioners on the PM's website. Wait for the backlash next summer. You will not be able to claim that you could not see it coming!",
