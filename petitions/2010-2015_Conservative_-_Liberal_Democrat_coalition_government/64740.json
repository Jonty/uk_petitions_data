        "additional_details": "Those who are out of work and wish to receive benefits should work for them. The Welfare State is a safety net. It should focus on the sick, the mentally ill etc. When someone loses their job - the benefits system should be there to make sure banks don't foreclose and children don't go hungry BUT there are many areas in our local community where gov. expenditure has been cut back, so it seems fair that those in receipt of benefits should be asked to work in the community 4 days/week in order to receive their benefits. (And have 1 day/week to look for work.) The work they do could include the upkeep of parks/gardens, painting, litter picking and for those with other skills anything that will help the community thrive. In return, the individuals receive their benefits, but they also have a reason to get up in the morning, maintain a strong work ethic and meet new people. The benefits aren't a hand out or an hourly rate, but in return, those who receive them should be happy to work.",
