There is a growing amount of children who have lost their lives and been robbed of a future by these monsters who only end up living out their days in relative luxury, segregated away from other inmates to protect them. This leads to a much higher price to the tax payer to help keep these people safe and out of harms way.\r\n\r\nWhy should we pay more to keep them from harm when the innocent young children they attacked were not given the same opportunity.",
