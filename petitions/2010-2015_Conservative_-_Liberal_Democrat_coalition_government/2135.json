        "additional_details": "I propose that all new builds, whether residential or commercial, should get all of their energy needs from renewable energy sources. Therefore, all new property should be built with solar panels or wind turbines or a combination of renewable sources. This would make all new property self sufficient for its energy needs with the beneficial side effect that any excess energy produced could be supplied to the national grid",
