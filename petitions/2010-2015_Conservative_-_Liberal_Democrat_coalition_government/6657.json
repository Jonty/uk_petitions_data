        "additional_details": "The Compensation Culture (TCC) is at the heart of \u201cBroken Britain\u201d. The impacts of TCC include; NHS funding diverted from patient care, emasculation of professions such as teachers, doctors/nurses, police/emergency services, etc, and an abdication of personal responsibility. It has led to cases which give real health and, safety a bad name, and at worst, costs lives. TCC has also built professions in both the public and private sectors that add no real value to society.\r\n\r\nThe rot set in in 1987 when law firms were allowed to advertise. The Law Society warned this could lead to no-win-no-fee and TCC.\r\n\r\nThe aim here is not to eradicate compensation claims entirely, but to quash the excesses of TCC. The proposal is that practical measures are taken which may include; i) make no-win-no-fee arrangements illegal, ii) withdraw the right for legal firms to advertise and iii) withdraw legal aid for any prosecution cases seeking cash compensation (still allowing cases for non-cash remedies).",
