        "additional_details": "This is a proposal to amend the \"Bedroom Tax\" so that as long as a resident who is subject to the \"Bedroom Tax\" places their name on a waiting list to be moved to a more suitable accommodation, then they should be exempt from the \"Bedroom Tax\". Failure to move to a suitable accommodation when one becomes available would result in the back payment of any \"Bedroom Tax\" the resident would have been subject to. Those who still wish to stay in their residence will still be required to pay the \"Bedroom Tax\" as it applies.",
