        "additional_details": "Daniel Pelka was a beautiful and loving little boy who's short life was tourtured and ended in the most heart breaking way.\r\nFor all those so called ' authoritive' figures who stood by and did nothing and instead turned a blind eye they should not be allowed to continue in their jobs because this could happen again to some other poor defenceless child.\r\nSo often in cases like these it is the head of these deprtments who seem to be held accountable.  In my viw, this is wrong.  How would they know to intervene if staff 'on the ground' did nothing to bring it to anyone's attention.  Prosecute the teachers, support staff and social services and take their jobs away from them so they can't do this to another poor baby.",
