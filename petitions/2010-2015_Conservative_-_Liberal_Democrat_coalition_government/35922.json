        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom has the silver medal when it comes to music exports, we are second only to the United States when it comes to people across the world wanting to listen to our sounds, but the current Secondary Music Education bears no resemblance to this.\r\n\r\nNot only is British music popular, but in the Post-war years it has contributed substanially to the cultural landscape of the Western world; affecting it's politics, sociology and influencing the sounds, trends and cultures of tommorow.\r\n\r\nInstead of an outdated focus on the Classical movements like Baroque, Medieval and the Renaissance - Music studies should be based more on Modern Post-war Popular Music, In hope to teach students the implications of the craft throughout the years and instill a new passion for all aspects of the Music Industries to maintain a sustainable leading role in the creation of music in the world.\r\n\r\n(This petition is not to eraidcate Classical teachings, but merely marganalise them)",
