The alternative is a free for all, where prime ministerial candidates are nominated by other members of the house and voted upon until there are two candidates who go to national elections, the winner and loser nominating their own cabinet and shadow cabinet but these will not be elected MPs but specialists.\r\nIn addition all MPs should be allowed to propose up too one or two bills a term based on seniority. Voting system should change so most laws are based on referendum basis with the prime minister able to reject some votes above 50% based on voting turnout e.g. a 20% turnout would require 75% approval to be passed, also specialist law changes would be voted on by experts not the people e.g. a structural change in how the NHS is run would be voted on by the medical professionals, but on the other hand a service change should be the people's choice as this affects them.\r\n\r\n",
