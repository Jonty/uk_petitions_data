        "additional_details": "To the mention of a British Federation is preposterous, by allowing each city, state, country to have maximum or free change of the laws of an economic stature will provoke economic decline.\r\n\r\nMaking these counties & countries with the ability to change their economic policy will be disastrous for the debt of Great Britain, as one has said that \"95.5% of our tax goes to the HM Treasury which can be spent on our communities\" this is a terrible comment as that money is required to pay for the debt that Great Britain has. By going by this policy the British Pound Sterling in a few years will be under the dollar.\r\n\r\nHaving this idiotic system will divide communities and promote independence from West minister.\r\n\r\nThere should only be one government with better representatives.",
