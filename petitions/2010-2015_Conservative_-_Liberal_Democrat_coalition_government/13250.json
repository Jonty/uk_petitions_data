Therefore voters may even be illegal immigrants from non-commonwealth countries!  All prospective voters before being entered on the electoral list for the first time should produce documents to prove that they are legitimately qualified to vote. Checking whether a prospective voter has qualified the criteria to vote should be performed before including them in the electoral lists for the first time.  Such checks could be done checking prospective voters' birth certificates, NI/ ID identities, passports, etc.",
