People can opt out of this by asking to be excluded from the \"edited register\".\r\n\r\nHowever, there are issues ensuring the accuracy of the data.  Hence it is difficult to ensure that only those who opt to appear on the edited register actually do.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is increasing evidence that the details are being obtained by criminals who are using this information to commit identity theft and identify potential victims of hate crime.\r\n\r\nThe only realistic way this can be stopped is with the scrapping of the edited electoral register and government being forced to keep our personal information completely private and confidential.",
