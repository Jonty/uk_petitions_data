        "additional_details": "A cholesteatoma is a rare abnormal growth of skin cells in the middle ear,it can cause dizziness, loss of balance, hearing loss and facial paralysis At its most severe, it can be fatal by causing meningitis, brain tumors and even death. Each operation is life threatening and there's no guarantee your going to come out fine, because you can lose your hearing, balance and facial nerves even if the cholesteatoma's removed. I would like a charity or more help and support created made for those with cholesteatoma's or had them that are struggling and feel useless, I also think disability allowance would be helpful as it can cause a severe amount of hearing loss",
