        "action": "New Land Owenership Tax to Replace Council Tax",
        "additional_details": "I propose a Fair Land Tax to replace the current and unfair council tax system. It would be a tax on the amount of land owned rather than services used with the amount charged being proportional to the area of land you own/occupy. A tax like this would reduce the cost of land, not devalue house prices, and encourage house building. A tax that is fair to those single/retired and all those living in small accommodations. It would raise revenue from those that can afford it and to break up large land ownership, punish buy-to-let parasites and prevent scandalous land banking perpetrated by corporations and the generation before mine, who bought it all so cheaply and now prevent my generation\u2019s access to a decent standard of living. It allows the fruits of this land to be shared equally among its economically active citizens. Exemptions for forests, active farmland (including allotments), free to roam areas, schools etc will apply.",
