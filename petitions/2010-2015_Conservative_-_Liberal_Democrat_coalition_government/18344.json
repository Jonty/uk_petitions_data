When endowments don\u2019t return the monies originally forecast, it falls to me to address. Why should public and indeed corporate pension holders receive guarantees not available to people such as me.\r\nIt's trustees responsibility to ensure pensions are appropriately funded.  If there is a short fall, then like endowments, members of these scheme should receive less return, returns that can be afforded by the fund.\r\nAlternatively members should be notified of any short falls, which they can make plans to resolve.\r\nEqually, if trustees are at fault, they should be held to account.\r\nThe law should be changed to allow the above to occur and not for the state (unless trustees of course) be liable to resolve.",
