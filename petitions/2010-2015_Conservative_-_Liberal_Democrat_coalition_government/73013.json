At shuttle sites (where one single file of traffic serves both directions alternating) this principle is difficult to achieve, even with multiple aspects.\r\n\r\nThe respective traffic signs regulations should therefore make a '<- LOOK BOTH WAYS ->' road marking for each pedestrian wait area mandatory at such a site.",
