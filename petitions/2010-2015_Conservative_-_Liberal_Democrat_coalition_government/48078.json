        "additional_details": "In rural areas there are narrow single track roads often with passing places. There can be high hedges, blind summits and sharp bends but in nearly all cases the national speed limit of 60 mph applies. These lanes are used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders and often there is little refuge from speeding traffic. The Government is asked to consider amending the national speed limit on such roads to a safer lower speed which could be decided after consultation but should be a maximum of 40 with a prefered speed through villages of 30.",
