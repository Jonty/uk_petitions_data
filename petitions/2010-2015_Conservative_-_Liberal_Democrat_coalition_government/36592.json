Just because we can't hear as well as you, does not mean that we can't do the job. The majority of Hearing Impaired people, are Physically and Mentally able to do the job, just like me (Will Cooper). Hearing should mean nothing, ever heard of sign-language, lip-reading?\r\n\r\nPlease consider this, and fight for what is right!",
