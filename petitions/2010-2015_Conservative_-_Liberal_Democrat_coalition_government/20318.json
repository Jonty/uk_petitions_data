        "additional_details": "It is common place in the UK for landlords to carry out quarterly inspections of their properties. This is problematic for tenants who work full time and need to take annual leave to monitor the person entering their home every 3 months. It is not feasible in the long term to continue to take time off work for this. It is an infringement of one's privacy and is particularly detrimental to families with children, because often the inspector is not CRB checked. It makes life very stressful.",
