        "additional_details": "Nuisance noise needs to be addressed with stricter policy to encourage responsible use of amplified audio equipment, provide relief for the victims of nuisance noise and punish those who use such equipment irresponsibly.\r\n\r\nThe 'evidence based' process applied by local councils is not working and many individuals have no option but to move since it is very difficult to 'catch neighbours in the act' and follow through with any measures against them.\r\n\r\nI propose a licencing system for use of amplified audio equipment, particularly those including sub-woofers and high wattage speakers to generate funds to tackle this poorly enforced anti-social behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe money generated from this scheme would go directly towards local councils, specifically their environment health departments, and would grant them greater powers and resources to enforce measures against serial offenders. Licences would be mandatory and irresponsible use would result in the removal of licences. ",
