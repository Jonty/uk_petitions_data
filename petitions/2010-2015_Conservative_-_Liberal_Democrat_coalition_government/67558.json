        "additional_details": "Stop selling so many laxatives in a packet, put them behind the counter and have a restriction on the amount purchased. Laxatives have killed so many people suffering with eating disorders and they ruin lives. A normal person will need a max of 2 for normal function yet during my illness I could buy multiple packs of 100 resulting in hospitalization. Please do something to save lives and stop the suffering of so many people before the problem becomes an epidemic in modern society!!!!  I was a lucky one to survive but others won't. Please help!!!!! ",
