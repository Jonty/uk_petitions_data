        "additional_details": "Expenses should only be claimed for essential functions that support your operation. Like you would in a large company, you would only claim for travel (not first class), you would have a limit on food and drink when travelling. No claims at all should be allowed for the running of a second home including utility bills and refurbishments.\r\n\r\nBetter transparency is also required with the various national trusts and local councils. Public funds need to be managed more efficiently.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for an independent and auditable unit to be created, not sitting or siding with any party, in government, to manage MP expenses and ensure that no non-essential claims are made. This unit also needs to be responsible for reviewing practises in various national trusts and local councils to ensure the best use of public funds are made and ensure that no abuse or excess budget use takes place.",
