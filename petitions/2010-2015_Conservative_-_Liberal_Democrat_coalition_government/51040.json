        "additional_details": "Fenton's Great War Memorial is at risk of demolition.\r\n\r\nMade from Minton tiles and at 4m x 3m in dimension, it features the names of 498 men. Fenton's historic former town hall, built in 1888, which houses the memorial has recently been put up for sale by The Ministry of Justice, who have refused to enter into a dialogue over the memorial's future.\r\n\r\nThe memorial's size and weight means it cannot be moved: it is embedded into the wall at the top of a flight of stairs. Unfortunately, neither the memorial nor the town hall are protected: a recent application for listing status was rejected.\r\n\r\nAs we begin to remember the sacrifices made by millions during the Great War, for many in Fenton it seems ironic that a Ministry of Justice should be about to violate the memory of 498 courageous heroes.\r\n\r\nThe people of Fenton ask the Ministry of Justice to listen to their ideas so that they can ensure the preservation of this fabulous piece of heritage, wonderful to all, priceless to many.",
