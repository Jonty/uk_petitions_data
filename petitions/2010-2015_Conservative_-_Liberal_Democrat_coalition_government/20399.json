        "additional_details": "If you look at why Radio 1 was created then you will clearly see that the original need for it disappeared years ago.  Before offshore pirate radio stations began to broadcast pop music in 1964, there were no other daytime pop music radio stations available to the British public.  These radio stations were funded by advertising. In 1967 the Government introduced legislation which led to the closure of these commercial radio stations.  In the same year it launched Radio 1 to fulfil the clear demand for pop music broadcasting. The wheel came full circle many years ago when commercial radio stations were legalised in the UK.  Now there are a number of national commercial pop music stations and countless  local ones.  There is no need for Radio 1 to be funded with public money. BBC local radio provides a terrific public service but it is to have its budget cut by \u00a35.3 million. Privatise Radio 1 and retain local radio budgets.",
