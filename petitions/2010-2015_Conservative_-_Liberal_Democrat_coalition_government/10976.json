The UK is built on limestone rock and all water takes on limestone from the rocks, hence the water is 'hard' not 'soft'.\r\n\r\nIndividuals are paying a fortune to have 'water softening' plants installed in their homes when all it takes is 'water softening' plants to be attached to all water pumping stations throughout the country.",
