        "additional_details": "In the generation of 'child protection' the needs of teachers, carers and guardians and any other adult involved is put before that of the teenager. There is an unreliable service for teenagers with mental illnesses whether it is an eating disorder or a depression of any kind as cases are often neglected or forgotten in unnecessary waiting lines. In some cases, the health of the adolescent is often avoided or not taken seriously. It is imperative that the priority in any situation is the youth in question, not any factors that will cause restrictions to the mental well-being of the teenager as they are the future of the nation. The support of the individuals and their mental health is the support of the future generation. The constant news of teenage suicides is dramatically increasing because of teenage mental health problems. This is because of the burdens of mental health problems and the disregard to help the youth before they are scarred. Support them now to support the future.",
