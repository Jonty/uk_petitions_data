I feel it is grossly unfair that women have to pay for what their body does naturally and what we have no control over.\r\nOn average women are paying at least \u00a35 per month on products that should be given free as they are essential items for the health and sanitation of our country.\r\nWomen are being taken advantage of financially and its time it stopped. I propose a ban on taxation of sanitary products. ",
