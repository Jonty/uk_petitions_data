        "additional_details": "To the House of Commons. The petition of John BUTLER declares that it is most likely that without positive action by you the country will shortly lose the indigenous capability to profitably manufacture satellite (and rocket booster) propellant tanks.\r\nThe petitioner therefore requests that the House of Commons consider actions that can be taken to prevent loss to the nation of the skills of those who embody this strategic asset.  The now foreign owned company owns a lease on the picturesque canal side design and manufacturing facility that runs out in July 2012.  The present owners of the company will then fill orders by building the tanks in their German facility.\r\nSufficiently large clean room(s) and engineering spaces are required nearby to retain this strategic asset.  Perhaps a source of investment capital could be found and the UK government could offer advice to the company management that it would be worth their while not to relocate.\r\nAnd the petitioner remains, etc. ",
