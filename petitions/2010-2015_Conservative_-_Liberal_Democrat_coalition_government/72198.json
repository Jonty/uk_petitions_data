My dreams answer is Bassingbourn Barracks. That's the place our government should give to all ex services that are homeless. It has everything there. As for those that have served there know. Ex Service men (ha) we dont need no contractors we would have enough experience to run the whole place else-selves. That's exactly what ours lost boys need, comradeship, a sense of purpose, And as they just kicked out the Iraqi trainee troops or whoever they where what a better time to get hold of the place only if i got enough comments could we do something.",
