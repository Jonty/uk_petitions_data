        "additional_details": "Since funding of Synchronised Swimming began in 2007, the Sport has set and achieved competitive targets, capable of performing alongside the World's elite.\r\n\r\nWith a full training programme in place and initially afforded funding for the next Olympic cycle, Synchro now finds itself fighting for its very survival. Dedicated athletes and world-class coaches cast aside by UK Sport.\r\n\r\nAs per many Team sports, Synchro has been 'removed' from UK Sport's funding programme - a victim of the 'no compromise' principle which clearly discriminates against Team sports. When the sport offers so much to, predominately, the female youth of the Country, wider issues are impacted.\r\n\r\nOlympic Legacy should not and cannot be seen to support the 'axing' of Team sport - Synchro and Women's Sport deserves better. Legacy should promote role models to inspire the next generation - not provide the excuse to remove them altogether!\r\n\r\nThe principles of the current funding policy must be challenged and amended.",
