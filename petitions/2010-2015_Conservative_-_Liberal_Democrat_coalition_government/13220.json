        "action": "Stop Manufacturers rigging UK prices to consumers",
        "additional_details": "For years, consumer goods manufacturers, from cars, TVs, computers & watches to clothing & sportswear have rigged UK prices, by getting together & fixing prices or by threatening retailers who want to offer discounts with no longer supplying them if they do.\r\n\r\nIt's illegal but rarely reported, as retailers would lose access to the brand of goods, or they make such profits that they don't care.\r\n\r\nE.g. over 80% of designer spectacle frames & sunglasses come from one company, no matter where you buy them or the designer name, & ones costing \u00a35-10 to make, sell at \u00a3100+,\r\n\r\nWhy pay \u00a3400-700 for metallic paint on cars (which costs manufacturers about \u00a320, & is free in the USA); or 30% more to service your car than at dealers in Europe because manufacturers fix UK labour & parts prices?\r\n\r\nIf you're fed up of being ripped off, sign the petition & tell your friends about it. The Government must act & protect consumers by passing & enforcing free-competition laws in the way the USA has.",
