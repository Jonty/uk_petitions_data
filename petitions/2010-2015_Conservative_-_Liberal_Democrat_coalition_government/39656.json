        "additional_details": "Construction has the highest rate of manual handling incidents and reports more than 25,000 back injuries every year. Nearly half of construction workers over 50 now suffer persistent back pain.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Institute of Occupational Medicine, half of construction employers offer no manual handling training to their workers.\r\n\r\nThe CITB's levy-funded 'Health, Safety and Environment Test' only claims to \"ensure that workers have a MINIMUM level of health, safety and environmental awareness\".\r\n\r\nConsidering back pain costs us \u00a319 BILLION every year, I think that a certification of manual handling training, employing the most efficacious methodologies evidenced, should be mandatory for all UK construction workers and should be Government funded.\r\n\r\nPrevention is far cheaper than treatment.",
