To often the sentence/fine etc does not outweigh the benefit criminals gain from it.\r\n\r\nFrom a non insured driver being charged \u00a3100 when insurance costs \u00a3500 etc - no wonder they don't get insured, to these current rioters who are getting way with looting and burning cars etc while the police sit around not doing anything becuase they will get vilified if they did, as per the student demonstrations.\r\n\r\nI say outweigh the benefit criminals make.",
