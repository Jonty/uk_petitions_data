        "additional_details": "Currently the state retirement pension paid to British expatriates is capped in value to the time that the retiree became an expatriate, leading many into poverty abroad.  These non-domicile pensioners loose out on annual increases and are faced with living on diminished incomes sometimes for many years. Their quality of life is adversely affected by this real and continuing reduction in income.\r\n\r\nI would like parliament to debate the humanitarian arguments for annually increasing expatriates' retirement pensions as it applies to United Kingdom residents.\r\n",
