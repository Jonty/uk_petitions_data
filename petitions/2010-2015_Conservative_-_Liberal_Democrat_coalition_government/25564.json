This is not adequate to protect our island, let alone overseas territories which have entrusted their defence to Britain, or even guarantee strength in diplomacy.\r\n\r\nRetaking the Falkland Islands would be impossible without at least two full size aircraft carriers. It is dangerous to assume that an enemy would not seek to neutralise land based aircraft so proper debate is needed to accelerate the construction of the new aircraft carriers and equip them with suitable aircraft including a naval Typhoon.",
