I propose that drugs be legalised and made free within National Drug Centres.\r\nThe drugs would be administered by a doctor.\r\nThis would ensure that no-one will accidentally overdose or that if something does happen to them, a doctor will always be close enough to help.\r\nLegal drugs would also dispel the appeal for young people who use drugs just because it's forbidden and making drugs free will mean that people wouldn't buy from drug dealers, eventually putting them out of business.",
