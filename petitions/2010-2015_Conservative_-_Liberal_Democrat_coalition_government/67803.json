        "additional_details": "Recent events in Mosul and the threat of annihilation of the Iraqi Christians by ISIS can only be described as horrific, the likes of which has not been seen since the 7th century AD. An 1800-year old Syriac Catholic Church is desecrated and burnt to the ground. Meanwhile, the outside world looks on as if this is but a mere local event.\r\nPlease write to your local MP, talk about the problem to your friends and, in particular, sign this petition to show Her Majesty's government the importance of this issue to every human being in the UK and elsewhere. Maximum pressure needs to be brought on the international community to see this for what it is, the genocide of the Christian in a part of the world in which Christianity was born.",
