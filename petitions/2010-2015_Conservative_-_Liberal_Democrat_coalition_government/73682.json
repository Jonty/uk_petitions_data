I would like Peaceline to offer a more friendly way of reporting anything suspicious. It should be widely advertised on television and ordinary peace loving muslims and others should be encouraged to pass on any information they have.\r\nI would like the phone number  to be some combination of 505 = SOS = Save our Society. Indeed 505 could be Europe wide - against Isis, Eta & IRA",
