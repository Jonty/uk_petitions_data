All he gets is 14 years; is this justice! All the Bulger killers got was 8 years. Oh yes we have mountains of law in this country, we have laws made here and laws made in Europe, we are swamped with law; but we have no justice.\r\nI say the time has come to bring back some common sense to the law of this land so when a killer is sentenced to life it should mean life. Or at least the greater part of the killers life, and to that end life should mean a minimum of 50 years in prison.\r\n",
