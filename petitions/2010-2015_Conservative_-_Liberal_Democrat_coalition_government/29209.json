        "additional_details": "Little Ablerts Pre School faces closure in July 2012 as funding from the RAF is withdrawn. The MOD continues to house service families in Lyneham and they and the local civilian families alike do not want to lose this much loved and outstanding (Ofsted 2010/2011) pre-school. When the tri-service training collage arrives with its 2000 plus staff members and their families the village is going to need this pre-school even more than it does at present. Please help us by signing this petition to prevent the MOD from closing Little Alberts.",
