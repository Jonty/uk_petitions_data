The money raised would provide a governing body to oversee all dog laws, local council regulations and provide extra dog wardens. All dog owners that were found to have an unregistered dog would pay a fine. Any owners that had dogs that were not on a lead in a public place, had a dangerous dog (not breed specific), did not pick up their dog poop etc would have the dog taken from them and have to complete a responsible dog ownership course. Such things as encouraging owners to microchip their dogs and have them vaccinated, as well as taking out public liability insurance, would be part of the governing bodys remit.\r\nIn 2006 it was estimated that there were 10.5 million dogs in England, of which 70% are microchipped.\r\nI believe that the only by responsible dog owners putting money into this are we going to get any action taken.
