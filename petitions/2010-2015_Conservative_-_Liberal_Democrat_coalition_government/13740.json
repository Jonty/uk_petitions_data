The Catholic religion is our native culture, in days gone by it had been used to justify revenge, lust & greed. But when used in it's original form, it like all other religions are peaceful & teach the ideals that most people desire. It does not promote greed or killing (abortion) to obtain profit, it recognises that bad acts harm everyone in the society.",
