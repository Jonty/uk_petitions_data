Both are against animal welfare and lives are put at risk every time they are raced. \"research indicates that around 420 horses are raced to death every year. About 38 per cent die on racecourses, while the others are destroyed as a result of training injuries, or are killed because they are no longer commercially viable.\r\n\" - http://www.horsedeathwatch.com/",
