I would like to ask a very simple question and that is, why was it that the organisation set up to regulate financial services failed so spectacularly?\r\n\r\nI for one would like to know where the prosecutions are for Senior Bank Directors and Building Society Directors who were in charge of companies that were responsible for wholesale miss selling. To date there has been no prosecutions, no banning orders and no fines of any Senior Directors. Why is this? ",
