        "additional_details": "There is an increasing amount of compelling evidence that these EU pensioners are actively promoting and talking up the EU because it is a condition of their pension continuing, that they do.  This introduces a huge conflict of interest in the House of Lords and now that we have evidence that the level of honesty, probity and integrity among our peers is not what we previously believed, we simply cannot trust them to act in the interests of this country when it comes to matters involving the EU when they MUST toe the EU party line to secure their next pension instalment.  The ONLY way we can be sure is for NOBODY occupying a seat in OUR House of Lords to be in the pay of the EU.",
