All electors should have the opportunity to express a view on whether they wish Scotland to separate from the UK, and, in doing so, to fundamentally change their country too.  The relative importance of this vote against that of Scotland may be different but informs politicians of the feeling of the other members of the UK on this issue and concerns raised by it.",
