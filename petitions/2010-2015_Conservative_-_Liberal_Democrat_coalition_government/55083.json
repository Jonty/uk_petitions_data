        "additional_details": "London Fashion Week promotes images of tall, underweight, gaunt young women and presents them as being beautiful and glamorous, as can be seen at the Highlights of London Fashion Week (2013) at http://www.londonfashionweek.co.uk/highlights.aspx. Please visit LFW\u2019s website and if you are unhappy with their photos then please sign this petition and tell/email/phone/text your friends, colleagues and relatives to do the same. In 2012 I contacted Maria Miller, The Mayor of London\u2019s Office and LFW but they ignored my concerns. Yet, as we know, such images put young people at risk of (at best) worries about body shape and feelings of self loathing and (at worst) anorexia and possibly even death. LFW\u2019s organisers know that they are putting under 18s at risk but continue to allow designers to use unrealistic stick-thin models. The UK Government (one of LFW\u2019s sponsors) has a responsibility to protect under 18s and therefore must legislate to prevent the use of underweight models at such events.",
