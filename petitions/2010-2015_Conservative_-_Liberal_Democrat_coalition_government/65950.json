        "additional_details": "In September the government will change the retirement rules so that those who retire after 2016 and who are currently entitled to a full state pension after having contributed to the scheme for 30 years will no longer be eligible and will have to work an additional five years.  Obviously, those who are now over the age of 58 will not be able to do this even if they were not too old to employ.\r\nThis is not only the usual breach of trust by the government but a breach of contract too.\r\nPlease sign this petition to have the date of the introduction of the new rules put back to 2020, at the earliest, in order to give people the opportunity to make up this contrived shortfall in their pension contributions.",
