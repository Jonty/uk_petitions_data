        "additional_details": "Hendre Fourie, born in South Africa, has lived in the UK for eight years so far and his 18 month old son was born in the UK. He has eight caps for representing England in Rugby Union but yet he is facing deportation back to South Africa after injury forced him to retire from professional rugby thus invalidating his visa.\r\n\r\nSign this e-petition if you think you feel the Home Office should step in and rectify this outrageous situation where man can represent England in a major national sport such as rugby on several occasions and yet is still not permitted to claim residency in the UK. Hendre Fourie should be permitted to reside in the UK as a British citizen.",
