They are judging whether a patient is capable of living another few weeks/months when it was suppose to be designed for terminally ill cancer patients who are not capable of living the next few hours/days. It is not scientifically possible to judge for definite how long a person can live,in many cases it had been proven that patients taken off the LCP have gone on to live a healthy life for months after when on the LCP they would be starved and forced to death without there concent because the hospital and doctors feel they are taking up beds and don't want to waste the drugs.
