        "additional_details": "There are currently many millions of analogue radios that are used on a daily basis, not only by householders but also in places of employment, workshops, garages, garden sheds, caravans and vehicles etc.\r\nOn the proposed change-over to digital radio all analogue radios will become obsolete.\r\nIn the current economic climate that is likely to continue for at least the next decade many people will be unable to afford the purchase of digital radios. In the south west of England where there is a  particularly high proportion of pensioners and lower paid employees all  will be disadvantaged. It is a proven fact that digital radio suffers poor quality reception in many rural areas and is likely to remain inferior to that currently existing with analogue reception\r\nThis proposed change-over is purely sponsored by commercial enterprise and profit at the expense of a system that currently meets all of the publics requirements .
