        "additional_details": "Altaf Hussain is Head of a Terrorist Organisation (MQM) in Pakistani city of Karachi. He often uses his party & followers to kill innocent citizens of Karachi & countless times ordered to shut the city and paralyze the life of ordinary citizens. His party has armed wings & they are involved in target killings. Hundreds of cases are registered against Him & his party leaders & members in Karachi & Hyderabad. He is wanted in many cases in Pakistan. He is in the UK since 1992, orders all murders while enjoying lavish life in London. He openly threatened people of Karachi many times on live broadcasts, hence UK authorities hesitate to take any action against him. This turns Pakistani public against UK Govt & authorities as they are not arresting him for his offences. Pakistanis are angry at UK Govt. We request You to either arrest Altaf Hussain for his Murders of innocent people of Karachi & start a trial against him or deport him from the UK. ",
