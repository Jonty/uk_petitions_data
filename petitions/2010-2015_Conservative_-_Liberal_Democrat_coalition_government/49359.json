        "additional_details": "It is well documented that Saudi Arabia and Quatar are funding terrorism in Syria resulting in the deaths of 10s of 1000s of innocent Syrians. The fact that the A-Qaeda terrorists that they support are using chemical weapons and are murdering people based on religion ie The Christians in Alleppo and on ethnicity is a gross violation of any moral or international law. Any country supporting these terrorists should be made to pay for these crimes against humanity. That is why I say we should put heavy sanctions on Saudi Arabia and Quatar.",
