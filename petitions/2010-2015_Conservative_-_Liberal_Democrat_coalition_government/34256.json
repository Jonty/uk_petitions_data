        "additional_details": "Don't waste tax payers money on Common Buzzard management Techniques. I Suggest more Pheasants and Game birds are killed on the roads by motorists than are taken by Birds of prey, maybe game keepers should keep their game under tighter control. so invest in better countryside and rural roadside fencing so these game birds can't run out infront of motorists, Remember the Common Buzzard is a Native British species the Pheasant was introduced dont percicute Native British wildlife because a miniority want to shoot game birds. The Common Buzzard seems to be being made a scape goat for the loss of Game birds when I strongly believe this is not true. I think DEFRA should not fund this study and the proposed money for this should be used for better roadside fencing to prevent the game birds escaping.",
