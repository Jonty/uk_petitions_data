Government need to toughen up, if we are to turn this country around. Prison holds no fear for hardened criminals. Prisoners who have committed the worst of crimes should loose all rights the moment they enter the prison gates, until their release. If prison were more of a punishment people would not want to return, that then answers the problem of overcrowding and saves us tax payers money!",
