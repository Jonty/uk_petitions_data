I would like to see the rules on the tax credits made fair to those on this ad-hoc basis of working because under the current system they are only assuming that everyone is getting a guaranteed 30hours a week, but this isn't the case as more companies are using zero-hours contracts to cut wage bills. I would like to see a qualifying minimum hours set at 15 hours a week regardless of your circumstances single/married etc.",
