        "additional_details": "I propose the reintroduction of National Service at the age of 18 or 19 for two years. The benefits to the country are threefold:\r\n\r\n1. The government wants to save money on the armed forces, the armed forces worry about manpower. Enlisted men on National Service could be paid at a lower rate, fullfilling the armed forces' requirements at lower cost.\r\n2. Youth's serving their country in the armed forces will learn respect for life, their elders, and property. They will gain a sense of respect for their superiors, and a sense of order in their lives, ameliorating the chance of them resorting to criminality in the future, and potentially saving the Home Office a fortune in policing and prisons in the future.\r\n3. Youth's entering National Service will lead a fit and healthy lifstyle, potentially saving the NHS a fortune in the future.",
