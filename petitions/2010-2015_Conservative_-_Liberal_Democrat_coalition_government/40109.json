        "additional_details": "Introduction of a mandatory 99 year prison term in solitary confinement for the murder of a police officer while on duty, or the murder of a police officer off duty in revenge over an issue related to him or her being a police officer. We as member of the public expect that if our families are at risk, that a member of the police force risks their lives to save them. Many of the events we hold as important to us could not happen without the police, the failure of a few cops at Hillsborough caused the death of 96 fans. I have no link to the police I just feel the events of late show the need to protect the police as an attack on the police is an attack on society, its either this or the death penalty or arm the police, it might entail a cost financially, but nothing like the cost the family of a murdered cop has to pay.
