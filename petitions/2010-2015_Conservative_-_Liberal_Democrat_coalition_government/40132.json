        "additional_details": "The current fines for car parking and speeding are unfair. Wreckless high-earners in our society break parking and speeding laws regularly on the basis that they can easily afford to pay the fixed penalty. Changing the law to have parking and speeding fines at 0.5% of pre-tax earnings for the previous tax year would make the charge fairer. A similar scheme is in place in Finland and it seems absurd that the severity of a punishment can be relative to one's ability to pay. I would like this to be given a serious debate in parliament.",
