        "additional_details": "Currently, aircraft flying in to Heathrow will go in to holding patterns, or 'stacks', circling for, on busy days up to twenty minutes in order to make an approach. This is not the case in, for example, London City, which operates reasonably within it's capacity. If Heathrow or another airport were to have an increased capacity, these aircraft would not spend time in these holds burning a simply massive amount of fuel - the emissions  savings we can make in a car are simply irrelevant compared to a Boeing 747 that is flying around in circles (This can amount to almost 5 tonnes of fuel).\r\n\r\nThis would also mean a decrease in noise problems for those living under the holds (Biggin Hill, Lambourne, Ockham, and Bovingdon) and would not necessarily come with an increase in traffic, there would just be less time wasted in circles in the skies of London.",
