We have almost one million young people between and eighteen and twenty four years who are un-employed. This is not their fault as they are all well educated in the main but have no chance of achieving their first job. Poles, Romanians and others poured into the country whilst the last Labour government was in charge without any restrictions placed on them. Our citizens must have priority in every case, we are simply being flooded by these migrants.",
