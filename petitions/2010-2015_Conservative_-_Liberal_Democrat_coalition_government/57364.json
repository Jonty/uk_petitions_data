        "additional_details": "We believe that the speed limit in Central London should be reduced to 20 mph and that, in order to implement this change, responsibility for setting speed limits in London should be transferred from TFL to the Highways Agency.\r\n\r\nLondon represents 14% of the population of the UK.  A strong case can be made therefore for making London speed limits a matter for central rather than local government.\r\n\r\nThe recent well-publicised spate of cyclist deaths makes this a matter of urgency.\r\n\r\nThe average speed in central London is currently less than 9 mph and 19 mph on major roads.  The effect could therefore be neutral to positive on overall journey times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
