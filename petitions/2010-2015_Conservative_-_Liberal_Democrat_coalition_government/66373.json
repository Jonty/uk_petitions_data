        "additional_details": "\r\nAccording to the law, only a man can commit rape (as the penetration has to be with a penis). However, both women and men can be raped. A rape can occur within a relationship or within a marriage.\r\nThe law says:\r\n\u2018A\u2019 is guilty of rape if:\r\nhe intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of \u2018B\u2019 with his penis; \u2018B\u2019 does not consent to the penetration, and\r\n\u2018A\u2019 does not reasonably believe that \u2018B\u2019 consents\r\n\r\nThe law needs to recognize that a woman being forced into sex with either a foreign object (inclusive on sex toys), tongue or fingers by another woman is RAPE.\r\nAlso -\r\n\r\nIf 'B' does not consent to any of the above\r\nOR -\r\n'A' does not reasonably believe that 'B' consents\r\nThis is rape too.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition as this needs to be changed!",
