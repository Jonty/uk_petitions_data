Some animals offered for sale or \u201cfree to good home\u201d can end up in the ownership of unscrupulous people involved in criminal activity, or worse still, animal cruelty such as dog fighting. Some animals are being used as\u201d live bait\u201d for this so called entertainment.\r\nThese internet sites are rapidly expanding and we call upon the Government to bring into effect new legislation or expand existing Animal welfare laws to cover the sales of live animals on Internet sites.\r\n",
