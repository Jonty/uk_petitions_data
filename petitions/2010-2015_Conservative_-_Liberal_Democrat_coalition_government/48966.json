And these are partly if not mostly because of the media in our country telling us all what is beautiful, what is right and what is wrong and how we should look. I would very much like the government to take action on this by forcing the media to reduce the amount of criticism on the appearance of celebrities (weight gain, blemishes, ill accepted change of style), dietary plans and ideal figures, hair, clothes, weight and other articles of that nature.",
