        "additional_details": "We are condemning Syria for unproven use of sarin against citizens/rebels who have been labelled as freedom fighters. Our special ally America indicates a line has been crossed. If chemical weapons have been used, and we do invade to ensure such attrocities end, we must also invade Israel.\r\n\r\nIsrael have recently admitted to using white phosphorus in a manner contrary to international conventions limiting its use. Thus by international standards they have committed chemical warfare against Palestinian citizens/freedom fighters, and therefore require the same global intervention as Syria. Each regime is committing attrocities and each must be stopped.",
