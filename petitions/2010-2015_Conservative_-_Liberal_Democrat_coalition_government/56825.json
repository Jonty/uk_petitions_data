        "additional_details": "You have probably seen in the papers recently the story of a marine who was charged with murder. After serving 5 months in Afghanistan and seeing several of his friends murdered, some of whose body parts were hung in trees as a 'trophy' he had a moment of madness and shot an insurgent who he believed was dead at the time. I think most people will agree with me that it's nothing the insurgents wouldn't have done to them. After serving many years in the marines, tours in Iraq,Ireland and Afghanistan e fighting for OUR freedom, he is now facing life imprisonment. Please sign this petition and help with this injustice.
