        "additional_details": "I want the government to immediately toughen up the rules on age related products in shops. The main issue is smaller shops in communities which often turn a blind eye to many rules. As part of this i want to see all sale of alchol in smaller shops banned till after 9pm and in areas of problem drinkers and anti social behaviour i want low priced alcohol banned on weekends when the problem is at its peak. Furthermore, i want to see harsher punishments and a two strike system introduced when any of these products are sold to or bought for underage people and this includes fireworks. For to long the smaller businesses been allowed to operate without strict control.",
