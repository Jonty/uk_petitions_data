Some disabled people can't stand or transfer by themselves so need the assistance of a carer or partner to help and having a hoist /chair etc reduces the strain of their helpers lifting and struggling by trying to get them in the pool. I know from experience that it can be random to what pools have hoists and what have unisex accessible changing areas but surely this option should be standard to all, so we can all enjoy the experiences like others.\r\n\r\nInclusion is important especially to families, for someone like myself that is a wheelchair user, wife and parent, I want to be able to share together!",
