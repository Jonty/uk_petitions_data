This is particularly a problem in the catering sector. I believe there should be rigid penalties for employers who do this as a deterrent. Many employees do not feel they have the power to stand up for the rights in this regard and employers are complacent believing they will face no consequences. So the law must be much more clear to prevent exploitation. It is unacceptable that this situation exists in the United Kingdom in 2014. ",
