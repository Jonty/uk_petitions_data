        "additional_details": "With all the discussion about Public Sector Pensions, there is continual focus upon 'fairness' to taxpayers.\r\n\r\nThe cost of all public sector pensions is around \u00a34bn per year, while the tax relief afforded to the pensions of those earning more than \u00a3150000 per annum, the top 1% of earners, equates to \u00a310bn.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the government to cut the tax relief on the pensions of those top earners, thus rendering the unaffordability argument for public sector pensions meaningless.",
