Not only to benefit the younger generation but to make the parents more aware that with every passing year, suicide and other knock-on effects that arise from mental health conditions such as depression is escalating at a rapid pace. I would like the Government to pass law that Mental Health should be fully welcomed into the educational curriculum and be a mandatory class for pupils to take. ",
