Hundreds of experienced staff, including caseworkers and solicitors, will be let go following a budget cut of 63%\r\n\r\nEssential services to the public and communities will disappear including free legal representation for victims of discrimination and community engagement work to promote good relations, and work with local authorities & the police when the far right come to town.\r\n\r\nWe are calling for the government to maintain the remit and funding of the EHRC.\r\n\r\n",
