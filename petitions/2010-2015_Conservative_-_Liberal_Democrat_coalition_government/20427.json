        "additional_details": "The reason we need to withdraw from the Common Market in Europe is that we would have to give all powers to EU.  We would be stripped of rights, we do not need quotas as in fishing etc.  There would be restrictions on what we do in UK.  UK would no longer be an a free country.  To withdraw from the Common Market means we do not have to vote for EU Referendum or work towards it.  We know that we no longer be involved in EU.  It costs money.  Each countries have different cultures and their economy is different.  We cannot be responsible if each country gets into trouble.  We will not be a fully functioning country if we are in Europe.",
