        "additional_details": "The US have signed into law a bill to require EpiPens in all schools to provide protection to children with allergies. This allows schools to maintain an emergency supply of EpiPens (adrenalin) to help treat anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction. In the event of an anaphylactic shock, an EpiPen can be used to stop swelling of the throat and tongue. Without this treatment, anaphylaxis is potentially a life-threatening event and can be fatal in minutes. The new law permits staff who have been trained to administer the shot to any student in this emergency situation. I am therefore proposing that the Government introduce new legislation to require all schools to stock EpiPens & be able to administer such medication should any child require it.  ",
