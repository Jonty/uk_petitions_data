        "additional_details": "We, the hard-working, tax-payers want the Government to end the madness that is political correctness. People get into debt and refuse repayment but are protected by the OFT, CAB etc. How can we claw our way out of the economical crisis if we give debtors the option to hide away and allow more and more bad debt? Who do we expect the banks to recoup this from? They have stakeholders. We are quick to judge them but they are only earning a living which is more than most of today's society. Another example is the riots; officers are bound by the Human Rights farce yet homeowners and business owners are seeing their dreams and efforts burnt to the ground. Why are we protecting those who do not deserve it and screwing those that do deserve it? Britain is fast becoming the joke of the world and we must make a stand.\r\n\r\nWe must elect someone to make the risky decisions; it is not just about spending cuts, it is about changing the laws that are the real reason behind our societal detriment.",
