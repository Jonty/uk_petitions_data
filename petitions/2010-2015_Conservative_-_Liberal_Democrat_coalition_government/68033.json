        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are outraged by the polarised and polarising views of Bob Blackman MP as expressed through his Twitter account.\r\n\r\nThere has been a global outpouring of concern and horror at how events have unfolded in Gaza epitomised by the huge demonstrations calling for peace across major capital cities these past two weekends.\r\n\r\nIt is of serious concern that Bob Blackman appears to have jettisoned any semblance of diplomacy and fairness by continually retweeting messages from the Israeli Defence Forces who cannot by any stretch of the imagination be regarded as objective participators in the disaster unfolding in the Middle East. He has also implied that Jeremy Bowen, the respected BBC journalist is a friend of Hamas.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call for a parliamentary review of Bob Blackman's use of social media and expect an apology for his divisive and libellous comments.",
