This huge amount of suffering can easily be avoided by killing the animals in the nearest slaughterhouse to the farm and then transporting their meat and carcasses.\r\n\r\nOn 15 March 2012, the European Parliament adopted Written Declaration 49/2011, which calls on the EU institutions to establish a maximum 8-hour limit on the journeys of animals transported for the purpose of slaughter.\r\n\r\nWe urge the British government to press the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council and EU Commission to review the rules on the welfare of transported animals and bring forward proposals to amend regulation EU 1/2005 to limit the transportation of live animals for slaughter to 8 hours.",
