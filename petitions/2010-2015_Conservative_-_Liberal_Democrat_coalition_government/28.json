        "additional_details": "We want our political system to recognise the abilities of 16 & 17 year olds. To properly include us in our society and show us the trust and respect that society expects of us by giving us the right to vote.\r\n\r\nA 16 year old can:\r\n\u25e6give full consent to medical treatment\r\n\u25e6leave school and enter work or training\r\n\u25e6pay income tax and National Insurance\r\n\u25e6obtain tax credits and welfare benefits in their own right\r\n\u25e6consent to sexual relationships\r\n\u25e6get married or enter a civil partnership\r\n\u25e6join the armed forces\r\n\u25e6become a member of a trade union or a co-operative society\r\n\r\nbut he/she currently cannot have any say in the government that ultimately controls these things. This is wrong.\r\n\r\nVotes at 16 would engage young people with politics in an era where disillusion with the political establishment is at a peak. It would encourage involvement and enthusiasm from young people and most importantly, it would give us a say in how our country is ran.",
