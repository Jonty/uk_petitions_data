I myself have had brilliant support from a doctor I visit regularly and she is very understanding however that is not the story in a lot of cases. A lot of my friends have gone to their GP for support and advice and come away with nothing. Mental illness is still a very big taboo subject and I want to break the stigma. I want the government to realise that people are not going to overcome their mental illness until they are understood and without educating and providing more training for doctors this is not going to happen. I cannot achieve this on my  own so I am asking for you all to just sign this, it doesn't take much. ",
