The bus drivers and transport workers who\r\nrisked life and limb to keep the buses running during those difficult and\r\ndangerous times.\r\n\r\nOrdinary people who helped maintain a sense of normality for the people of\r\nNorthern Ireland by keeping the buses operating during those volatile years.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this petition is to ask for those bus drivers and transport\r\nworkers who endured and survived those difficult times to receive an\r\nappropriate award in recognition of their courage and determination to\r\nprovide that vital service to passengers throughout Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nFor those who went to work and lost their lives, their families deserve a\r\nfitting tribute in the form of a specially designed posthumous medal in\r\nrecognition of the \u2018terrible price\u2019 their loved ones paid.\r\n\r\nThank you for signing this petition.\r\n",
