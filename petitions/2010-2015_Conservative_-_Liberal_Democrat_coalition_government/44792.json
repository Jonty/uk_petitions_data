        "additional_details": "This petition is to show our Government that the UK's people are tired of Outdated equipment and tactics towards Snow and Icy conditions come winter time.\r\n\r\nYear on year, parts of the UK grind to a standstill due to Local Councils failing to react effectively to the threat of Snow and Ice, Thus posing a threat to Life.\r\n\r\nOther Countries such as Sweden, Norway, Germany, USA and Canada continue regardless of the amount of snow and ice forecast because they have the Equipment to deal with bad Weather Conditions.\r\nThe UK however grinds to a halt with as little as 2in of Snow, when other Countries have had as much as 6ft!\r\n\r\nEnough is Enough.\r\nIt's time to act and stop hiding behind excuses such as, \"It doesn't snow enough to warrant upgrading and spending\"\r\nOr,\r\n\"Freak weather conditions, that we rarely encounter\".\r\n\r\nSign this Petition, and make a stand if you are fed-up of poor road conditions in winter.",
