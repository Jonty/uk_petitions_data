All other games are being shown on Premier Sports channel only available to Sky subscribers and at a monthly fee. As a competition of national and international importance this is unacceptable, it make the RLWC an elitist viewing competition. The BBC should show all the games, if only in an highlights format on one of its 4 channels as a matter of public interest.",
