        "additional_details": "The Nationwide Association of Blood Bikes is forced to meet rising fuel prices year on year. NABB's single biggest running cost is fuel.\r\n\r\nNABB not only save the NHS considerable monies, they provide a much needed out of hours medical essentials courier service, free of charge - entirely run by volunteers and charitable donations.\r\n\r\nAllowing NABB member groups to recoup fuel duty would be of major benefit and allow NABB to expand it's vital service operations.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to have an urgent review of this situation and in doing so we call on the government to return in the form of grants to NABB member groups all the future fuel duty which the Treasury collects from them.",
