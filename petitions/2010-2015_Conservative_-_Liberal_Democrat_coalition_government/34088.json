        "action": "Mark future World Telecommunication and Information Society Day",
        "additional_details": "Today (May 17th) is World Telecommunication and Information Society Day (WTISD).  Its purpose is \"to help raise awareness of the possibilities that the use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies (ICT) can bring to societies and economies, as well as of ways to bridge the digital divide\".  This year's theme is \"Women and Girls in ICT\".\r\nAll of this fits well with stated governement direction on techology and growth and yet I can find no events in the UK which mark this day.  This petition calls on the UK govenrment to ensure that in the future WTISD  is marked in an appropriate manner.",
