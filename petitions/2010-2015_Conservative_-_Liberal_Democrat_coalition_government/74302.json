        "additional_details": "Currently the walk in service that we offer at the Thurrock Health Centre is under review and a public consultation is due to be held in February\r\n\r\nThe service was originally commissioned due to the lack of local GPs and access to primary care and to our knowledge, this has not changed.\r\n\r\nMany walk in centres have been shut across England in the last 2 years and we strongly believe this service is required in the local area as health needs/demands along with pressures on GP practices and other health services is at an all time high. By having a walk in centre in the area, it gives another option to patients who may not be able to attend their own surgery quickly and is convenient as the opening hours are 8-8pm 365 days a year. It also relieves pressure on the emergency services as patients are less inclined to attend A+E.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t want the Thurrock Health Centre Walk In to close please support the campaign by signing this e-petition.",
