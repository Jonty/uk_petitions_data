        "additional_details": "Very simply people should do jobs in the community for a few hours a day, i.e cleaning graffiti,cutting grass,picking up litter etc in order to earn their dole. This not only proves that you are willing to work, but also gets people used to working again if they havent done so for a while.\r\nAs the groups of people would be supervised (similar to community service) the individuals could have a report marked down for them by the supervisor to say how they perform. This would be very helpful for potential employees to see. To simplify, if someone hasnt worked for a year but genuinly wants to work,then it is hard for an employer to justify taking them on,but if the person has a report to say how hard they worked for the benefits,it helps the employees case. unemployment goes down,less taxes have to be paid by everyone else,england becomes a pround country again.ANYONE WHO DOESNT COMPLY GETS BENEFITS LOWERED/LOST.",
