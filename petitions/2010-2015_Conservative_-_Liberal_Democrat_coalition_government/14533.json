(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-10927410)\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Red Arrows are a good thing - they are world known for their skills and displays and show the good side of Britain as a whole. Men and women join our Air Force to one day have a chance of flying with the Arrows - a good recruitment tool.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the best of the best, the Red Arrows are Britain's 'Top Guns' - it would be a shame to see them go.\r\n\r\nThis petition shows how proud the British public are of the Red Arrows and what they represent - the best of British and we want them to stay!!",
