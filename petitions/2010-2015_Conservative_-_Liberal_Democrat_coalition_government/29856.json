Who actually benefits? The public have a right to a clear debate and explanation as this printed money could, for example, be spent on government projects that fuel employment and positive consumer spending cycles.\r\n\r\nLet's hope it's not just funding banks and bankers bonus' - let's have a transparent explanation and analysis of exactly where this money is going.",
