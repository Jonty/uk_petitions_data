The tourisum that these women and men have created would be lost to the communities and further generations.Whether they were guilty or innocent is not for us to say, we were not there and the time of witch trials was a very different one to that of today. If anyone should ask for a pardon it should be the direct descendants of those accused.\r\n\r\nTo have the convictions over turned would be the ultimate betrayal to those that did practice the craft and died for their faith. If this decision was made then all claims to saint hood, for example, would have to be disputed.\r\n\r\nTo pardon them would just make them innocents that were killed by the establishment. ",
