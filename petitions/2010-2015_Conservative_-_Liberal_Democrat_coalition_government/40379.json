        "additional_details": "There is currently a TV advertising campaign warning of the danger on Railway Crossings.\r\nI would like to have the rule regarding the use of Train Warning Horns reverted to using both high and low tones instead of the current 'low tone only rule'.\r\nIf you ask any child what noise a Train makes, they all give the same answer, nee-nor, or, dee-dah, or something similar.\r\nThe new rule of only using the low tone could easily be misinterpreted as being from a road vehicle or a water born vessel.\r\nIn my opinion, when it comes to Foot Crossings, this is an accident waiting to happen.\r\nIt may have been a contributory factor in this incident;  Fatal accident at Mexico footpath crossing (near Penzance) 3 October 2011.\r\nI too, as a Train Driver, have had near misses at various sites and am convinced that the use of both high and low tones of the Warning Horn may well have prevented these incidents.\r\nI would urge the Minister in charge to review this change in the Drivers Rules without delay.
