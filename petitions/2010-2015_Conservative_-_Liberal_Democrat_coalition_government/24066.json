If you look at the vast majority of 17 year olds compared with 24 year olds you will notice a massive difference.\r\nThis is another illustration of businesses being pushed too far by government schemes advocating fines to prevent a minority purchasing alcohol.\r\nChallenge 25 was enforced by certain companies and retail of Alcohol Standards Group in 2005. It was enforced even though the standards groups own statistics state that 90% of 18-24 years olds are aware of the Challenge 21 scheme.\r\nThis is discrimination toward the many responsible younger consumers based upon the under-age attempting to buy alcohol and few reckless drinkers whom are often in the press, meaning the younger consumers appeared more reckless than they were.
