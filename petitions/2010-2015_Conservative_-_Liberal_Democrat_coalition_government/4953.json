        "additional_details": "I would like the government to review and legislate to prevent oil companies from fleecing the public.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that when the price of oil goes up, the forecourt prices go up very quickly yet when the price of oil comes down there is very little reduction in the price of fuel. It appears that oil companies use this as an excuse to push prices up all the time.\r\n\r\nIf you look at peak oil price and the price now, 90$ish a barrel,  the cost of fuel is now more than when it peaked.\r\n\r\n",
