        "additional_details": "I work as an Enforcement Officer within Environmental Health department at Walsall MBC in the West Midlands.\r\n\r\nIt is becoming increasingly difficult to prosecute offenders for fly tipping. Even when there is very good evidence, we still rely on the suspect attending a voluntary interview in relation to the matter.\r\nIf the suspect choses not to co-operate, we have to convince the Court of his or her guilt without having asked that person any questions about it.\r\nEye witness evidence is not enough. The whole incident needs to be recorded on film. Although we have done this in the past, to actually obtain that kind of footage, is rare.\r\n\r\nFly Tipping is a Criminal Offence, yet is currently not arrestable. Offences of this nature are on the increase and ruin our Towns & Landscapes. The lawless people responsible for committing these offences need to know that they can be arrested and charged with it, like any other Criminal Offence.",
