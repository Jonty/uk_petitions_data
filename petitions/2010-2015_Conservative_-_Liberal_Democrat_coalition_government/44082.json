        "additional_details": "On 3rd January 2013, it was announced that Hendre Fourie had to retire from Rugby Union after taking medical advice.\r\n\r\nHendre worked incredibly hard in an attempt to come back from the injury, but unfortunately medical advice has indicated it will not be possible for him to play professional rugby again. Over the next few days, it came out that there was a chance that Fourie was poised to return to South Africa because he cannot get a visa to remain in the country he represented now he is not playing professionally.\r\n\r\nWe, the Rugby family ranging from his team-mates and supporters, plead to the Home Office to reconsider this decision as this man has represented this country in rugby many times, and even had a child here. He has paid his taxes since coming over to live in this country and said he wants to stay in this country and get a job teaching children. Please may the Home Office see sense and let him stay in the country he loves.",
