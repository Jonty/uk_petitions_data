        "additional_details": "I start this petition with regards to the way the officials treat people at this Embassy. I and the rest of the people have to stand outdoors in the freezing cold all day while the embassy officials sip up a cup of tea indoors. What are the big offices indoors for? The queues are small but the wait is so very long causing chaotic attendance of customer service by an abrupt and rude obnoxious person at the little window to submit passport applications. When the applications are ready the passports given through the window and sometimes through the door where the security guard stands is disgraceful. No clear instructions on any particular website, Rude and obnoxious officers. ",
