        "action": "End UK nuclear dependence",
        "additional_details": "Under the 1958 Mutual defense agreement, the UK received various military nuclear weaponry and delivery systems etc form the US, since then the UK has based its nuclear deterrence on these systems, relying on US support and expertise. Which under the Mutual defense act limits what the UK can do with it along with other things.\r\nThis treaty is due to be renewed in 2014, which will hamper the UKs chance to be an independent nuclear power. I would like the UK to develop its own nuclear deterrent and delivery systems, and cease use of or reliance on US systems",
