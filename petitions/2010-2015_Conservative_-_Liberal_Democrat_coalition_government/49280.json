His curly locks and cutting side-burns, coupled with beautiful tones gracing wonderful melodies are missed in the Rovers. After the crushing disappointment that has been Karl murdering Sunita Alahan - the street needs a bit of joy, that can't simply be reached through Devendra's White funeral robes. Vernon (Ian Reddington) once displayed the passion needed to lure the enigmatic, 'celebate' Liz McDonald - and needs to return and bring back the joy which once filled millions of viewers evenings with laughter, warmth and music.\r\n\r\n#BRINGBACKVERN",
