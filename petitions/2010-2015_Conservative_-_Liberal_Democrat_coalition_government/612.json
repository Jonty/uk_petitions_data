        "additional_details": "Since the Lisbon Treaty the EU currently has control over a majority of British law, allowing it to override the wishes of the British people and their elected representatives. British people are able to elect representatives to less than 10% of the seats in the European Parliament, and the supreme body, the European Commission, is unelected. The result of these facts is that most power over our lives is in the hands of politicians and bureaucrats who cannot be voted out by the British people - this is an affront to democracy and is a national disgrace.\r\n\r\nMembership also necessitates subscription to the ECHR - it was this court that recently forced the Government to pay taxpayers' money in compensation to a remorseless axe murderer on the grounds that not being given the vote whilst in prison was against his human rights.\r\n\r\nWe demand that Government give us the choice to decide how we are governed through a Yes/No referendum on our continued membership of the union.",
