This should be headed by Nigel Farage and all members of this government should have at least 10 years doing a 'proper job' and two years work experience volunteering in the public sector.  They should all be taught to answer direct questions, not to lie and claim every last penny on expenses.  They would not need to know everything but have access to those who do.  The main thing would be for them to have a little common sense and thought for the common man - and woman.",
