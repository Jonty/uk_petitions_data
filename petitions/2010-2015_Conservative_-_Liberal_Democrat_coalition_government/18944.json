        "additional_details": "We believe that the House of Lords is essential for British democracy. It provides common sense and helps to keep the Government from getting too powerful. It helps to give a balanced opinion and does not have to worry about making populist and partisan moves to get re-elected We believe that the House of Lords can only achieve this if ALL peers, hereditary and life, have the right to sit and vote AND have the ability to veto bills. To achieve this, the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 (except reducing the maximum life of parliament to five years) and the House of Lords Act of 1999 need to be repealed.",
