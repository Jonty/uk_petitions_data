        "additional_details": "Building regulations Part P criminalises any attempt by competent home owners from repairing or renovating the electrical infrastructure in their own home. Home owners can modify wiring, but only by submitting an application which costs hundreds of pounds. The application process seems to be there to cost the home owner money, and doesn't necessarily improve the quality of the installation.\r\n\r\nPart P treats home owners as incompetent, not trusted to embark on home repairs, which encourages home owners to leave sub-standard or pre-war wiring intact.\r\n\r\nPart P penalises the UK electrical industry by discouraging purchasing and installation of modern electrical infrastructure, and impacts the UK economy.",
