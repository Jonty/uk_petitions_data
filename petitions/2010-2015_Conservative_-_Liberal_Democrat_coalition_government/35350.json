        "additional_details": "Today (25th June 2012) the PM raised the problem of our welfare system and the \"entitlement generation\"...and that benefits should maybe be cut. Remove their benefits and social problems are sure to rise for the rest of us..criminal activity etc.\r\n\r\nChange the social contract to make work and benefits go hand-in-hand....and that doesn't mean cheap labour for corporates.\r\n\r\nThis national work programme would be out of the business and commercial sphere and more at a community level.  A chance to learn new skills, gain respect in the community and contribute something to the country in return for benefits.  Big Society?\r\n\r\nThink of it as an expansion and support of the charity and community sector, lots of ideas, no space here to elaborate. Whatever benefits, everyone can contribute something.  Change the balance (motivation) for those people that have a chance to move on from benefits, whilst those with no other choice still have the welfare state supporting their basic needs.",
