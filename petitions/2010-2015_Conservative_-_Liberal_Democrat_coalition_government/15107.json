        "additional_details": "It would be much easier to reduce the vieolence and fighting in places like Sudan if we or the UN were to purchase or trade for their weapons.\r\nIn places like Libya it would be far easier to disarm the civilians and secure peace if they were paid to relinquish their weapons, even greater would be public statments that the weapons they carry are tainted with the blood of their own people.\r\nThe metal that many of these weapons are made of is worth more as scrap value than their purchase cost and the profits made from buy backs and amnesties could be funneled back into communities or fund the programs.\r\nThe money currently spent on medical treatments could be re-deployed to other serious medical issues.",
