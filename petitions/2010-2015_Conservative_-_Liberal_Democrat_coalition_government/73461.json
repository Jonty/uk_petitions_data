        "additional_details": "The Al Sweady enquiry has, save for a few procedural matters, exonerated members of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of any of the so called \"war crimes\" that they stood accused of and gave rise to the enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe enquiry has concluded that the allegations were totally spurious and without foundation and that they were palpably and clearly spurious.\r\n\r\nPublic Interest Lawyers must have or ought to have known this too and yet they persisted in pursuing these allegations on behalf of their dishonest clients at public expense. I call upon HM Government to launch an enquiry into the ethics of Public Interest Lawyers and the entire legal industry that has developed in order to, quite frankly, fleece the public purse",
