It's magazine, website and podcast  provides a window into a way of life that is both distinctly British but also very worldly.  It truly epitomises the very best of UK culture and is up there with the World Service  in representing all that is Great about Britain.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that this vital media outlet is worth saving and that the UK Government should nationalise the institution to save it for all future generations in the UK and overseas.",
