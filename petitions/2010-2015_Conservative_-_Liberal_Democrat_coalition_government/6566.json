        "additional_details": "During times of high unemployment and economic crisis the prospects of finding jobs in the UK is limited. However, there are many job opportunities around the world that may be attractive to UK citizens. At the moment there is no assistance for UK citizens who have been offered a job abroad. They therefore have to make their own visa and travel arrangemets at a cost that may prohibit them from seeking work abroad or accepting an offer of work abroad. The saving to the country in welfare benefits and the administration of benefit claims would offset the cost of assistance to those seeking work abroad. ",
