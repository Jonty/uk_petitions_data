        "additional_details": "RBS Chief is creating waves by saying \"free banking could end\". Lets stop this before it gains momentum. We pay more than enough into banks, so having to pay for our banking is WRONG, WRONG, WRONG! They have the luxury of OUR BACS-(Wages), OUR SAVINGS & ASSETS-(Mortgages). Put it this way, you never hear about the poor bonuses paid out in the hundreds of thousands, even millions for the elite banker bosses, yet they want more from you & me. Sorry, but no thanks.",
