        "additional_details": "Motorists in the UK currently pay the highest percentage of fuel duty according to a study conducted by the European Commission called the Oil bulletin. The bulletin allows for direct comparison of Petrol/Diesel prices at the pump across the member states of the European Union.\r\n\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/energy/observatory/oil/bulletin_en.htm\r\n\r\nThe level of UK fuel duty is the highest amount per litre in real terms throughout Europe on both Unleaded and Diesel fuels (at the present level, approximately 60% of the price consumers pay for their fuel goes directly to HM Treasury.)\r\n\r\nThe government intends to add a further 3p to the duty in January 2013 on top of expected rises in oil price.\r\n\r\nThis has a dramatic effect on families and companies in the UK directly and indirectly and must be reconsidered to help stimulate the economy.\r\n\r\nThe fuel duty should be revised and reduced and the amount of fuel duty paid should also be clearly marked on any receipt as a legal requirement.\r\n",
