        "additional_details": "The UK has not contributed even a single symbolic penny to the International Space Station and it's about time that changed. The ISS is humanities crown jewel in space, a floating laboratory with a vast amount of science experiments taking place on board.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government also needs to contribute money to the European Space Agency's Astronaut Corps so that more British Astronauts like Maj. Tim Peake can be trained and inspire the British public. The UK Government needs to clearly state that it supports manned space flight and join the rest of Europe, Canada, Russia, Japan and the United States in meaningful funding for the exploration and habitation of space.",
