It would give young people the basics they need in order to make informed choices on voting for political parties and in referenda. Just look at the recent sham that was the referendum on AV for instance, it was very hard to find unbiased information in order to make an informed decision. It is also probable that it would drive up interest in politics and the number of under 24's voting in elections.",
