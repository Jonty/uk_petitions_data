        "additional_details": "The blended diet is a form of diet mostly used for children and adults requiring tube feeding, either via NG or gastrostomy.\r\nCurrently this form of diet is not promoted, nor supported by the NHS and in many parts of the UK parents are being ignored and given misleading advise about it.\r\n\r\nWe would like to ask the UK Government to review the current lack of knowledge within and support by the NHS of this diet. Parents should be given a choice and appropriate support by a nutritionist/dietician, whatever diet they choose for their child/dependant. This support should also reach as far as educational services and other community services, for the Blended diet to be acknowledged as appropriate form of nutrition.\r\n\r\nOn the longterm this would help decrease costs for the NHS - reduced demand for special formula milks as well as medications.",
