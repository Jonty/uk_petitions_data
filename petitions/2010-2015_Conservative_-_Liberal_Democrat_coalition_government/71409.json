Year on year local authorities have reduced their responsibilties with regards to  their properties, passing on responsibilty for more maintenance to the tenant.\r\n\r\nHundreds of long term tenants find themselves caught in the rent trap despite actioning their right  to buy find that the actual financial discount is just over 50% of what they are entitled to.\r\n\r\nIs it truely legal to confirm 70% discount but only give 37.5% in real terms?  Free up tenants and really give them the right to buy.   This should be backdated  to 1  Jan  2014  and allow those who had to withdraw their applications  to reapply with no increase in the value of their home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
