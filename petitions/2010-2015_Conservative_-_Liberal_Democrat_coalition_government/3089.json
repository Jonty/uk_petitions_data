There should be no links between them and there should be no power given to UK churches or any other religious bodies as they are not elected officials.\r\n\r\nBoth the Church of England (Anglican church) and the Church of Scotland are still nominally established churches, and the British monarch is the titular head of the Anglican church and cannot be or marry a Catholic. In England, Church appointments are Crown appointments, the Church carries out important state functions such as coronations, and a number of high Church officials have seats in the House of Lords. The Church of Ireland was disestablished as early as 1871; the Church in Wales was disestablished in 1920. ",
