        "additional_details": "Prime Minister Questions (PMQs) are full of party politics now a days and over excited MPs.\r\n\r\nAt a time when the country is in need of help from the government in terms of the economy and health, questions to the Prime Minister and answers from the Prime Minister should be related to national issues rather than party politics. Party politics and party issues should be dealt with outside of PMQs. The Prime Minister should also have to answer the question directly rather than avoiding it.\r\n\r\nMPs should behave as adults and professional rather than ignorant school kids shouting over the top of each other. It's about time that MPs behaved better than school kids rather than worse. MPs should recieve classes on the way in which they conduct themselves.\r\n\r\n",
