That is 30 days served in an operational unit to qualify.\r\n\r\nThe men who fought and died for our country must be given the respect due to them.\r\n\r\nMany have been rejected for a Bomber Command Clasp because they did not spend long enough on an \u201coperational\u201d unit.\r\n\r\nExample: One man was posted to 622 Squadron, at Mildenhall, Suffolk, in February 1945, he flew 10 sorties, all against targets in Germany, although his aircraft had to turn back early on one flight after an engine caught fire.\r\nHe served on an operational unit for 73 days - 13 more than the 60 day minimum specified by the Ministry of Defence on its \u201celigibility criteria\u201d for those applying for the clasp.\r\nHowever, officials have told him that to receive it, he must have first served an additional 60 days, to have first qualified for the 1939 to 1945 Star, onto which the clasp must be affixed.\r\n",
