        "additional_details": "The 70th Anniversary of the D Day landings highlighted the fact that there will soon be no remaining veterans to tell the horrific tale first hand. The National Curriculum should include a compulsory short trip to Normandy where children in secondary education are taken to the beaches, shown the extensive video footage available in the museums and visit one or two of the many cemeteries where they can read the ages on the headstones and understand that boys not much older than themselves gave up their lives in order to secure the future for them. Reading about it is one thing - actually being there makes it far more real and meaningful. There will soon be no veterans left to tell the tale, so it's vital that acknowledgement of what those heroic and brave souls did for us all is kept alive through our children.",
