        "additional_details": "Environmental Health Practitioners routinely inspect  properties, requiring improvements to remove hazards that could impact upon the health of the occupants. Improvement works on listed buildings are often prevented or made excessively costly and restrictive by draconian planning rules counteracting the potential benefits. The government should relax planning legislation where action under the Housing Act 2004 is required to make homes healthy and safe places to live. With the number of people suffering from fuel poverty increasing, people living in conservation areas or in listed buildings should not be prevented or restricted from having safe and energy efficient homes. Hundreds of thousands of homes will become unlettable by 2018 when new energy performance regulations are planned to take effect. Many improvement under the new Green Deal scheme will also likely be impacted upon. Healthy,  energy efficient homes and reducing fuel poverty should come first!",
