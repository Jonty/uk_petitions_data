        "additional_details": "This is a petition against the proposals by the current government to pay benefits into a card scheme limiting what claimants can spend thier benefits on.\r\nMany claimants, (and low income workers too!) rely on being able to carefully budget thier money like going to charity shops or cheap online auctions for clothes/ homewares, buying items in small local shops/ markets. Chain stores simply are too expensive. How will parents pay for school trips? How will somone studying or re-training pay for required books or DVDs for thier course?\r\nIn addition to these, and countless other issues, this will also increase the crime rate as people become desparate for cash to survive.\r\nIt will also cause the demise of small businesses in deprived areas, which have relied upon the regular custom of low income people local to their area.\r\nWe, the undersigned, strongly urge the government to re-consider this proposal.\r\nThanking you for your attention in this matter; ",
