        "additional_details": "Lung cancer kills more people a year than any other cancer. In 2012, more than 34,000 died from Lung cancer in the UK, that's 97 people day. In comparison, 11,600 people died of Breast Cancer, when it's the most common cancer in the UK. That's down to the screening processes that are in place & more funding into research. In majority of cases, when Lung Cancer is diagnosed, it is already at a late stage, making it more difficult to treat. If annual CT scanning was offered to high risk individuals of Lung Cancer I.e over 55, current or former smoker, and have had cancer before, many lives could be saved. This is because symptoms of lung cancer can go un noticed, and because Chest X-Rays don't always pick up Lung Cancer, leading to a mis-diagnosis. This petition is to change the way we screen for lung cancer so that more lives can be saved. If this screening procedure was in place, it could've saved my mum's life.",
