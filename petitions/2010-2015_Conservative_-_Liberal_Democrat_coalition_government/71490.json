Cancer is an illness, heart disease is an illness, epilepsy is an illness and it a grossly offensive insult to sufferers, who would choose not to have their illness, when anybody describes drug abuse as an illness, which sufferers actively choose to abuse drugs.  It should also be made illegal for taxpayer pounds to be used in the treatment of drug abusers, THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO TAKE OUT PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE FOR TREATMENT OF THEIR LIFESTYLE CHOICE.",
