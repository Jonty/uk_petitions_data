We need an outright ban on using these products and not allowed to be sold in shops, classifieds or online in the UK or destined for the UK so the above is all illegal and a law can be passed:\r\n\r\nProng/pinch collars, spray collars, choke chains, shock collars and anything barbaric not to be used on animals in the UK.\r\n\r\n. The metal spikes pinch the skin around dogs\u2019 necks when they pull and can scratch or puncture them.\r\n\r\nProng collars are a quick fix and will not teach the dog not to pull or lunge on the lead.\r\n\r\nDogs may well interpret the tightening of a prong collar around their neck as a stranglehold (which it is, after all!) and become fearful or even aggressive.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE WISH AN OUTRIGHT BAN ON USE, SELLING IN ANY WAY ON THE ABOVE ITEMS.\r\n",
