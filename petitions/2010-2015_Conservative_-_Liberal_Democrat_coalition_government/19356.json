Now the government has introduced a children\u2019s ISA lets have an employer\u2019s ISA.\r\n\r\nWhy should you sign this petition?\r\n\r\n1.\tThis is a simple easy employer savings scheme, and could be an alternative to the NEST scheme which is restrictive and cumbersome in many ways\r\n\r\n2.\tIt is a low cost savings scheme for providers to administer, and therefore would benefit them as well\r\n\r\n3.\tIt will benefit lower paid workers with tax-efficient income in retirement (potentially tax-free income) which means they have more money in retirement\r\n\r\n4.\tIt has the potential to provide income during periods of unemployment putting less pressure on the state\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the government to think outside of the box when it comes to encourage people to take control of their retirement income.\r\n",
