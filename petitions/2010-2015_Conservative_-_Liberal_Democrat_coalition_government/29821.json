        "additional_details": "Ofgem has not gone far enough to promote competition among energy suppliers when offering business customers a fair deal. A few simple changes to customer correspondence would make it easier to switch supplier and result in more businesses doing so. This would encourage the suppliers to sharpen their pencils and offer more competitive rates to retain their business customers in the first place. 'Make It Cheaper' research shows that 96% of businesses share this view. So, as a business energy user, I would like:\r\n1.\tEach bill I receive from my supplier to clearly highlight my contract end date and any notice period required to terminate.\r\n2.\tEach renewal letter I receive from my supplier to be sent by Recorded Delivery and show the difference between the current rates charged and the proposed renewal rates in \u00a3s and %. I'd also like it to explain how & when to serve notice if I am to prevent my business from being automatically rolled into a new contract on the proposed renewal rates.\r\n",
