People will move and will not be traced.\r\nMy petition is to get the Government to go one step further and insist that the owners (and breeders) National Insurance No. is included on the form.\r\nThis number is with us from the moment we are born until we die, it cannot be changed and it is traceable. It will also help with the back yard breeder and puppy farmers, who are out to make profit on animals and not pay tax on their income. ",
