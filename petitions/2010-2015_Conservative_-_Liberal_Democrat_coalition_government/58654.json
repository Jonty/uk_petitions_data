Reports that political party activists in the leadership office on the taxpayer payroll have increased exponentially since 1990 reveals just how disingenuous our elected leader, who promised (yes, another one, just like his promise on an EU referendum) to cut the cost of politics has been.  SOMEBODY must do something to take him under control before he becomes the biggest employer in the country. If Mr Obama can have a legally binding  budget to operate to for his administration costs then, surely, a political minnow like Cameron should have one.",
