There are 2 countrys i know that have heavy internet censorship china and north korea. both under heavy dictatorship.\r\n\r\nThis is a breach of basic human rights of free speech along with restricting foreign communication.\r\n\r\nThis should not be allow to be made a prescident where large media companys can simply block sites because they do not like how they are run.\r\n\r\nThis is like suspecting your neighbour of stealing your lawnmower so you put a ten foot fence around his house instead of dealing with the issue with him.\r\n\r\nPlease can the goverment step in, over rule these judgings and help settle this matter in a fair and sensible fashion.",
