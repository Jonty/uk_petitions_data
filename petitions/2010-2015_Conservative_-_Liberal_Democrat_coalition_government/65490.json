Roads made of durable, economical, enviromentally friendly hexagon solar panels. There are already two working prototypes, YES, the technology is there. This will lower energy prices, generate enough clean energy to power the country, even if everyone was using eletric cars. It can also make driving, walking, cycling safer and secure. But I'm not the best at explaining this, I understand, so here is a link to a video that can explain it better:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.indiegogo.com/projects/solar-roadways#home\r\n\r\nWorth it?
