        "additional_details": "When the UK originally joined the Common Market which became the EC and then the EU,it was not made clear that this would pave the way to the intricate arrangement that we are subject to today.It is now time for Parliament to allow a referendum as promised by Mr Cameron.He well knows that a large majority of the country would sanction either a complete withdrawal,or a renegotiation of the present liabilities.We have an amount of one billion pounds paid in benefits to immigrants, being sent abroad annually.The Euro is totally inflexible,and has led to the present financial drain towards countries who fiddled figures to join,or have lax financial controls.The UK attempts to keep to the rules.Many other members ignore them,to gain an economic advantage.Maybe we are too entwined with our continental cousins,but a positive vote would certainly allow us to gain better terms.",
