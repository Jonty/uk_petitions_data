        "additional_details": "Please prevent our Prime Minister making fatuous comments on the suspension of Jeremy Clarkson suspension by BBC.  Quite rightly ePetition does not accept petitions on Jeremy Clarkson being suspended as it is a BBC matter.  For the same reason Mr. Cameron must be refrained from making comments on the case as it is not a matter for the Government.  Mr. Cameron's comments can only serve to prejudice the investigations and eventual actions by BBC.  He cannot evade responsibility by saying its not a matter for him and yet use his office to support his allegedly violent friend.",
