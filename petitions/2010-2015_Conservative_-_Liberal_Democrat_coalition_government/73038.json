        "additional_details": "The proposed enactment of The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2014 has raised some very important questions, ethically and scientifically.\r\n\r\nWhile the introduction of NSP has created real and profound health problems, the use of criminal law to deal with these issues is problematic. One effect is the placing compounds into the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, placing them outside regulatory systems, and into the hands of criminals. As an effect, the banning will promote the use of this substance as a recreational drug, and more people will use than currently, with less quality control.\r\n\r\nIn the tradition of scientists such as Sir James Clerk Maxwell, ethical self-study has found possible clinical and scientific benefits to this compound..\r\n\r\nThis is not a solution. This is making the problem worse, and I demand an answer from the people that are placed to protect us as to why this is.\r\n\r\nMatt Adamson LLB LLM\r\nDirector\r\n\r\nSecond Movemet Legal Intelligence Ltd",
