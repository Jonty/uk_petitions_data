        "additional_details": "We rented a property to someone in receipt of direct payment Housing Benefit.  He chose not to pass his rent payments to us resulting in Court proceedings. His total debt is over \u00a32500.00 and he was ordered to repay the debt by installments which he has refused.  As he does not own anything, the bailiffs were unable to seize goods or money.  We paid hundreds in Court costs to get nothing in return.  The Government has made a big mistake which in turn is costing the Landlord thousands in lost rent arrears and court costs.  To make matters worse, the Government has now given the defaulting tenants the right to appeal against eviction!  We need to make a firm stand against these people and the Government needs to wake up and see the damage these rediculous rules have caused.  The landlord has zero rights and even less chance of recovering any debt owed which is a gross misjustice which must be addressed.",
