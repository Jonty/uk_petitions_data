        "additional_details": "BBC 3 is a channel that caters primarily for teens, young adults and young professionals.\r\nBy cutting this channel the BBC no longer have a dedicated terrestrial channel for this age category, despite the persons in this category paying their licence fee. Yet the BBC have two channels for children, one for Gaelic speaking viewers and a 24 hour news channel. This is not acceptable\r\n\r\nThe new programming that has come from BBC 3 has helped shape the culture of our demographic for the last ten years, that would be lost if it were to come off the air.\r\n\r\nInternet speeds, particularly in rural areas may not be fast enough to stream content and it will cost extra when people go over their download limits when streaming media.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should maintain BBC 3 and find savings in other channels such as BBC2, BBC4, BBC News24, CBBC and CBeebies.\r\n\r\n",
