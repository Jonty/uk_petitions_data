Cities such as Leeds, Manchester, NewcastleGateshead (etc) would be allowed to create a prosperous cultural environment; preventing the Brain drain of northern talent that too often is encouraged to migrating the wealthier South.\r\n\r\nWith the North-West alone having a population greater  than the whole of Scotland (+7million as oppose to 5million); we are enough in number and spirit to strive towards a greater future as one, new, united and affluent North.\r\n",
