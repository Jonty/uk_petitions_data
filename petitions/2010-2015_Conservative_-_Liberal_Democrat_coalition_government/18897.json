        "additional_details": "Heathrow is one of the most overcrowded airports in the world with \u00a3119,000 of fuel wasted each day whilst planes unnecessarily circle London waiting for a landing slot.\r\nHeathrow needs a third runway and sixth terminal.\r\nInstead of other proposals to achieve this RAF Northolt 6 miles north of Heathrow should become a new Heathrow terminal.\r\nThe runway should be re aligned with Heathrow's and lengthened, a new terminal constructed, and a high speed rail line constructed to add on to the Heathrow express.\r\nThe process will eliminate the need to demolish homes and will also add much needed capacity to Heathrow.\r\nThere will be no need to develop Northolt into a new airport just turn it into an integral part of Heathrow.",
