It burned to love and protect my beautiful little baby nephew forever. As soon as he was born i made the biggest promise to him that i shall ever make. To be there, to love him unconditionally, and to always fight for him.\r\nThat's was 5 years ago and today that promise still stands as strong as ever, except its multiplied not just by my love for him but for his sisters and brother too. I've helped raise these children. I helped with the feeding, the nappies, the late nights. I've had the tears and the tantrums. The laughter and the smiles.\r\nBut what if one day that was taken from me. If I could only spend an hour a year with them?\r\nIn what world is that fair to the children or myself? So help me guarantee we won't have to worry, help me show that we deserve access. These kids deserve to Live every day knowing they are loved and wanted.\r\nHelp me fight!",
