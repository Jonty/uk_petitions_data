        "additional_details": "There has been a singular lack of investment in the Manor Park area and it has now become Londons Dirty Secret with zero investment or opportunity for residents and no effort made to attract new business, improve infrastructure or improve facilities.  This is leading to growing unrest and an increase in opportunity for radicalisation\r\nWe propose that a planned regeneration and investment programme takes place in this extremely deprived area and that the Romford Road becomes the catalyst through 'The Romford Road Regeneration (R3) Project'.  This needs to include vast improvements to the road surfaces, traffic management, street furniture, a concerted effort to attract high-street names to the area, improvements to the commercial properties and an improvement to the facilities for local residents\r\nThe R3 Project needs to happen soon if London is to avoid having a sinkhole of depravity and unrest in what should have been a jewel of growth following the success of the 2012 Olympics",
