        "additional_details": "The abolition of tax credits and family allowance for medium income families will basically force mothers/fathers looking after small chidren to go out to work instead of looking after their children. Any income recieved will then be swallowed up in child care costs. This loss of income will increase child poverty as no additional help is provided to these families. The APA was abolished and replaced by the Child Tax Allowance system. As Child Tax allowances are now not available for many people it is only fair a tax allowance for children is re-instated and, to incentivise families, the married couples allowance should be reinstated.",
