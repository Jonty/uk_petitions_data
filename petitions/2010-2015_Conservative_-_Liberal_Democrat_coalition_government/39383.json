        "additional_details": "With England rapidly becoming one of the most densley population countries in the world while on the other extreme the Falklands are one of the least inhabited places on the planet, this would kill two birds with one stone. Offer generous financial incentives or discounted land for English families to relocate to the Falkland Islands. This would also help to build up the overseas territory economically and also strengthen our sovereignty claim, since many people (wrongly) believe that the current population is too small for their views to be of relevance, and also show the Falkland Islanders that the British government is invested in their future.",
