        "additional_details": "Victims Of Oscar would like the Home Office to investigate why North Wales Police between 2007-2014 did not take any complaints brought to their attention regarding the Thoughts Of Oscar blog seriously and to ensure that all UK police authorities are taking complaints of 'Trolling' or internet harassment seriously.\r\n\r\nIn 2009 the National Policing Improvement Agency issued to all Chief Inspectors practice advice on 'Investigating Stalking And Harassment'.\r\n\r\nThere is strong evidence to suggest that North Wales Police did not investigate complaints of internet harassment despite knowing who the authors of the vicious internet blog Thoughts Of Oscar are.\r\n\r\nWhich is contrary to the advice given to the victims.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the statement read out in Parliament by Guto Bebb MP on September 9th 2014.",
