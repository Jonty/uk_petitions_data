        "additional_details": "This is a petition to make law that universities should give 80% of their places to UK nationals. It is grossly unfair that UK home students are being pushed out to give way for higher paying foreign and EU students. England and its university's should be making a priority to give places to UK home students, Not the rest of the world. Sign this petition now to make it easier for  Our Future Children to get a place at British University's.",
