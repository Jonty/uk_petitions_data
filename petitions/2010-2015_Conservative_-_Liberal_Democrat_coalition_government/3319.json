        "additional_details": "If you agree that any animal slaughtered in Britain should be done in a humane way, then you should sign this petition.  Halal and Kosher meat, demanded by the Islam and Jewish communities, insist that animals must be killed by having their throats slit, and must not be stunned prior to death.  This meat is now reaching our super markets unmarked, and we all could be unknowingly consuming meat which has been slaughtered using this religious method.  In Britain, this practice must stop.",
