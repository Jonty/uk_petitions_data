        "additional_details": "The on trade is being slaughtered by the off trade as people are choosing to drink cheap booze at home rather than drinking in controlled and supervised licensed premises. Most people have already had sufficient alcohol before they even step foot into a licensed premises. Making the minimum price \u00a31 for a single unit of alcohol will dramatically change this and will hopefully halt the cancer eating its way through the whole of the on trade and closing down businesses on a daily basis. Domestic violence has increased dramatically because people are drinking alcohol at home unsupervised or controlled. It has become common practice now for 2 or 3 teenage girls to drink a bottle of vodka at home before they hit the town. It's time to put a stop to this madness!!",
