He has declared that his is guided by astrology and that those who criticise this superstition are \"ignorant\". He has expressed in the House of Commons a belief that \"blood does not clot under a full moon\" as one of his many alternative medical stances. He believes that astrology and alternative medicine could be used to \"relieve the pressure on the NHS\".\r\n\r\nWhile that may work, allowing people to suffer or die unnecessarily is not our preferred means of pressure relief.
