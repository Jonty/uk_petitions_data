        "additional_details": "George Osborne announced in the March 2013 budget that there will be limits on 'progression' pay rises in the public sector.  This government has already made changes to previously agreed pension arrangements, given the public sector little or no pay rise over the last few years and given us little hope of anything changing in the near future. Say NO to this government taking anything else from the public sector, these are previously agreed terms and conditions, no government should be allowed to change them without consent from the public sector workers.\r\nThe government should not limit incremental/progression pay for public sector workers.",
