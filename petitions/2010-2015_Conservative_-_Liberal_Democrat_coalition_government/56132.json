        "additional_details": "After 3 years of no pay rises and continuing increases in both pension contributions and living costs, public sector workers were given a paltry 1% pay rise this year. However, despite their claims that 'we're all in this together', MP's are now pushing to receive the 11% salary increase (\u00a37,000+ p.a.) that was recommended by the I.P.S.A. This will be in addition to the generous expenses and allowances they can claim, including for second homes, duck houses, porn films and paper clips. They even get subsidised food and drink! Vote if you think this is abhorrently wrong. They should be brought to book and dragged from the trough.",
