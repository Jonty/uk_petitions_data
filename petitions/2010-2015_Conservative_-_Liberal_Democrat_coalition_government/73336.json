NO MATTER THE CIRCUMSTATNCES THEY HAVE KILLED AND SHOULD HAVE A AUTOMATIC BAN UNTIL FURTHER INVESTIGATION IN THE SITUATION. THIS IS WRONG, HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE BE ABLE TO DRIVE ON THE ROADS AFTER THEY HAVE JUST KILLED AN INNOCENT PERSON. LETS GET A DRIVING BAN IN PLACE  FOR THOSE WHO KILL BY DANGEROUS AND CARELESS DRIVING! ",
