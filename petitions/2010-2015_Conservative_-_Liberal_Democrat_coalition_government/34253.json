        "additional_details": "At present, a conviction of over two and half years is classed as unspent for life.  Therefore for an ex offender who wishes to apply for a job or insurance, must declare their conviction to the employer or company in question, giving a distinct disadvantage.  For an ex offender to be given the best chance of a normal life, I suggest increasing this to a sentence of 4 years and over. This sentence is then become spent after 5 years from the end of the sentence.  This will give many people a better chance in life and equal to everyone else.",
