        "additional_details": "I would like the government to bring in line advice issued to new parents. Advice given is currently vastly different not only from differenct Primary Care Trusts and areas accross the UK but from individual Health Visitors, Nursery Nurses (within Health Visitor Practices), Midwives, GPs, Pediatrician's. I have found that advice from my community midwife differed from that of the midwives on the delivery suite and on the ward, and again from each other. The GP's don't have a vast knowledge of infant conditions such as Reflux and Colic and in multi GP practices every GP has a different opinion. Some more willing to help than others.\r\nI think that the government need to issue standardised advice and promote streamlined focus points but still take into account that every baby/child/parent is different.",
