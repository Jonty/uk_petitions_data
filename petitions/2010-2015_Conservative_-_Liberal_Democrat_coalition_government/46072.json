You would hate it and so do they.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to consider in more detail the problem of child soldiers, and think about doing something about it, for example taking a famous or imposing figure like a celebrity to say or do something that might make people think more about the problem at hand. Another thing is that stopping the sale of arms and ammunition to countries in favour of child soldiers could well stop, to a certain extent the problem of child soldiers, in particular the democratic republic of congo.
