Without discipline there is no respect and children, youths run RIOT. You can\u2019t expect them to respect parents and authorities if they are not disciplined. They need to be put back in their place. Children need to be children and taught right from wrong from an early age. There are too many laws that go for children and they know every one of them. In fact they are taught them in schools. All we keep hearing is I blame the parents. Even Cameron said it. Let Parents do their job then. Smack them and its assault, lock them in doors and its imprisonment, shout at them and its verbal abuse. What are we allowed to do???????\r\n\r\n",
