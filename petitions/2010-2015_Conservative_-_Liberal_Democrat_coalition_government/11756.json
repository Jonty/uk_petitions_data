To adhere to a \"short, sharp shock\" policy whereby misbehaving children that need to be given a \"clip round the ear\" have it administered.\r\n\r\nThis should be allowed without teacher and police having the fear of reprimand from parents or social workers.  We are talking about discipline here, not a walloping or beating, just enough to give the child a notion of right and wrong.\r\n\r\nhttp://uk.news.yahoo.com/comment/dont-panic/let-return-clip-round-ear-culture-121050487.html",
