We are also calling for her to pay back all of the money she falsely claimed.\r\n\r\nMrs Miller over-claimed by \u00a345,000 for expenses towards mortgage interest payments and council tax on the family home in London on the basis of the rules that were in place at the time.\r\n\r\nIf this was any 'ordinary person' they would be prosecuted and probably imprisoned and they would certainly lose their job.\r\n\r\n",
