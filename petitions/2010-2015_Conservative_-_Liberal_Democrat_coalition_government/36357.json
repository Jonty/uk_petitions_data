        "additional_details": "The aim of this petition is to introduce a cap on the price of Football Shirts. I recommend that this be no more than \u00a340 for an adult shirt and \u00a325 for a child's shirt.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of new shirts this season has seen a \u00a35 to \u00a310 increase on the price compared to last season, resulting in shirts costing between \u00a345 to \u00a350 for some clubs.\r\n\r\nMy team, Everton, have just released a new home and away shirt at \u00a350 each for adults and \u00a340 for children. I expect a third shirt to follow sometime soon.\r\n\r\nI would have to pay \u00a3130 for a shirt for myself and my 2 children which I think is too expensive. However there is pressure on a family for the new shirts to be bought and because of this the clubs think they can get away with it, which they shouldn't be able to.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so we can get shirt prices down in these difficult economic times for us all. #keepshirtpricesdown",
