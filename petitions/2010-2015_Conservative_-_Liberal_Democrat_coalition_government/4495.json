The experts would write down all the lies and half truths told during PMs questions and make sure that politicians are made accountable for the things they say, by addressing PMs questions the next week \u2013 having researched the claims made.\r\n\r\nThis would stop the current situation where politicians never have to answer a question and would also enable average Joe to come to a more informed decision about who to vote for.",
