Kept under House Arrest for a year and Now Gagged for Life by Scottish Law, to stop him Speaking Out to help Abuse Victims. Not only was he sentenced for 250 hours of community service,  he has been gagged for the rest of his life not to speak about anything to do with the Hollie Greig case. If he does, he is immediately imprisoned for a maximum of 5 years This is unacceptable and it is time to speak out for this man and the injustice of this whole case. ",
