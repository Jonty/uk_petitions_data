        "additional_details": "My daughter Isabella now aged 2 is one of many children in the UK diagnosed with a life threatening illness everyday. We found out she had Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in March 2013. This life threatening diagnosis forced me to stop work and take leave to care for Izzy.  We were forced to live on one salary and our expenses began increasing. Thinking that some form of financial help should be available for families like ours, we turned to the government but were told there was no help.  Having your child diagnosed with an illness like this completely changes your life and makes me and other families question why this government is not providing financial help?\r\nWhy are we left to accumulate debt to get by?\r\nWe have had no control over recent events. With so little being done for families like ours, I and those in similar situations would like to see this changed.",
