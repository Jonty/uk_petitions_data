No doctor on site and so many press headlines as to their poor care - one pays thousands a month from working hard all their life and being a member of society and have worked hard and even maybe fought for their country and have their savings taken away in sometimes squalid conditions. The other has been judged as a not fit member of society and are incarcerated for that reason.\r\nWhy does the one undeserving get treated better than the one that deserves and they get it free as opposed to having to drain their savings from working hard and doing the right thing?
