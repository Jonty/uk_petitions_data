Animal experimentation is as essential as breeding animals for food & harvesting the by-products (like leather) of their slaughter; enabling UK to be in the frontiers of bioscience R&D.  In pharmacological R&D for new drug agonists (enhancers) or antagonist (inhibiters) of specific biochemical metabolic pathways & processes, SUITABLE animal models (like primates for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease research) are required. Drugs attached (in lock & key fashion) to biological substrates (in cell receptors in membranes, DNA, enzymes, precursor macromolecules, etc) can switch on or off certain biochemical pathways of APPROPRIATE species concerned hence providing the desired chemotherapeutic interventions.",
