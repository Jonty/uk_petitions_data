        "additional_details": "The vast majority of people in the UK have been shocked at severity of the riots that have occurred in London and other major cities in the UK. We urge the government to give much stronger instructions to the police to use all measures that are necessary to stop these riots as quickly as possible and to bring the perpetrators to justice.\r\nWe feel that standing by and letting these rioters act as they wish, merely fuels their confidence  and increases the likelihood of future violence.\r\nWe feel that the police should be equipped with and instructed to use stronger measures as soon as possible which may include mounted police, tear gas, water cannon and support from the army. In cases of extreme violence we feel that the use of rubber rounds is perfectly justified.\r\nThis needs to be stopped as quickly as possible before it gets further out of control.",
