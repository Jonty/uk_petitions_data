It feels safer in Market Square than outside Sainsbury' s on Manorsfield Road.\r\nI now feel I can not use the buses as it does not feel safe where they are now located it worked better in Market Square plus easy access to shops on Market Square. It will get worse when nights draw in. Please help me by signing this petition.",
