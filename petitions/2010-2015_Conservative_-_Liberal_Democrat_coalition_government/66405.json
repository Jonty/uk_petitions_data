        "additional_details": "The Medical Innovation Bill is claimed \"to encourage responsible innovation in medical treatment\" by allowing doctors deviate from standard treatment without risk sued.\r\n\r\nHowever no-one can come up with an instance where fear of medical litigation has proved a barrier to innovation in medicine.\r\n\r\nWhat this Bill WILL do is open the way for doctors to make decisions which no other clinician would agree is a good idea, and be protected for it - irrespective of whether that treatment decision is genuine or simply flat-out quackery. At present, the law demands that medical decisions are supported by a responsible body of medical opinion. The Saatchi Bill would remove that safety net..\r\n\r\nThe Medical Innovation Bill is opposed by many medical organisations, health charities and patient groups, including the GMC, BMA, Cancer Research, the Royal Colleges, and the Wellcome Trust.\r\n\r\nI urge the Secretary of State for Health to reject the Medical Innovation Bill, as it stands.",
