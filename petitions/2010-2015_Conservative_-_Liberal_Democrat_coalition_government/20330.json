Now, not all drugs are bad. (Unless you've been brainwashed by the lack of scientific evidence presented.)\r\n\r\nAlcohol and tabacco kill more people each year despite being legal.\r\n\r\nAnd caffeine gives you a certain type of high.\r\n\r\nSo, alcohol, caffeine and smoking should be made illegal.",
