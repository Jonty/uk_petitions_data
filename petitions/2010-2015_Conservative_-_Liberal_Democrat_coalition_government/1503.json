This petition asks members to consider a default position of shared parenting to be  considered as a starting point in disputed custody cases where courts are involved. This petition asks members to consider that where there are no welfare issues then it is in a child's best interests to be given the opportunity to substantialy benefit from both mother and father shared contributions to parenting. This petition also asks members to seek positive and pro active mechanisms that would help encourage parents to work together in the interests of their children and promote substantial positive involvement by both parents in the development of their children.
