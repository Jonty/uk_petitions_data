        "additional_details": "The CSA has a cap on maintenance protecting high earners from paying their dues.  Meaning that those earning in excess of \u00a33000.00 per week are spared paying the 15% expected of them.  A man earning in excess of \u00a3400000 per year could be paying a nominal 4% child maintenance, whereas the equally hardworking persons earning \u00a320000, \u00a345000 etc cough up the full 15%!\r\nOn top of this if a court agreement with the correct level for high earners has been in place for two years, it can be superseded by a CSA application knocking the money down to the level of the cap.\r\nPlease sign as this shameful cap needs removed.\r\n",
