        "additional_details": "Every place at a grammar school is taken at the direct expense of between five and nine other children. Affluent, middle-class parents use their advantages in culture and wealth to push their children into these privileged places, forcing out those very children the schools were meant to help. Where grammar schools still exist, the surrounding schools are amongst the poorest in Europe, if not the world. We cannot have every school as a good school so long as selection endures. Secondary Moderns, by any name, are hellish. Abolish selection and improve the provision for the general population.",
