The remaining choices are to (a) vote anyway  (b) vote for someone you feel is unlikely to win, (c) protest vote, or (d) spoil/not vote. All have drawbacks as none may get your message across. This petition is to ask that all future local government and general election slips have a \"non of the above\" box to put your \"x\" into should you choose that option. This should be counted just as though it were a candidate, and should be a measure of real feeling towards candidates at election time!.",
