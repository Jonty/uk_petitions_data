        "additional_details": "The British pub industry is on it's knees and needs help now. Britain has one of the most smoke-free societies in the Western World. Britain is a modern democracy, yet it allows no place with a roof for a minority of people to enjoy a cigarette, something which is still legal and provides the Exchequer billions of pounds in tax revenue, ironically enough, to fund the NHS. Sign this petition if you believe in the rights of the minority, as well as the majority.",
