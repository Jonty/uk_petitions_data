This needs to be rectified.\r\n\r\nIn light of the historic vote due to take place in 2014, it is vital that no particular viewpoint is given preferential treatment.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should fairly represent the views of all Scottish licence fee payers and should provide both sides of the argument (in accordance with the Ofcom broadcasting code section 6) to encourage a well informed debate in Scotland and help ensure that the democratic validity of the result cannot be questioned.",
