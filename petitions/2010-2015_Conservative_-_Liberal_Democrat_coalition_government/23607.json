Local authority spending priorities is not a matter in which the Government can intervene, as local authorities will know most about the best way to run their services taking account of the impact on local people.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities are democratically elected organisations, and as such they are independent from central Government and are responsible for their own finances.  This means that spending decisions are for individual councils to make."
