        "additional_details": "The Health and Social Care Bill was not included in the Conservative, Liberal Democrat or Labour manifestoes. In each manifesto there was a clear indication that there would be no major reorganisation of the NHS.\r\n\r\nSince it was obvious that Andrew Lansley had been drafting this Bill for a considerable period of time prior to the last election, why was it not included in the manifesto? All the problems which it aims to address would have been well known before this government entered office.\r\n\r\nThere is no adequate electoral or political mandate for this controversial (arguably constitutional) reform. Either this Bill should not pass into law, or a democratic mandate should be sought from the electorate. Haphazard inquiries with the media, think-tanks, and professional institutions are not sufficient to constitute a mandate for reform.",
