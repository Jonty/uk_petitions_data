        "additional_details": "The Tyne and Wear Metro is causing more and more problems for passengers. Constant delays, failed trains and increasing ticket prices.\r\n\r\nOther systems work without as many issues as ours, so why should we waste our time, our money and our confidence in a system that never works.\r\n\r\nThe DFT needs to inspect the system, note the failures and suggest what can be done to improve our confidence in a system that should work. This is all after the millions of pounds that seem to have already been wasted on something that more and more people are wanting to avoid to use other services.\r\n\r\nThe current system is not adequate, so why should it have the right in its present state to be the main operator for our light rail in North Tyneside?",
