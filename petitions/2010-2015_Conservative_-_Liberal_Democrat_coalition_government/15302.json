        "additional_details": "Following an article in this weekends Mail on Sunday discussing the treatment of animals in an abbatoir, I feel it is time that the public ask for animals to be killed in a HUMANE manner. To read of cows still aware of what is happening around them is disturbing in the extreme. The author describes the cutting off of cow legs whilst they are awake, trying to move their legs away. This makes me physically sick to think that our society is so hungry for cheap meat that it doesnt care about how is achieved.\r\nGovernment should set new legislation relating to the slaughter of animals and enforce stronger supervision of abbatoirs to ensure animals do not suffer.",
