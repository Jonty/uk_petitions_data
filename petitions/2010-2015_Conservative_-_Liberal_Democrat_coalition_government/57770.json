Compulsory Severance[Redundancy] based upon compliance with Orders destroys that principle.\r\nThe WINSOR Proposals would introduce CS on the basis of 'Performance' determined by Senior Officers. This fundamentally puts ar risk that Individual Discretion that is the cornerstone of Policing in the UK.\r\nIn Law, no one can ORDER a Police Officer to Arrest a Citizen.\r\nOfficers could be forced to choose a course of action that owes more to their fear of losing their job rather than their conscience.\r\nThis is fundamental.\r\nThe Home Secretary should   remove this threat.",
