        "additional_details": "Over the last 3 decades, companies in the plastics industry have developed various approaches to make degradable and biodegradable plastic products that process and perform equivalently to inexpensive & widely-used commodity plastics.\r\n\r\nTheir intent has been to develop a degradable and biodegradable plastic that is as functional as commodity plastics, but that would degrade and biodegrade relatively quickly in a disposal environment (litter, landfill, compost, water soil). Proven technology is the most practical and economical way available today to accomplish these objectives.\r\n\r\nI.E. TDPA tech are food contact compliant, meet applicable US, CA & EU stand., supported by scientific testing & published  reports to provide legitimate environmental claim statements.\r\n\r\nTech provides a means for rendering conventional plastics degradable, & biodegradable. Some UK-retailers provide 100% (bio)degrable palstic bags, but many don't. My peition is for all UK-retailers to provide these.",
