        "additional_details": "This petition implores you to consider the problems around new build developments without the essential planning for infrastructure.\r\nAlphington is 2 miles outside Exeter in beautiful rural Devon, with the features of a country village surrounded by lush green rolling hills.\r\nLocal villagers found out earlier this year that E.C.C. and Teignbridge D.C. plan to build 2500 dwellings on our boundary.\r\nThis petition is due to our extreme concern about current traffic congestion & pollution, plus overcrowding of community facilities.\r\nTraffic from the South West enters Exeter via a narrow road running through the middle of our 'Conservation Area', which leads to 'The Alphington Corridor' - our only route into town. This is already so congested that it can take up to 1 hour to commute to and from the city centre by car.\r\nI am petitioning you to protect residents from the consequences of unsustainable over-development without vital infrastructure.",
