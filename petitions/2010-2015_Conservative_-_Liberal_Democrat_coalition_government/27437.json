        "additional_details": "The government has put the apprenticeship scheme into action and for someone like me it is the only liable source of income as I feel there aren't enough jobs and the ones that are available require experience. If I get the apprenticeship I am aiming for I will be receiving \u00a32.60 per hour which is \u00a391.00 a week for working over 30 hours in a warehouse lifting heavy objects. Please consider changing the minimum apprentice wage to something fairer as I feel employers are using young people for cheap labor. If you increase the apprenticeship wage less young people will turn to illegal incomes like selling drugs or committing robberies. If I get this apprenticeship I will be working longer and harder hours than my mother but will be receiving over four times less which is ridiculous. David Cameron emphasizes how good apprenticeships are for the economy and I believe it is because the companies using the scheme pay wages that shouldn't be aloud in this country.",
