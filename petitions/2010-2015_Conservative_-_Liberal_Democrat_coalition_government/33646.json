We reject duplicate petitions so that signatures are concentrated on those already submitted, rather than spread thinly over several.  If you want to set up a petition of your own, it will need to call for something distinctive that other petitions haven't asked for (the search facility on the e-petitions website isn't the greatest in the world, but with some ingenuity you should be able to work out what's already on there)."
