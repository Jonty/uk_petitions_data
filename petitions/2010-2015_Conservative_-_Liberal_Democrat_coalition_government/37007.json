In order to be able to do this, every vote should be a free vote. Free from the bribery, blackmail, intimidation and coercion of party whips who put party and vested interests before those of an MP's constituents.\r\n\r\nAll parliamentary votes should be free votes.\r\n\r\nMPs should be empowered to represent the electorate first and foremost.\r\n\r\nSupport this petition to make \"whipping\" illegal.",
