        "additional_details": "The age for hpv screening tests is currently 25 years old, however, this is something that can be contracted from the time of first becoming sexually active. if this is done at the legal age, that is 9 years that women are being left without any way of being tested, and therefor, 9 possible years of abnormalities developing and becoming something more serious, which can not be treated by the time you reach 25 years of age. The age for smear testing should be available to those over 16 that are sexually active if they request it, and compulsory for anyone that has had a baby, regardless of their age. ",
