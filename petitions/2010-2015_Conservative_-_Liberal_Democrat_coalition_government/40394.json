        "additional_details": "The voting system needs to be changed as it does not represent what the population want.\r\nMost seats in the house of commons do not have over half of thier constituants votes.\r\nMost parties in office do not have half of the populations votes.\r\nMost parties do not have the equvilent number of seats, to what the population voted for.\r\nIn other words the government is made up of parties that the population as a whole does not want. most people voted against the conservatives in the last election. in the election before most people voted against the labour government. Therfore a government that should represent the people actually doesnt. Why? the voting system. In the referendum on changing the vote the campaign against av was harsh and overcomplicated it, this petition is not for av but for the fact that the voing sytem should be chaanged so people actually vote for thegovernment not just their constituancy.\r\nIn short the current voting system is unfair and needs to be changed.",
