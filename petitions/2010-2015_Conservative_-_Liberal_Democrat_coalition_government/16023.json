        "additional_details": "Our council have cut the funding for evening, some weekend bus services in Hartlepool and a total cut to villages such as Elwick and Dalton Piercy this is a disgrace!. this effects everyone from those who use the bus to go to work to those visiting relatives in hospital to pensioners who need to get out and are not able to walk,  people are being made prisoners on an evening not everyone has a car or access to one and certainly not the money for constant taxis. We want the government to take action by stepping in either to fund or make available money for more services even if that means paying another company instead of Stagecoach. f we cannot have a full timetable then at least let us have a revised hourly evening & weekend service for the number 1, 3, and a service to Elwick, and Dalton Piercy and other surrounding areas.",
