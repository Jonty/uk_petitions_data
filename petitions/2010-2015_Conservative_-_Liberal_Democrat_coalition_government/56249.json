This will cost the taxpayer a shedload by pushing up council tax to subsidise it, or cutting other services exhaustedly. It will fill the buses with noisy, unruly kids.  What's more, where is the incentive for people to try to support their own family, if the state isjust going to keep picking up the tab for every expense that having a child incurs.Thank you for taking the time and trouble to read this.",
