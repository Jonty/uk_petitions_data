        "additional_details": "As it stands, students are only eligible for free prescriptions up until and including the age of 18. However, with the majority of degrees lasting 3 years, students are left to pay the \u00a37.85 prescription fee using their already limited student loan for at least two years following. It seems unfair that a student, with no income other than their loan, should pay for their medication.\r\nThe government should therefore consider allowing students and anyone in higher education above the age of 18 to receive free prescriptions.",
