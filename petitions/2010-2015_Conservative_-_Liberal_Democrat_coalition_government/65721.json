Anyone should be able to display our national flags without embarrassment or fear that they will be seen as supporting racism and violence.\r\n\r\nWe demand a law which prohibits the use of our national flags by extremist groups and their supporters, even if they are not banned; that perpetuate hatred toward any groups or individuals in this country and victimise them, using intimidation and violence. Display of our national flags by such groups using any media format, (clothing, books, video, images etc) associated with them should also be illegal.\r\n",
