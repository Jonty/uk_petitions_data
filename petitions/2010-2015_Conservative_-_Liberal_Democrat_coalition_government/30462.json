        "additional_details": "We believe that it is right that the UK government immediately ends all aid to Argentina while they continue to threaten the self determination of the falkland islands and continue their hostile political stance towards the UK. We have paid nearly \u00a35 billion into international aid fund which has given Argentina \u00a3450 million we call on the UK government to demand that future payments to Argentina cease immediately or we will withdraw our support for the fund. We should not be supporting nations that are both as economically developed as Argentina and who threaten nations right to self determination.",
