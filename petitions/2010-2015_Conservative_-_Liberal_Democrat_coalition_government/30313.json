        "additional_details": "According to the website of the Home Office the immigration minister proposed new harsh fee schedule with effect from April 2012. We strongly condemn these harsh fees as it would directly affect working people especially highly skilled workers on Tier 1 General Visa. We would like to request to the Home Office to put a Cap on current fees for at least next five years, otherwise there would be adverse affect on the families of migrants and their mental states. We understand that no forum is available for the migrants to raise their voice so we decided to raise our issue through this forum. ",
