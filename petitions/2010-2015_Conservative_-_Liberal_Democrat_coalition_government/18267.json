I therefore find it absurd that politics is not taught as a compulsory subject in schools. Is it any wonder that so many people are apathetic about politics? I was taught Design and Technology, Electronics, Woodwork etc, but not politics, yet privately educated children are taught politicals. This had the effect of telling me that certain people are simply not supposed to take part in political debate, that I was simply meant to spend my life producing, and I believe this feeling is widespread. Voter turnouts are lower than they have ever been.\r\n\r\nIncluding people in the discourse - giving people a voice, an educated populace - can not be detrimental to the country. ",
