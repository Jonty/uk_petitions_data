        "additional_details": "Pedestrian flow could be greatly improved by removing the large \"TOWER BRIDGE\" signs from either end of London's Tower Bridge, which gather huge numbers of tourists every day insisting on taking photos of each other next to the sign and some stones.  Pedestrians are compelled to wait as tourists struggle to turn their cameras on, focus, retake the photo as everyone was blinking, etc. No interesting background view is visible - just stones - and so the signs could easily be moved down to riverbank level against indistinguishable stones, and provide the same dull poor quality photographic backdrop. Tourists would not miss out, pedestrians would be allowed to walk across the bridge unimpeded.",
