        "additional_details": "My latest bill from SSE shows that they have increased the calorific value converter for gas from 39.6 to 40.01 in addition to increasing the unit cost for gas from 15 November 2013.  However, the calorific converter increase applies over the whole period from the last bill - 8 October 13 to 8 Jan 14.  In my case this increases my bill by GBP1.28p over and above the increased cost of the the gas provided over the period.  Not a lot, the poo poohers will say. Multiply it by the 3 or 4 million customers SSE have, I say,  and there you have huge additional millions of pounds bonus pots for managers (WHICH WE HAVE NOT BEEN TOLD ABOUT)?",
