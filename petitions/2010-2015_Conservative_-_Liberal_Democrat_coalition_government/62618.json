        "additional_details": "This petition has been set up in opposition of and to stop the building of even more homes in our village area this time using the much loved used and loved Wellesbourne Airfield. The building of homes on and loss of this site would not only have a severe and dangerously damaging impact on the village infrastructure along with that of the other small surrounding villages especially with the huge number of homes already built/being built in the area but mean the end to much loved events as the Wellesbourne Market which is held every Saturday and Bank Holiday, and attracts people from a very wide area.\r\nThe loss of the exremley popular \"Airfield Cafe\" and all the Pilot training Schools.\r\nAll the Industries on the M40 Distribution Park will be lost, and these employ people from Wellesbourne and the surrounding areas\r\n\r\nPlease sign this E Petition and pass it on to all your friends and colleagues.\r\n\r\nWE MUST TRY TO STOP THIS DEVELOPMENT.
