        "additional_details": "During breakdown of vehicles on motorways the drivers and passengers usually huddle around the vehicle or side of road and are hard to see, especially at night.\r\n\r\nIn other countries it is compulsary for all vehicles to carry hi-viz vests for the drivers and passengers. By having this same law in this country other motorists would visually see all persons at side of road or walking to emergency phones and not dark clothing at the very last minute.\r\n\r\nAll commercial vehicle drivers have to wear hi-viz as part of health and safety so when they break down they are always visible, however should a car driver break down they could be dressed in any coloured clothing and that makes it harder to see them.\r\n\r\nSo, the uk should come in line with other european countries and change the law that all persons travelling in non-commercial vehicles have and wear hi-viz vests during a breakdown on any road in the uk.",
