        "additional_details": "We are wanting to get the hidden ruling changed that says financial help cannot be given for babies born under 24 weeks to have a proper funeral. This rule cant be found in any literature from the social fund. Our son Archie was born at 23 weeks + 2 days and lived for 50 minutes so we had to register his birth then his death. Babies are being born at 23 weeks and now surviving so this ruling needs changing. Archie wasn't aborted or a miscarriage but he is being treated as so. ",
