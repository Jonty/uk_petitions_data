        "additional_details": "I am calling on the Government to scrap the '''Human Rights Act'' , that was brought in by the previous Labour Government.  This act is allowing the courts not to use the full force of British Law, and the act is also allowing criminals to flout the law and think they are above it.  This so-called act is even preventing the police to carry out their full duties in protecting the public, property and businesses, as seen during the early stages of these August 2011 riots.",
