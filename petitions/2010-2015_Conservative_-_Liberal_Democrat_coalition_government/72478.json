        "additional_details": "The Public Space Protection Order 2014 (PSPO) is a form of ASBO, but aimed at groups in a public space. Homeless people huddled for warmth, ramblers following legitimate footpaths, people waiting for stores to open on sale days - the list is endless.\r\nThis order is far to broad. It gives power to private security and police to issue on the spot fines for not leaving a particular area within 20\r\nMinutes of leaving the shop or restaurant as an example.\r\nWe the people want this act retracted, and request a broad based public consultation, and not a decision behind closed doors. We want a full and transparent appeal procedure, and mandatory consultation for each council looking to enforce this act. ",
