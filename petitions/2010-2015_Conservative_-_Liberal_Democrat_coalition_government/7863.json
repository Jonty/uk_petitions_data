Yob culture is at an all time high, it is on the increase, unless something is done now, it will only get worse.\r\nMore police in the comunities, tougher sentencing, and the threat of re-introducing National Service might make these \"yobs\" sit up and take notice.\r\nProblem families on housing estates should be evicted from the society as they are not wanted.\r\nWe the taxpayers have had enough of subsidising them through our taxes. It is time the government took our thoughts into consideration and acted upon what WE want in our society.",
