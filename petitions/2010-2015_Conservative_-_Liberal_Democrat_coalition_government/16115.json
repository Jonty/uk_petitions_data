        "additional_details": "I think it is wrong that public/private schools have charitable status, and thus avoid VAT and other taxes. Most of these schools are used by well off and privalidged people and they should pay taxes for this kind of service and not get tax breaks and discounts for what is in reality a luxury. These schools are only available on the whole to those who can afford the fees and do not realy fit the idea of a charity. I believe that if a school can prove that they really are acting as a charity i.e. the majority of places being given free to bright kids not rich ones, then they should retain the status of a charity. But schools like Eaton etc should have to pay taxes as a bussiness inc VAT.",
