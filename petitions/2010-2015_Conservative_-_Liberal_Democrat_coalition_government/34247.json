Section 10 will eliminate choice for people like me who want to be treated with homoeopathy.\r\n\r\nI would like to call on the Health Minister to revise slightly the proposed language of the revised Medicines Act to ensure that I have continued access to a full range of homoeopathic medicines and my right to choose homoeopathic treatment is maintained.\r\n",
