My sister who suffers with M.E is a qualified teacher who cannot return to the job she love's because of her condition.  It is so hard to see my sister who used to be so active and independant having to rely on others.  M.E is not in the mind it is an actual illness that need looking into and not to be ignored.  I don't feel as tho enough research has gone into this condition, and if you have a member of family that suffers this you will understand.",
