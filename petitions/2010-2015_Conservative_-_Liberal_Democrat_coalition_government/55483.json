By the time they finally get a diagnosis it's to late.\r\n\r\nEven if the age won't be lowered surely all women, no matter what age, showing symptoms of cervical cancer should be allowed a smear test. This is why I have started this petition. Things need to be changed, women are losing their lives when it can be prevented.",
