This is not in accordance with our laws, our traditions, history, or in the best interests of the majority of the public.\r\n\r\nProposed laws to jail social media trolls who happen to state their opinion on such sites, are downright Orwellian! Where is the line drawn on what constitutes grounds for arrest? If someone calls an MPs vote in the HoC on twitter, can that person be arrested & thrown in jail?\r\n\r\nLaws already in place, deal with the harm & threat of harm to others, so we do not need this law! We have lost our right to privacy & if we also lose free speech, the nation is collectively screwed!",
