        "additional_details": "Sign this petition and support a plan that will regenerate Lowestoft and protect it from North Sea flooding.\r\n\r\n- It will relieve the chronic traffic congestion through the centre of Lowestoft.\r\n\r\n- The roads on the lock gates will be useable 24/7.\r\n\r\n- The roads will have cycle lanes which will open more of Lowestoft to cycles than the proposed cycle bridge to run parallel to the bascule bridge.\r\n\r\n- The barrage will help protect Lowestoft from flood risk both North and South of Lake Lothing.\r\n\r\n- Ships of a greater draught will be able to use the harbour.\r\n\r\n- Much of the construction work could be carried out by the local workforce.\r\n\r\n- The barrage will benefit Lowestoft by bringing over 200 acres of disused land back for employment and/or residential use.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is for a tidal barrage and lock gates at Lake Lothing.  The lock gates would be surmounted by roads to take traffic from the existing roadways and roundabouts at Denmark Road and Rotterdam Road.",
