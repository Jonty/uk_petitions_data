        "additional_details": "Not only is fuel currently taxed at 58p per litre but motorists are then taxed VAT at 20% on the fuel and the duty. VAT is Value Added Tax. There is no Value to the motorist in the fuel duty. This is a tax on a tax and should be stopped.\r\n\r\nMotorists face little choice but to pay crippling levels of tax on fuel. This is discrimination against something which is a necessary part of life which is strange in a country that tries to promote fairness and equality.\r\n\r\nDrinkers are similarly used as an easy target. While drinking creates problems for policing and the NHS, taxation levels are far above the increased costs necessary to deal with these problems.\r\n\r\nI propose scrapping fuel and alcohol duty and raising VAT so everyone pays their fair share.",
