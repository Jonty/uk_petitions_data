        "additional_details": "We vehemently believe that trolling is a very serious offence, and the consequences can be catastrophic.  Internet trolling can impact a person both emotionally, mentally and even physically.  In some cases, it has caused people to take their own lives, Through reports in the media we have been made all too aware of high profile trolling cases; such as the disgusting and hurtful comments made towards, and about Gary Barlow and Tom Daley following the deaths of family members.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that under the Human Rights Declaration, we have the right to freedom of expression. But we believe that with this right come responsibilities, and that there should be tougher consequences for those who are guilty of undertaking genuine threats of violence and vicious attacks that can in reality cause real harm.\r\n\r\nWe  would like to see an acknowledgment by Members of Parliament that constituents are increasingly incensed by this malice act and we seek a change in the law.\r\n",
