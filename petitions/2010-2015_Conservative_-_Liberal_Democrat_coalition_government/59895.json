For smaller companies the employees may not be entitled to this, and if any time off is needed, they will have to go into their holiday days or take time off as unpaid.\r\nWhat I want is to make bereavement leave law, so EVERYBODY is entitled to up to 3 days paid time off when losing a relative or loved one.\r\n",
