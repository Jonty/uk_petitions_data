        "additional_details": "At present Queens hills has approx 1500 homes with more on the way, We have 1 entrance in and out of the development which leads onto a busy main road into norwich which can be blocked or so busy we are unable to leave our homes. Their is a proposed buslane due to be installed at the rear of the development for bus and emergency vechiles to get off we are asking for this to be relooked at and for this bus lane to be made into a 2nd exit for residents to be able to exit the estate This would not only benefit residents but also cut down on the ammount of traffic enterning an already very conjested main norwich roundabout.",
