        "additional_details": "We, the Undersigned, are actively coming together as one voice in order to show that we care about our home planet, and in caring for our environment we demand that the protection of the rainforests be of the utmost importance. In the destruction of rainforests, many species of animals and plants become extinct before they have even been discovered. Trees also help to take carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere - with fewer trees, the process of global warming will increase. For these reasons, we demand that the rapid rate of deforestation is immediately halted. ",
