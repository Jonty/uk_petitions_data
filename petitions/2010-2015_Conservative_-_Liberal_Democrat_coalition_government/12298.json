There seems little point in jailing someone for a given period when only a small portion of it will be carried out.\r\n\r\n2.\tStopping the practice of \u2018discounts\u2019 off sentences for early guilty pleas and replace it with an added term if the accused pleads not guilty and is subsequently found guilty (as he will have lied in court).\r\n\r\n3.\tNo \u2018time off for good behaviour\u2019. This practice be replaced with \u2018time added for bad behaviour\u2019.  Prisoners should be expected to behave properly and if they do not, it should incur further punishment.\r\n\r\nLet us get away from a system that is \u2018soft\u2019 on the perpetrators of criminal acts.\r\n\r\n",
