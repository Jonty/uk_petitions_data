We need to ensure that TAX PAYERS money resides in our own country during these unstable economic times to help benefit the lives and conditions in which our own citizens live. With the up and coming expected influx of foreign nationals expected from Romania and Bulgaria in the coming year we need to ensure our countries own welfare before helping those that \"choose\" to move here from their own countries whilst leaving their children behind.",
