It is responsible for the police, UK Border Agency and the Security Service (MI5). It is also in charge of policies on security-related issues such as drugs, counter-terrorism and ID. It was formerly responsible for the Prison Service and Probation Service, but these have transferred to the Ministry of Justice. My knowledge of my country has become rather anxious. I used to acknowledge it as a social democratic paradise, disapproved of but tolerant, law-abiding welfare state in which everyone was a good and caring citizen. It is something of a paradox that my country so married like paternal husband and wife to social democratic ideals of life and equality in work forces yet fairness should at the same time try to secretly tolerate, help and enjoy a vice, folly and depravity on such a scale that corruption and sadism should be feared greatly!",
