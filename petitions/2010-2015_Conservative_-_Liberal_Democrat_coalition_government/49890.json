        "additional_details": "The Bedroom Tax has been flawed since its introduction. It was throught up in a rush, and is not practicle. It punishes people who are already struggling, based purely upon whether they have spare bedrooms in their home. So far, the only option for people who can't afford to pay the tax has been to move to smaller properties, in the process ripping up families and communities. There aren't enough smaller properties for people to move into, especially in the more rural places. Unfortunately, for one lady, there was no other option but to commit suicide, aged 53. (Source: Source: http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/bedroom-tax-victim-commits-suicide-1883600)\r\n\r\nThe Bedroom Tax must either be drastically rethought, or completely abolished with no chance of return before more people feel that they have no option but to commit suicide because they can't afford to live any more.",
