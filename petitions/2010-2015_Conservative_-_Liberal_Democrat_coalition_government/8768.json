        "additional_details": "when individuals cover their faces in public in mass group/ protest / suspicious situation this should be made illegal and should be reason to be challenged and identity made known. Refusal to make their identity and face know should be criminalised .  When some groupsand individuals hide their face they have something to hide or are up to no good. This has been seen in the english riots and so some freedoms have to be removed. If it is cold or raining they still needs to be their faces exposed  We cannot afford this freedom and those that have nothing to hide should not be concerned.",
