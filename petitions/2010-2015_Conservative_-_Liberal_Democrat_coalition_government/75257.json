        "additional_details": "Currently if Boxing Day falls on a Saturday the national bank holiday is allocated to the following Monday (28th December)\r\n\r\nI propose that when Boxing Day falls on a Saturday that the bank holiday be allocated to the 24th December.  This would only happen every 6 six years but could increase turnover of businesses prior to Christmas Day with people who usually get bank holidays off being able to use Christmas Eve to finalise their Christmas arrangements.",
