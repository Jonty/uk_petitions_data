        "additional_details": "I would like the government to support the right of the public to be able to easily access the Food Safety / Hygiene Ratings (or scores) of all businesses in the UK that handle food. Display and publication of the EHO inspection score should be made compulsory, and not remain voluntary and difficult for the public to access. This legislation should include not only cafe's, restaurants, pubs, hotels, sandwich shops and general food outlets but also schools, care homes, hospitals, company dining facilities and anywhere that food is consumed. The public have a right to know that the food we eat will not cause us harm.",
