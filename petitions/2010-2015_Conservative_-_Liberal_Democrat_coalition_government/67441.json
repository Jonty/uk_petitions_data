A 1% rise for public employees can mean as little as 150 per year rise.  How can Mr Osborne say \"We are in this together\" when a 2.5% rise in the cost of living is easily absorbed by him and his cronies by their pay or their own private wealth.\r\nI never hear from my MP and have never had any contact from any political party in my 52 years voting life.  How can MP's understand the effects of their actions if they sit in their ivory towers making pronouncements which they know will not affect them but may mean many families having to sell their homes to live?",
