        "additional_details": "I would like the zebra crossings on fernclough road harpurhey to be changed to a safer lighted crossing as zebra crossing are outdated and dangerous as nowadays drivers don't know the rules for them and drive straight across them even when you are midway across the road. I think changing the crossing would prevent accidents as drivers know they have to stop and pedestrians know when to cross.",
