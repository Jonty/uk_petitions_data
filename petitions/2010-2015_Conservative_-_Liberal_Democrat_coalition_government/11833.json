        "additional_details": "The government has responded to the recent wave of looting in Britain by announcing a crackdown on social networking sites.\r\n\r\nWe strongly oppose these measures and consider it wrong that the government should be able to  decide who can use the internet and what content and subjects are acceptable on them.\r\n\r\nThere is no need for such legislation as users are already bound by terms and conditions which state acceptable use policy during signup processes.\r\n\r\nIt would be unthinkable for the government to control the content of newspapers and that the same freedoms that apply to the media should also apply to the internet. We also note that censorship of or disruptions to the internet is generally seen as a characteristic of oppressive regimes.\r\n\r\nWe believe there should be no action taken against social networking sites or the wider internet in response to the recent riots and looting.",
