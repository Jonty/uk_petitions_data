The PHSO only investigate a tiny 1% of complaints, which is ridiculous.\r\n I suffered from Dental Negligence but was unable to take the dentist to court because his notes indicated that he made a diagnosis more than three years previously.The negligence caused loss of 60% of my jaw bone , and loss of many teeth as well as two TIA's .(mini-strokes).\r\nIt is not fair that he has been able to evade Justice.\r\nI want my day in court.\r\n\r\nThis dentist must not be allowed to get away with what he has done to me.",
