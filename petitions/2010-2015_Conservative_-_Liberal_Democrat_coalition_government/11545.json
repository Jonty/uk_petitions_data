This will enhance the lives of youth, teach them respect, motivation (the good sort), keep them fit, disciplined and out of trouble.  It will give them a purpose in life. They will learn.\r\nFor the thuggery we have witnessed recently, it seems fitting.\r\nThere is not enough justice in this country and there are not enough cells to house everyone. Childrens centres arent good enough.  There has been no respect in the UK for over 20 years.  A civil riot has always been on the cards, especially since governement told us we were unable to discipline children.\r\n\r\nIt will also increase numbers for our flagging Army, Navy and Airforce.  if the need to fight is there, then they can do so on foreign soil.",
