The original artist (whether author, film-maker or musician) does not see a penny from the subscriptions that these sites charge in order to download this material. A lot of this material, the original artist doesn't even know is being downloaded without their permission.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that the Government brings in new powers to stop these sites from selling material they have not got permission to distribute; allow artists to collect reprimands when their material is being sold without permission and create an independent body to investigate complaints against copyright infringement and deal as appropiate in each case.",
