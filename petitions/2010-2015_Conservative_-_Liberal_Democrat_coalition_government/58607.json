        "additional_details": "It is quite a common practice among taxi firms for incoming calls to be diverted to a mobile phone which is then handed to a nominated driver to answer. This driver will be in charge of accepting and delegating jobs, and taking advance bookings, all while carrying out his or her own driving duties.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be a safe way in which to operate, as every call takes further attention away from the road.\r\n\r\nI petition the Government to consider banning taxi firms from operating in this way, and instead requiring that they use an office-based call handler where their fleet size numbers 2 or greater.",
