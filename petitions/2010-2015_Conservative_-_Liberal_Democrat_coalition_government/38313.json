        "additional_details": "The House of Lords needs to reflect modern diversity and become more accountable to society. At the moment there are lords sitting due to their position in the church. Membership of the House of Lords should reflect wider society by firstly being electable. Secondly, there is no place in a modern secular society for certain faith groups being included and others not. To prevent unelected faith groups having a say in a democracy, it would be more prudent to end membership of lords spiritual to the wider House of Lords..",
