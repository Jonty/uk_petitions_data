        "additional_details": "I represent a Multi -Sport Community Club in North Manchester. We specialise in Cricket, Tennis,Crown Green Bowling and Football. My current CWO is retiring and I have been told that I need to replace to satisfy England and  Wales Cricket Board (ECB) despite the fact I have a fully qualifed CWO under Football Foundation regulations. Tennis authorities are happy with the Football quaification but the ECB require cricket specific qualifications!!! This added to similar individual CRB requirements for all sports is becoming far to expensive and untenable for Community Sports Clubs to handle and control. The regulations must be standardised across all Sports.",
