        "additional_details": "Theft or attempted theft of Motorcycles is not dealt with seriously and effectively by the police authority. The motorcyclist community as a whole have growing concerns that reported motorcycle crimes are not followed up or acted upon, in short, not worth the police time. Many motorcycles are stolen every day and some leads are handed to the police but no action is seen to be taken or interest shown. I move to suggest that a authority section be allocated to Motorcycle theft and information focused and acted upon with feedback to those affected so we as a community can see results or actions. It is a very large motorcycle community suggestion that this E-Petition is raised with real concern. We need to see action, not a dismissive approach to dealing with a real issue.",
