        "additional_details": "I am absolutely fed up of listening to fireworks all year round! I have 2 Jack Russell Terriers and i refuse to DRUG my beloved dogs from the vets for the sake of peoples ignorance. Ban fireworks from supermarkets, corner shops and internet. Enough is enough, they are dangerous and cause fires and deaths to humans and all animals. Fireworks are even more dangerous than guns and yet they are allowed to be sold to the wrong people. I already have a petition that is world wide and people are signing. Its time to take notice and action for those who suffer, especially for animals. Fireworks are gonna kill my dogs if something aint done asap!!!!",
