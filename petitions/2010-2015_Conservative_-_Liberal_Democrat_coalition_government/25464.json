Consenting to organ donation by all patients to their GPs could help to alleviate the problem of shortage of organs for transplant. However, health records, like other records/statistics, that is made truly anomalous, need NOT be considered as information requiring informed consent, as it should be considered as analogous to reviewing case histories by 3rd party professional peer group or educational conferences, which do not require informed consent. When informed consent is required, it can be given only by patients mentally competent (usually over 16 of normal intelligence) enough to understand the medical procedure/treatment/risks involved & circumstances information may pass onto third parties. The nearest next-of-kin can give informed consent, in the best interest of the patient, if he/she is considered mentally incompetent.",
