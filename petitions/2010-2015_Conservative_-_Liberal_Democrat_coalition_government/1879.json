It has destroyed millions of social lives for those that enjoy a legal product...tobacco, and has driven a poisonous wedge between decent honourable people, with increasing vitriolic attacks against smokers, which have greatly increased since the ban.\r\n\r\nThe smoking ban was predicated on the dubious fact that so called \u2018passive smoking\u2019 killed people. But this is a lie perpetrated by the anti-tobacco lobby groups like ASH.\r\nThere is absolutely no post-mortem evidence that anyone has ever been killed by \u2018passive smoking\u2019.\r\n\r\nIt is not for politicians to dictate how we enjoy our lives. No politician has the right to stop me going to my local pub for a smoke and drink \u2013 that is down to the landlord and landlady it\u2019s their business, not that of duplicitous politicians who said they would not bring in a blanket ban \u2013 remember the Labour manifesto pledge?\r\n\r\nWe want our civil liberties back. We don't want nose-prodding social engineering.\r\n",
