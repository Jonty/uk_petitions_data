        "additional_details": "I would like British folklore, legends and ancient beliefs taught in our schools before we lose any more of our heritage.\r\n\r\nI knew nothing about druids when I left primary school but I knew about the Greek gods - I was taught nothing about my own rich heritage and both historical and current pagan beliefs, but I knew about a European country's dancient religion. I learned about the Tolpuddle martyrs at secondary school but not why we put baubles on a Christmas tree (druidic gilded apples to represent fertility) or why the easter bunny gives out eggs (rabbits run away from people who would then discover ground nesting bird nests with eggs and would assume they came from the rabbits as the birds would hide with their feathered camouflage). I also knew nothing of King Arthur or Avalon, the green man or Herne the Hunter.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure our children learn more about their own heritage. Thank you. ",
