        "action": "Reduce road fuel prices to compare to those in Europe & tax foreign trucks",
        "additional_details": "In the EU, diesel is taxed at a lower rate than petrol. Both diesel & petrol are cheaper in the EU; in France & Belgium the average price of diesel is about 25p. per litre cheaper than it is in the UK.  An experience  HGV driver will fill up his fuel tanks before crossing to the UK. Some trucks have tanks that will hold up to 2000 litres, saving them \u00a3500:00 this will easily enable them to travel 3000miles before they need to refuel again. Not only is our high fuel tax putting our own haulage companies out of business but the the fuel tax isn't even coming to Britain, it\u2019s actually going to France & Belgium. Reducing the cost of our fuel to compare to that of our neighbours will not only help our haulage industry but fuel tax which at present goes to France & Belgium will come here. UK hauliers have to pay a tax or toll to use the roads in Europe, foreign trucks travel the roads of Britain and pay nothing",
