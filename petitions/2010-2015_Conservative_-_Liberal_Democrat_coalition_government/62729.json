As a lawyer, YOURSELF, will you be able to tell us when your legal brethren will consider they have taken enough off taxpayers?  I wouldn't mind so much if the majority of practising lawyers hadn't been trained before university fees were introduced so we taxpayers were paying in advance for our own destruction.",
