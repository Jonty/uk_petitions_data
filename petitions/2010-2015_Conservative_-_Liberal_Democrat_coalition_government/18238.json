        "additional_details": "For too long the people of this nation have been subjected to potential prosecution for travelling at a speed deemed unsafe by standards set in 1965. Cars are much safer, they have more sophisticated equipment now than they did 40 or so years ago. They are capable of driving safely at higher speeds. There are enormous economic benefits to be had by increasing the speed limit and shortening journey times. It is time we supported the political clout to get this done! ",
