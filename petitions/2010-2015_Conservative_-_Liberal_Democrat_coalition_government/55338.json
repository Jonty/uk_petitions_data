They take far too long to reach decisions and people are dying. Patients are being denied the most modern effective drugs available and being given the cheapest available. If we can afford to send billions of \u00a3's overseas for  ~World Health and give free Health Care to the World then we can afford to spend the money on those who have paid into the system. NHS patients deserve the best treatment available not the cheapest.",
