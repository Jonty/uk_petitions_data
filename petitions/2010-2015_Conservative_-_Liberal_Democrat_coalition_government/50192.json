        "action": "Reduce exise of fuel and tobacco to prevent crime",
        "additional_details": "We as a country are currently suffering an epidemic of organised crime in terms of fuel laundering and with tobacco smuggling.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental purpose of excise is simple and effective, it reduces consumption of products that are detrimental to the environment and to health respectively. However excise in this country is excessive. This excessive tax is funding crime and is making it difficult for genuine business to compete with significantly cheaper goods offered by criminals\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned firmly believe that by pulling excise into line with the European average would reduce crime, help business, would have little impact on consumption and in the long run would save the government money as they would have to spend less on fighting this crime and because there would be far fewer of these criminals, many people would return to buying genuine UK duty paid fuel and tobacco.
