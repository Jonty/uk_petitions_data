        "additional_details": "The recent deplorable acts of arson, looting, physical violence and attacks on police officers in London make it clear that although the officers are highly trained, they are not up to the scale and threat posed by the gangs that roam the streets looking for trouble.  The e-petition is to bring back the Riot Act.  If a peaceful protest deteriorates into anarchy then a magistrate would read the act to the rioters, the police would then withdraw and the army takes its place.  The army are far better trained and equiped to deal with violence on such a massive scale.",
