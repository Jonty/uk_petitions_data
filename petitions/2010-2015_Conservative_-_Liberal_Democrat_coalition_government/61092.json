        "additional_details": "An derogotary and offensive article, written by Richard Littlejohn, against Islam has been published on the DAILY MAIL regarding an event that will take place for the Muslim community of Whitechapel, who will be travelling to Legoland Windsor for a 'Family Fun Day'. This article displays full hatred against Islam by verbally describing the events of the day as if they are conducting terrorist activity. This can be seen as nothing but hate crime against Islam and the Muslims and allowing this article to circulate will only further increase the negative imagery that media gives to the religion and governmental support in doing so.
