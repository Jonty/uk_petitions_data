        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, disagree with the abnormally large increase in English authors at the expense of others.  We feel that the variation in the literature between the ages of 14 and 16 has been narrowed far too greatly and does not give a school pupil a broad enough range from which to learn from.  By repealing these changes and reinstating previous curricula we feel the English Literature GCSE maximises learning potential within pupils and better prepares them for the adult world.",
