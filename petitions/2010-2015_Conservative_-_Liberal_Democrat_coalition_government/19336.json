        "additional_details": "I have on a number of occasions been forced onto the road, from the pavement with my small children, by people driving mobility scooters irresponsibly and at high speed. I was also driven into by a scooter in my local shopping centre, when someone turned a corner driving at such speed they were practically on two wheels. Although they are a vital piece of equipment for some people, there should be greater control and enforcement of the law regarding their use.",
