        "additional_details": "We , the undersigned, call for the government to stop bribing new mothers with vouchers for breastfeeding. We believe this is a waste of money. Money that would be better spent on increasing the number of midwives, enabling them to spend time helping ALL new mothers.\r\n\r\nWe understand that breast is best. However many women struggle to breastfeed because there isn't enough support from overworked midwives and for medical reasons. Breastfeeding takes a team of dedicated people to support mothers, including midwives and fathers. Support which isn't always available.  There is already an enormous amount of pressure on women to breastfeed which adversely affects the well-being of many new mothers and their babies.\r\nThe important thing is that babies are fed well.\r\n\r\nSpend the money on more midwives, not bribes.
