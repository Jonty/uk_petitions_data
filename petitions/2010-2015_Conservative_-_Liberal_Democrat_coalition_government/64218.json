        "additional_details": "On 5th March 2014, Southend Borough Council granted an amendment the section 106 for Gunners Park. This amendment for its preferred option to locate a Multi Use Games Area (MUGA) and stake park in Gunners Park nature reserve.\r\n\r\nThis is an area of outstanding natural beauty, the MUGA and skate park are not in keeping with the local area or needed.\r\n\r\nThe majority of people who have expressed their opinion, including those living and using the park, are opposed to the amendments.\r\n\r\nWe feel the Council has failed to engage with the people of the area in a fair and impartial way about an alternative location or investment into nearby parks. Instead it has every intention of pressing ahead with a decision it has made regardless of public opinion.\r\n\r\nWe request that the Secretary of State hold a Public Enquiry to examine how this decision was reached and consider alternatives.",
