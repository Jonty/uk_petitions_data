By allowing religions to continue to circumcise their children, you are branding them and taking away their choice to choose their own faith.\r\n\r\nMale genital mutilation takes away a functional part of the male genitals, which leads to desensitisation and less pleasure for the man and woman in a sexual act.\r\nDetailed research into this subject can be found here:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/Ceht-3xu84I",
