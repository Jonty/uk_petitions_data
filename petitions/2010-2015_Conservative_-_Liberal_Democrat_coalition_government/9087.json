        "additional_details": "The youth of today are a \"lost generation\" there is no work about for them and they have no aim in life and no goals and are bitter. they should bring back national service - if these kids cannot find work within a year of leaving school and do not go on to higher education or learining a trade then they should be called up and learnt a trade by our armed forces. this will give them a step up in life and also teach them discapline and that you dont get anything in life given to you - you have to earn it they've been given chance after chance - there is no fear of the judicial system   our country is being dragged into a quagmire of  lawlessness as a country we too soft on most things as a whole. It should be brought back for the likes of the  those that have fouled our country in the last couple of days and that national service brought back. They have not learnt the easy way now its time to learn the hard way before we sink into civil war in this country",
