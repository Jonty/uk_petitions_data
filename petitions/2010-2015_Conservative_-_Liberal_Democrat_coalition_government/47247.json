        "additional_details": "It is disgraceful that someone is allowed to decide my age based on their own personal opinion of the way I look.\r\nI was in the queue of a supermarket and a young girl who barely look over the age of 18 was NOT asked for Identification when purchasing alcohol even though it was an over 25 policy. I must mention this girl was all dressed up, short skirt, all ready to go out on a Saturday night.\r\nWhen I get to the counter I am dressed in my work clothes covered in mud and yet I am forced to provide my Identification even though I clearly looked much older than the girl he just served. I am not sure if this is ageism or sexism but either way it an illegal practice to asked me for ID based solely on how I look.\r\nThe law should require everyone to provide ID when purchasing products which have age restrictions, or no one should be asked.\r\nIt is illegal to ask me for ID based on the way I look!",
