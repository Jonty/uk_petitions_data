        "additional_details": "We want to have Mutual Exchange tenants whom repeatedly waste their councils or housing associations time and resources to be fined for pulling out for a non emergency reason of a Mutual Exchange once they have signed their paperwork. Serious house swappers are being let down so badly by other tenants . The government needs to make a new rule to protect tenants from time wasters. Many tenants go as far as to book their removals ,get school places in another area, change jobs only to be let down at the last minute. After the tenants both sign their new tenancy agreements then they should have a fine system in place to discourage changing their minds. Also they would then be barred for a length of time as a deterrent to stop them abusing the system. and a note should be placed on their file to state this case of action. We believe this would stop many tenants whom abuse the system. This would benefit both the Housing Dept and the serious swappers whom are legitimate swappers.",
