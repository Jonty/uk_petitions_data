The guardian reports that 'there will be no coursework in English and maths as modules are scrapped on the grounds that they encourage what Gove described as \"bite-size learning and spoon-feeding\".'\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the stages of considering, preparing, planning, and producing a piece of coursework are essential to nurturing creativity in students. Scrapping coursework for subjects like English will result in a cohort of students leaving school without having important training in thinking skills, essential for any future career.\r\n\r\nThe government must remember this, and reconsider the exclusion of coursework from the EBacc to allow all students the chance to express their creativity in their own language and culture.",
