        "additional_details": "We request that HMRC reconsider their decision to refuse Bright Horizons a lease renewal within Centre One,Queensway House. This nursery is a custom  built space with exemplary Care Inspectorate reports and provides much needed local childcare. The space cannot be utilised by HMRC without considerable refit costs and the closure will cost local jobs and trauma to the children who use the nursery. The Chief Executive for HMRC, Lin Homer has the authority to change this decision for the better and keep Hector's House open and David Gauke is the minister for whom HMRC is accountable for it's core duties. Please sign our petition to show your support for  reversing this decision and keeping this wonderful nursery open in it's present location. Thank you",
