School bullying wherein the perpetrators have a total disregard for current behaviour management schemes needs to be thoroughly addressed forthwith. The present educational climate in relation to pupil/bullying issues and discipline must be dealt with. I say bring back decent moral standards and corporal punishment, before it is too late.   ",
