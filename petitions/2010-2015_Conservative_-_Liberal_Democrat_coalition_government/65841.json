        "additional_details": "More than 250 16 year old boys are killed or seriously injured riding mopeds each year. The standards of riding shown by many moped riders falls well short of what it should be on public roads. It is a common site in the towns and cities of England to see mopeds, quite often modified so that they far exceed the 30mph design speed, being ridden dangerously and without consideration for the safety of the rider or other road users. Government needs to put a stop to the noise and nuisance caused by modified mopeds and poorly skilled riders and make a commitment to reducing the awful accident statistics. A good start to this would be to require all riders to take a theory test in addition to the woefully inadequate CBT before a rider can ride on the road and to make modification of the mechanics of mopeds illegal so that those licensed to ride a moped at 30mph are not riding machines which can be made to reach almost double that speed.",
