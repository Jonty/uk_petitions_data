It is hoped this will be helpful to you.\r\n\r\nThe BBC has announced that it plans to interfere in the political movement to support a No vote in the Scottish Referendum.  I do NOT support a no vote and do not wish to fund any organisation which acts in favour of a no vote.  The BBC is a media organisation and it is NOT a political party and to use licence taxpayers fees for political motives MUST a the very least be illegal.  If the BBC wishes to dabble in politics then it should refund EVERY SINGLE LICENCE TAXPAYER WHO DOES NOT SUPPORT A NO CAMPAIGN IN THE SCOTTISH REFERENDUM.",
