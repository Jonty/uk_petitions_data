If they pay tax somewhere else in the world, ownership is forfeit.\r\n\r\nAll properties found to have no resident tax payer should be forfeit to the government without compensation and rented out for the treasuries profit.\r\n\r\nMake a new law to this effect and include all office blocks and other properties in the City Of London.\r\n\r\nIf offshore tax haven entities don't want to lose their property to the government, then they will have to declare their identities and pay tax on the rental incomes in the UK to keep ownership of the properties.",
