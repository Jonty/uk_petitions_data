My beautiful baby girl was born in February this year and diagnosied with sma type 1 on 17th July . She was so strong and fought so much . Her big eyes spoke a thousand words. She lost her fight on 21st August . The empty loss our family feel is unbelievable , it's a loss no one should ever have to go through. One blood test in a pregnancy would help diagnosied this silent genetic killer . Now I've lost my beautiful girl to this horrid illness I'm automatically entitled to have the test , but how is it right to go through this to get that extra test . Please help sign this and let's get that test included for everyone. It's takes a few seconds to help prevent a life time of pain . Thankyou for reading and completing . In memory of baby Grace Taylor xxxxxxxxx",
