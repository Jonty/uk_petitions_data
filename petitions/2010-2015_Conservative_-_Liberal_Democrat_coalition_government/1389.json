It is followed by millions worldwide while the english speaking countries usually see the british broadcast.\r\n\r\nBy allowing it to go to paid for channels it will reduce the amount of viewers, which in turn will decrease the exposure of sponsors. This could make them leave the sport, stop sponsoring teams and by doing so put at risk the British Motorsports Industry that is so valued and generates so much employment.\r\n",
