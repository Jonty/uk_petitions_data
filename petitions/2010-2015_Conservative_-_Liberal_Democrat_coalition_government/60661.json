        "additional_details": "The cost of energy is ever increasing and valuable .  My petition is to gain support for a debate in Parliament  concerning the merits of compelling all motor manufacturers (that import to/or manufacture vehicle in the UK) to only produce Hybrid motor vehicles - with a 10 Years deadline. The 10 year period would give manufacturers ample time and incentive to improve on existing technology and provide the motorist with a more fuel efficent and enviromently friendly option to todays vehicles. I offer this idea for development. .",
