The government must re-issue a consultation document or bill on how best to address this. This should include consideration of a range on requirements, including further training after the basic test, the need to have an experienced older qualified driver in the vehicle, speed restrictions on recently qualified drivers who will display a sign on their vehicle, and compulsory enhanced new driver training.",
