It is a voluntary union for life of one man and one woman by following the rules of nature and leading to parenthood.\r\n\r\n    From ancient times the term marriage is a sanctified word which refers to opposite sex relationship. Is it right to use the same term for same sex relationship? Please change the law to use another term for same sex relationship to protect the sacredness of the word marriage.\r\n",
