After a few letters, emails and calls it is clear that many restaurants in the UK are not cooking food freshly at all, but are defrosting and/or reheating factory produced food delivered frozen or chilled and in some cases are cooking food from frozen (burgers etc.).\r\n\r\nIt would I think be right that the consumer knew what condition food arrived on the premises and to know from the menu which foods to order/avoid.\r\n\r\nIt's about time we the consumers got a better deal on food. Processed foods are less nutritious and in many cases are known to actually be harmful. I think we have a right to know what's being severed and how it was prepared. ",
