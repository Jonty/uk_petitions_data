        "additional_details": "I want to suggest all new furniture, particularly large items such as book cases, wardrobes and tv stands come with a warning sticker highlighting the dangers of tipping furniture accidentally.\r\n\r\nAlso furniture anchoring straps should be widely available and either supplied as standard or sold in EVERY furniture retailer. These accidents and deaths are preventable but the risks are simply not advertised, and many parents may never have heard of anchoring straps.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to search online for the \"Meghan Agnes Act\" which came about after a toddler was killed by her bedroom furniture. The American petition is here as I feel this might help people decide wether to sign. https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/mandate-all-furniture-and-televisions-are-sold-tip-over-warnings-and-anchors-safely-secure-them-wall/CdpL6Twf?utm_source=wh.gov&utm_medium=shorturl&utm_campaign=shorturl",
