        "additional_details": "Universities uk, the governing body of universities has issued guidance to universities regarding segregation of male and female students at university. In recent years speakers and organisers of some speakers have insisted on male and female students being segregated. Universities uk have agreed this and have stated that religious belief trumps sexual equality. However they have said segregation should be side to side and not front to back! This is 2013, since the suffragette movement the UK has pushed forward for equal rights. This must not happen in our universities on any grounds. The government must step in and stop religious segregation within education establishments and put this into legislation!",
