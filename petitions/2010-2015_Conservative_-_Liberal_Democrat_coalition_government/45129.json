        "additional_details": "The best way to spend 33 billion is to invest in a digital not transport network. The new engine for change is a high speed fibre optic network. What worked for Japan in the 1960s is not the example to use. South Koreas investment in high speed fibre optic network is the model we should be following. I ask the government to scrap HS2 and use 5 billion now to place broadband into every UK home. This will benefit all areas of the UK.",
