        "additional_details": "In order to save the reputation of our Legal System it should be mandatory that only a qualified lawyer can hold the office of Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\nMr Grayling has highlighted in recent times the dangers of a non-lawyer holding the office of Lord Chancellor. He has repeatedly taken decisions which show that he lacks even the most basic understanding of the legal system and has failed to listen to recognised experts (Judges, Treasury Counsel, Practitioners, to name but a few).\r\n\r\nMr Grayling is destroying our Legal System. The Office of Lord Chancellor must be preserved such that the oath taken upon appointment, has true purpose;\r\n\r\n\u201cI, do swear that in the office of Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain I will respect the rule of law, defend the independence of the judiciary and discharge my duty to ensure the provision of resources for the efficient and effective support of the courts for which I am responsible. So help me God\"\r\n\r\nThere should be a sanction for breaching this Oath. ",
