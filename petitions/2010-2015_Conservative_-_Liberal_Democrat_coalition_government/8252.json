        "additional_details": "The country has suffered numerous riots where effective policing has been restricted by the concern of police officers that they could lose their jobs / liberty if someone innocent inadvertently gets hurt or they are deemed to have over reacted.\r\n\r\nWe therefore petition the government to reintroduce a riot act.  On reading of the riot act people will have a set period to withdraw from the locality; if they fail to withdraw within this timescale they will be assumed to be guilty of the offence of riot.\r\n\r\nAfter the expiration of the notice period if the police deploy appliances or weapons their use will be deemed to be legitimate (for civil, criminal, disciplinary and promotion purposes) unless gross recklessness or gross incompetence can be shown.\r\n\r\nWeapons and appliances anticipated to be used are:\r\nTruncheons of standard and baseball bat type length\r\nWater cannon\r\nTear gas\r\nTasers\r\nBaton rounds or plastic bullets\r\nAnd in the most extreme circumstances live ammunition",
