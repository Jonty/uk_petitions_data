        "additional_details": "We want to improve the image of Pond Square, Highgate Village, London, because it is quite a notorious place for muggings.\r\n\r\nWe believe it has the potential to be a very nice and family friendly area all through the day if we are able to make a few small changes. Such as CCTV camera's and better lighting to make it a safer area. Also in relation to making Pond Square a nicer and more inviting environment, we would like to renovate the public toilets, have proper maintenance for the grass areas and if possibly re-surface the ground.\r\n\r\nWe would like signatures to raise awareness for our petition, so that hopefully the Government will consider our petition, to help the local community and schools.",
