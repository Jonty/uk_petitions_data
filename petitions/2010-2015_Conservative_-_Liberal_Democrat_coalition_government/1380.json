        "additional_details": "We all work very hard in this country, working longer hours than most of our neighbours in continental Europe. Enough is enough! None of us are getting any younger, indeed the population is ageing significantly. Incidents of terminal illness are rising as is excessive alcohol consumption. Lets all take the initiative and push the Government to introduce a 4 day working week.This would allow us more time with friends and family and would lead to a happier, more tranquil Britain and ultimately a more productive, creative and innovative country.",
