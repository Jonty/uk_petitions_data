        "additional_details": "According to http://www.highways.gov.uk/our-road-network/managing-our-roads/operating-our-network/motorway-service-areas-and-roadside-facilities/  Government policy states that all motorway service areas must provide \"free short term park\u00ading for up to two hours for all types of vehicle\".  After the two hours free parking has expired a fee is payable at almost every motorway services. This clearly discourages drivers who may be tired, from taking a long rest.\r\n\r\nWe believe that in the interests of road safety, the limit on free parking should be raised to a minimum of 6 hours.",
