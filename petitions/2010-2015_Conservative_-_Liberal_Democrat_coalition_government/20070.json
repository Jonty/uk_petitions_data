What use is this if MPs are restrained in their votes and the public opinion is ignored by parties? I don't pretend that many of the issues debated will be passed or even sensible, however I do believe that our elected MPs should have the freedom to fully represent and support their constituents on an topic that has been popular enough to amass the required number of e-votes.\r\n\r\nI propose that parties should be restricted in the whips they are able to lay down while voting on e-petition popular issues.",
