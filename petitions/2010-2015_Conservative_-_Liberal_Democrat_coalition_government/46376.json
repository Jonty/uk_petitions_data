We already have problems getting home insurance due to subsidence from 20 years ago, most insurance companys will not insure the S71 area of Barnsley. Tunneling around these mine areas will cause us greater problems getting insured.properties are still moving now and this route will add to the problems we already have, will the goverment pay compense or instruct the insurance companies they MUST provide cover???",
