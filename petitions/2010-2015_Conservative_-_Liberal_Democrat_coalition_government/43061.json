        "additional_details": "The death of this unassuming 46 year old mother of 2 after the prank call from Australia's Radio Station is appalling to say the least. All British citizens are upset over this. The part played by the 2 DJs should not be understated. However, questions need to be asked about the part played by the hospital authority in the interval prior to her death. What pressures were brought to bear on her? What did her line managers say that pushed her over the cliff? The hospital needs to answer questions on how they handled the issue between the prank call and her death. Please do not let this question go unaddressed.\r\n\r\n",
