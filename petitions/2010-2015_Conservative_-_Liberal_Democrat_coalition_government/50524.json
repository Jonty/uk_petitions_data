The symptoms of the condition can affect women not only physically (excess hair growth, acne, hair loss) but also mentally (fertility problems, issues with weight loss).\r\n\r\nI propose a strong support network available to all women diagnosed with PCOS (offered at the point of diagnosis), including free help and advice and an ongoing councelling service.
