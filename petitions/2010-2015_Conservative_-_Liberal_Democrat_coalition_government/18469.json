Very often it is slow and intermittent but customers still have to pay full price.\r\n\r\nIf the government changed the guidelines it would incentivise companies to provide better download speeds and better reliability. It would also result in a more competitive broadband market.\r\n\r\nSimple software could report download speeds and reliability back to the provider who would then calculate the bill for the month.\r\n\r\nThe UK is far behind other countries across Europe and around the world with internet quality and it is no doubt affecting UK business performance and hence the economy.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't pay for a three course meal if you were only served one!\r\n\r\nSIGN IF YOU AGREE\r\n",
