        "additional_details": "I propose that the Goverment revises it's rules on the payment of carers for those who are on Income support.\r\nAt present if you are on Income support and looking after someone 24/7 the carers payment is deducted from your income support, there for you do not infact do not get paid any more than someone who is on jobseekers.\r\nAs it stands there is no point in claimming carers if you are on income support since it is deducted in full. If you are working and claiming carers for looking after someone you get to keep all the carers why then should those who do it 24/7lose it alltogether.\r\nIt is hard enough looking after someone 24/7 but not even getting enough money for doing it is a disgrace and an insult to those who do, do it full time. Please sign this petition and help change how carers are treated by this Goverment.",
