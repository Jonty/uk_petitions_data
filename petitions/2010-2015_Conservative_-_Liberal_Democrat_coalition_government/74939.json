        "additional_details": "At present, employers pay National Insurance contributions based on the pay of each staff member.\r\n\r\nMany employers, such as large profit-making high street retailers, have realised that if they have more staff working fewer hours, they will pay less National Insurance contributions (there is a low minimum threshold, as with income tax, for example). The only people who benefit from this is the company themselves. Full-time work is hard to come by and staff are struggling to pay bills. Also, the Treasury is being robbed of revenue that the country really needs for our NHS, pensions etc.\r\n\r\nI would like to see this change to a system whereby employers' NI contributions are paid as a percentage of total staff pay. This will increase payments from large profitable companies to the treasury and help to fill in the black hole in our public finances.",
