        "additional_details": "To often when Registered Assistance Dogs are attacked by aggressive and poorly controlled dogs in public places the owners are told it is a 'civil case'. This is not correct, the law re Criminal Damage to Property can, and should, be used to obtain a suitable outcome, be it destruction of the dangerous dog or compulsory muzzling. We wish to see pressure put on Police Forces to institute this law and prevent them from 'neglecting their duty'.",
