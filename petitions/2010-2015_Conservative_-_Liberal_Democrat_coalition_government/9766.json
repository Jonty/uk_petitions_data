        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand the cancellation of all Public debt that is created by bank bailouts. A public enquiry into both the banking crisis and bailout should be undertaken with the aim of arresting and prosecuting those bankers and politicians responsible so that they can be punished.\r\n\r\nGovernment should lobby foreign governments to take the same action sending out the clear message that the people will no longer tolerate being robbed by the banking elite.\r\n\r\nWe further demand legislation to be drawn up requiring any proposed banking or corporate bailouts that will be paid from public funds be brought forward in the form of a public referendum.",
