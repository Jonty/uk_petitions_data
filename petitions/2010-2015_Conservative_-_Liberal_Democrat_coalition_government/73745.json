        "additional_details": "The NHS have planned to remove some treatments currently offered to patients with advanced cancer.\r\n\r\nThe restrictions come into place from 12 March and affect a whole range of treatments for breast, pancreatic and bowel cancer. It is estimated that more than 7,700 patients will lose out due to this.\r\n\r\nWe understand that cuts need to be made, but this is literally a matter of life and death.\r\n\r\nWe would like the department of health to reconsider their decision, and continue to offer the drugs that may save lives.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition. 10,000 signatures are required for the government to look at this issue.\r\n\r\nEveryone deserves the right to fight for their lives\r\n\r\n",
