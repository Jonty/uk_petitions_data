        "additional_details": "The purpose of this petition is to stimulate a proper debate about the extent to which CCTV should monitor our lives. At the moment, any extension to the use of CCTV is justified on the grounds that it detects, deters or prevents crime: that the end justifies the means. In fact, it tends to shift crime so those areas not covered become exponentially more vulnerable. It follows logically that the whole of the UK should be covered by CCTV because this will have a dramatic effect on crime and will make sure that offenders can't go to ground and no child or vulnerable adult can go missing.\r\n\r\nI want the government to create a citizen's right not to be remotely monitored and to halt the further use of any CCTV so that if an organisation wants to install a new camera it will have to remove one from somewhere else.",
