        "additional_details": "England is seen as a model of human rights, yet in the case of China we seem to dare not confront this important issue too strongly, instead engaging in massive lucrative trade with them.\r\n\r\nChina's occupation & oppression of Tibet for over 60 years is getting more vigilant as time passes rather than letting up. Torture, abuse, indefinite imprisonment & suppression of religion within Tibet continue, & Nepal is caving to pressure to marginalize and deport Tibetans.\r\n\r\nChina continues to oppress its own people with re-education labor camps, denying of free speech, imprisonment, etc. while suppressing reports of this in order to preserve a false image.\r\n\r\nLet us finally set the precedent for the world by showing there are consequences for human rights violations, rather than rewarding it with trade.",
