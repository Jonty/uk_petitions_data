        "action": "Ban audio ads on all UK internet domains",
        "additional_details": "Audio ads are an unacceptable form of web advertising.\r\n\r\nOften the sound is deliberately annoying to draw attention, and muting audio ads is difficult, with mute often hidden or clicks on the ad needed - forcing ads upon us. Also, audio ads interfere with the ability to run programs that require sound.\r\n\r\nAudio ads also lower PC performance as they use more RAM and bandwidth. For many internet users, bandwidth units cost money and therefore these ads are unfairly costing money we're already spending on our internet package/line-rental.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the ads are a major hindrance to the visually impaired who are unable to see them  and because they require the volume to work for correct use of their PCs, they cannot simply turn the sound off. This goes beyond annoying - it's totally unacceptable.\r\n\r\nObviously the UK can't regulate content on foreign domains; however, I propose a ban on audio and audio/video ads on .co.uk or .ac.uk and any other UK-based domains on the internet.",
