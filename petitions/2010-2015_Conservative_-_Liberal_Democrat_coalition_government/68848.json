        "additional_details": "Today Rosdeep Adekoya received a jail sentance of 11 years, for brutally murdering her son Mikaeel Kular. The prison system in the United Kingdom means Adeyoka will be out in 5 years (maybe less) on good behaviour.\r\n\r\nMikaeel was found in a suitcase behind Adekoya's sisters house, wrapped in a blanket with over 40 injuries to his body. Adeyoka admitted to a court of law, she despised Mikaeel, yet she loved her other children, she had the whole of Britain looking for Mikaeel after she reported him missing and played on the hearts of thousands of British people trying to help her find her son.\r\n\r\nRosdeep Adekoya deserves LIFE IMPRISONMENT, Please sign this petition if you agree that she should serve the minimum term of LIFE.",
