        "additional_details": "On the night of March 10th 1942 a Halifax bomber, call sign F for Freddie, was returning from a bombing raid on Le Havre when it was mistakenly shot down by a British night fighter. The Flt Eng Ron Aedy was seriously wounded by shrapnel. The Skipper, Sqdn Ldr Peter Gilchrist, gave the order to abandon the stricken aircraft.Aedy could not leave the aircraft unaided so Stan Broadhurst, Teddy Arnold, Bert Cooper and Reg Cooper put on his parachute and pushed him out of the door. Stan Broadhurst pulled the rip-cord as Aedy exited the aircraft.  All but one were killed as the aircraft hit the ground near Merrist Wood in Surrey. Sgt Pilot Reg Cooper died from his injuries 3 days later. No medals or citations were given to recognise the actions of these brave men. We call on the Government to right this wrong which has gone on for too long by the posthumous award of the appropriate medal as well as the Bomber Command Medal.",
