        "additional_details": "The government should change prisons back to a puishment facility. There should be no TV's, gyms, child care, good food, things that you would find in a hotel.\r\n\r\nPrisoners should be held in cells, with food put into cells three times a day, nutrious enough for them to survive, but not for enjoyment. The cells themselves should be bare, with a bed and a toilet and possibly a window.\r\n\r\nThey should be allowed one hour of exercise a day and should be allowed to shower once a day.\r\n\r\nThis saves money for the government and should hopefully punish prisoners for the crimes they have committed.",
