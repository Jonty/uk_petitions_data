        "additional_details": "Over the years, a lot of games have been banned because of their graphic content. People always seem to think that games cause crimes, but they dont cause crimes. People have commited crimes for millions of years, and because someone makes a game about crime, it somehow means that all the crimes that follow are because of the game?\r\n\r\nI want the government to unban and uncensor all banned and censored games. E.G  Manhunt 2, Blood, Carmageddon, Postal series etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIts the right thing to do. At least give it a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",
