Political decision making should be informed directly by the public using electronic media. Put policies and procedures in place to regularly use electronic media to guide decision making. Not referendums but regular guidance from the public. Examples could include setting levels of overseas aid,  migration targets, participation in overseas military actions. This will come so let us act now.",
