        "additional_details": "I am looking for the government to take action on the rising inequalities in British society. The gap between the richest and the poorest in our society continues to widen and as long as this continues to happen more and more sections of our society will become disillusioned with life in our country. The political class in our country is made up mainly of those from privileged backgrounds and those that are privately educated and whilst this remains there will be no real drive to reduce the gap that exists. I want government to introduce measures that will start to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. How can it be right that one man can earn \u00a3250,000 a week and another claim \u00a350 in benefits?  ",
