This underhand manner in which data was shared is a clear indication that they are fully aware they are in breach of privacy regulation.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be tabled strengthening our privacy laws to prevent our data being made accessible to contracted companies.\r\n\r\nIt is an intrusion and will break any trust which exists between the HMRC and the taxpayer.
