        "additional_details": "Last night (18/07/2014) five lorries full of sheep and lambs were stuck on the motorway en route to Ramsgate Port for approx 2 hours in 30c heat outside.\r\n\r\nOnce they arrived in Ramsgate the ship Joline proceeded to launch in stormy weather to continue on to its destination, Calais. This is a journey that would usually take approx 2 hours. Last night, because of the storms it took SIX!\r\n\r\nWe don't know where the animals were going after that, but know that they were destined to be part of a festival to celebrate the end of Ramadan, which would include ritual slaughter with no pre stunning.\r\n\r\nWe don't treat our murderers like this. Those animals would have suffered terribly in the heat, crammed in without water on the motorway and then into a storm on the Joline.\r\n\r\nWe do not live in the dark ages anymore, the practice of live export is cruel, barbaric and outdated and it desperately needs to be stopped.\r\n\r\n",
