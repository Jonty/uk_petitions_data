The trustee has not fulfilled it's legal duty as a trustee (as per the Pension Trustees Toolkit).\r\n\r\nA substantial amount of money has been stolen from me and I have been informed by Dalriada that I will see little or none of it returned as it was destined for an 'illegal' pension scheme.\r\n\r\nThe Pensions Regulator and Dalriada are sourcing all legal costs from my pension fund (and the funds of other members of similar schemes).\r\n\r\nAs I have received no benefit from this 'illegal' scheme I expect the Pensions department to return my Pension Fund in full (via the trustee).",
