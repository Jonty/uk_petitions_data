        "additional_details": "Petrol stations are ripping off customers by charging 0.9p on every litre and are rounding up to the next nearest penny which is earning them millions or probably billions without supplying the correctly metered fuel amount, Petrol staitons state that a minimum amount of fuel you are allowed to purchase is 5 litres, 5 x 0.9p = 4.5p and so customers are being charged an extra 0.5p which is not legal tender and they are illegally charging for goods that have not been accurately supplied.\r\nSimplify pricing by forcing petrol companies to stick to whole pence prices.",
