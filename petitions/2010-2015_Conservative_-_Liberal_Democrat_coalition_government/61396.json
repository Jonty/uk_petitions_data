        "action": "Penalise local authorities for issuing wrong parking fines",
        "additional_details": "When an appeal against a penalty charge notice goes as far as the adjudicator at Parking and Traffic Appeals Service, and the motorist wins, there should be a financial penalty to the local authority. The amount should be the same as on the PCN and they should pay it to the motorist within the same period as on the PCN i.e a reduced amount if they pay within 14 days and double after and it must be paid no later than 28 days otherwise it keeps going up. This will stop local authorities abusing their power in the hope that drivers will just pay up even when they have done nothing wrong.",
