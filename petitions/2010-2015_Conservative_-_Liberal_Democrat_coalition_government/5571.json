        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Government to follow the example set by other European countries such as France and Belgium and ban the wearing of the Burka, Niqab in all public places. This relates to all garments which cover the face at least partially.\r\n\r\nThe Burka prevents identification and creates difficulties in some professions such as teaching as well as in the public domain. It can also be seen as a symbol of division and hostility between communities.\r\n\r\nIn a modern and free society it is wrong that women are still allowed to be oppressed in the name of religion.",
