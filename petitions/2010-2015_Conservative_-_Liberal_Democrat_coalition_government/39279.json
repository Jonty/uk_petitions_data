        "additional_details": "In 2013 scrap the end of BST, make evenings lighter. Save 2% of the UK's energy bill, cut greenhouse gases, prevent 200+ fatal car accidents.\r\n\r\nStudies show that traffic fatalities are significantly reduced when there is extra afternoon daylight. This simple move could save up to 200 lives a year.\r\n\r\nA 2007 study estimated that winter daylight saving would prevent a 2% increase in average daily electricity consumption in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAnd it would also save energy by burning less fuel in the lighter afternoons and evenings, and so cut 170,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, according to University of Cambridge scientists.\r\n\r\nA vital hour of extra light in the evenings would have a major positive effect on communities around Britain.\r\n",
