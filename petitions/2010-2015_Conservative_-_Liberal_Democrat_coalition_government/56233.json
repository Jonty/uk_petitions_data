        "additional_details": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type 1 is the biggest genetic killer of babies under the age of 2. Currently there is no known cure.\r\n\r\nOur beautiful baby boy passed away at 7 months old due to this cruel disease.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is currently no treatment, or cure for SMA. Testing can be done at 12 weeks via CVS to determine if the baby has SMA, but currently its not on the list of prenatal tests.\r\n\r\nThis disease is devasting, for the families & most importantly the babies that it affects. Testing for Spinal Muscular Atrophy needs to be added to the prenatal tests done, so more babies and families do not have to go through the same things we did. ",
