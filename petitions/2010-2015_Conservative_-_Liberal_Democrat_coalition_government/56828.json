        "additional_details": "The Government's New Welfare reforms are discriminating against people who have any form of disability or issue that limits the type of work they can do.  These people are being bullied and intimidated into being sanctioned and loosing their benefits simply because the JCP doesn't think they are fit for work, when clearly they are with a little extra support and understanding.  They state that they want to 'HELP' people into work, instead they are causing people to become stressed, depressed and unable to work.  Surely this is the exact opposite of what they should be doing.  Sign this petition if you agree that something needs to be done to stop these bullying tactics and instead of forcing people off benefits by bulling and harassing them, that more needs to be done to help vulnerable people find work or training that is suitable for them and supportive of their individual needs.",
