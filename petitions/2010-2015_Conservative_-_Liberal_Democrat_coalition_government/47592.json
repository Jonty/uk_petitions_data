        "additional_details": "That on or near the day in each year of one of the Patron Saints of the British the First Minister of the Country in Question be invited to address the people of the British Isles as a whole on the State of the Union between them.\r\nAs historically it has been the English who to the greatest extent have determined the nature of the Union the first Address should be made by the First Minister for England, but thereafter the Address would rotate between all Leaders. Not only would this add interest and variety to the Calendar but it would also provide an opportunity for Leaders to offer a more complete and a more balanced perspective on the Union. It would enable them to affirm and assert the new dispensation of power in the Islands and the more collective form of leadership that the new Union of the British will require.\r\n",
