Nick Clegg demonstrated that he has no conviction to the welfare of this country nor his people but will go to the wall (as he has now done) in this country to ensure he keeps his EU pension.  That option MUST be removed if we are to get people who have an interest in us, and NOT the abomination that is the EU.",
