Admittedly Free Parties and Raves can create some problems such as noise pollution, however, I think that with reasonable guidelines, this can be avoided as much as possible. I am becoming increasingly aware of the fact that section 58 of this Act means that those who're organising or attending Free Parties or raves are being treated as criminals as oppose to what they really are - which is a group of people who want to  dance to music, create an uplifting atmosphere and have fun.
