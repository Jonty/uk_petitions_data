        "action": "Reduce central, department and local government bureaucracy by at least 2/3rds",
        "additional_details": "Over the last decade, central, dept and local govt bureaucracy has reached epidemic proportions, with traditional internal depts such as Finance, HR and IT having to expand significantly to deal with ever more numerous and dubious central governance diktats. This is exacerbated by the explosion of PR, Commissioning, Business Case Development, Marketing, Commercial, Strategy & Planning, Governance, Audit, Risk Mgt and Benchmarking functions to name but a few. In monitoring all this back office stuff, we have monthly Board, Investment, Audit, Governance, Risk Mgt, Chief Exec, Mgt Team etc Committees. To make sure these often public forums go to plan, we have PRE - Board, Investment, Audit, Governance... meetings - all of which require \"papers\" - agendas, documents, procedures, business cases, minutes and action points along with a cast of thousands to attend them. Why can't at least 2/3rds of the cost of this lot be put either to front line services or - perish the thought - saved...?",
