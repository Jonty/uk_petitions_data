Why are the thieves who pretend to receive message from the dead freely permitted to steal from feeble-minded people?\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"harmless\" psychics, astrologers, tarot readers et cetera, are causing damage to vulnerable people and perpetuating myths in the minds of young people.  Whilst anyone should be permitted to believe in anything they want, no matter how stupid, people should surely be educated not to believe in things which simply do not exist.\r\n\r\nThe government should raise a law which prohibits these thieves from advertising or performing.\r\n",
