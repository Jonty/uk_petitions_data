Bottles, tin-cans, plastic bags and other forms of rubbish provide an unsightly backdrop to both residents and visitors from abroad as they travel around the country. The rubbish is also a potent danger to wildlife.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly an advertisement for our \u2018green and pleasant land\u2019. The sides of our roads really are depressing when compared to their equivalent in most of Europe. Britain has truly become \u2018the dirty man of Europe\u2019.\r\n\r\n",
