        "additional_details": "West end adolescent unit in hull helps children in the hull and surrounding area with severe mental health problems.\r\nWest end unit is a five day unit which has recently had the residential beds taken away because it does not operate on a 7 day residential basis, although public opinion supports the expansion from 5 to 7 days the license for residential care has been taken away by Nhs England before public consultations are complete.\r\nThis unit is vital for the severely affected child and residential care is a life saver, mental health does not manifest its self during office hours\r\n Beds all across the uk are in short supply already, this is just another attack on our mental health service aiming at the most vulnerable of our society.\r\n please support this cause and sign this petition as mental ill health can strike any child in any class in any family, and if your child where affected then a place like this will be their best chance of a full recovery.",
