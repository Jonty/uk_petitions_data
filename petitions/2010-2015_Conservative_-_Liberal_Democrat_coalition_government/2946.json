Once the petition has been validated by Parliament then a recall referendum should be held in that constituency on as to whether the voters approve or disprove of the recall of their elected representative.\r\n\r\nIf the recall referendum returns a majority in favour of recall, then the Member of Parliament should be immediately removed from their position and a by-election called for an appropriate date in the near future.\r\n\r\nOnly eligible voters should have the ability to sign the recall petition or vote in the recall referendum.",
