        "additional_details": "This shows how corrupt our government is! This country is in a mess and all they want to do is give themselves a pay rise, this money should not be spent on MP'S. They should receive a pay cut and the money should be spent on keeping hospitals etc open. Even with all the lobbying scandal etc they still want to give themselves a pat on the back. PM says he can't do anything to stop this? Then were obviously corrupt! I want the government to go to the high court to stop the pay rise!",
