        "additional_details": "This petition is to call for the resignation of the head of BBC sport in light of the scandalous deal which was done behind closed doors with Sky TV to end UK Free to air broadcasting of live F1 races from 2012.\r\n\r\nThe deal effectively blocked other free to air broadcasters from bidding on the coverage and provides Sky with a foot hold to move to subscription only coverage in future. As a public funded organisation the BBC should be held accountable for this shambolic deal whose sole beneficiary is Sky TV.",
