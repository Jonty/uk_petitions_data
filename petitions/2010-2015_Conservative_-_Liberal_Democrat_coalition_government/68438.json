        "additional_details": "As a new student moving from Northern Ireland starting University in London in September, i'm bracing myself for the huge debt i'm going to collect over my 3/4 years study, however due to the amount of public transport students use (Nationwide, not just London), I do not believe that 30% off (using TFL as an example) is enough for struggling students.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am grateful for these money saving charges, I think that a nationwide law should place a cap/ fare freeze of AT LEAST 50% off on all public transport in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for reading.",
