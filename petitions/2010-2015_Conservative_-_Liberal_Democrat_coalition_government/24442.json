        "additional_details": "Why do teachers feel that they deserve an excellent pension scheme, when the vast majority of private sector workers only receive the basic pension.\r\n\r\nPutting aside the excellent benefits that the public sector brings to it's workers, here are a few of the arguments that they keep bringing to the table, the list does seem endless.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We receive a lower salary than the private sector, so our pension makes up for it. - This is not true, for the vast majority of the private sector workers, they receive basic minimum wage and the basic state pension when they retire.\r\n\r\n\u2022\u00a0We work long hours. - Not compared to the average private sector worker.\r\n\r\n\u2022 We work during holidays. - For the majority of teachers this work consists of a day a week.\r\n\r\nI write this as a private sector employee who has worked in schools, day in day out for many years.\r\n\r\nIn essence, I propose that all public sector workers should receive the same pension entitlement that the private sector receives.",
