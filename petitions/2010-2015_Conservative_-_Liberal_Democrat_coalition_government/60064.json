        "additional_details": "Epilepsy is a condition that has been recognised for centuries but yet the stigma continues. Old stigmas in regards to Cancer, Aids etc. has been eradicated, but why not for Epilepsy? There are many misconceptions when it comes to Epilepsy such as Many people feel they have to hide the fact that they have this condition, so tackling employment issues is a must. Also, the lack of fist aid knowledge among the general public, such as some people still believing you need to place something in the mouth of someone having a seizure, this is an issue that needs government input. There are many wonderful campaigns that are in circulation, but more government input is needed to help make Epilepsy stigma a thing of the past.",
