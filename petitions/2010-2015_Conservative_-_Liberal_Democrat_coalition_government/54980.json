        "additional_details": "The Trident nuclear deterrent is outdated, indiscriminate, polluting and vulnerable to attack from conventional weapons.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose that we replace Trident with an Ion Cannon network. Ion Cannons are incredibly green operating on solar power for the satellite component and whatever source of power is most convenient for the ground station, for instance a hydro-electric dam.\r\nWhile the nuclear deterrent has a response time of around 15 minutes, Ion Cannons are instantaneous. Furthermore Ions dissipate rapidly into harmless energy... Though not entirely harmless when used on the scale of a cannon.\r\n\r\nAs a first-world country we have access to tier 10 tech trees so why is it that we're stuck in the past using polluting technology from a time when communism threatened the free world?",
