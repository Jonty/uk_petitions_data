        "additional_details": "On 10/26, Dilma Rousseff was reelected, and will continue his party's plan to establish a communist regime in Brazil - the Bolivarian molds propounded by the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. We know that in the eyes of the international community, the election was fully democratic, but the ballot boxes used are not reliable, apart from the fact the heads of the judiciary, are mostly members of the winning party. Social policies also influenced the choice of the president, and people were threatened with losing their food allowance if they do not re-elect Dilma. We call a UK position in relation to communist expansion in Latin America. Brazil does not want and will not be a new Venezuela, and the UK that need help the promoters of democracy and freedom in Brazil. ",
