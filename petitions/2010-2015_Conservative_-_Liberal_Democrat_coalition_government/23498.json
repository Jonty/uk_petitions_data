        "additional_details": "My son who is 17 and is studying A2 in London said to me last night that it was unbelievable how much he is spending on travel.  I believe that ALL travel for children in full time education should be free.  I know buses are free but these children are busy and cannot spend all day getting around.  I believe as children are having to pay for teritary education, all travel should be free until their education is finished.",
