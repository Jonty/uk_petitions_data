        "additional_details": "The fundamental belief of this survey is the chance for children to make a conscious decision on faith, religious schools do not allow this.\r\nIt is completely immoral that these schools can make demands for proof of religion of an applicant, when these schools are being funded by a state where 66% of adults have no connection with any religion. \u00adIt is one thing for parents in private to bring up their children to believe what they, the parents, think true and important. It is quite another for parents to expect that the state should undertake the role of transmitting such a belief.\r\nTherefore, this petition calls for the secularisation of religion from education in this country, and the stopping of government funding for these schools, or the conversion of these schools from faith, to secular schools.",
