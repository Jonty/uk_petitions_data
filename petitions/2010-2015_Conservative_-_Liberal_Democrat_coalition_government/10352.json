        "additional_details": "Due to the recent riot's in the UK it is clear that England isn't prepared for such a situation and the moral fabric of a proportion of it's citizens has never even existed. Cutting benefits isn't a solution as it will encourage crime to survive and cost the tax payer more. Giving police more power weapons isn't appropriate as they clearly don't know the difference between a political mainly peaceful demonstration or criminals committing arson/theft/ assault, criminal damage etc. I propose the government pass legislation to approve the use of a voluntarily based vigilante group run by the public but only with authority sanctioned by public the public.",
