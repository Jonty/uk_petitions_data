        "additional_details": "District heating schemes that utilise waste heat from power generation processes are used across Europe to increase energy efficiency and cut emissions. Currently, there are only a few such heating networks in the UK, with the majority of such systems associated with business premises rather than residential properties. The number of people in fuel poverty in the UK is a national disgrace and market reforms alone will not cut the cost of heat for many householders. The UK Government should draw up action plans to install new district heating networks (that serve homes as well as businesses) in towns and cities with populations greater than 5000 people to provide more affordable heating in future years.
