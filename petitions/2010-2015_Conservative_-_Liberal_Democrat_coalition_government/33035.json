        "additional_details": "The EU Cookie Law will harm the UK economy. The government must repeal its implementation.\r\n\r\nThe law attacks the digital economy - a huge and growing part of UK wealth. Non-EU businesses have a competitive advantage and some EU countries will ignore the law to their advantage.\r\n\r\nEvery business website must track visitors. Anonymous analytics help to improve websites - increasing revenue and tax income.\r\n\r\nMany businesses use retargeted advertising.  This allows them to get the best ROI from their marketing budget. Efficient advertising helps businesses manage their finances and make more profit - meaning more tax.\r\n\r\nInternet users can use browser controls to manage cookies. The EU Cookie Law is out-of-touch and draconian. Enforcing the law will be costly; business will waste money on compliance and then lose money when people opt out of cookies.  The UK economy will suffer.\r\n\r\nThe law is bad for business, bad for the UK and must not be enforced. The law should be repealed.",
