Whilst it is a serious mental illness, it is not a debilitating one. Save for paedophile adults with mental retardation, all paedophiles are fully aware of society's revulsion towards their crimes, yet most will continue to be a threat to children for the whole of their lives.\r\n\r\nBy being found guilty of possessing child pornography, the offender is proven to be an active paedophile and is, therefore, as much a threat to society as those who created the images.\r\n\r\nRemoval from society is the only viable option we currently have for dealing with this problem.\r\n\r\nPaedophiles who are caught in possession of child pornography should be sentenced as if they themselves committed the acts depicted in it.\r\n",
