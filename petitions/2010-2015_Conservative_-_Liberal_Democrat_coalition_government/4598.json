An annual charge would be levied on each vehicle (sliding scale dependent upon size/emissions) at the port of entry.  A non-transferable disc or sticker would be placed on the windscreen.  This could be purchased at either the Customs area or at foreign service stations near the ports, with a fee being paid to the operators.  Offenders would be fined. ",
