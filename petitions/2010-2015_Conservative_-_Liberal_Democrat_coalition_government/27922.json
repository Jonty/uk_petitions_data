        "additional_details": "I am John Moore, I am 14 years old and I'm in foster care (Durham Local Authority, Section 20). I go to an BESD school but recently a group of professionals decided I should go back to a mainstream school. I was delighted until St John's RC Academy refused my application for a place at my local secondary school with my close friends. The educational department cannot direct the school into taking me because of there academy status.  But 'higher' people can. Sign this petition not just for me. But for every other young person in a similar situation to mine! Help me get into my local secondary school with my close friends so I can achieve my full potential in life!",
