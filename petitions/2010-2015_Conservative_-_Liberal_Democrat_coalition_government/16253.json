        "additional_details": "It seems a little strange in my mind that when a person in the UK turns 16, they can legally; join the army, get married, have sex or leave home. However, they are unable to vote in elections which may in turn result in policies being instigated that may affect things such as benefits or other types of support that may be required by a young person. This problem of not being able to vote at the age of 16 also creates a problem that the first time people can vote will not sometimes be until they are aged 21/22 where they have missed a major chance to have their voice heard in elections.
