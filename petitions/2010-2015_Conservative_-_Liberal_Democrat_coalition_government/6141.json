Let councils concentrate finances on higher end needs, like social services and care for the elderly and utilise local benefit claimants to keep the community clean and tidy. It would help keep towns clear, toilets open and old folks gardens mowed, It will not take work from the private sector as there is no money for these things anyway. For those who want to work they will be working and for those who don't it may encourage them to seek proper employment and stop depending on the taxpayer.",
