        "additional_details": "The headline \u201cpoor foreign doctors put patients at risk in NHS\u201d in Daily Telegraph dated 12/01/2012 gives the impression that foreign doctors are putting NHS at risk. This headline undermines racial equality. The patient has no way of knowing who is foreign qualified. This will boil down to than making judgment calls based on skin colour. Even the locally trained UK doctors with a different skin will be seen with scepticism. The NHS is very much dependant on the skills and dedication of these foreign doctors. This is nothing but an exaggerated, sensational, and misleading headline. This ill serves the public, and damages the morale of foreign doctors. This may well have a huge impact on NHS, damaging the doctor-patient relationship and harming the foreign doctor. We call upon the Department to look at this closely and respond to such misinformation headlines with accurate facts. If appropriate should be raised at the Leveson Inquiry. The media is rife with such inaccurate reporting ",
