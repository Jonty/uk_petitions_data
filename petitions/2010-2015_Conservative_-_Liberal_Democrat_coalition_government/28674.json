        "additional_details": "We (The Little Green Sheep) are looking for the government to review the VAT on Baby Mattresses.\r\n\r\nOther items like baby clothes (zero rated) and car seats (reduced rate of 5%) have lower rates of VAT because they are seen as essential or carry a certain safety element for the baby.\r\n\r\nOur argument is that all independent bodies (NCT / FSID) recommend a NEW mattress for each baby and that a firm, flat and supportive cot mattress is the safest place for a baby to sleep.\r\n\r\nWe want all cot mattress to be zero rated VAT or at the least at the reduced rate, to make buying a new mattress as accessible as possible for all parents and to encourage parents to follow the guidelines and use a new mattress for each child. This will also ensure every penny the parents spend actually goes in to providing the very best quality mattress for their baby.",
