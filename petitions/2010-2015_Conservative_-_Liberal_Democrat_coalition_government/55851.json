        "additional_details": "The government isn't doing enough to teach people about video game addiction. It can easily happen if you have too much free time and it takes away a lot of that and you miss out on a lot of what life has to offer from it. I feel video games are fun in moderation but when it becomes an addiction it can destroy your life. People don't see playing video games as a danger or a problem but I want the government to help people who are addicted as well as teach others about it so it would happen less in future",
