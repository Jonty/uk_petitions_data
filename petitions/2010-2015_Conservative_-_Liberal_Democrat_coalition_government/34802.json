        "additional_details": "The current Nigerian regime is taking the lives of her citizens for granted. In the recent years, there has been series of serious safety and security issues and it seems the federal government has not got a clue of what to do.\r\n\r\nThese include the current spate of Boko Haram in the Northern Nigeria, the continuous loss of life on the roads (National Motorways even) due to non-existent maintenance and the more recent but now more rampant and more bloody avoidable plane crashes, leading to life losses en-masse.\r\n\r\nThe least a citizen could ask from his country is his protection and safety. It seems Nigeria is unable to provide this.\r\n\r\nI therefore ask you to use your influence to put pressure on this government to do more and prioritise the needs of her citizens over personal needs, over personal needs, and I dare say, over the needs of the cabals of the country.\r\n\r\nThank you",
