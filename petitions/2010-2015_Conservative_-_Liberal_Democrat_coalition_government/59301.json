        "additional_details": "Rafal Nowak, Anna Lagwinowicz and Tadevsz Dmytryszyn were found guilty of killing 23 year old Catherine Wells-Burr and were each sentenced to a minimum 32-year jail term by Mrs Justice Sharp in June after a six-week trial at Bristol Crown Court.\r\n\r\nBut it has now emerged that they have applied to serve their sentences in Poland. This would mean they could be released after 25 years. This is 7 years earlier than they were sentenced to. This is because of more lenient Polish sentencing guidelines.\r\n\r\nWe urge our Government to act accordingly and oppose the deportation until 32 years have passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
