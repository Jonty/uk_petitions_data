Fuel duty currently stands at 5%, which, at current oil prices, adds around \u00a330 to the bill every time a fills up with 1000 litres.\r\n\r\nTo someone struggling to pay their bills on a fixed income, it equates to heating their home for an extra couple of weeks, or having the cash to turn the heating up a degree or two as well as to buy food.
