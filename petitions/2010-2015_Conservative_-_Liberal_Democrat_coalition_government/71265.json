If other countries have failed to improve their situation it is up to their own tax payers.\r\n\r\nIt is not up to the UK taxpayer to foot the bill of other country's economic failings. Especially when Germany and France are having a reduction of more than \u00a31.4bn between them.\r\n\r\nRefuse any increase come what may. We the British people shouldn't be punished for our hard work.",
