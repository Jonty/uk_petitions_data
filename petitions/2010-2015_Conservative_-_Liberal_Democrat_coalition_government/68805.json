        "additional_details": "Not all disabilities are visible so why does the sign show someone in a wheelchair.  It's discrimination and it causes friction.  It also puts someone in a awkward position having to explain why they are in the disabled bay and its intrusive and wrong. There are many people suffering from serious illnesses that are registered disabled but not in a wheelchair. Also it suggests that to be disabled means that you have to be in a wheelchair.  The government is all for political correctness and against discrimination yet the sigb suggests different. ",
