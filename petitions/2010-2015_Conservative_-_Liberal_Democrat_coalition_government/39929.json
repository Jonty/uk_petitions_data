Then there should be a Law to defend the right to live for the unborn. To Lower the time for a legal abortion from 24 weeks to 20 or 12 is an oxy-moron. Do you not know the baby has a beating Heart after 5 weeks. So as a beating heart is medically used to define if an adult is still alive then surely it should be the same definition for a unborn child. Thus should be protected by all the same laws that protects a child after birth. If it is a living human at 5 weeks as it has a beating heart and the beginning of a nervous system being formed. then to be scientifically and morally correct then it should be a law that 5 weeks should be the line in the sand that an abortion should not be carried out after that point. anything beyond contradicts all current definitions of life. 12 or 20 weeks is not enough. make it 5 weeks.",
