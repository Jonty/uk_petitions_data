        "additional_details": "Chinese Lanterns are paper decorations, often with a metal wire structure, which can float up to a mile into the air when they are lit. Austria and Germany have banned the lanterns but there are no restrictions in force in Britain.\r\n\r\nWhy should they be banned?\r\n\r\n1) FIRE HAZZARD: If they land still lit they can cause fires on farm land, in forests and property. They are considered extremely dangerous by most of the UK fire services.\r\n\r\n2) RISKING LIVES AND TAKING UP THE TIME OF OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES: The RNLI has reported a large number of call-outs after the lights from lanterns were mistaken for distress flares.\r\nThe Civil Aviation Authority has said the lanterns could potentially be ingested into plane engines.\r\n\r\n3) CAUSING THE DEATHS OF PETS, WILDLIFE AND LIVESTOCK:\r\nMany cows have been reported to have died as a result of eating the wire frame of lanterns which fall into fields.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and support the campaign on facebook -\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/banchineselanterns",
