Despite this, there are no legal guidelines being enforced to stop people from carrying knives around on the streets, which is why these attacks continue to happen.\r\nAction points:\r\nPeople need to be educated about how dangerous a blade is. One stab can be fatal.\r\nLaws need to be enforced so that carrying a knife is treated as a serious offence.\r\nProtection needs to be provided for anyone who comes forward with information about knife crime.\r\nThere should be no leniency in sentencing, and the full 25 year sentence for murder due to knife crime must be enforced.
