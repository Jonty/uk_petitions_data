        "additional_details": "The government wants to impose new road tax laws to profit off hybrid and electric vehicles. For years the government has said that we should be moving away from fuel driven cars and should be rewarded for doing so.\r\n\r\nNew road tax charges for hybrid or electric vehicles should not be implemented due to the shear fact that the government is going back on its word to reward and encourage drivers to improve the environment and climate.\r\n\r\nWe must fight these changes and ensure that other, fairer methods of taxation should apply. It is simply not fair and should not be allowed to proceed.",
