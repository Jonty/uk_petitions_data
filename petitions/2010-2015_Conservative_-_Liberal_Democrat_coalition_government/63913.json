        "additional_details": "I call upon our Government to take back all shares in water, gas, electricity, rail and road and any other 'need to live' utilities. These should not be in the hands of private shareholders but owned and operated by the state, and along with a re-envisioned National Bank, run at a profit with all the profit being re-invested into the welfare of the nation as a whole. Currently we pay a few, often foreign national, shareholders a profit which is garnered from the entire population of the UK. This profit could be used to recreate our industries, support our education and NHS, even fund our armed forces. There would be a much lower UK deficit if we were not churning out profits for private individuals from utilities that we have no choice but use, and which we once owned. Please, recover these utilities for our own people.",
