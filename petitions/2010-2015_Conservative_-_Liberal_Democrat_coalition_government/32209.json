Between 1966 and 1967 (Cultural Revolution) the entire grave yard was destroyed and a Shopping Centre was built on the area. If his body is recoverable he should be repatriated back to the UK, if not then a full and frank apology should be sought from the Chinese Govt and a marker placed on the site. This is not how a Victoria Cross hero should be treated.",
