        "additional_details": "Using \u2018green energy\u2019 options can costly & inhibit economic growth. UK should not \u2018shoot herself in the foot\u2019 by being unilaterally green.  China, Russia, India, etc will not. Climate change is multi-factorial & their interactions can be difficult to predict. Hardly anyone talk about the greenhouse effects before it became widely publicised about 12 years ago. Climate change due to CO2 greenhouse effects palls into insignificance when sun flares occur, large meteorite strike the earth, when earth\u2019s magnetic poles reverse its polarity. The earth\u2019s circular orbit with the sun can revert to elliptical orbit causing the next ice age, which has been predicted to may occur again in around 2030. If enough cold, fresh water coming from the melting polar ice caps and the melting glaciers of Greenland flows into the northern Atlantic, it will shut down the warm Gulf Stream & then instead of increased global warming, winter would set in for all of Europe, Siberia and eastern USA.",
