If after they are elected to office they fail to deliver what they promise, then the elctorate should have the right to call for them to be dismissed from their post. This should be done by way of a proportional percentage of the vote from which they gained their seat. In any other profession if an employee failed to deliver on their job description or contractual promise,their position would be untenable.",
