        "additional_details": "\"Adequate proficiency in English\" is not a requirement to be able to serve on a Jury in the UK. If you look at conditions to serve on a Jury in the USA and Australia for example then the ability to speak and have a good understanding of the English Language is required to be able to carry out the duties of a Juror. I want this requirement to be brought in and for potential jurors to be vetted to ensure they are able to speak and understand the English Language before serving on a Jury.",
