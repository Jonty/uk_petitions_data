        "additional_details": "Apart from QE Barnet, there are no grammar schools in Middlesex, particularly for North west part of greater London. It is quite unfair that neighbouring counties such as Buckinghamshire and Berkshire have huge number of schools which are very restrictive in terms of their catchment area while Middlesex has one. Students from Northwood, Harrow have to travel almost for an hour each way to QE and majority of student population is disadvantaged due to lack of grammar schools. Like Kent CC, please expand grammar schools in Middlesex.",
