        "additional_details": "This petition aims to enshrine in UK law limitations on the ability to hold referendums in parts of the United Kingdom. It would require that any part of the UK which votes for parties pledging Independence require a 2/3rd majority vote from elected members in their respective parliament or assembly before it is passed to the central UK government. The UK government must then approve to grant the referendum based on a 2/3rd majority ruling by MPs in the UK parliament. It aims to limit the possibility of continual 'never-endums' and to ensure that the UK collectively determines its own future. ",
