The builder put in the groundwork\u2019s, but no equipment has been installed.  Furthermore the area is not maintained and dangerous to the children in the area.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the area is overgrown, with waste and dog faeces, not in keeping with the area at all.\r\n\r\nThe residents are looking to have the area restored to plan or a least have the area turned into a recreational area in keeping with the surrounding area,  that is maintained and safe to use.",
