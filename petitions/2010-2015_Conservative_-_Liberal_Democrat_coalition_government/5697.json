These books hand out breastfeeding advice that is completely wrong, leading to less people breastfeeding, 'advice' that could lead to your child having a heightened chance of SIDS and weaning advice that goes against WHO's advice. Surely for these women to publish their parenting guides or call themselves experts they should have qualifications?",
