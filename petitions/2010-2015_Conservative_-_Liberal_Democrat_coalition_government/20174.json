Private schools should be replaced either by grammar schools or comprehensives. They need not necessarily be taken under state control but this may be the only way to ensure fairness in education.\r\nAn education tax could be levied on those who earn above a certain amount to pay for better state education and increase teachers' wages to provide an incentive for intelligent people to go into teaching.\r\nThese ideas would vastly improve our current education system and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor, allowing those with talent the opportunity to excel.\r\nThe bottom line is that poorer students have as much a right to an excellent education as do the sons and daughters of millionaires and the upper middle class.
