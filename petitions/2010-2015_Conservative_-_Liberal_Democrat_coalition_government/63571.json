        "additional_details": "Easington County Durham, is a proud ex mining village. It is currently in a sad state. The old schools are standing rotting and derelict. Half finished projects are bringing the place down. The coastal walk and miners path on the old colliery site are a disgrace, littered and filthy.  Businesses are moving out and the shopping street virtually shut down. The colliery church is now under threat. The heart of easington is being ripped out and the people of Easington deserve more. We want our village  back and some life injected back into it. ",
