        "additional_details": "India is a rapidly developing country with a nuclear missiles, a large military budget and a space program. It neither needs nor wants aid from the UK. So why do we insist on sending \u00a3600 million aid in the next 5 years? I can only suggest that there are vested interests who wish this unnecessary flow of cash to continue. We call upon the UK government to stop aid to India effective immediately.",
