        "additional_details": "The public, headteachers, schools, colleges, unions and local authorities are calling for an urgent independent investigation into the GCSE English grading debacle.\r\n\r\nBy grading students inconsistently for the same exam, awarding bodies have failed in their duty to maintain standards in the exam system. The grading errors will have massive implications for both students and schools.\r\n\r\nOfqual has so far failed to take any responsibility for the GCSE debacle and to hold the awarding bodies to account. Dismissing the grading inconsistencies as \u201cluck\u201d, it stated that it was \u201cregrettable\u201d that grade boundaries were moved to such a large extent mid-year, and labelled schools\u2019 and parents\u2019 very real concerns as \u201cmyths\u201d. This is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nOfqual\u2019s failure to act undermines parents\u2019 and students\u2019 confidence in the exam system. We call on the Government to launch an urgent independent investigation, so that thousands of students are not left paying for the mistakes of others.\r\n",
