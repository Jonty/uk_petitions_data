        "additional_details": "\"3. Education\r\nIt\u2019s against the law for a school or other education provider to treat disabled students unfavourably. This includes:\r\n\r\n\u2018direct discrimination\u2019, eg refusing admission to a student because of disability\r\n\u2018indirect discrimination\u2019, eg only providing application forms in one format that may not be accessible\r\n\u2018discrimination arising from a disability\u2019, eg a disabled pupil is prevented from going outside at break time because it takes too long to get there\r\n\u2018harassment\u2019, eg a teacher shouts at a disabled student for not paying attention when the student\u2019s disability stops them from easily concentrating\r\nvictimisation, eg suspending a disabled student because they\u2019ve complained about harassment\"\r\n\r\nSource:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/rights-disabled-person/education-rights\r\n\r\nFrom my own experience, some institutions still fail to abide by this law even in todays modern society, this petition aims to get the government to enforce this law and these rights.
