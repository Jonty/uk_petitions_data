What if the EU imposes a new country (e.g. Turkey) upon UK as part of the EU?  In may be chaotic as there can be potental conflicts amongst believers of different religions & culture. The EU is not a united country but a trading economic bloc of countries so there is no need for a constitution. A United States of Europe is doomed to failure, like the former USSR.",
