This should then be \u201cformalised\u201d as soon as possible.\r\nGiven that there is a promise to look at devolved power in England and the rising demand for devolution of power from England's citizens then:\r\n2 The rising demand for devolved power within England be addressed with some urgency.\r\nWhen the above (1) is achieved, the remit of devolving powers on the same basis could lie within the remit of English constituency MPs as an English only affair, to be ratified by HM Government.\r\n\r\nWe request that HM Government take steps to implement the above.",
