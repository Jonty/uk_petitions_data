        "additional_details": "The York Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said that planned operations for orthopaedic patients on the East Coast will soon be delivered at Bridlington Hospital. People having hip and knee operations will be forced to travel 20 miles to Bridlington Hospital instead of in their own town. So far the Trust has kept it silent, gagging the staff, so they could get it passed through without anyone being able to object. As a recent patient i can say their care is excellent, personal and award winning, it would have been a nightmare for me should this have happened to me. If you ever think you or relatives will need a hip replacement in future please sign this petition to stop this drastic and unneccesary move. This is due to happen in March.",
