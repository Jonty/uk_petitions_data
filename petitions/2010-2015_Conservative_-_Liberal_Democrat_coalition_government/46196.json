Surely as a lay man I am not familiar with the workings of large organisations and government departments and need clear guidance to where the complaint or request needs to be addressed, not a vague and ambiguous set of menus that really do not contain the information that I need to make an informed choice. I am given the job of sorting through layers of jobs that I must do before I can proceed. The petition speaks for itself!   ",
