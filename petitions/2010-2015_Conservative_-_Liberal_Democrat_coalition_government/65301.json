        "additional_details": "In 2012 a small town on the Lancashire/ Yorkshire border (Earby) was the first in the UK to honour all its WW2 veterans by giving them the freedom of their town. This was shortly followed by a few more towns within the North-West.\r\nAs we all know our veterans are now in their 80's and 90's.\r\nI am calling on the government to set aside funding for all town, parish and city councils in the UK to honour all our men and woman that served our country in WW2 by giving them the freedom of the town .\r\nI feel that in a few years it will be too late.\r\nWe all have a connection with WW2 veterans weather it be our grandparents or the elderly that walk down your street.\r\nDon't forget what this generation have done for this country.\r\nThank you for your support.",
