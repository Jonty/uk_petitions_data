        "additional_details": "The concerns of MK residents have been treated with contempt. MK has grid roads, which give us a pedestrian casualty rate far below the UK average, cleaner air as cars travel efficiently, and prosperity as working people can get in, out and across the city quickly. MK Partnership and English Partnership, but now the HCA planners, have, ever since 2005, ensured that, where they have authority, no grid roads have been created or extended, and that existing grid roads have been downgraded. If localism means anything, then the planning powers must be returned to MK Council. These outside bodies work contrary to the wishes of MK residents, ignore local transport policies, and gone directly against the Core Strategy, which was published under the previous LibDem council and is now endorsed by the current Conservative administration. Allow elected councillors decide on planning matters for Milton Keynes.",
