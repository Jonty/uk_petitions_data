        "additional_details": "Under NHS rules, women are only eligible for screening from 25.  If screened too young, girls may have abnormal test results when there is nothing wrong leading to unnecessary worry.  Women under 25 who actually have precancerous cells/ tumour remain undiagnosed and untreated.\r\nBy the time a 23 yr old with cervical cancer is eligible for screening, she may be dead.\r\n\r\nWomen over 25 are only eligible for a test every 3 years.  Therefore, if she develops cancer during that time, she\u2019s not entitled to a test.\r\n\r\nDespite having numerous symptoms, family history and concern from her GP, a friend (27) has to wait 5 months to have her 2nd test because she\u2019s \u201ctoo early\u201d, in which time she could die.\r\nImagine being told that despite having symptoms and being advised by a doctor to get tested, you have to wait 5 months and live each day knowing you could be dying: \u201crules are rules\u201d.\r\n\r\nThis government should lower the minimum age of screening to 20 and invite to screening should be annual",
