Not voting is not an option.\r\n\r\nI would like a box to be added to all voting forms saying \"I do not want any of these parties to represent me\".  Perhaps if the majority of the British people actively say that we do not want these people to be making the decisions for how our country is run then they might actually listen to us and not only those with large bank balances.",
