        "additional_details": "The housing proposals by J. Ross Developments Ltd. and A. F. Macdonald & Partners will have a hugely detrimental effect on the west Whitchurch area, in particular on the highway infrastructure. The area is already extremely busy with traffic, much of which detours on other smaller roads and the impact of many hundreds more vehicles will create further chaos. Their mitigation proposals will not improve this situation.",
