        "additional_details": "I would like either the introduction of a beer purity law or the full ingredient list and nutrition information displayed on the product. And while premium beers proudly indicate that they only use the four historic core ingredients - water, malted barley, hops and yeast - others give no more detailed information than the current legal requirement: to say that their beer includes malted barley or wheat. In many cases, therefore, the buyer has no idea whether or not his or her beer of choice has been brewed naturally, or what else might have been added.  As a consumer I deserve to know what goes into my alcoholic drink in the same way as I would any other product. Brewers should have nothing  to hide from the public.\r\n\r\nTYPICAL BEER ADDITIVES\r\nAmmonia caramel\r\nBetaglucanase\r\nRhoiso-alpha acids\r\nSulphur dioxide\r\nProtease\r\nAmyloglucosidase\r\nPropylene glycol alginate\r\nSilicone\r\n\r\nI want a chemical free beer or cider containing no additives. Please make this choice possible.\r\n",
