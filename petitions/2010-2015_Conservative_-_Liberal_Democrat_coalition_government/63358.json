        "additional_details": "It is about time that this and past governments accept that any service in northern Ireland fighting terrorism should be justified with its own unique campaign medal and not just a GSM. I know that all governments do not like mentioning this silent war against terrorism ( calling it the troubles) but many servicemen and service women lost their lives during the long battle thus justifying its own campaign medal as fights against terrorism some still ongoing are afforded there own medal. So I challenge the MOD and Government to have respect for sll those that served and commission a new NI Campaign medal from the start to finish date. Thank you",
