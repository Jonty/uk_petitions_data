        "additional_details": "I believe that all fixed term tenancy agreements for private tenants should contain both a 1 and/or a 3 month break clause as mandatory in order to allow the tenant the ability to decide to end the agreement if, for example: they are suffering from health related matters; family related problems, or financial problems. (The final point being in relation to private landlords that do not accept DSS) Furthermore, such a measure would allow the tenant the ability to end FTTA in instances of emergency, such as ill-health of family members' who live a fair distance from the tenant's residency, and where the tenant wishes to return to his family home.\r\n\r\nEquality & Human Rights\r\nI believe the government should consider increasing the rights/liberty of the tenant in relation to permitting greater control over the ending of fixed term contracts, and thereby making the rights of both landlord & tenant equal.",
