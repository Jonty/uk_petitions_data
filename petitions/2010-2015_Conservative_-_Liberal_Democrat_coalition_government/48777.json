Surely this level of devotion to our country deserves better financial benefits than currently received. There are people in other public service roles that are considerably less risky and have much better working conditions earning far more than our armed service personnel. We appreciate that funding in difficult in the current economic climate, but feel very strongly as do many others that this matter deserves consideration. Thank you for taking the time to read this message and your replies would be gratefully received.\r\nBen Lea Cunliffe aged 16 .",
