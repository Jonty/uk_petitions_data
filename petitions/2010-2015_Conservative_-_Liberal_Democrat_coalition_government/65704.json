Unless they are guide dogs.\r\n\r\nRecently there has been a lot on the news, about how dogs have lashed out on adults and children.\r\n\r\nHow can bus drivers tell if dogs are vicous or not?\r\nSmoking and drinking alcohol has been banned as they create problems for innocent people. So dogs should be too.\r\n\r\nDogs that are on the bus sit on the chairs, which is frankly quite unhygienic.\r\n\r\n The bus fair is currently \u00a32.40, why should people pay that if there is a dog on the bus? Especially if it could put adults and children at risk.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
