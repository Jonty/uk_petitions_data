Ridiculous and far too easy to get away with.This is costing tax payers millions of pounds every year,that money should be going to those who are genuinely ill not to those too bone idle to work,that is not an illness!\r\nGet these investigated quicker,to court quicker and make the punishment fit the crime,might deter people from trying it on in the first place",
