They do this statistically, by looking at the popular music charts: rather than paying the particular artists you've played, they just assume that almost all of your money should go to the most popular stars.\r\n\r\nOne of the more absurd things about this system is the triple-billing that occurs. But here's what you get when you do the math:\r\n\r\n    PRS/PPL got paid when the radio station bought the CDs;\r\n    PRS/PPL got paid again when the radio station paid their broadcasting license fees;\r\n    PRS/PPL got paid a third time when the store paid their broadcasting license fees.\r\n\r\nSo we need to stop these \"companies\" from taxing us to actually hear music, especially for small new bands that will never get paid royalties",
