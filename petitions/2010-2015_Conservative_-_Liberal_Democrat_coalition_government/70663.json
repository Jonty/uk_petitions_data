Needs to be accessible for part-time workers who cannot benefit from season tickets too.\r\n\r\nResult: boost in economy as people spend more whilst travelling; eases the housing crisis in areas such as London as people can afford to commute further from areas where housing costs are cheaper; fewer cars on the road as public transport becomes cheaper option\r\n\r\nDepartments: HMRC (wasn't in your list) ; Treasury: Department for Transport; Department for Energy and Climate Change.",
