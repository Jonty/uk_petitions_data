        "additional_details": "Too many staff are under pressure from their employers to complete work that they could not complete during their normal contracted hours after office hours for no extra pay. This means that the employer avoids taking on the extra staff required to do the work during office hours and it contributes to the unemployment level because the employer is exploiting the existing staff instead of taking on the required staff to do the work.  Staying on beyond office hours should be optional and those choosing to stay must be entitled to overtime.\r\nIf unpaid overtime is made illegal it will reduce unemployment, keep the workers healthy meaning less sickness and stress etc., as they can happily go home to their families and loved ones at the end of the working day and relax or perform their family chores.\r\n",
