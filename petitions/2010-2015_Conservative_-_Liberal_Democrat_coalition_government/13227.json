        "additional_details": "The membership of the House of Lords has grown to the highest level ever recorded. Various proposals have been made to reform this house but there is no expectation that the number of peers and all their related expense will be reduced any time soon.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that all new peers will be created for a one-time fixed term of ten years. As existing peers expire, then new peers will be created on a one-for-five replacement basis until the target number of peers (e.g.one hundred) is reached.\r\n\r\nAs a further suggestion, I would restrict the number of former MP's, and I would abolish the right of C of E bishops, to become peers.\r\n\r\nMy proposals will not affect the tenure of existing peers and it should be quite straightforward to enact.
