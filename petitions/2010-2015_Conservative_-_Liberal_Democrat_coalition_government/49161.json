        "additional_details": "Floating the country's 33% stake in Urenco, the uranium enrichment company is foolish. We would likely get about 3 billion pounds from a firm which makes 8 billion annually and is a great investment in a sector which is doubly important as the number of nuclear reactors in the world is on an increase and the length of contracts are often long term bringing in long term revenue for the taxpayer. This is just as farcical as the floating of Royal Mail which is also a profiting industry and a credit to our nation. Stop trying to sell off the family silverware at reduced price and create growth through investment instead rather than the stagnation austerity inevitably leads to.",
