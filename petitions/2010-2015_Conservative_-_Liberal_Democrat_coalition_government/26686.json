The ability of companies to increase wages in this economic climate is already stunted without the added pressure of a third of its business being unable to increase its profits beyond the figures set at the introduction of the scheme. We could believe and support this if Fuel costs etc had stayed the same also .\r\n\r\nWe find it incredible that the only industry in the UK being forced to discount its product is the Bus Industry . Would the supermarket giants stand for the government telling them to give discounted products to all pensioners ? . We are calling on all bus company staff and their families to sign this e-petition and force a long overdue debate on this issue  .\r\n This petition also affects many non bus company staff ie people living in areas were buses are not available , you still subsidise the concession .
