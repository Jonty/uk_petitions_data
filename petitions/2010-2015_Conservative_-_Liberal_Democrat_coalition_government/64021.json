This problem is no longer exclusive to peak trains.\r\n\r\nWhile there is seemingly no progress on the shortage of trains and carriages, more and more people are piling on to already overcrowded services.\r\n\r\nThere are documents and guidelines in place for the transportation of Livestock, which covers Spacing, Air Ventilation and Temperature Controls. Unfortunately Humans are not afforded the same rights, with nothing in place to protect our health and wellbeing whilst paying to travel by rail.\r\n\r\nIn addition to services being overcrowded, poor ventilation on services with windows that do not open and air condition that often does not work. This also affects the ambient temperature of the train, and has led to people feinting or collapsing.\r\n\r\nThe Government should address this issue immediately and look at introducing maximum capacities by type of rolling stock and seek immediate resolution to providing extra capacity across the network.
