        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call for the resignation of George Osborne. We call for this resignation because we feel that he is incapeable of carrying out the job he has been appointed not elected to do. He said that there was no alternative to cutting the deficit much more deeply than originally planned or we would lose our triple AAA rating but he has lost us the triple AAA rating anyway so what is the point in keeping him in a job that he is failing so badly at. All his sums and predictions are wrong he does not want to invest in infrastructure apart from rail in twenty years time when the Country is crying out for investment. He chooses to cut and cut instead to save money yet ends up borrowing more and more any way needless to say he is failing on every single front and if employed in this position by an outside Company he would have been sacked a very long time ago.
