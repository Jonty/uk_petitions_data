Licensing production will also allow appropriate taxes to be applied to the cartridges.\r\n\r\nThis will encourage more smokers to convert to e-cigarettes, thus cutting the tar-related lung damage from traditional cannabis roll-ups cigarettes.\r\n\r\nThis will also provide access for those patients who believe cannabis will help their medical conditions.",
