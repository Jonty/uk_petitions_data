However, the UK government added lots of exceptions to this guarantee.\r\n\r\nOne of those exceptions is the use of insulting words likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.  This has been used to prevent people from saying anything that the state deems could be offensive.\r\n\r\nIn a true democracy, people should have the right to say what they like as long as they are not threatening other people with physical violence.\r\n\r\nThe exception that prevents insult should be removed.",
