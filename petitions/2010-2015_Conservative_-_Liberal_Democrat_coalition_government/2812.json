This would not be hard labour. It would help rehabilitate Prisoners and give each something worthwhile to do 5 days a week. No pay should be given for this work. If criminals are expected to work for nothing in prison, it will also provide a decent deterrent for reducing crime by persuading the incentive to work for a living instead.",
