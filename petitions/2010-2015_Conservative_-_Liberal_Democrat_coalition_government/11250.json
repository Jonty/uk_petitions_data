        "additional_details": "We would like funding allocated to build animal rescues and provide staff and vetinary care there. Too many animals are dumped or killed through human errror.\r\n\r\nAlso bring in a term of compulsory lessons to teach children how to look after animals correctly, so in the long term plan this equals less cruelty and neglect and less spaces needed in rescues. This can be provided by volunteers. Awareness will promote better care.\r\nThis is a massive issue thats getting out of hand and so many rescues shutting through lack of funding.",
