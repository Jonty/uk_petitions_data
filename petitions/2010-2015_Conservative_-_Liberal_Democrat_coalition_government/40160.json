With riots on the streets of Europe we believe that this announcement has degraded the principles of the Prize and the memory of Alfred Nobel. We call first on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to resign and, secondly, for the Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to make representations to the Norwegian Government to ask that such politicised award-giving does not occur in future.",
