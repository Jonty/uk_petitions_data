        "additional_details": "\r\nIs it me or have I woken up in a different country? My grandchildren who go to a C of E school have had their menu for the term headlined NO PORK.\r\nI have also heard that the meat served is Halal, this type of meat should not be imposed on our children. The way the animals are killed is completely inhumane\r\nI have contacted the school and the Head informs me that all catering and running of kitchen are done by a local council sponsored company and the school has to accept want is on offer.\r\nThis is England and surely all children should enjoy a good well nourished English fare with further options for other religions. Surely that's not too much to ask?.\r\nPLEASE SIGN MY PETITION IF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY, TO ASK H.M. GOVERNMENT TO PUT PRESSURE ON LOCAL COUNCILS TO ADOPT A MORE DIVERSE SCHOOL DINNER MENUS. OTHERWISE IF ALL CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS HAVE TO ADOPT THE SAME MENU THEN IT COULD BE THE DEMISE OF THE ENGLISH PIG FARMER. THANK YOU",
