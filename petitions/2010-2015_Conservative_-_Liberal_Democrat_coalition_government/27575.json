        "additional_details": "In order to improve the efficiency of the NHS a small fee (approx \u00a310 for example) should be introduced for the first appointment and diagnosis, if the doctor or nurse recommends future appoints these should be free. If a person fails to attend the appointment they should also pay a small fee (approx \u00a310). This would go some way toward ensuring that the NHS is working efficiently by reducing the costs incurred through cancelled appointments, and will also prevent unnecessary useage.  This would aid to improve all efficiencies and improve the service to those who need it. ",
