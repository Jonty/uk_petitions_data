        "additional_details": "The market for consumer batteries is currently very misleading. Descriptions such as \"Super Heavy Duty\" can be placed on even the weakest batteries. The only sensible way to display how long a battery will last is in mAh (milliampere-hours). This will be easy for consumers to work out the best value for money because the higher the mAh, the longer the batteries will last. Many consumers buy Zinc-Carbon batteries that are described as \"Very Heavy Duty\" or words to that effect, only to find they last only a few minutes in a power hungry device such as a Digital Camera.
