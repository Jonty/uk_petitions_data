        "additional_details": "The UK has a slanted system of democracy. Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland have Parliaments and Assemblies which legislate on regional matters (although their powers differ) the English have no national representation whatsoever!\r\n\r\nThis means that Welsh and Scottish MPs can vote on English only matters in the UK Parliament. This is unfair and unjust! Why should certain areas of the UK enjoy greater representation than others?\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned seek to end this injustice and finally resolve the West Lothian question. We seek the establishment of an English Parliament with powers equal to those of the Scottish Parliament. In the long term we also seek the devolved Assemblies of Wales and Northern Ireland be given equal powers.  This will bring equal representation to all citizens of the UK, no matter where they live! Sign this petition if you believe that all Britons deserve their voices heard equally!",
