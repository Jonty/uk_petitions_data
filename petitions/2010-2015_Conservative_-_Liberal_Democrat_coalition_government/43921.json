        "additional_details": "Having served a prison sentence for a driving accident that resulted in a fatality which was not drink or drug related but medically related trying to find employment without discrimination has become practically impossible. I have good qualifications and I recently applied for a job at RBS who were interested until the previous conviction was revealed. I was convicted of a driving offence not fraud but this makes no difference whatsoever! If the government wants to see ex prisoners turn their lives around and stay out of prison then give the person trying to get work a chance! Its the tax payer who pays for prisoners welfare whilst in custody so the government should give them more of a chance that once released they stay released. Less discrimination for ex offenders who are qualified but are not being able to explain to prospective employers their mistake in life.",
