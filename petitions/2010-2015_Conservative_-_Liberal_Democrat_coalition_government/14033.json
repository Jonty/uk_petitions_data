        "additional_details": "This is a petition created in direct response to the recents riots which occured in many parts of the UK. We propose to set up a national commission of youth workers and people who are passionate about youth issues to look at the roots of the problems of violence and anti social behaviour associated with troubled young people in our communities. This commission will come up with practical proposals to be implemented, to tackle at their roots this problem and attempt to prevent and eradicate it from our communities.",
