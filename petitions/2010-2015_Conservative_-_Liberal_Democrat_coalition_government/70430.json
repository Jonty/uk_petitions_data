I disagree, we are in a situation where our own people are being killed. These murders are being commited by people from our own shores.  The government and relevant authorities have not taken appropriate action to stop these people travelling to Syria.  Therefore this problem becomes a problem for the west aswell.  Our forces are stronger and better equipped to deal with the Islamic State and I suggest that ground forces should be deployed to eradicate these evil terrorists and the people commiting treason against our country!",
