        "additional_details": "There are currently no separate criminal offences relating to \u2018disability hate crime\u2019 (unlike racially and religiously aggravated crime) as the existing legislation set out in section 146 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (s.146 CJA 2003) is deemed sufficient.\r\nVictims of disability hate crime are constantly being let down by the police and the CPS because of the lack of clarity that surrounds the issue and the reluctance of the authorities to acknowledge the extent of abuse suffered by the millions of disabled people in this country.\r\nThis, in turn, leads to a lack of deterrence that leaves some of the most vulnerable people in society to live their lives in fear of abuse or worse.\r\nWe demand the law is changed to make Disability hate crime a specific criminal offence.",
