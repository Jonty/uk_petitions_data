        "additional_details": "Although there are currently moves to improve the side & front vision on lorries to help protect vulnerable road users, there is currently nothing planned to address the fact that the majority of lorries and vans have NO vision to the rear, leaving a lethal blind spot EVERY TIME such vehicles reverse. Meanwhile lives are being lost or irrevocably damaged by avoidable collisions. With your help and signature RearView (www.rearview.org.uk) intend to increase the pressure on the Government to make changes and introduce mandatory requirements for rear view cameras or sensors to be fitted to all commercial vehicles in the UK.  Please add your signature now and help save lives.",
