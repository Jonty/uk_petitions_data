Surely the option for people to pay car tax in smaller amounts, every month, would reduce the number of drivers risking driving without car tax.\r\n\r\nMany people on low wages or unemployed through no fault of their own are in the very difficult position of not being able to pay car tax in one lump sum, and this can cause tremendous problems for people who live in areas where there is very little public transport.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\nA simple option to pay monthly (even if this is strictly by Direct Debit only to save the cost of paperwork by reminders every month) when renewing the tax disc.\r\n\r\nIf the insurers can do it, then surely it's possible for the DVLA, even if it's only for those people on certain benefits or low wages?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
