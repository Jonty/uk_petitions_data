        "additional_details": "The Grand Arcade/Lion Yard is the City of Cambridge\u2019s flagship shopping centre, and since its redevelopment back in 2007/8, Cambridge residents have lost a key feature as a result of the centre redevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe people of Cambridge would like too see the return of their Red Lion statue. For many years, a central feature of the atrium was a large white pillar with the statue of a very large red lion on the top of it, safely out of easy reach from children and adventurous students.\r\n\r\nThis recalled the old Red Lion pub, one of the main coaching inns in Cambridge, which had occupied the site until it\u2019s demolition in 1969. The size of the shopping centre and cark park gives some idea of just how large the Red Lion's coaching yard was.\r\n\r\nThe developers still have the Lion in storage, let\u2019s remove the dust cloths and return him to his pedestal high above the shoppers of Cambridge, and allow future generations to marvel at this iconic statue.\r\n",
