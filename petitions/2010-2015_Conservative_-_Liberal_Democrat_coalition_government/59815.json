        "additional_details": "It is becoming more and more obvious that the current system of government is out dated and out of touch with the people. To say we are living in a fair democracy is a laughable concept. The people have no voice.\r\nThe world is changing and systems of governance should change in line with this.\r\nI call for the immediate dissolution of government and real debate on the right direction to proceed. I have my own opinions on this, as i'm sure you all do. Is it not therefore the right thing to do to debate these choices. Move forward as a society together for a better future. Enough living in the shadow of overbearing, untrustworthy and out of touch elitists. I call for real change. ",
