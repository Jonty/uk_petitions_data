As a smoker, I find myself feeling uncomfortable and singled out as a result of this ban - a ban I feel was made up of coincidental incidents with regards to some people's health.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the government could consider granting public houses and bars licences for smoking areas within their premises? Or alternatively, scrap the ban and realise how important smokers are to this country.",
