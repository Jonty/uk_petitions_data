        "additional_details": "We have \u201crights\u201d under the Human Rights Act and the Common Law but there is no institution of state that allows the ordinary citizen defend those rights. We lack article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Without this most citizens have no means to defend their rights.\r\n\r\nIt is even worse for Common Law rights. For example there is a public right of navigation on all rivers, affirmed by the 1472 Act for Wears & Fishgarths. The High Court ruled this could only be extinguished by legislation or statutory powers but no one may defend this right because infringement of a PRN can only be addressed by the Attorney General who is a politician with no obligation to bring any case. Anyone may violate this right, as happens on 96% of waters that the public could navigate.\r\n\r\nThe British government should adopt article 13  and set up a  National Rights Authority charged with the defence of human and Common Law rights of the individual citizen regardless of their means.",
