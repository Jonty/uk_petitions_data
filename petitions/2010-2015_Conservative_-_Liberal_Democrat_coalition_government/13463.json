        "additional_details": "I believe that the main/root cause of the riots is that the government expects the unemployed to work at a work-placement for free unpaid for as much as two years without earning a penny. It is my opinion that these work for free schemes make the unemployed feel like undervalued slave labour. I want parliament to discuss the possibility that I am correct in this assumption and I want the Loyal British Public to be aware that the unemployed are expected to work for free. I want this work-placement scheme abolished. Respectfully Bradley James Davies I=MC2 all those in favour say \u201cI\u201d ",
