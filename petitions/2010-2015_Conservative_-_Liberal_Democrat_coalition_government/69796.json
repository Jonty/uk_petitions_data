People living in Scotland have been promised Constitutional reform, including a white paper before the 2015 General Election and ratification as soon as possible thereafter.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned appeal to the Westminster Government to include in the process proper consultation with the public and the holding of a Constitutional Convention in Scotland prior to the writing of the White Paper and the General Election.\r\n\r\nWe will reject the imposition of new rules if adequate consultation and agreement are not part of the reforms.",
