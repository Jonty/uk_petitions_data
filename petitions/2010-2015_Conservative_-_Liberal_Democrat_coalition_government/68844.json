Customers are more likely to write a review if they have had a negative experience, competitors can write reviews or get third parties to do this and ex-employees can abuse it. A true picture of an establishment is never given.\r\n\r\nCustomers decide not to visit establishments on the content of these reviews and although some are removed by TripAdvisor damage has already been done.\r\n\r\nThis is a basic request to have the right to be removed from review websites.",
