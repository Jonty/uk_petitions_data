        "additional_details": "Contraception and sexual health (CASH) services have always been an alternative to the GP's for women to have their Cervical screening.\r\nDue to recent political changes and CASH not getting any funding to provide this service  there is no longer choice and the GP is the only option.\r\nGP's are incentivised and so to bring back the choice  for women there should also be payments for CASH\r\nShouldn't the money follow the patient? Shouldn't women still have a choice where to go?\r\nCASH Nurses have the Expertese,the skills and the time. They will be deskilled if they are not utilised, they can relieve the pressure on GP practices and are very often more accessible.",
