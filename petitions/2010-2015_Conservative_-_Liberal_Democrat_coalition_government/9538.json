        "additional_details": "Following the recent riots in London and elsewhere, the government is considering the possibility of censoring and even shutting down Social Networking websites and services during times of disturbance. While it is true that some criminal elements may have used these services to co-ordinate their actions, far more people used them to keep friends and the broadcast media informed of danger areas and help innocent people avoid the areas where the riots were taking place. Shutting down such services could seriously endanger innocent lives, and would also constitute a serious breach of civil liberties. These services must be protected from all forms of government interference, even in times of civil emergency, in order to protect the right of free expression, and this protection should be enshrined in law.",
