        "additional_details": "We can no longer trust even big corporations not to exploit vulnerable adults. Many vulnerable adults and those with learning difficulties do not understand the small clauses in mobile phone contracts, bank charges, media contracts, high street loans, credit card loans hire purchase loans, pay day loans, utility contracts etc. They do not understand interest rates APR, fines for late payments and other penalties. Consequently, many suffer disproportionately, when large corporations levy heavy penalties on often very low incomes.\r\nA Select committee should be set up to examine corporate abuse of vulnerable persons and consideration should be given to adding a 'corporate abuse' category to the Safeguarding Adults legislation",
