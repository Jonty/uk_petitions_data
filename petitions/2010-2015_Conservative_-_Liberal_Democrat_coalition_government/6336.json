I propose that we start investing in that country once again. Take a lead from Germany and make our own products and be proud to buy British.\r\n\r\nLets be at the front again in business by making things that the world wants to buy and pay our workers a decent wage for the skills that they have.\r\n\r\nI want the government to do more to produce goods here in the UK thus keeping our people employed.",
