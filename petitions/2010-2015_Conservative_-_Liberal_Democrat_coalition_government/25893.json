        "additional_details": "With the current economic climate the only future should be to push funds into Britain and build the wealth of the UK. A simple but effective method would be for the government to decide  to withdraw from funding the failing Eurozone, saving the UK and its people \u00a350 million per day. In two days every person in Britain could be given a one off payment of \u00a31 million, thus investing in Britain, with the condition of paying off any existing personal debts, and then investing at least 50% of the remainder in the UK for at least 12 months.. This would in effect reduce all personal debt substantially, remove poverty and improve quality of life. In addition to this the goverment could then use the remaining \u00a350 millions per day to start reducing the national debt and make Britain great again.",
