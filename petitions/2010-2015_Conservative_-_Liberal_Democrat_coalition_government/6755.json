        "additional_details": "For years I have read articles about the government funding legal cases for people who lack the opportunity to fund them themselves. I believe in this fair system. Even the less wealthy deserve a chance. What I petition against is the complete disregard for the total sum the tax payers are paying for regarding ridiculous claims. A system needs to be put in place to put legal aid back in its rightful place, As \"AID\" and not just a handout to the best lawyers around. Have legal grants which can be applied for and means tested and granted based on the claim being made. Or lawyers that are on govt payroll, that handle any case. Then the claimant with only be given a choice of a govt lawyer or pay for the case themselves. This could save us millions every year. This is a subject that needs to be discussed in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nJOIN VOTES... JOIN TOGETHER",
