        "additional_details": "Government action required: Re-open the Ofsted report into the circumstances of the death of Peter Connelly now that more information is available.\r\n\r\nBackground / rationale: The previous report was flawed due to various pieces of information being withheld by a number of organisations and the conclusion should not in good conscience be allowed to stand. Indications are that the previous government in some capacity influenced sections of the report which is unacceptable and that the opposition at the time had incorrect information.\r\n\r\nThe media hysteria and tactics that are now being alluded to have subsided to a degree so hopefully it is the correct time to revisit and re-scope the nature of the report. If these systemic failures in reporting are allowed to continue unchallenged then the public will continue to be misled and incorrectly informed by the media and the agencies involved.\r\n\r\nNote: Initially rejected on the strange rationale that no governmental action was specified.",
