        "additional_details": "First time and Second time buyers struggle to get onto and up the property ladder as they are bidding against investment buyers.Just because a person is not an investment buyer, does not mean that they are good for the money to buy a property. So why are investment buyers treated favourably?  Estate agents push in favour of investment buyers as they often result in fees associated with the resulting rental.  Sign this petition to make it a conflict of interest for an estate agent to be able to market for rent, a property that they have sold, for a period of 12 months from the date of completion. ",
