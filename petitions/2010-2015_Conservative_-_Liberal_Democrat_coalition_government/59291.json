        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the UK Government to legislate against banks maliciously reporting disputed credit accounts to credit reference agencies (CRAs)\r\n\r\nBanks have a nasty habit to hold people to ransom for money that they don't owe.\r\n\r\nWorking with retailers and CRAs, false accounts are created. Banks then try to extort money from victims,with the threat of a default.\r\n\r\nIf the victim refuses to pay, the bank maliciously defaults the account, annihilating the creditworthiness of it's victim.\r\n\r\nThe victim can't borrow to buy a family home or other borrowing (including 0% deals) and may have trouble finding employment.\r\n\r\nThe nightmare lasts 6 years (longer if the victim attempts to seek justice)\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court will finally rule on the first case to have made it in early 2014.  Durkin v DSG & HFC.\r\n\r\nIt has taken 16 years and a very strong will to overcome all the hurdles that successive governments have in place to protect these criminal bankers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
