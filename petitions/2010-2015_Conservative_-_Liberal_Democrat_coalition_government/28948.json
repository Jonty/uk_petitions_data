        "action": "Reform of sentencing for causing death whilst uninsured.",
        "additional_details": "Following the death of a biker, it has become apparent that the courts are unable to impose a custodial sentence to a driver who was not insured at the time of the accident, and the uninsured driver caused the death of another.  This petition is for reform and to lobby the Ministry of Justice to reform the sentencing guidelines and to impose a mandatory custodial sentence if the death of a road user is caused by an uninsured driver, no matter what the circumstances are.\r\n\r\nAt present, the sentencing guidelines state that where the level of carelessness is low and there are no aggravating factors to the standard of driving, even the fact that death was caused, is not sufficient to justify a prison sentence.  This should be changed for a mandatory custodial sentence.",
