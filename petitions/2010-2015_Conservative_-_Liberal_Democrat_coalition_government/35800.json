        "additional_details": "The goverment notes that two decades of lack of action and indecision are killing and maiming motorists on the A36 in West Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nThe A36 between the Cotley Hill Heytesbury village roundabout and the Codford by-pass claimed three local lives so far this year.\r\n\r\nMarch 2007 cyclist dead. February 2003 car driver dead. November 1999 car driver dead. February 1999 passenger dead. July 2003 another death.\r\n\r\nBetween 1999 and 2010 the total death toll in West Wiltshire was 77 drivers, passengers, or cyclists.\r\n\r\n22 around an 11 mile section around Warminster is an appalling statistic. Two per mile.\r\n\r\nTherefore this pettion calls on the DoT to:\r\n\r\n1) Take immediate action to implement the Heytesbury to Codford by-pass to improve this sub-standard stretch of the A36.\r\n\r\n2) Take immediate action to make the egress from Upton Lovell on to the A36 a no right turn.\r\n\r\n3) Urgently review the A36 safety record through west Wiltshire.",
