        "additional_details": "We want the government and/or Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council to stop the closure of The Pines - Kitt Green, Wigan.\r\n\r\nThe Pines provides accommodation for 24 people living with disability, in particularly learning disability. There are also five places for respite care.\r\n\r\nThe Pines has provided adapted accommodation for many years and disabled residents, carers, families and workers are extremely concerned and worried about the consequences of the proposed closure.\r\n\r\nMany residents have lived with each other for many years and have developed strong bonds and friendships providing each other much valued support.\r\n\r\nThe residents and their families want to continue to live at The Pines so that they can continue with their settled accommodation.\r\n\r\nWe believe all other options should be considered to ensure the project remains open.",
