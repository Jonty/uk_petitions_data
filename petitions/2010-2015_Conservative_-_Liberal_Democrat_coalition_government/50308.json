        "additional_details": "As all MP's can claim rent, travel, food and other expenses then why do they need 60k + as a wage?\r\n\r\nSurely if we are deemed worthy of a minimum wage as a basic standard of living then MP's should also adhere to this! If its good enough for us it's good enough for them!\r\n\r\nLets make a difference and get this debated in parliament... A payrise is perverse after all the tax cuts for the rich.. Don't just think its unfair find your voice and make a change!!",
