Users should require a license, given by a medical professional, stating that they are in need of a mobility scooter. This should count for rental and sales.\r\nCurrently, in the streets of Bridlington (just one example) people are encouraged to ride mobility scooters whether they need them or not. Resulting in hazardous footpaths, congested shops, blocked roads and general nuisances. ",
