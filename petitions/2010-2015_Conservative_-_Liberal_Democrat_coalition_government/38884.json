Others who have looked into the issues and pressures upon students and their teachers/ school-workers must also.\r\n\r\nIt is a radical overhaul with no dialogue from its stakeholders. It shows no awareness of the last thirty years of educational progress within this country including the acceptance and development of learning styles.\r\n\r\nAbove all, a \"one size fits all\" approach merely allows for young people with skills in anything other than academia or memory to lose self-esteem, self-confidence and opportunity.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the more academic can switch off until their final exams meaning they are not being properly challenged or fulfilling potential.\r\n\r\nI call upon anyone to have a careful and detailed observation of these issues, which I believe are merely the tip of the iceberg, and sign this petition.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, it requires debate.",
