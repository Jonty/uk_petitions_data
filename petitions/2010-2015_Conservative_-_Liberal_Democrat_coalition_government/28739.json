        "additional_details": "With members of the UKARA having to be over 18, and the legal age for anyone to play airsoft is 16+ it is highly unfair that school/college students in the UK should have to pay an extra \u00a3200-\u00a3300 for a realistic airsoft gun when they are 18 instead of the two tones currently available.\r\n\r\nI suggest that ages 16 and 17 should be able to join the UKARA, but they will require a parents signature, and have to play 4 times in over 2 months (Instead of 3 in over 2 months.) This should then grant them use of an airsoft gun. The parent guardian would have to purchase said gun, but the under 18's UKARA license  can be used to purchase realistic airsoft rifles.",
