        "additional_details": "As the price of fuel continues to rise the Government solution is to continue to increase the rate of duty, a rate which is already beyond an acceptable level. While fuel prices and duty continue to rise people are inclined to make less journeys so the amount of revenue generated, albeit at a higher rate, must be in decline. The rate of duty must be reduced in line with European rates before the transport sector grinds to a halt.\r\nNo transport = no economy = european bailout.\r\nIt is not a sufficient government response to the debate to say they should have charged more duty already, fuel duty is not a bailout fund for the UK.
