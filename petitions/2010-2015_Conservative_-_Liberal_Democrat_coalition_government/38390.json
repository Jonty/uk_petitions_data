Means testing is designed to eliminate benefit cheats but it doesn't because those who want to play the system will do so no matter how tough the process and will leave people who may have a valid claim unable to claim.\r\n\r\nAs a disabled person, it seems unfair that people without disabilities or who earn vast amounts of money feel they can play the system because that means less money for the disabled, unemployed or otherwise disadvantaged.\r\n\r\nBy taxing benefits we make it less \"cool\" to play the system",
