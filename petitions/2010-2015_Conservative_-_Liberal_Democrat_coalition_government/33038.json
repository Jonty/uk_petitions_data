        "additional_details": "In March 2012, a 6-year-old schoolgirl tragically lost her life after choking on a piece of food while eating her lunch at a school in Teesside. Dinner supervisors were, unfortunately, unable to prevent the incident. A shortage of qualified first-aiders was potentially a contributing factor.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe that steps need to be taken to prevent similar accidents in the future. We therefore call for all school staff responsible for supervising children to be required to successfully complete suitable first aid training prior to taking up their post, and to take regular refresher courses thereafter",
