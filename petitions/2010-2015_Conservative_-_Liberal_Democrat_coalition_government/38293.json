        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon the government to build a million new council houses over the next 15 years.\r\n\r\nEvery year the housing industry builds around 120,000 private homes: we need at least 200,000 new ones a year to  keep up with population growth. A major council house building program would combat help combat this shortage and make sure that no one is left without a roof over their head.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a house building program would bring economic benefits in the form of stimulus to jobs and investment, less spending on housing benefit and income from rents. A House of Commons Council Housing Group report has estimated that the cost of NOT building a million council houses will exceed \u00a321.5 billion a year in the direct and indirect costs of homelessness.",
