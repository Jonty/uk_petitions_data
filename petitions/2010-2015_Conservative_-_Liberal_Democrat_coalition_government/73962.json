        "additional_details": "I propose that NS&I urgently offer the new 65+ Guaranteed Growth Bonds to all women who have reached the Government retirement age.  This includes those women born between 1950 and 1955 who already qualify for state pensions.\r\n\r\nWomen born between 1950 and 1955 retire before the age of 65 and do not qualify for the new Bonds.  This is grossly unfair to women in this age category.\r\n\r\nNS&I should recognise that the age of retirement is no longer 65 for everybody and revise their rules accordingly.\r\n\r\nWould all women, particularly those born between 1950 and 1955 please sign this e-petition to be recognised and counted by the NS&I.\r\n\r\nAll votes from men, of course, are also extremely welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
