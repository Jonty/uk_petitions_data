        "additional_details": "Jack Smithies is the most fantastic young poet of our time and we have decided it is time for his unique skills to be recognised. His use of the forward slash is most innovative. He has recently been awarded an award for young writers, which recognises talent in young writers in the fields of poetry and creative writing. Also, he is really good at writing Latin essays, and his interpretations of the works of Catullus are inspirational. Vote for Jack!",
