        "additional_details": "While there are about 25 major species within the Genis \u201cCoffea\u201d, there are only two main species that are cultivated for commercial coffee consumption; Coffea Arabica (Arabica), and Coffea canephora (commonly referred to as Robusta).\r\n\r\nAs a rule, Arabica is the bean of choice for the specialty coffee trade and Robusta is used predominantly in instant coffee production.\r\n\r\nIn recent times as a way of cutting costs coffee manufacturers have started to introduce and increase the percentages of Robusta beans in their previously high quality coffees whilst the price remains the same.\r\n\r\nWe therefore petition this department to make coffee labeling clearer so the consumer has a clear view of what they are buying",
