        "additional_details": "Stop the breeding of dogs by people who are doing it to make money off of their pets. There are enough dogs in rescue centres that need a home, so why are people allowed to breed to sell. I am aware there is a wide variety of people who breed, but some just see the profit at the end of it and their dog is not insured or cared for in the correct way. These are the people I would like to be stopped! A licence or permit as such should be introduced that investigates the reasons for breeding, environment its going to happen in and possibly make sure all puppies (minimum 5) are sold to a good home before allowing the bitch to become pregnant. Serious consequences such as a large fine and being banned from owning any dog should be put upon people who choose to breed without permit if this or something similar was put into place. Thanks for reading and I hope you sign. ",
