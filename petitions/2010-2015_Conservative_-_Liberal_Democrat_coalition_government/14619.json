        "additional_details": "The increasing cost of motor insurance among the 17 to 21 age group, has led to an increase in so called 'Fronting'; this is when a 'parent' takes on the ownership and main insurance of their 'child's' car, making the 'child' a named driver; thus reducing the insurance premiums by around two thirds (which is apparently illegal). surely, it would make more sense for our insurance companies, simply to reduce the premiums of 17 to 21 year old's by up to 50%. This would not only make motoring more accessible to young drivers, but would also stop this so called 'Fronting'. The high premiums are surely, just another way for insurance companies to increase their already huge profits. Our government need to put pressure on the insurance companies, to drastically reduce these ridiculously high premiums.",
