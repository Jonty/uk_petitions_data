Should the driver win and the clamper refuses to recompense then a County Court Judgement is issued.\r\n  Invariably the Clamping Company just ignores any CCJ issued to them and when they have an embarassingly large number of CCJ's they just close the company without the victim having recovered their money.\r\n   I would like the Ministry to look into making these Business CCJ's enforcible so that their victims are not without any means of redress.",
