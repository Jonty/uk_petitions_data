Some young people may attend clubs, societies sporting events and other activities where they choose to go, as they have a right to alongside other young people their own age.\r\n\r\nIt is common for many major religions to teach that being gay is wrong in the eyes of their deity, and that it is wrong to be gay.\r\n\r\nIt should be illegal for anyone who is in a position of trust who works with children to give any anti-gay or homophobic messages, spread hate or bully, tease and humiliate any child because of their sexuality or gender identity.\r\n\r\nThe law should include anyone teaching that homosexuality is immoral, sinful or an abomination and should not just cover religious institutes but extend to anyone who a child is asked to trust.\r\n",
