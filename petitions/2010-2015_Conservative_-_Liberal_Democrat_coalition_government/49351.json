It is not fair that students or parents should have to pay for an education.\r\nGovernment is trying to get people to stay on in further education instead of going for a job, but if people have to pay over \u00a3100 per term for transport that should be free then they are not going to stay on.\r\nI want government to change this so that there is some way for children to get into school for free; this could mean a cycle track from each village to the school or some form of free transport, like the free bus service that everyone from year 5 to year 11 get.\r\n Sign this petition to ensure that the right to an education, is a bit more fair",
