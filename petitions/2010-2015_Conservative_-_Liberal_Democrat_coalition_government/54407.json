So it is no surprise the vote failed.\r\n\r\nWhich ever side is responsible, we simply cannot stand by & watch over 100,000 people perish. The Syrian regime should have listened to their people to avoid the current conflict.\r\n\r\nChemical weapons or not, a more informed & better calculated response is required by Government & the international community that avoids or minimises the loss of life and enables a more stable outcome for the whole region.\r\n\r\nOur country has an obligation to continually assess and reassess the situation. The Government should acquire concrete evidence & re-debate the issue.",
