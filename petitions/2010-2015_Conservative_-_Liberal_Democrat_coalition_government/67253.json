Not just car users but also HGV. On rainy drizzly or misty dull days, oncoming vehicles are less visible, especially in rear view mirrors. If it is wet, the amount of spray which is created adds to a lower visabilty, and also increases the the dirt spray on windscreen and mirrors. Driving with only sidelights on makes absolutiy no sense at all, and doesn't create a smaller carbon footprint or save energy.\r\n\r\nIn a time where so many \"nonsence\" Health & Safety rules are made, I think this is really something that would make a massive difference and would save lives, and would contribute to less road incidents all together.\r\n\r\nWhy not do it like in scandinavian countries, where it is an offense to drive without headlights switched on ?\r\n\r\nAt least on motorways.",
