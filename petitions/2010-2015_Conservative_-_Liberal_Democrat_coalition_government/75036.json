Introduce more practical subjects.\r\nEg; cookery from scratch, growing food, animal keeping, sewing, knitting, budgeting and home management, fishing and hunting, more sports, building and construction. The self esteem of our children is being greatly affected. Some know full well that they won't be needing French, maths or English in their chosen life path, by changing the current curriculum it will not only cut the problems produced by our frustrated children, it will allow them to excel and flourish.",
