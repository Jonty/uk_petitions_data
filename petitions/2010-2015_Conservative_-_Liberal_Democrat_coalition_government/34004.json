At present the guidelines appear to have limited value and do not ensure any close scrutiny of organisations buying clubs. In fact the Premier League appear to show a willful neglect of it's responsibilities seeming to view in favour of financial backing and funding rather than looking into whether the organisation bidding have managerial competence and any understanding of football as a business. There appears to be no probationary period within their current arrangements which I believe should be added. I refer to the recent performance of Venky's at Blackburn Rovers to highlight the classic failings of the curent system.",
