        "additional_details": "For too long the European Human Rights convention and the associated European Court of Human Rights have interfered with national affairs in regards to the deliverance of justice for the victims of crimes. The latest case of whole life term sentences being in breach of Article 3 due to 'inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment' shows that they are unable to look at the big picture and are endangering the lives of the general public by encouraging the release of mass murderers. In regards to this bizarre system the government is urged to immediately withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights and create a British Human Rights Convention to better protect the rights of the general public.",
