We (the Elctorate) demand accurate records of the time MP's spend actually IN the House, representing us. We are smart enough to make allowances for MP's spending some time looking after our interests AWAY from Parliament, but NOT the majority of their time. Publish the attendance facts and we'll decide for ourselves.",
