        "additional_details": "The UK Government gave its support to the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding when this was adopted by the World Health Assembly but has yet to fully implement its provisions in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health has said it, \"recognises the evidence-based health benefits of breastfeeding both for the mother and her baby and the savings to the NHS.\"\r\n\r\nAction will also protect babies who are fed on formula by ensuring parents and carers receive accurate, independent, evidence-based information. Required actions include:\r\n\r\n1. Full implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes and subsequent, relevant Resolutions of the World Health Assembly in legislation in all countries of the UK. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has repeatedly called on the UK to take this action.\r\n\r\n2. Appoint national infant feeding coordinators supported by multisectoral committees. The Government scrapped the coordinator posts in March 2011.",
