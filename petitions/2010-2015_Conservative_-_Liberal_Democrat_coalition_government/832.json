        "additional_details": "The DVLA and NHS has announced that anyone applying online for a driving license or renewing their license will be required to answer the question whether they want their name to be added to the Organ Donor system. However, the only answers are \"Yes, I want my name added\", \"Yes, I am already on the list\" or \"I have not yet decided\", which is effectively a \"yes\" because the system does not allow the person to state clearly and without any equivocation, \"No, I don't want to donate my organs after death\". It is not right to have a publically funded system that does not take into consideration all of the possibilities. The system should be changed to include the \"No\" option, so that license holders can have their intentions regarding their organs appear on their license as supporters of the system will be able to in future.",
