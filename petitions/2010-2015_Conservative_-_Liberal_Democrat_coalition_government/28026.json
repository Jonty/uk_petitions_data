        "additional_details": "I gave up my Motability WAV partly due to the high cost of petrol. A powered wheelchair is extremely heavy, so adds to the running cost.  With a WAV now, I could get to university lectures without hoping that the next bus has a ramp.\r\n\r\nApart from paying for the lease with the Higher Rate Mobility component is the only other cost incurred by leasing a vehicle, but when you have a severe physical disability, these WAVs are a lifeline, and many non disabled people fail to realise this.\r\n\r\nTo provide people with mobility that is affordable to people who live on low incomes and have additional living costs due to physical disability, allow disabled people who drive a WAV via Motability to use red diesel. Strict conditions would have to be implemented, involving spot checks by local police who would be told of every red diesel WAV user in their area. I would love to have a WAV again and would have no problem if police pulled my vehicle over using ANPR to ensure that I was in it.",
