        "additional_details": "The government should abandon all plans for badger culling and instead push forward research into vaccination programmes for cattle and badgers, tighten up on cattle movement restrictions and generally take notice of the vast bulk of scientific research which states that any culling is likely to have no effect on the prevalence of bovine TB, and indeed may make matters worse.  If Northern Ireland can reduce cases of bovine TB without a cull, by tightening up on the movement of cattle, then so can the mainland UK.",
