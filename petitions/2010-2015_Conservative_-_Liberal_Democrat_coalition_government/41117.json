Guns are highly regulated and yet fireworks are, at the end of every year, being sold in shops to people who, invariably, are mo longer using them for safe private displays in a safe environment. They are often used to cause nuisance and spread fear and cause danger in communities.\r\n\r\nFireworks should be only sold to those with a license, who can demonstrate that they are using them for organised events. The organisers of these events must be able to demonstrate that their events have safety as the number one priority.\r\n\r\nOnly by regulating the use of high explosives in this way will we preserve the tradition of Bonfire night and the tradition of using fireworks for celebration by a community rather than their use by those intent on using them to cause physical harm, damage and to spread fear.
