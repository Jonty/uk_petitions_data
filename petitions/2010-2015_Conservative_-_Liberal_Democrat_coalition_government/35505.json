Beckam has been an ambassador for the Olympics since the original bid and will be an inspirational captain.\r\n\r\nSurely Pearce is missing the point of the Olympics and if he doesn't think Beckham will gain the extra 2 yards he has lost because of his age with the occasion he is not in the right job.\r\n\r\nBeckham at very least still can be a substitute and have a role to play in set pieces etc.  We are also not going to be up against the best teams in the world as most of them will be rested by their league managers for the coming season.\r\n\r\nHe should be Captain as he will be an inspiration to all the team unlike the recent England performance which lacked passion in the midfield and up front.
