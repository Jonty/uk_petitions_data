However, these people need to realise they are in a position that influences others. As such, I do not believe we should allow them to remain in office when they have proven beyond reasonable doubt that they are discriminatory in any way.\r\n\r\nOur Government promotes tolerance, understanding and acceptance. Are we really working towards a tolerant or fair society with these people in office?",
