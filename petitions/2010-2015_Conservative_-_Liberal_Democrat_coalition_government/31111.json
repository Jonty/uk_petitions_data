Poole Hospital is already over suscribed with reduced bed capacity. This closure has to be stopped.\r\n\r\nThere are plans to reduce the choice women have to birth in other midwife led maternity units so women  and womens services appears to be an easy target for the governments austerity measures.\r\n\r\nDespite promises to give women choice this government are consistently standing by and watching Chief Executives of NHS trusts undermine midwife led units and then close them.\r\n\r\nThese units have equal if not better safety statistics than consultant led units.  It is also cheaper for women to deliver at midwife led units.  So why are these units closing?\r\n(See the Birth Place study by Brocklehurst P. et al 2011 BMJ343:bmj.d7400.)\r\n\r\nWomen rise up and fight for your right to birth in comfort, in peace and quiet, in the gentle surroundings led by midwives known to you.",
