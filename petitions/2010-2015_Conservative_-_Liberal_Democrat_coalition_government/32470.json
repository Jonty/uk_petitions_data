        "additional_details": "We call upon the UK government to heed recent research concerning the impact that neonicotinoid insecticdes are having on the environment.Recent reports have drawn attention to the role these chemicals play in the collapse of bee colonies. There are also strong suspicions that the recent global and catastrophic falls in butterfly, amphibian, bird and bat populations may also reflect an even more alarming and extensive neonicotinoid impact.\r\nWe call upon ministers to 1) enforce an immediate ban on these chemicals until such time as researchers CAN PROVE that our fears are unfounded.All non agricultural products can be banned overnight .2) To ensure that water companies and other agencies are made responsible for the monitoring of 'under the radar' levels of neocotinoid\r\ncontamination in our lakes, rivers, reservoirs and food\r\n3)To provide independent scientists with the necessary funds, staff and resources to research the impact of neonictonoids properly.",
