We the undersigned call for a restoration of this visa for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n-Not enough time exists at the end of current Tier 2 for graduates to find suitable employment.\r\n\r\n-The Tier 2 option open to graduates presents unreasonable barriers to finding work.\r\n\r\n-The best and the brightest should be encouraged to remain in the UK and contribute to our economy.\r\n\r\n-The UK must remain competitive in the eyes of the world, but many non-EU foreigners are now put off studying in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe the undersign call for the return of this visa.\r\n",
