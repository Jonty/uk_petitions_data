        "additional_details": "People on Job Seeker's allowance should work for what they get within the public sector, part-time. They should get up every morning and do half a day, leaving the rest of the day to search for other jobs, if they so wish. This should apply after the first 3 months of claiming. Should any claimant find a job and conveniently lose it again after 3 months, a '3-strike' system should be put in place to ensure that those who repeatedly try to do this will automatically go straight back in to public sector work.",
