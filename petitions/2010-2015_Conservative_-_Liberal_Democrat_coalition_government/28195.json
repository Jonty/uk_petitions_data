        "additional_details": "The government needs to change the law to ensure that football clubs are run for the benefit of the community they are supposed to be a part of.\r\n\r\nAll owners should have any company involved with the club registered in the UK, so that all Directors can be vetted by the Football League & Premier League.\r\n\r\nMonthly accounts of all incomes and outgoings should be published to ensure transparency and force clubs to live within their means. Fans are the lifeblood of their club and the government has a responsibility to ensure that they are protected from asset stripping. They are not like a normal business.\r\n\r\nClubs like Portsmouth, Darlington, Kettering, Northwich Victoria have been taken to their knees and nearly out of business all together.\r\n\r\nAnyone found guilty of wrongdoing should be banned from owning a club for life.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to try and help safeguard your clubs future for your children and get this debated in government.",
