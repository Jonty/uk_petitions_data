Further, all rights and pensions of those Scottish MPs shall be paid for by the Scottish Government from the point of secession.  No Scottish MP shall be allowed to influence the settlement between Scotland and the Union which must be the exclusive domain of the Scottish Parliament and the Home Office. ",
