        "additional_details": "Food prepared through Halal and Kosher methods of slaughter should be clearly labelled with a bold, easily identifiable icon on the outer packaging.\r\n\r\nAlready the Government mandates content such as additives to be labelled to allow consumers to make an informed choice, and this choice should be extended to allow the buyer to choose or not choose meat prepared through these methods. This would benefit both Halal/Kosher and non-Halal/Kosher preferences and is based solely on the personal ethics of meat slaughter rather than a religious basis.\r\n\r\nThe argument that there is already too much information on packaging and it is difficult to enforce is a weak excuse by companies wanting to reduce costs, when various other symbols and labels are already in force. Making their inclusion mandated through Government food regulations will ensure this option is clearly demonstrated to all consumers and promote freedom of consumer choice.",
