They are not able to gain qualifications, hold down jobs or have healthy relationships. Some never come forward and some commit suicide or self harm.\r\nI ask the government to consider significantly increasing the prison sentences served by paedophiles and sex offenders to reflect the severity of the consequences of their actions.",
