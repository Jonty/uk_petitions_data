        "additional_details": "Chinese Lanterns are let off to float uncontrolled into the night sky with no thought of the consequences when they land.\r\nFIRES: Roofs have been set alight, crops have been destroyed, a fire at a recycling plant saw 11 firemen injured. Chinese Lanterns damage businesses and lives alike.\r\nANIMALS: Livestock have been known to eat the remains of burnt out lanterns, causing severe injuries and even death, once again, fatally - birds are getting caught up in the wires.\r\nUNECESSARY ALARM: Chinese lanterns are wasting valuable resources, mistaken for flares and UFO's that's the better spent time of our coastguards and police gone.\r\nLITTERING: Once these lanterns have fall from the sky they are litter. If you were to drop a lantern in a town centre you would be fined for littering.\r\n\r\nPlease ban the sale and use of Chinese Sky Lanterns in the UK\r\n\r\n100,00 signatures needed- please sign",
