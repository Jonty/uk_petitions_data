        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request the UK Government to set up an Independent Health and Safety Commission for Nuclear & Radioactive Hazards to research and audit the Ionising levels of radiation in those people subjected to unusual exposures of radioactive materials and substances. This appeal comes at a time when the importance of establishing direct links between ill-health and genetic malformity, with unusually high exposure to radioactivity, has never been more important. I would ask the UK Government to discuss this in relation to numerous nuclear war veterans who have been fighting since the 1950's to get their various medical complaints officially recognised as being related either directly, or in part, to the tests held during the cold war.
