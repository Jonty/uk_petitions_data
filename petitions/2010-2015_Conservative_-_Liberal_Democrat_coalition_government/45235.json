Responsibility for road safety on particular roads is the responsibility of the local authority.  You don't say where your school is, but we guess that it is in Bolton; so the local authority would be Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council.  You may wish to resubmit your petition, asking the Government to bring the issue to the Council's attention in some way.  You may also, of course, wish to petition the Council itself directly in some way."
