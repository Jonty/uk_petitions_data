        "additional_details": "We pray the government should create a route for Tier1 PSW Permit holders who are working full time in contract jobs & in their field of study to extend/switch their visas.\r\nWe are concerned that alot of Tier1 PSW Permit holders are unable to switch their visa into other Point Based Systems as the requirements for these Point Based systems are far beyond the reach of these young graduates as we all know that the economy is going through recovery & as such there is not much of permanent job positions. Many of these young graduates are working in their field of study, earning good income & paying their taxes.\r\nWe respect government\u2019s right to reduce immigration from outside of EU, but we must point out that government also have responsibilities to protect the welfare of its people which includes PSW Permit holders. We believe Immigration restrictions & changed must not be at the expense of migrants thereby causing them unwarranted pains & sufferings.\r\nThank you & God bless.\r\nPSW Forum",
