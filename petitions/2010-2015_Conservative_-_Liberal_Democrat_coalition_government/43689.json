Copts are the indigenous people of Egypt who have become a minority. For many years now they have been persecuted and killed for their beliefs and this has been encouraged by goverment officials, mosques and terrorist groups. Copts cannot find work easily, build churches or preach Christianity. All Copts are asking for is equality.",
