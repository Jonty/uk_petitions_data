        "additional_details": "Tired of not getting a broadband Migration authorisation code (MAC) easily from your current broadband supplier.\r\n\r\nThis is a call for the law to be reviewed and changed back to the enduser with their freedom rights to change supplier without disruption in service i.e Choice to move to another broadband and telephone supplier and KEEP existing home telephone number.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair or correct that suppliers make it very difficult to recieve the MAC code and law should be changed.  You don't need a MAC code to change energy suppliers.\r\n\r\nFor example.....\r\nI suggest that when an enduser recieves the new service they also recieve a unique MAC code which does not expire is used only once if the end-user wants to move suppliers.",
