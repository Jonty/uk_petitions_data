        "additional_details": "There should be a ban or control on unfiltered inadequate housing for all fish and aquatics. Goldfish bowls are still regularly seen on television and advertising and to the general public are acceptable BUT are wholly inadequate for any species of fish or aquatic animal to be housed in and is entirely detrimental to their health and well being, always causing extreme suffering and death.\r\n\r\nIt should not be relied upon for stores to regulate this as they do not. Very small plastic tanks without adequate filtration are marketed at children, and yet are nothing more than torture chambers for whatever species is housed inside. Goldfish in fact need a minimum of a 4ft long fish tank! ",
