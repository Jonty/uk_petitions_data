        "additional_details": "The government should subsidise nurseries so that they can pay their staff a fair salary. Day Nurseries are facing a staffing crisis as pressure rises to get higher qualified more professional staff . The staff  are then expected to carry out the role of a teacher in a school, on a salary of just above minimum wage.  This is resulting in staff leaving the profession as the stress and pressures are high and the pay low. Nurseries can not afford to pay each staff member the salary they are worth.  Something must be done quickly.  Our children deserve the best! ",
