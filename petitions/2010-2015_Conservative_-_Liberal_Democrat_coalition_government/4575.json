This concept is unacceptable and should not be approved.\r\n\r\nApproval will put vulnerable students and other persons at an increased and unnecessary risk. Not to mention the significant risk involved in living kidney and general organ donation.\r\n\r\nThere is also the chance of organ rejection by the recipient. Leading to waste of tissue and funds.",
