        "additional_details": "It is ridiculous for us to continue giving overseas aid when we take into account the austerity measures introduced by this Government that are gravely affecting our citizens.\r\nNot only this, but at a time when the very fabric and infrastructure of our own society is disintegrating, how can we justify giving the 0.7% or more of our Gross National Income to others when we as a nation are struggling to increase our national income?\r\nIf we look at the enormous projects completed by these other nations by themselves, then clearly they do not need our funding. In any event they should look after their own interests, and we should look after ours'.\r\nIt is essential that the Government takes a radical and detailed introspective look at how we are going to fund our own essential projects and properly look after the welfare of our own people before being generous to others. This is a critical matter that urgently needs Governmental attention.\r\nAll overseas aid should be suspended.\r\n",
