        "additional_details": "Lorries pulling out into the outside lane of dual carriageways is dangerous. Lorry drivers frequently pull out without indicating and without regard for any vehicles behind them, in the knowledge that their size will always prevail. Furthermore, they will often travel side by side for a number of miles before they either give up or eventually manage to overtake another lorry. Neither will yield to allow the other to pull in. This causes frustration to the many drivers behind them and encourages drivers to speed up rapidly when they have a chance to overtake. Lorry drivers often become aggressive when they are not given way to, even though they have no right of way. Preventing lorries from using the outside lane completely would solve these problems and reduce accidents.",
