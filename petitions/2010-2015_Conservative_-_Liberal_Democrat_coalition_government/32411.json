        "action": "Opposition to the planned monitoring laws for Internet, email and telephony use",
        "additional_details": "The Government have announced plans to allow monitoring of our everyday Internet usage, email communications, texts and telephone calls, all in real-time, without the need for legal authorisation, in the name of national security.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe this is a gross violation of privacy. The current system requires approval to be sought from a magistrate before any communications can be monitored. But under this new scheme, Internet history can be browsed, emails read, etc, at any time, without any kind of legal approval.\r\n\r\nIt would be a horrible clich\u00e9 to compare this to Nineteen Eighty-Four, but the proposals come scarily close. It is somewhat ironic that the current government raised vocal objections to the previous government's attempt to introduce similar laws.\r\n\r\nWe believe these plans should be dropped. There is no need for such an invasive system. Is national security really worth sacrificing the privacy of every British subject?\r\n",
