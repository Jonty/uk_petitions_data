        "additional_details": "The  planned Dartford Crossing charging scheme is discriminatory to UK registered vehicle drivers. Central to the enforcement regime  is use of the UK ANPR  database  to trace and pursue non- paying drivers and the ability to apply fines to them. There is no UK right of access to the  vehicle registration databases of any foreign state including  EU states. This means that there cannot be a viable  enforcement regime for foreign registered vehicle drivers. These include not only the hundreds of thousands of  tourist vehicles which will be using  the crossing  but also the many thousands of EU registered vehicles which are driven by foreigners who are working in the UK. The government should  scrap the scheme and opt for a cost free crossing to negate this built in discrimination and inequality. If the Government is not prepared to do this then they should allow a debate in Parliament to consider the question of equality of treatment and the possible need for a judicial review.",
