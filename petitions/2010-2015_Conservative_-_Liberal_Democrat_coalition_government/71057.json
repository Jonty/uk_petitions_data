Many of us do this yet we are all still charged an early termination fee in one form or another.\r\nPeople who have given notice 30 days before end of contract as required and paid their bill that covers the 24th month of line rental why are they being penalized for moving? Some are even being charged even if they leave perfectly at the last day of their contract.\r\nA more defined and simpler system for customers to end contracts on last day and port numbers to new network needs to be recognized and resolved.
