        "additional_details": "Hi, I'm Emma Salter. This is my petition about the UK needing more mental health centres. I myself have been rejected by mental health teams because funding has been cut. I want to increase the numbers of mental health professionals so that all young and old patients are seen and receive suitable support. I've suffered from depression myself and haven't always been given 100% support so I know what its like. I'm not just petitioning around depression but also self harm, Suicide, Bi-polar, Anorexia, Bulimia, Psychosis, Alzheimer's and any other mental illness. I just want there to be more support so less people are loosing their lives. Together we can break the pattern.  ",
