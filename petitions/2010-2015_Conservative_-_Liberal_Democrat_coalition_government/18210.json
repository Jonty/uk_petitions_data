        "additional_details": "Laminate flooring being laid in flats causes a huge amount of problems for tenants on the lower floors. Noise pollution in public housing is responsible for a large number of health issues, including not being able to sleep and suffering at work and home due to stress.\r\n\r\nThis government should pass a law applicable to all social housing to ensure that all present leases are amended; and all future leases for flats state that any upstairs flat MUST be carpeted - absolutely no exceptions. This is especially important in the older conversions where soundproofing was not as well regulated. If any neighbour in an upstairs flat lays laminate flooring, the housing association or council are held responsible and a large fine levied to ensure action. The fine should be payable if the situation is not remedied within a period of 3 months. ",
