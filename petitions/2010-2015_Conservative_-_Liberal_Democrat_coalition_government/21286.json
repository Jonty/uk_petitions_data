        "additional_details": "When people from former princely State of Jammu and Kashmir arrived in Britain in 1960s they used Pakistani passport as a travelling document. Many Pakistani brothers erroneously believe that this act of travelling on a Pakistani passport makes them Pakistanis. They forget that it is a travelling document, and Palestinians, like Kashmiris have no country, and they travel on Jordanian, Egyptian, Syrian and many other passports, and that does not take away their Palestinian identity from them.\r\nKNIC and Association of British Kashmiris have done a considerable work on the issue of Kashmiri identity, and with help of local people have successfully persuaded a number of Councils to recognise Kashmiris as a separate ethnic group. But this is not enough, a lot more need to be done, and I believe that Baroness Emma Nicholson\u2019s initiative will give this campaign boost and moral support",
