Despite making over a hundred job applications for positions at all levels I have only had 3 interviews this year.\r\n\r\nI feel something good could come out of my long term unemployment if the law could be changed to guarantee persons whom are appropriately qualified for a position an interview.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will cut the number of unemployed by helping more unemployed people to gain an interview.\r\nMany employers are only interested in employing people who are already in work. The government needs to assist the unemployed by making it harder for employers to discriminate against the unemployed.\r\n\r\n",
