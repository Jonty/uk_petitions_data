        "additional_details": "I would like to put forward plans for an M&S or Waitrose to be placed on Willesden Green High Street.\r\n\r\nWillesden Green is rapidly changing and the high street is seeing changes, as is the surrounding area. With the new luxury apartments being built, The Library, as well as the new Cultural Centre and a number of new apartment blocks - the area calls for a revitalisation of the high street.\r\n\r\nThe surrounding area - Brondesbury Park in particular, is a predominantly middle class area, and there is much need for higher end food options in the surrounding area. The nearest M&S or Waitrose is Brent Cross Shopping Centre.\r\n\r\nWe already have a Sainsburys Local and one big Sainsburys, but we need to be inclusive of all members of the community. Small shops which are rundown can be built up with an M&S or Waitrose, to build the area up.\r\n\r\n",
