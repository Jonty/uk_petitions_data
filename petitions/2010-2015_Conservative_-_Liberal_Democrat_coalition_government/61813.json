Technology has improved drastically in the past decade and will keep improving by 200% each year, The government need to realise that basing the rest of our lives on a single exam is wrong. People are drifting towards more creative careers than academic ones. I have an ambition to become a video game developer rather than a doctor or lawyer. Im not that gifted in english or maths (overall grade c) but when it comes to technology I know my stuff. Exams have become about how much you can remember. Not your knowledge on the subject. I please ask you to re think the Curriculum and modernise it, you need to be educating children on stuff that really matters not poetry or chemical reaction. Every one is different. And that means for everyone the things they are taught should be different.   ",
