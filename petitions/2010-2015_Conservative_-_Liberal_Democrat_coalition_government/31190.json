        "action": "Abolish food and drink subsidies for MPs and Lords in the Houses of Parliament and ban members from being/becoming intoxicated while 'on duty'.",
        "additional_details": "The taxpayer-funded subsidy for the bars and restaurants in the Houses of Commons has risen to \u00a35.8m a year, despite promises by parliamentary officials to cut public funding for politicians\u2019 meals and drinks. They are given the privilege to eat gourmet meals  at the same cost as most taxpayers have to pay to eat a sandwich and soft drink. In a time when 'we are in this together' this is a disgrace and that money would pay for over 200 nurses, or would fund dozens of community projects to help the young find work. Given MPs salaries are upwards of \u00a366,000 they should pay for their own meals/drinks like most other civil servants.\r\n\r\nIt is also unacceptable that in this day and age MPs are allowed to be intoxicated in the line of duty. Moreover no member is allowed to point the fact as a reason to disprove an MPs argument (even if they are indeed intoxicated). This is surely a medieval practice that must end immediately.",
