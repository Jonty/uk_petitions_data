        "additional_details": "IN RECENT HISTORY EVERY TIME THE UK HAS INTERVENED IN HOSTILITIES WHICH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UK, the taxpayer ends up having to pay BILLIONS OF TAXPAYER POUNDS IN COMPENSATION BECAUSE THE ACTION HAS BEEN DECLARED ILLEGAL. This must not be allowed to happen again without first obtaining a mandate from the people who will eventually be picking up the tab, who do not, like William Hague, have the pleasure of a taxpayer funded expenses account they can call upon to pay for unexpected compensation orders.  WE MUST NOT MARCH INTO, NOR SUPPLY LETHAL WEAPONS TO, SYRIAN TERRORISTS WITHOUT FIRST PUTTING IT TO A REFERENDUM OF THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE PAYING FOR IT.  Should William Hague wish to offer to pay personally any compensation ordered by the international courts then he should feel free to press on regardless, the people of this country could not be less interested in what he does to make a name for himself as an international statesman, which is what this posturing is all about.",
