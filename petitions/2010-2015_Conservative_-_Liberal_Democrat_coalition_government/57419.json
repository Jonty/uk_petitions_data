        "additional_details": "During his election campaign David Cameron made a contract with the voters of the UK , he made several claims and invited us to hold him to account for them. He has clearly failed this contract and his suggested remedy was that he would remove himself from office. We the undersigned feel that Mr Cameron is bringing the entire election process into disrepute by not upholding his own entirely voluntary contract.\r\n\r\nThe speech is too long to quote here but is reproduced here http://thesiegeofbritain.wordpress.com/2013/11/20/if-cameron-has-breached-his-contract-do-we-have-the-right-to-fire-him/\r\n\r\nIt has been removed from the conservative party website but is widely known and has been independently archived elsewhere.\r\n",
