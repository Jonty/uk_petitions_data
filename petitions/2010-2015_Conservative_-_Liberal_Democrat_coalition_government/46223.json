In the 1990s, large-scale dumping of nuclear wastes in Landfill was banned. However in March 2007 the law was changed so that wastes such as plutonium wastes can now be sent to ordinary disposal sites. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Make Room for Nuclear? Cellulose - the woody compound used to make paper \u2013 breaks down into chemicals that can make plutonium up to 10, 000 times more likely to get into underground water supplies.   We the undersigned ask HM Government to change the \"exempt\" law and ban nuclear waste going into landfill.  ",
