        "additional_details": "Surely it is time the music industry and people who like to go to live shows and events should follow the same path as football.\r\n\r\nIn the United Kingdom the resale of football tickets is illegal under section 166 of the criminal justice and public order act 1994.\r\n\r\nIt is time this law spreads to all aspects of ticket sales.\r\n\r\nGenuine fans of artists and bands now days are pushed aside by giant corporations and people who do not care for the artist who are only trying to make a profit. They buy up all the tickets so the fans have to sometimes pay five times the face value.\r\n\r\nIt is fair enough if you genuinely have brought a ticket and cannot attend the show and need to sell the ticket, but you should be able to get a refund on however many tickets you need to get rid of so you can still get your money back.\r\n\r\nPut an end to having to pay over priced to see your favourite artist, put an end to these big company's like Getmein making even more money out of you.",
