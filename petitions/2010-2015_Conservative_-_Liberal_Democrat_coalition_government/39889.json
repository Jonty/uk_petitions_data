        "additional_details": "The UK population is contributing to climate change, and also habitat destruction, from \"development\", which is encroaching onto valuable wildlife habitat, and from intensive farming, which is now necessary for food security.\r\n\r\nFor example, all of Britain's agricultural land area is needed just to feed London. Some food will always come from abroad, such as exotic fruits, but the current situation is simply unsustainable.\r\n\r\nThe government should change the child benefits system to encourage population decline, and immigration should be limited to immigrants who are skilled and capable of working. Planning regulations should also be tightened to discourage urban sprawl.\r\n\r\nUnless strict measures are taken to reduce the UK population, we will never be able to fully tackle climate change, pollution and environmental degradation. Our current population of over 60 million is unsustainable and something must be done.",
