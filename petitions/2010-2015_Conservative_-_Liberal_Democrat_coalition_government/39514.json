We now believe that in order to avoid this ordeal happening to other children under 16 and their families that it is essential that under 16 year old children are not allowed to leave the UK without the written parental knowledge of all legal parents and/or legal guardians who hold parental responsibility, unless exempted by a UK Court A special UK Border Exit Form for Children under 16 will be required to verify that all parents have been notified that the child is proposing to leave the country ALL Passports must be checked BEFORE exiting the UK and if under 16 appropriate checks made before the child is allowed to leave the UK This will also prevent unauthorised abduction of children from the UK by one parent over another In the 21st Century it should be possible for  all parents/guardians to give digital consent over the internet on a secure server using a unique digital ID and the parents' passport details",
