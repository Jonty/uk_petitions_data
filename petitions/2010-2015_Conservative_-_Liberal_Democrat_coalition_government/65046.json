Ukraine is not a member of NATO. Its participation in military exercises by a nuclear-armed alliance with a first-strike policy can only further destabilise the country.\r\n\r\nWe call on the British government to urge the US and other NATO governments to cancel this July's Rapid Trident exercise, and to give a plain and public undertaking that Britain will not participate.\r\n\r\nLindsey German - convenor of Stop the War Coalition\r\nKate Hudson - general secretary of CND\r\nCaroline Lucas MP\r\nJeremy Corbyn MP\r\nJohn Rees - Stop the War Coalition\r\nBaroness Jenny Tonge\r\nKen Loach - film and TV director\r\nMark Rylance - actor\r\nMiriam Margolyes - OBE actor\r\nMichael Rosen - author and broadcaster\r\nSalma Yaqoob - former leader of the Respect Party\r\nAndrew Murray - chief of staff for Unite union",
