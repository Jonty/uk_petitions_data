        "additional_details": "I want the government to erect a memorial to the 435 soldiers who died during the war in Afghanistan, as the memorials in that country to those who died have now been dismantled there, because the Army has left that country.  Four hundred and thirty five British soldiers lives lost, many of whom never reached their 20th birthday deserve to be permanently remembered.  They gave their lives - they should not be forgotten.",
