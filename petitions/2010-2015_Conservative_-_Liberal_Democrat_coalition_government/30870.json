        "additional_details": "Airlines such as Ryanair tend to keep APD Taxes to themselves on unused flights. Ryanair especially, makes it impossible to claim back taxes on such flights by charging the equivalent or more in administrative fees. The purpose of taxation is to benefit the common good rather than airlines and other private enterprises. Taxes on unused flights should go to government.\r\n\r\nFor those who request refunds, the airlines can then request reimbursment from the government at the end of the tax year. ",
