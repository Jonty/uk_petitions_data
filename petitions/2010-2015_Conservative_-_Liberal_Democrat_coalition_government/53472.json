It cannot be right that granting a human right to one person causes HUGE adverse effects to others.  The human rights act is a modern day scourge to right thinking people, because right thinking and honest people don't need (AND IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO THEM ANYWAY) the use of the human rights act.  Only criminals and those who wish to change our society and make themselves mega rich in the process have a need of a human rights act.  It needs to be scrapped, SOON.",
