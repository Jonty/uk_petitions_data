Where is the sense in that? I want the Govement to either make footballers use their money for good (and I mean A LOT of money to charity) or for them to get paid less and for people who are saving lives (or risking their own) to get paid WAY more. It is obvious that footballers are getting paid way too much for kicking a ball and living a life of luxery and fame. It needs to change and it needs to change NOW!",
