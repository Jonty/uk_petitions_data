        "additional_details": "Dumping waste at sea continues to destroy our marine environment but there is little deterrent or enforcement to protect our waters and so many illegal discharges are made without detection. Every action has a consequence; one of these terrible substances to be legally discharged, is an oil addative called polyisobutene or PIB. In February 2013, a large number of seabirds were killed by this glue like substance, which mats the feathers of birds, causing them to drown, die of cold or starvation. Another disaster is now unfolding along the Southwest coastline, decimating many more seabirds and once again polyisobutene is to blame. Such chemical pollutants destroy life within our oceans, yet dumping this deadly waste at sea is allowed and accepted by our law-makers, why? Stop Dumping Waste at Sea Now.",
