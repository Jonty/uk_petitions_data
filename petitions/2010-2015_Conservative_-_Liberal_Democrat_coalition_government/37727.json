        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned residents of Bassett Road and neighbouring streets are alarmed at the prospect of a new private school being set up at 49 Bassett Road. We believe the building has too little outdoor space to meet the needs of the 245 students proposed for this school; that it will be unable to provide sufficiently for the parking needs of the extra traffic that would be generated; and that there would be difficulties in managing deliveries to the premises. We also note that there is already a private school in the same short stretch of Bassett Road, which is essentially a quiet residential street. We are concerned that a second school less that 100 yards away would fundamentally alter the nature of this street to the detriment of its residents. We therefore urge the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea to reject permission that would be needed for this development to go ahead. ",
