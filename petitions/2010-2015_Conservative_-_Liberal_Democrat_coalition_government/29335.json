If a Provisional Driving Instructor, (PDI) actually qualifies, the reality is that there is not enough work to sustain them.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the market place is swamped with new instructors with few or low qualifications, whilst the experienced and most highly qualified instructors go out of business!.\r\n\r\nAction Sought.\r\n\r\nOne solution. Government to tell the  DSA, (Dept. For Trans). Close the register to new instructors until the number of instructors on the register returns to a sustainable level.\r\n\r\nTraining companies could also be put to a more useful and profitable use providing CPD to existing instructors.",
