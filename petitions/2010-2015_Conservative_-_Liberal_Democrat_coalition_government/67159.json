        "additional_details": "The Offord and Buckden rail crossing is under threat of closure from network rail.  This crossing is more than just a link between two villages, people of Offord and Buckden use this route daily by car, foot and bicycle.  For many this is the only route accessible for the nearest doctors surgery.  A closure of this route would change a walkable 2.5 mile journey in to a 13.1 mile journey via Huntingdon, forcing further congestion through already heavy traffic, at peak times, in Godmanchester, or an 8.4 mile journey through Little Paxton.  This would make the route generally only accessible to those who drive or have access to transport.  The impact of this closure would be on residents and businesses.  Please help us keep our crossing and our very close link between our neighbouring villages.",
