It is very difficult. Even some of the simple tasks such as reading, writing, watching television and driving that us 'hearing' people take for granted are difficult.\r\n\r\nBasic Sign Language is easy to learn and fun! Young children will be able to communicate with others more effectively and have a greater appreciation of the wider world and how difficult it can be to live with a disability.\r\n\r\nI would like to see Basic Sign Language taught from Primary school age and beyond.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petiton if you agree.",
