        "additional_details": "Each MP\u2019s draws basic annual salary of \u00a367,060 but this will go up by about 10% to \u00a374,000 AFTER THE ELECTION.  MPs also receive expenses to cover the costs of running an office, employing staff often family members, having somewhere to live in London and in their constituency, and travelling between Parliament and their constituency.  Some MPs say being an MP IS NOT A FULL TIME JOB so take on second jobs not connected to serving the public or their constituency earning sometime ten\u2019s of thousands on top of their MP\u2019s salaries.\r\n\r\nAfter the General Election 2010, 650 MPs were elected, we are ALL supposed to be helping reduce the national debt, so DO WE REALLY NEED THIS NUMBER OF MPs burdening the public purse.\r\n",
