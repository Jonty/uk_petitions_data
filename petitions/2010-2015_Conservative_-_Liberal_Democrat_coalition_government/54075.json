        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on our Government to put an end to taxpayers funding career benefits claimants.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we request the following;\r\n\r\n1. An end to social houses for unsatisfactory tenants. That is those tenants who regularly commit anti-social behaviour or fail to keep the property and it's gardens in reasonable order.\r\n2. Emergency temporary social housing for single parents, this should only be temporary to prevent parenthood benefits being seen as a career choice. Parents should work. Free child care should be available as a reward for working.\r\n3. State operated work placements, such as street cleansing, refuse collection, horticulture for persons who have been long-term unemployed. In return for continued benefits. Failure to work, medical reasons exempt, would result in benefits ceasing.\r\n\r\nAbove all else the benefits system needs to change to a short-term safety net, not the long-term career option it currently is.",
