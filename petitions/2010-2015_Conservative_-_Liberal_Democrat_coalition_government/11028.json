        "additional_details": "Petition for reform in all areas of government and rule. Stop the free handouts, encouraging whole generations of people who refuse to work and to contribute. If you're able to work, you should be working, if not - you receive the bare minimum; in the form of food/clothing vouchers. Why should people receive cash they haven't earned, to spend as they please, on alcohol, tobacco, drugs etc. If you break the law, you should lose your 'human-rights'. If you don't contribute and pay tax, you should lose your right to vote. The punishment (it's supposed to be a punishment) should fit the crime. The recent riots are just the beginning of a generation that does not respect the law, or authority. Hard working, tax-paying people have surely earned the right to live in a safe environment. The rights favour the people on the wrong side of the law. Time to scrap the softly-softly system.\r\nIf you pay tax, and contribute, surely then you also have the right to say what happens to it.  Fair's fair.",
