Earlier this year Sheffield City Council decided to demolish the ground as it is 'Not Used Enough'.\r\n\r\nIf the ground is demolished, the Eagles will be forced to leave Sheffield and find a Home Ground somewhere else. If this happens, Sheffield will loose it's Rugby League pride and thousands of fans will have to leave the city to watch their team play. THIS MUST NOT HAPPEN!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and help keep the Sheffield Eagles in Sheffield!",
