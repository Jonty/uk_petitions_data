        "additional_details": "This month the Post Office introduced a scheme whereby most post, which could not be put through residential letterboxes, will be delivered to a neighbour of the postman's choice, unless a sticker is displayed preventing this. This change was inadequately researched and poorly publicised but was implemented nonetheless. There is a real risk of lost post. I petition Parliament to cancel this scheme and revert to the previous delivery arrangements.",
