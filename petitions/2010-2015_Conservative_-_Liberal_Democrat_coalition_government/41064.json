This includes the cost of producing and issuing a renewal reminder for a tax disc or SORN (V11 reminder) which is part of the relicensing process and the cost of posting the tax disc where applicable.\"\r\n\r\nThis to me is a complete waste of money, we don't need tax disks, as all the data is on DVLA computers and is available to law enforcement.\r\n\r\nWe don't have a insurance disk to show we have insurance, therefore we also don't need tax disks to show we have tax.",
