        "additional_details": "This petition aims to get the Department of Health thinking about the layout of Women and Children's units.\r\nMy partner recently had a hysterectomy due to ongoing issues with cysts and endometriosis. The ward she is on is divided into rooms of 4 beds. One room just down the corridor is for parents and their newborn children. It is insensitive and disrespectful to expect women and their partners to come to terms with no longer being able to have their own children while hearing cries of newborns. The part I found most distressing was hearing visitors gather outside the open door of my partners room expressing delight at their new family member. People should absolutely be able to celebrate the birth of children, it's a beautiful part of life, but people should also be given the space to grieve when the gift of having their own children has been taken from them.\r\nThe layout of these wards is similar in many hospitals in the UK and needs changing now. Please sign and share!\r\n",
