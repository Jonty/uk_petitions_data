(Which according to HMRC is an Employed Role, not \"Self Employed\" which these companies use a legal loophole so they do not have to pay Tax, NI, and Liability Insurance.\r\n\r\nIf these jobs, which are very easy to get, came with a basic rate of pay for the work they do, and the hours the workers put in, there would be less benefit claimants.\r\nThey either have to up the commissions or promise a basic rate on NMW - This should be the LAW!
