        "additional_details": "BBC Television Centre was closed for redevelopment recently. The plans are for five of the eight studios to be demolished leaving just three available for producers and programme makers to use when the centre reopens.\r\n\r\nThe last couple of years has seen a steady stream of production coming from these studios not only for the BBC but for other broadcasters as well here and abroad. They have been upgraded for HD production and 3D production and so it makes business sense to keep these studios open for production companies to use and continue to make such great programmes that contribute to our culture. This has happened on the site for decades and it makes no sense to stop it now.\r\n\r\nI call on the government to ensure the future of BBC Television Centre, its eight studios and the continued production of shows that are not only loved in the UK but internationally.",
