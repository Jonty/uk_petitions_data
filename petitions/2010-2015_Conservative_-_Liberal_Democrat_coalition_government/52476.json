        "additional_details": "As a young woman myself, I find this new policy announced in the Telegraph appalling. To divide individuals going through the criminal system on sex is barbaric and against everything the feminist movement has been fighting for.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the need to save money, this move is a backwards step. If any such movement is to happen it should be universal across both genders. If it cannot be justified for both genders, neither group should be exempt.\r\n\r\nSegregation by gender alone is wrong. Please stop this new policy before it spreads further sexism through this country's own government.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
