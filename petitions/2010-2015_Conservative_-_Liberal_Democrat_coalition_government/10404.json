        "additional_details": "Provide teachers with greater power to maintain high standards of discipline in the classroom. The government must provide schools with a more comprehensive school discipline structure to support this problem of apathy and the lack of respect in a significant proportion of England\u2019s children. Teachers are finding it difficult to gain this respect due to a lack of support from the current \u2018system\u2019. School discipline needs to be debated and reviewed by government. They can make initial inquiries about discipline improvement by consulting parents and professional educators. I feel that the government should be looking at a nationwide schools discipline policy which is fully transparent and consistent throughout the whole of England. If the prime minister doesn\u2019t want a repeat of the recent riots he needs to act now to eliminate dysfunctional families and give more support to teachers to discipline children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
