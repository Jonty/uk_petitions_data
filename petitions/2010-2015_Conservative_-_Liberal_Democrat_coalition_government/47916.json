        "additional_details": "This is a real story, a real person whom we know and has been so unlucky to be caught up in it all, and we need all the exposure we can get so she can fight her case:\r\n\r\nAnd don't think what's happening in Cyprus doesn't affect you, because if they can take money out of people's accounts here without permission it may not be too long before the EU is knocking on your bank's door....\r\n\r\nGary and Sharon lived in Cyprus since 2004. Sadly Gary passed away suddenly last year and Sharon decided to sell her home here and go back to the uk.\r\nThe money from the sale of her house went into her Cyprus account on the 15th March to be transferred to the uk on the 19th. However on the 16th March under the instructions from the EU the Cyprus government froze all accounts. As Sharon's is a sizeable sum she can not now transfer that money across to the Uk and reports suggest she may lose 60% of it. 60% of the money her and her husband had worked hard all their lives for.",
