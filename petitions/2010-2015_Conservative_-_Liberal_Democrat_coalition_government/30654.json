But most of the public are not warned about the food therefor, are uneducated as to what foods to eat.\r\n\r\nI feel the public would also benefit greatly from being educated about thier diet. Organic food needs to be pushed more. This type of stuff is not general knowledge to most people which is why we are seeing such a high rise in Cancers. Please get as many signatures as possible. We need to stamp out this horrible nasty desease!",
