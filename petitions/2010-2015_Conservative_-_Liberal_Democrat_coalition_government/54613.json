        "additional_details": "This petition has been started to ban the rule against  'Extremes of hairstyle' in all public schools because it is a vague and entirely subjective rule.\r\nOther points include the fact that students feel that they cannot express their individuality and that intolerance of subcultures could be caused by people not being familiarised with these differences.\r\nThis could be seen as another thing that led to the murder of Sophie Lancaster who was murdered due to intolerance possibly caused by unfamiliarity and the lack of exposure to these subcultures.",
