        "action": "Refusing Asylum to Afghan interpreters",
        "additional_details": "The Secretary of State has refused to grant Asylum to some Afghan interpreters who have diligently worked as interpreters for the British Army since the invasion of Afghanistan. Well documented evidence exists that their lives are threatened if they return to Afghanistan. The Home Office has granted Asylum to some but for unknown reasons refused others on grounds they refuse to disclose. When challenged by appeal in court and lost, the Home Office are wasting valuable resources by lodging appeals to court decisions. The Home Office issues residency cards giving the right to remain but no right to work. Deportation would mean death whilst with no work the only option is life on the streets. During procedures that last more than a year their passports are being retained by the Home Office. This petition is to grant interpreters the human right to live and work in the country they put their lives at risk to serve and protect. Return passports to those held imprisoned in UK.",
