        "additional_details": "I am writing to stop dangerous driving, serious fatality's deaths of young drivers and innocent lives.\r\n\r\nYoung drivers (17-24 years old) are at a much higher risk of crashing than older drivers. Drivers aged 17-19 only make up 1.5% of UK licence holders, but are involved in 12% of fatal and serious crashes.\r\n\r\nData on British drivers shows that:\r\n\r\nDrivers aged 16-19 are more than twice as likely to die in a crash as drivers aged 40-49.One in four 18-24 year olds (23%) crash within two years of passing their driving test.Young male drivers are involved in many more crashes than young female drivers.\r\n\r\nTo reduce all this all this i want to get the DVLA to make all drivers up to the age of 24 to get a tele-matics box fitted in there cars by insurence company's and failure to do so will mean you will not be insured to drive! Please take your time to sign this petition and help save lives!! ",
