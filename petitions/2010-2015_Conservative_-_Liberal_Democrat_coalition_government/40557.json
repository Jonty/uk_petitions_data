        "additional_details": "Times are hard and everyone is feeling the pinch, If you are a football Fan you might not want the whole sports package, why pay sky sports around \u00a320 p/m for sky sports when your team might only be on 1-2 a season, if you\u2019re lucky.\r\n\r\nA fairer option would be Pay per View matches, charging between \u00a33-\u00a35 per game maybe? Not only would this allow more people a chance to watch their team, I believe more people would be willing to pay this than \u00a320 p/m so Sky wouldn\u2019t be out of pocket. Everybody Wins.\r\n\r\nSign the petition if you agree - Hopefully we can get Sky to sort it out and stop televised football being priced out for most people.\r\n",
