The EHRC also spent taxpayer's money on lobbying political parties, and it is wrong for our money be used by one arm of Government to lobby another. Finally, the National Audit Office has repeatedly refused to sign off the EHRC\u2019s full accounts.\r\nThe government should scrap this wasteful and spendthrift Quango without delay\r\n",
