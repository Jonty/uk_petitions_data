        "additional_details": "I would like to tighten up the regulations for elderly drivers which are not fit for purpose. Our elderly population is increasing and the vast majority are good drivers. However a combination of physical & mental frailty is a disaster behind the wheel and many elderly patients lack insight into their lack of ability. I believe this would reduce accidents on the road and improve the reputation of elderly drivers by only allowing the capable ones of continuing to drive.",
