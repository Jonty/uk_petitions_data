        "additional_details": "Barbara is 82 and lives alone in a council house near Rugby. She has no family and is housebound. Her neighbour Andrew mows her lawn for her but can't anymore. If her lawn isn't mown the council are threatening to evict her, but aren't offering any kind of help.\r\nWe were wondering if someone from the Big Society could help her..............or if anyone can give us a number to contact them to ask ourselves?\r\nWe want the government to accept their responsibility towards older people and not rely purely on the goodwill of neighbours, who can't always help, to meet the needs of residents - it's what we pay our taxes for and shouldn't be something national and local governments devolve responsibility for to this hazy organisation 'The Big Society'.",
