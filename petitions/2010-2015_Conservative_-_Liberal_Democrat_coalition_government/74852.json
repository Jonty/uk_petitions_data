        "additional_details": "2015 New Year's celebrations in London cost almost \u00a32 million and it lasted around 10 minutes. This funding would be very useful if it was reassigned to another cause. Any kind of charity would be a much more worthy cause than some fireworks and music. Also if London decided to adopt this approach for the 2016 New Year's celebrations, then it may encourage other countries to also adopt this approach. This will be a much more worthwhile use of government funding. ",
