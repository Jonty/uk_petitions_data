But I am NOT prepared to countenance any more of my taxes being spent on prisons or making life easier for convicted criminals.  The most appropriate treatment is TWO STRIKES AND YOU ARE OUT -  life means life prison term, in a prison run under austerity terms, with human rights left on a hook at the entrance.  Anything more costing any more would be an absolutely immoral waste of MY taxes.",
