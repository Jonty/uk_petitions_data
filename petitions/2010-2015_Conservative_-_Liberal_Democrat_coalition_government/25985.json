Nor even ensured that UK laws have secured equal treatment under the law throughout the UK  in the public interest?\r\n\r\nI therefore petition that the Government and its 'Chief Legal Adviser' needs to educate the public about what rights they've been denied for 63 years now and to explain in full detail why that is considered to be 'lawful'. Bearing in mind Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties stated that a State cannot invoke its 'internal laws' for failures to comply with all its International Treaty obligations.\r\n\r\nThe Human Rights Act clearly denies many rights to many people whilst ignoring the obligation to educate all and to respect other peoples rights, included in the Universal Declaration of 10th Dec 1948 and subsequent treaties signed with the UN.\r\n",
