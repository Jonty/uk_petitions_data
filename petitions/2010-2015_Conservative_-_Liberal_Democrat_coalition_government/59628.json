        "additional_details": "Further to the recent proposal by the UN that Western countries should take in their \"fair share\" of Syrian refugees, we would like to request that Labour's suggestion of limiting the number to 500 refugees be adhered to.\r\n\r\nWe should continue to give aid as appropriate, to help those in dire circmstances, but only allow in the small number of 500. This small island already has an awful lot of people, and there are other, less crowded countries in Europe they could be resettled in, or even in the USA.\r\n\r\nFailure to limit numbers to a reasonable level will only add to the strain on the UK's finances, housing and health systems.\r\n\r\n",
