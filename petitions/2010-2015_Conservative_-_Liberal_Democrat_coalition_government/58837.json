It is common knowledge there are numerous gangs stealing vehicles and selling them on, or shipping them abroad, and too often now victims of this crime have had very little assistance from the Police.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous occurrences of people finding their stolen vehicle on social media and having to take the law in their own hands as the Police do not appear to treat these matters seriously.\r\n\r\nWe propose increased penalties on those caught and convicted stealing vehicles, and for Police forces to dedicate more time, effort and resources into ensuring vehicle crime is reduced by actively pursuing leads, imposing checks on export containers and checking social media / buying and selling websites.\r\n\r\n",
