        "additional_details": "Huge Government cuts to Council funding are self-defeating, unfair & divisive\r\n\r\nFor many Councils the majority of their funding comes from Government, so Government cuts mean they have less money and are forced to cut local services. Government isn\u2019t taking into account or assessing the cumulative impact of these cuts. It is becoming clear that the impact is significant, leading to a crisis in frontline services, affecting the most vulnerable\r\n\r\nThis is made worse by the way the Government has applied the cuts, with areas with highest need facing the greatest cuts. The cuts damage the ability of local government to support job creation & tackle worklessness both of which are vital to support economic growth & recovery\r\n\r\nWe call on DCLG to change its allocation of council funding to protect areas of greater need, giving Councils the chance to save services such as libraries, children\u2019s centres, funding for charities & voluntary groups, & care for the disabled, the elderly & vulnerable",
