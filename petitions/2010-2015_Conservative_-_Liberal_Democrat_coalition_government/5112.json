        "additional_details": "To quote PM David Cameron \" We are all in this together\" I would like all MP's, to agree on forfeiting their respective annual salaries for during the next financial year, currently there are 650 elected MP's who earn roughly \u00a366'000 PA a whooping \u00a342 million. all MP's respective salaries will be donated to hard pressed families who reside in an MP's respective constitution. This windfall payment will help ease the burden that has been placed upon them by the hard hitting austerity measures brought on by not only the global economic crisis but bad management with-in government over the last few years. For example 66 families in every constitution could be selected to receive \u00a31000.00 each (Minus Tax & NI) which could be paid in one lump sum or in instalments. The selection process would allow all families to put in a claim for this windfall payment but using a filtering system would ensure that the most hard up, financially insecure families would benefit.",
