        "additional_details": "For several years, 192.com has been collecting information on the public, that is to say everyone. By trawling through electoral records, phone books and the like, this 'business' establishes astonishingly detailed profiles on private individuals.\r\n\r\nOf course, being private concern, they then sell this information back to the public, or any interested parties. This is sanctioned stalking and indeed provides rather a convenient springboard for identity theft and so forth. Using the information provided one could quite easily make life difficult for others.\r\n\r\nThis site is a mockery of the Data Protection Act and an affront to the privacy of individuals. As such, I implore the government to ban the sale of electoral roll information to non-sanctioned parties, and moreover to make the sale of public data to third parties illegal without the full and educated consent of the individual in question.\r\n\r\nI invite you to do the same.",
