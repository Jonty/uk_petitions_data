If any of these or other animals were found to their way onto my property I would expect the owner to take repsonsibility for their pets behaviour and any damage to property.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to cats they are not subject to any such restrictions. They can wonder where they like, dig up plants, scratch up the bird table, scare off and attack other animals and poop all over the place. We don't condone this behaviour from other pets.\r\n\r\nThe governement should pass a law to ensure that cat owners are liable for damage caused by their animal, that cats must wear a collar with an identifying label (eg name, address) and for keeping the creatures out of other people's property.",
