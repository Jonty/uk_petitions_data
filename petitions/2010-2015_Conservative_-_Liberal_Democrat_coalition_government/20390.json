        "additional_details": "\r\nInfluential editors and others are exaggerating the misdemeanors of the past in the hope of proving that newspaper self-regulation has been a remarkable success.\r\nThey claim the press of more than 20 years ago was \u2018outrageous\u2019 and \u2018scandalous\u2019 and that today, thanks to the Press Complaints Commission, it is \u2018vastly better behaved\u2019.\r\nTwenty years ago there was no scandal to compare in scale or gravity with current phone hacking allegations; and today\u2019s newspapers seriously breach the law of contempt, ruinously for some people, in ways previously unthinkable.\r\nThe slur that older journalists, almost as routine, stole photographs of bereaved people verges on being an \u2018urban myth\u2019.\r\nThe excesses in tabloid conduct in the 1970s and 1980s were no greater than today\u2019s, and possibly a good deal less.\r\nThe DCMS must acknowledge this when it reviews press regulation following the Leveson Inquiry.\r\n",
