The best option would be to implement a no travel policy to the entire West Africa region, passports should be checked to see if the person/s in question have travelled to an infected region. If they have they should be isolated for at least the incubation period of the virus.\r\nIt is the right of the people of the UK to be protected by its government from uncontrolled outbreaks of deadly diseases by sealing our borders from anyone that may carry the virus / disease.",
