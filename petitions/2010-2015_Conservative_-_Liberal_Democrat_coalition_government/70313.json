        "additional_details": "SCKM's -yellow zig zags outside school entrances are currently advisory only resulting in highway authorities having to make an order to prevent drivers stopping on them which only then enables enfocement by Civil Parking Officers -this incurs addtional costs re both the order and the necessary sign. Why not change TSRGD Regs to make all such markings enforceable without the need for a sign or order. This will improve school safety, save time,enable enforcement where drivers ignore markings,  save cost and improve consistency of regulation.",
