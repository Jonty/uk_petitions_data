In 2006, a joint report by the former Health Care Commission, Audit Commission and Commission for Social Inspection criticised the \"patronising and thoughtless\" manner in which NHS hospitals and care institutions treated older patients.  Labour had the warning signs for years. An inquiry must be launched if it just quashed knowledge of the warning signs to try to get the rights statistics.",
