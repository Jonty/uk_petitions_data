        "additional_details": "I propose that the State give more funding to the official religion of the nation, The Church of England to help support our national treasures, i.e., Cathedrals and other ancient churches that are part of our national heritage and to support the work of what the Church feels very strongly about, the state of our society and of building a stronger sense of social cohesion. Also, for the government to support the historic faith of this land of which is woven into the fabric of our identity. I feel that the Church had much to offer still and the government should support this official religious institution of the realm of Her majesty the Queen and her successors.",
