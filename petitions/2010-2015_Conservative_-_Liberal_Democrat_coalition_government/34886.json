On completion of the tour we had chance to talk to some of the current In Pensioners who felt quite upset that they do not meet the award criteria for the issue of a medal to commemorate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.\r\n\r\nThe 300 pensioners at the Royal Hospital have all served in the armed forces, the majority of which has been during the reign of our current Queen. The pensioners are heavily involved in what I perceive as public duties and a review of the award criteria to include in-pensioners would be a fitting tribute to the service they have and continue to give .\r\n",
