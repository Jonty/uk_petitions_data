        "additional_details": "The laws in place to punish irresponsible dog owners if their dog attacks, is aggressive or fouls in public places are almost impossible to enforce. Dogs should have to be registered with a local vet & a dog ID card be issued with an ID number on it & a photo of the dog to be carried at all times. The dog would have a smaller card on it's collar incase it got lost. The vet & main database would have the owner & dogs details including description & distinguishable marks of the dog for ID if an incident occurred. The public should be allowed to take a picture of the dog to be matched to database if dog attacks or fouling occurs. If ID card isn't shown to Police or dog warden on demand the dog should be confiscated until owner pays a fine & proves identity(this may help in the case of dog theft). If the fine isn't paid the dog should be rehomed to a more responsible owner. Random checks should be carried out to ensure addresses are up to date. ",
