        "additional_details": "This Petition is to stop Govt and our Local councils introducing \"extra taxation\" against diesel vehicle owners. Councils are planning tax of up to \u00a3100.00 for parking and driving diesels. We are paying enough through Road tax and Fuel Duty, yet are picked on again and will be discriminated against our Freedom of choice no matter what CO2 emissions are emitted or how manufacturers make them more CO2 efficient. Motorists have borne the brunt of these taxes for too long, we do not want more!!\r\nIt is a denial of our rights of choice in what Make, Model and fuel used.",
