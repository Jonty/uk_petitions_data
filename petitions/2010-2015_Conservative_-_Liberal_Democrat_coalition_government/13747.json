        "additional_details": "I would like to ask my government to inform my Queen that on behalf of all Artists in the UK, who act as 'Lightening Rods' for the pain in this world and who visualize the daily madness of the worlds' governments' destruction of life, liberty and freedom of all human, animal, plantlife and eco-systems, that if it has her name on it...she can pay artists to make head or tail of it.\r\n\r\nA percentage of the annual Art wages would be used to pay for a national free to air TV channel to not only broadcast the works of the artists but to encourage all citizens of the UK to spend at least 1 hour a day in thoughtful reflection and to visualize their response and feelings. The viewers' artwork no doubt would illustrate the true inner feelings of all the down trodden folk of this wonderful island. Maybe then we can be as one and seek a real egalitarian society.",
