        "additional_details": "The proceeds from the UK national lottery for good causes should be distributed in line with the income generated.\r\nTherefore if for example over the period of a year West Yorkshire contributed 20% of the overall income to the lottery then West Yorkshire should get 20% of the money issued to good causes.\r\n\r\nThis can also be divided by city for example, if Leeds contributed 15% of the West Yorkshire total then the city would get 15% of the money for good causes.\r\nThis way of dividing the income will ensure the people giving the most will get back the most.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that people in poorer areas of the country pay more into the lottery and therefore should get back more instead of the majority being spent in areas that have no links with the area that the income was generated.\r\n",
