        "additional_details": "For six years now the castastrophic leadership at Tameside Hospital has eroded away a public service. Petitions to SoS Andrew Landsley, many reports from CQC, Monitor, Local MP's, coroners, and other associated bodies, have highlighted serious concerns in patient care. The  Local involvement network (LINk) who gave the community of Tameside a voice in May 2010 after a public meeting at Ashton Town Hall reported serious concerns in patient care to the hospital. In it's update event June 2011 reported all concerns enitially raised to be red rated again. The CEO and Board must now go as they have proved beyond doubt  they are incapable of turning things round. If this had been a public company they would of been sacked years ago for their preformance. ",
