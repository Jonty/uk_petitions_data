It could mean that whereas before a Judge would have given someone a 1 year sentence,at the taxpayers expense,he may only give them,say,3 months with an order that they repay the cost afterwards,as the cost could also be considered part of the punishment. Only those who are unemployable after release(e.g. through age or disability) would not be required to pay so it would save the taxpayer a fortune and reduce the number of prisons needed as well as reduce overcrowding.Ex-prisoners could also be monitored more easily to ensure they are leading law-abiding lives,thus reducing crime by reducing re-offending.\r\n",
