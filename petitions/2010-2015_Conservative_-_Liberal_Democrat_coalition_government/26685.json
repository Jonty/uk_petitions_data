        "additional_details": "It cost the UK over 255 dead, many more wounded, scores mentally effected & a lot of money that could have been better spent, when the Argentina military thought we were indifferent to the sovereignty of these islands.  Again the sabre rattling has started & we must ensure that it does not happen, again.  One way, would be to orchestrate additional military training on the islands, instead of elsewhere. We could ask our Commonwealth special forces if they could do some foul weather training in the area. Anything to remind  Argentina we are not too far away.  Anything of additional military traffic to the regular service personel stationed there, should be encouraged.  The Government should also question the legality of banning individual international shipping from designated South American ports.",
