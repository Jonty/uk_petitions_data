        "additional_details": "We call on the government to legalise same-sex civil marriage for same-sex couples. There is unprecedented support in favour of legalisation, and polling repeatedly shows up to two-thirds of the population would support this. We further believe that the ban on same-sex marriage is a violation of religious freedom. A growing number of religious groups support legalising same-sex marriage, and we believe not allowing them to perform such ceremonies impeaches on their rights. It is vital that religious groups are not impeached for their beliefs and practices, but religious freedom can only truly be respected by allowing religious groups to operate in accordance with their beliefs, rather than only accommodating those who are opposed to same-sex marriage. The United Kingdom should be the cornerstone of equality, and we believe this change in the law would protect all citizens and families equally, and would affirm the importance of democratic values in society.",
