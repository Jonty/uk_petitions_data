        "additional_details": "We are calling on the government to withdraw the driving licences of all those showing sociopathic behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis may be in the form of actual aggressive or careless driving involving a cyclist or written or verbal communication promoting anti cyclist behaviour which demonstrates sociopathic personality disorder.\r\n\r\nAnyone demonstrating such behaviour is not mentally stable and therefore is a danger on the roads to themselves and worse, others. You would not issue a shotgun licence to a mentally unstable person.\r\n\r\nFor this reason licences should be withdrawn until they undergo a course of psychotherapy treatment and are certified mentally stable by a psychiatrist.\r\n\r\nAny act that endangers a cyclist shall incur  loss of licence together with a hefty fine and min 6 month prison term as standard.",
