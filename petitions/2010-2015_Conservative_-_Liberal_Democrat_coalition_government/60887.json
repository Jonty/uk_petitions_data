Representation of the people is not something which has happened in the HofC for decades and this trend MUST be reversed.  As our senior law officer you have a moral and legal obligation to ensure that our electeds do what they are supposed to do and not merely use their votes as pawns to their masters and to protect themselves.  If you cannot see that, or worse, you know that obligation and choose to ignore it in favour of party politics, then you need to get a different job.  THE BRITISH PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER THAN WHAT YOU OFFER.",
