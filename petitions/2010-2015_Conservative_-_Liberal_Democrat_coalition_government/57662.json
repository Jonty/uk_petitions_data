We want clear guarantees from the government that the following things will not occur as a result of fracking in the UK:\r\n\r\nContamination of water supplies.\r\nEarthquakes.\r\nDecimation of our eco-systems or wildlife populations.\r\nSoil contamination.\r\nGiant sink-holes opening up around the UK.\r\nUn-mortgageable or un-insurable properties.\r\n",
