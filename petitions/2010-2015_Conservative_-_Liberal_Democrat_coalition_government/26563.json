        "additional_details": "The NHS employs dentists that are not trained to the same standard as qualified British dentists.  Someone with their expertise would not be allowed to qualify as a Dentist if they were receiving training in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis scenario is causing NHS patients pain, and is a waste of money, time and resources for everyone involved: From patient\u2019s right through to medical suppliers.\r\n\r\nI would like to make clear that this petition is not against immigrant dentists. Merely that all Dental Care Professionals that work for the NHS must meet or exceed the standard that British trained dentists qualify at.\r\n",
