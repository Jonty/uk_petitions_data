        "additional_details": "The government has a responsibility to manage national assets efficiently and to be responsible with the disposal of such assets.  The proposal to sell a significant stake (1/3) of RBS to a foreign power (UAE's Abu Dhabi) at a 50% loss to the UK tax-payer represents an appalling return to the tax paper, lacks strategic wisdom, denies the tax-payer either a future revenue stream or the opportunity to attain better value in the future, effectively uses tax-payers' to subsidise big business's interests, and is tantamount to a serious dereliction of duty and responsibility. This petition calls for the proposed sale to be denied until such a time as the national assets can be sold at or above their real value, even though this may be quite some time away.",
