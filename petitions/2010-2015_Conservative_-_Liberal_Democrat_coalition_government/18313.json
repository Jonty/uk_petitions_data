        "additional_details": "Have just heard the proposal by the government to allow funding for re-introducing weekly bin collections and think it is very poor.\r\nSpeaking personally for a family of four we very rarely fill our black waste bin even after 2 weeks so to collect weekly would be a complete waste of fuel and labour. Also it goes against everything we are proposing in terms of trying to increase cost efficiency throughout the public sector. Filling a bin every week shows that people need to be challenging the amount of waste they are generating, another key environmental consideration that this decision goes against.\r\nThose who say food waste needs collecting more often again suggests too much waste that needs challenging.\r\nGiven all the other problems our society faces I cannot believe this is a priority. Seems like a vote winner that wont benefit those who need it most in current times. ",
