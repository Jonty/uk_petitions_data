        "additional_details": "The existing teaching skills tests are highly challenging, especially for mature trainees who have not studied English or mathematics since they left secondary school. These tests already go way beyond basic arithmetic and spelling. The government now wishes to make these tests harder. The new test will also involve abstract reasoning tests, which are biased towards those who are trained for them in public and grammar schools, and keep highly skilled and knowledgeable people out of jobs.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that these changes will 'raise standards in our schools', as Michael Gove seems to think. Standards in schools are maintained by recruiting gifted teachers with excellent subject knowledge, not traditionally intellectual individuals who are good at passing irrelevant tests. In fact, many who become teachers under the new system will probably find it very difficult to make their ideas understood by an 11 year old! ",
