        "additional_details": "\r\nWe call on the government NOT to put the price up on the Tunnels and QE2 bridge crossings this October from \u00a31.50 to \u00a32.00 per Car & then again in 2014 for another increase to \u00a32.50.\r\nThis will mean that for a lorry to pass one way it will cost \u00a36.00 which means more cost for the haulage firms to move goods around the country and then mean higher prices for you.\r\nkeep the promises of previous administrations and remove the toll charges imposed on road traffic using the Dartford Crossing.\r\nHave a look at this link showing the proposed price hike http://twitpic.com/9nxx2s\r\nFollow on Twitter Dartfordbridge1\r\nPlease Sign and help thanks ",
