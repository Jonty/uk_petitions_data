Ear piercing is painful and can lead to infection and permenant disfigurement.\r\nIt should be the choice of the individual concerned, and not his/her parents, to undergo such an invasive and permenant procedure, purely for aesthetic reasons.\r\nAn age limit needs to be imposed to prevent the violation of babies and young infants.",
