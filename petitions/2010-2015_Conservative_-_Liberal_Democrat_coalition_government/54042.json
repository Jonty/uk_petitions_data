The commission should also look at how Shale gas fits into a wider energy strategy, fuel poverty, and energy security. Clear headed science.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this commission should report back empirical evidence that helps the debate and guides policy, because at present its clear that the wider public (the author included) is ignorant of all the facts.",
