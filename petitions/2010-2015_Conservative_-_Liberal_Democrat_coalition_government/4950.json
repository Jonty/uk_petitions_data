Especially through intellectual input, contribution to research and acquiring skills (in medicine, architecture, etc.).  All members of our society benefit from this and therefore it seems reasonable that we should be prepared to pay for it. Not only is our society neglecting to reward people for achieving high levels in education we are adding insult to injury by placing them in years of debt and anxiety. The current system does not encourage children to succeed in education and also prevents talented students from embarking on an academic career.  ",
