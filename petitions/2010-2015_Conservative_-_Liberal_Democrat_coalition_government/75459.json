        "additional_details": "There is much debate and much controversy around the subject of immigration, whether from within or outside the EU, or or involving so-called asylum-seekers. This topic is rarely illuminated by statistics because of the extremely polarized viewpoints  politicians and the general public have. The result is that as we approach the General Election, we have only a superficial understanding of the scale of immigration, the laws that permit foreigners to make their homes in the UK or its impacts and implications, particularly around housing, social services and job prospects. What is needed is an objective study of the scale, nature and consequences of the immigration we are now experiencing along with a set of proposals for addressing the disbenefits and long-term harmful impacts. A Royal Commission is the only way of securing this.",
