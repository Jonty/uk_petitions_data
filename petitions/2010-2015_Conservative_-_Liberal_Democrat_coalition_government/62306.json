        "additional_details": "Greenfield skate park is a highly used area in Oldham\r\n For too long have the floodlights been out of working use, after several attempts to have them fixed which resulted in failure. We have had petitions, emailed the council. But nothing. It would cost such little money to fix 4 floodlights and it needs to be done after such a long period of time of them not being in working order.",
