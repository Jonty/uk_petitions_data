        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition for people with the aboive disorder who may hold down jobs with support and need the PIP payment just as much as people who do not work.  These people may experience overwhelming psychological difficulties with sensory overload, dyslexia and other problems associated with their condition, which may not be apparent on a day of activities such as is being proposed by the powers that be.  I think that the person's GP or any other relevant rofessional should have the last word and a day of activities should be only a minor factor in the assessment.",
