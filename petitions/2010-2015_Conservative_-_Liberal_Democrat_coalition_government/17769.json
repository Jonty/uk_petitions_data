THIS RIGHT IS BEING THREATENED BY CALDERDALE COUNCIL.\r\n\r\nDOGS NEED TO RUN LIKE JOGGERS AND PLAY LIKE CHILDREN.  DENYING DOGS THEIR PROPER EXERCISE AND SOCIALISING IS IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE ACT OF 2006, AS A DOG IS BEING DENIED THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS NORMAL BEHAVIOUR.  A DOGS HEALTH SUFFERS AS A RESULT.\r\n\r\nAT THE SAME TIME WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT ALL DOG OWNERS CLEAN UP ANY MESS SHOULD THEY MAKE ANY AND ALSO THAT HUMANS DO NOT LEAVE THEIR UNPLEASANT AND OFTEN DANGEROUS LITTER AROUND EITHER, WHICH COULD HURT NOT ONLY DOGS, BUT PEOPLE AND OTHER SMALL ANIMALS.
