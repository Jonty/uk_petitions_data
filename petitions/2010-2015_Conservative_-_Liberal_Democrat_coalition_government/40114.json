        "additional_details": "I would like to put forward that the Government recognise caring as a full time occupation. For those returning to work after caring, I feel that it is imperative for employers to cease discounting years spent caring. Many work-essential skills are developed through a caring role such as; time management, effective communication through all means, due diligence, patience, administrative duties etc.\r\n\r\nI find it necessary and acceptable for carers returning to work to include their caring duties on their CV and implore the Government to see that employers accomodate said duties, as and when they apply to a role.",
