Sadly, this is not the case as more and more women are developing problems after this procedure including pregnancy with a roughly 50 / 50 chance of a successful pregnancy ending in a live birth, allergic reactions, irregular cycles, constant pain, headaches and rashes to name a few.\r\n\r\nThe procedure needs to be withdrawn and further testing into its efficacy and safety carried out.",
