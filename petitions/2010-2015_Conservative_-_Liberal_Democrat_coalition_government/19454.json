        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK physical books are not subject to VAT, however, e-books are.\r\n\r\n With the ever expanding e-book market, and with the ever increasing need for access to the great and good of english literature- as demonstrated by recent figures showing that British kids are falling behind their international peers in literacy standards- we cannot afford to maintain this double standard.\r\n\r\n Other countries have adapted, Britain has stood still on this issue- Britain is lagging behind.\r\n\r\nScrap e-Book VAT. Stop this knowledge tax. Let's open the doors to Britain's wealth of excellent literature.",
