A rent-to-own arrangement, also called a lease option, lease to own or lease to buy, allows a homebuyer to rent a property for a specified initial term with an option to buy the property at the end of that term. Monthly rent payments are generally higher than market price, with the surplus going toward a future down payment. If the buyer opts not to purchase the property, the extra rent is forfeited.\r\n\r\n",
