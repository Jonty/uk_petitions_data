Under the proposals many of the current processes  will  become vet only.\r\n\r\nEquine dentists will be restricted from providing  healthcare treatment in many situations.There could also be a big cost implication for the owner as many  smaller vet practices  are not equipped to carry out most dental procedures, therefore the horse owners,   horse/horses will be have to be referred to a practice that is equipped to carry out the work required .   In most cases this will mean travelling horses to vet hospitals.\r\n\r\nEquine dentists dedicate all their time and effort into developing their skills in equine dentistry to provide a better service for horse and owner.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to help protect the current equine dentistry  status  then please show your support by signing the petition.\r\n ",
