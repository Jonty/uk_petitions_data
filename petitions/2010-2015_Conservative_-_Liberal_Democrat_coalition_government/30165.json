This remoteness creates a feeling that the UK Parliament is out of touch and doesn't care about people outwith the \"Home Counties\".\r\n\r\nIts location means that legislators travel further than they would to a central location, which increases travel costs and the damages the environment.\r\n\r\nAlso London is the most expensive region for property and staff costs, and best value could be obtained with a capital outwith the region.\r\n\r\nWe beleive that the governance of the UK would be improved if its parliament moved to a location somewhere between the geographical centre of the country and the population centre.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the Government takes all necessary steps to relocate the UK Parliament to somewhere in the north or north west of England.",
