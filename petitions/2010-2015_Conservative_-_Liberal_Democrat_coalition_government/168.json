Germany has its cars, Australia has Fosters lager, Canada has maple syrup, e.t.c.\r\n\r\nWhat do we make?  Is our manufacturing industry diverse or distinctive enough?  Should foreign people be able to say \"Yes, thats English\" or \"That was made in England\"?\r\n\r\nShould the Government setup a task force to encourage innovation in manufacturing to bring out a distinctly English set of products? Does it matter?",
