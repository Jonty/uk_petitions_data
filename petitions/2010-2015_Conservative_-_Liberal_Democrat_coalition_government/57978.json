        "additional_details": "Abolish the Rights of Entry for Gas and Electricity Boards (1954 Act)\r\n\r\nEnergy suppliers are privatised - they should not be given leniency to enter residential property for debts.  Energy Suppliers and Magistrates are treating such matters as \u2018Bulk Hearings\u2019 - the majority of Magistrates are not willing to allow Defendants time to mitigate their case, and Warrants are being \u2018rubber stamped\u2019 under the 1954 Act.\r\n\r\nPeople considered \u2018vulnerable\u2019 who are not able to maintain payments are being pushed into having a pay-as-you-go energy meter installed through the Warrants Magistrates are \u2018rubber stamping\u2019 regarding the 1954 Act.  Energy Suppliers do not put vulnerable customers on their Vulnerability Registers (Energy UK Safety Net); in turn, when the matter is heard at the Magistrates, a Warrant is issued without recourse.  If vulnerable customers are then not able to maintain payments through the pay-as-you-go meter, they are being intentionally cut off from their supply.\r\n",
