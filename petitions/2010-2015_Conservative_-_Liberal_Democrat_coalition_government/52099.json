In the majority of instances, younger people cannot have joint replacements because they are too young.  Obviously, arthritis for example is not going to get better on its own and it is a debilitating disease.\r\n\r\nThe DWP should not stop or restrict the benefits of people who suffer from any form of degenerative illness and not just arthritis.",
