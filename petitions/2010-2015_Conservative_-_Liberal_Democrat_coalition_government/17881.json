        "additional_details": "I believe that leaving school with basic first aid skills would benefit everyone as so many people have no idea what to do in the event of an accident. Knowledge of what do in the case of  scolding, cuts, broken bones, seizures, heart attacks, shortness of breath etc could be taught as part of manadory education to pupils at GCSE age. I feel this would be interesting to students as well as pratical.",
