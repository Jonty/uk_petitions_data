        "additional_details": "The Introduction of a standardised Cycling exam and Test to be taken by all Cyclists wishing to use british roads.\r\n\r\nCurrently all other road users such as Car drivers and Motorcyclists must sit and pass an Exam and Practical test before they are able to use the Road.  I believe the introduction of such a test and exam for Cyclists would not only help make our roads safer but would increase public awareness of cyclists and help prevent accidents.\r\n\r\nThis exam would Cover areas such as Road Awareness, Cycling Safety and Rules/Regulations.  A practical exam would include a test cycling on a main road and how to properly approach junctions.\r\n\r\nThis exam would not have to be expensive or time consuming however it should be considered a legal requirement for all cyclists and fines should be in place for cyclists who use the roads illegaly.",
