The underground is an essential service and no disruptions by industrial action should be allowed again.  We are fed up of LU seemingly being held to ransom, blackmailed and extorted by the underground workers and their unions.\r\n\r\nEmployment law is there to protect their rights as for all other employees in this country.  It is already ridiculous that tube drivers are paid \u00a352k pa, when for many of them due to trains being driven by computer on 4 lines, all they have to do for this is open and close doors.\r\n\r\nWithout the right to strike, their employment rights will not be impinged, LU will be able to run a more efficient service and the paying public will actually be provided with the service that they pay dearly for.\r\n",
