        "additional_details": "Mercedes Curnow died from cervical cancer aged 23.\r\nMercedes was diagnosed with cervical cancer at 21 years, she became a very active member within the cervical cancer communities & her mission was to lower the cervical screening age.\r\nI know many other young women that have died from this preventable disease.  Leaving behind devastated families & friends.\r\nI also know many young women that have been left severely debilitated. The chance to have their own children taken away because of late diagnosis.\r\nWe are calling on the Government to take another look at the cervical screening age which is currently 25 years in the U.K. & reduce it to 21 years thus saving young lives & preventing severe debilitation.\r\nCervical cancer is a preventable disease.\r\nPlease sign and share this petition & help save lives.\r\nThank you.
