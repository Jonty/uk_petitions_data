        "additional_details": "Build homes and sell them at cost price. Firstly, The eligability would work similar to housing benefit does at the moment (you cannot already own a home, have more than so much in savings etc). Secondly, If the house is sold above what it cost the tennant within a number of years then a high percentage of the 'profit' would have to be paid back. Any improvements to the property would also be taken into account so they get their money back. Thirdly, the tennant would have to pay for the home themself. If the tennant fell into hardship and couldn't afford the repayments, a scheme similar to housing benefit would allow them to stay in the house but the equity wouldn't be paid off while they wern't paying anything. This would prevent abuse of the system. This approach to home ownership would encourage people to have pride in their homes and hold communities together better, reduce crime and reduce the number of people claiming housing benefit for private accommodation.",
