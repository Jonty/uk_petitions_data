        "additional_details": "Following the failure of The England Rugby Team in Rugby world cup 2011, the Blackett Report into the governance of English Rugby should be published in full with Lord Robertson's recommendations implemented.\r\nThe report recommends an overhaul of the RFU Board and the appointment of non-executive directors with the required skill set to govern an institution of this size in the professional era.  Martin Thomas (current RFU CEO) has vetoed the report and threatened legal action against Blackett if the report was to be published.  This is in response to the reports recommendation that Thomas be replaced.\r\nIt is in the interest of the game that this report is published in full and that the recommendations are implemented.  This e-petition is to petition the government to force the RFU to make the full report public and that the RFU implement the recommendations contained within the report.",
