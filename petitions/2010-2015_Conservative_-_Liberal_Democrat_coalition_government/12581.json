        "additional_details": "With the current threats that humans pose to the environment - predominantly climate change - the government needs to be proactive in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the UK. Subsidies for businesses producing innovative renewable energy technologies allows these firms to be more competitive with polluting technologies, but also allows this sector to develop within the domestic economy and become a major exporting industry for the UK.\r\n\r\nMutual gains can thus be seen attained. The economy benefits from an innovative, dynamic industry, whilst the environment benefits from increasing renewable energy production. This is without straining energy consumers (you and me), as subsidies compensate for the higher cost of renewables.",
