        "additional_details": "Passing Part 2 of the LASPO bill will mean victims of Industrial Disease will incur a 25% reduction in their compensation.  These victims include: bladder cancer victims caused by carcinogens, mesothelioma victims, chronic myeloid leukaemia victims, bowel cancer victims, occupational asthma victims, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and silicosis victims.\r\n\r\nThese victims were exposed to hazardous materials through no fault of their own and should be completely entited to 100% of their compensation.\r\n\r\nThese are all complex and unique conditions and many of these people form the backbone of our great country.\r\n\r\nWe request the House of Commons to rethink their decision on the LASPO bill part 2.  We also request the House of the Lords maintain their position of rejecting part 2 of the bill to go ahead.",
