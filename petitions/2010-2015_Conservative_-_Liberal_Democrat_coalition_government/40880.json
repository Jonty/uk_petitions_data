        "action": "Cut VAT on fuel bills as rises are getting out of control.",
        "additional_details": "Since the conservatives have been in government my supplier SSE has increased the cost of gas and electric for the last 3 years in a row. For gas the last 3 increases have been 2 of 9 percent and one of 18 percent.\r\n\r\nThis is increasing the amount of revenue that the country receives in VAT. I propose that the government scraps VAT for families who are in fuel poverty.\r\n\r\nThis would be done by getting an annual forecast of your useage from your supplier and showing proof of income. If you spend over 10 percent of your income on your gas and electric bills and your useage is not excessive for the size of your house then the government should allow you to not pay VAT on yours bills.\r\n\r\nI understand the government currently offers the warm home discount, which is a winter payment made to people on benefits, but I believe the government has a duty to help some of the poorer working families tackle to cost of their bills and help those in fuel poverty.",
