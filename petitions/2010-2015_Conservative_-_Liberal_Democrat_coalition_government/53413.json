The aim of the law would be to stop individuals or businesses from hiding behind rules or terms and conditions when accused of misconduct or wrong doing. The law would make them responsible for whatever they do to earn a living above all means they use to aviod responsibility. Examples being the primary use of a politician is to serve his constituants so anything that promoted self interest is not defendable.
