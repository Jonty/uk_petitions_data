        "additional_details": "The Government needs to address the growing number of solar panel park applications in rural areas, which increasingly are occupying good quality agricultural land, and are being built in areas of great natural beauty that are not necessarily protected landscapes.  Can the Government introduce legislation to reduce the density of such applications i.e., no more than 50 acres per parish boundary and no closer than 500 meters to more than 3 households.  The National Planning Policy Framework seeks to protect the rural countryside, and supports local views, but it is not being implemented. Our rural countryside is there to feed us, to provide natural homes for wildlife, to enjoy and attract tourism, and should not be desecrated by greedy developers.  Can the Government start looking seriously at hydro-electric power where we have 2 guaranteed tides per day, whatever the weather.  ",
