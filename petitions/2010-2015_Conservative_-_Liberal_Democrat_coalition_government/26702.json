        "additional_details": "There is a huge danger that when the EU folds we UK taxpayers will be told that the contracts of MEPs and their UK employees in the EU have been written in such a way that we (UK taxpayers) will be required to continue to pay the salaries and tax free allowances of these people for the rest of their natural lives, as if they were still in their job at the EU.  This situation must NOT be allowed to obtain.  Any UK citizen who loses their job in the EU as a result of it closing down or our withdrawal should cease to be paid anything by the UK taxpayer from the moment they lose their job.",
