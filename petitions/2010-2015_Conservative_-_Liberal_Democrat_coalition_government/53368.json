Have agencies not learnt anything from their mistakes after the baby p case ? How many more deaths do we need to hear about before people get involved ? And for the teachers in his school to believe his mother about him having an eating disorder. Children rarely have eating disorders at that age. I'm disgusted by the lack of intervention by the police and hospital who treated him for a broken arm...need I say anymore ? ",
