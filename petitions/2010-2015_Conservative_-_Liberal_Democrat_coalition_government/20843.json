        "additional_details": "A common practice within retail is to bring a product to market and initially offer it at an unrealistically high price for a short period, often only a couple of weeks, at a small number of outlets, and then to offer it for general sale at a \"discounted price\" which in reality is the price the product was designed to be sold at, and is a more realistic representation of the product's worth.\r\n\r\nThis can be addresed by creating an offence of \"False Discounting\", where a retailer commits an offence if an item is sold for a short period at an unrealistically high price, and then \"discounted\" to a price that accurately represents its true value.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning behind this is that claiming that an article was previously sold at a given value misleads the consumer into believing that this value is an accurate representation of its true value, whereas in fact it is the discounted price which actually reflects the value of the item.",
