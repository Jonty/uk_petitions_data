        "additional_details": "South Northants council planning Dept have rejected a proposal to create a new shooting range in the county. A co-ordinated anti shooting campaign was organised against the plans where local residents complained that there would be too much noise, but despite demonstrating to the planning officers (and the committee) that no noise would be created (the officers literally could not hear a single shot) they have still decided to reject the application. Their view is that there is no benefit to having a shooting range in the county.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to alert both local and central Government that shooting is a safe and enjoyable sport and deserves as much chance to grow in the UK as any other sport.
