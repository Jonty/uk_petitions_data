We believe it is an antiquated idea for this country to still have a non-elected second chamber, and that the British government should fast-track a referendum on House of Lords reform to ask the British people whether they believe the second chamber should be reformed to be fully democratic.\r\n\r\nWe believe that our country's laws should not be ruled and determined by a select group of Lords who hold their position based on wealth, class or birth right.",
