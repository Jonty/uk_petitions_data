There is already more then enough of the chain stores all over the UK, yet they plan to grow bigger.\r\nI would like to see the government stop the huge companies from expanding more and use their resources to help independent companies across the UK. Bringing back our proud communities instead of destroying them.\r\nUK businesses should also get a tax break and investors from different countries be forced to pay higher tax for coming into our country.",
