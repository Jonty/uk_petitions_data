I believe working low income family's should have priority on the housing list.\r\nWorking low income family's should be priority along with ex service men and registered disabled. Un employed, drug, alcohol and single mums should not take priority over tax payers. Implementing this would improve the safty on the streets of the uk's housing estates making the uk a better place to live.",
