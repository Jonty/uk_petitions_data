        "additional_details": "The breaks between TV programmes for commercials and clips of what coming soon or next is getting out of hand and spoiling the public viewing. ITV depend on adverts however, they can reduce the what\u2019s coming or next programme. Sky TV take two bites of the apple as we pay Sky a monthly subscription and still have to watch commercials this I feel is exploiting the paying public and if this cannot be stopped the time duration must be cut. It is not too bad at the end of a programme but breaks whilst we are watching a programme spoils our viewing and should be stopped or reduced. ",
