We The Undersigned Feel Now Is The Time To Restore The Death Penalty.  Why?\r\n\r\n1.The death penalty gives closure to the victim's families who have suffered so much.\r\n2,It creates another form of crime deterrent.\r\n3. Justice is better served.\r\n4. It provides a deterrent for prisoners already serving a life sentence.\r\n5. DNA testing and other methods of modern crime scene science can now effectively eliminate almost all uncertainty as to a person's guilt or innocence.\r\n6. Prisoner parole or escapes can give criminals another chance to kill.\r\n\r\n",
