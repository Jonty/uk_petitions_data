Their salary could be linked to revenue generated by the London Underground.  All people using the underground could have a swipe card with their salary registered on it; those on less/no income pay less for travel and those on high income pay proportionately more.  As someone from Devon, why are my taxes paying extortionate salaries for a service I might use twice a year?",
