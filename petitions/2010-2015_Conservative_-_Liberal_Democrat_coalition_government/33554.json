If the plugs of chargers and USB cables etc were to be standardised or become an optional extra when making purchasing goods this could:\r\n\r\n(a) benefit industry by reducing manufacturing costs, transport and packaging costs and improve competition.\r\n(b) benefit the environment by reducing the amount of electronic goods/plastic being sent to landfill\r\n(c) benefit consumers by reducing costs or helping to stabilise price increases",
