This at a time when the numbers of UK citizens (who are paying the taxes that Mr Clegg is giving away) who are having to use charity foodbanks is increasing exponentially.  The taxpayer needs to know why the government prefers to feed starving foreigners in favour of feeding starving UK citizens.",
