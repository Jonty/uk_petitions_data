        "additional_details": "A homicide or lethal contaminant poisoning is infinitely worse than an overdose.\r\n\r\nAn overdose, however tragic, occurs when an individual takes one of the few most dangerous substances, and recklessly pushes for an ever more powerful high, in full knowledge that they risk death.\r\n\r\nA homicide occurs when organized criminals start blasting guns and waving knives - killing innocents along with targets.\r\n\r\nA lethal contaminant poisoning occurs when black market dealers bulk up drugs with far more dangerous substances.\r\n\r\nIf we legalize supply and let prices collapse, organized crime will stop - there's no longer money to be made. Countless innocent lives will be saved - homicides and poisonings.\r\n\r\nThe ethical thing to do: decriminalize and demarginalize consumers; legalize supply; offer real humanitarian help to those who request it.\r\n\r\nAdded benefits: reduce prison population; save taxpayers' money; free police resources to investigate real crimes (those with unwilling victims).",
