        "additional_details": "The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs  (DEFRA) is not fit for purpose. It should be replaced with a new department which is able to properly ensure the environment is protected, animal health and welfare are safe-guarded and human health, as affected by the food chain, is protected.\r\n\r\nDEFRA has consistently under-performed. It is unresponsive to community concerns, is obstructive in its dealings with citizens and defends decisions which are unsupportable in terms of evidence. It's decisions are disproportionately influenced by the agricultural sector.\r\n\r\nThe Government should replace this department with one run by people whose attitudes and skills make it fit for purpose in the 21st Century.
