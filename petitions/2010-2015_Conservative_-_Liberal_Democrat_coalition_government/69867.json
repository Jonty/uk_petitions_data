        "additional_details": "To lessen, if not stop, the need for food banks I suggest the adoption of a new universal food credit scheme.\r\n\r\nSuch a scheme could be run by providing all citizens over 16 with a chip and pin style card that would be credited on a weekly basis with a set amount common to all.  The only people who should receive greater amounts would be parents who should have further credit based on the number of children under 16 dependent on them.\r\n\r\nEvery citizen in the UK, no matter what there income, age or other factor should be entitled to this.  If the system is common to all then the adoption of it will become common amongst all but the very wealthiest and thus no stigma would be attached to the use of it.  Much as use of the NHS for health care works.\r\n\r\nI suggest that such a program should be funded though a combination of corporate tax and a new income based charge, similar to that of national insurance.",
