        "additional_details": "As the NHS is public funded it makes no sense to sue ourselves, so the Goverment should ban this practice & ensure Medican Staff carry sufficient insurance, in line with their expertise .  All medical procedures carry degrees of risk, the Ministry of Health should ensure that all patients are made aware of the % risk involved prior to any operation or treatment & all hospitals display such percentages, both national & local so that comparisons can be made .  As the number of people eligable for free prescriptions increase each year & people are living longer, the prospect of free medical treatment for life is becoming very expensive - when the NHS bill was debated in 1948, it was thought that as people got healthier they would use the NHS less .  The Goverment should institute a charge - I propose a \u00a31 per prescription page - on those people on free prescriptions at the present, there to be no exceptions, other than NHS hospital inmates.",
