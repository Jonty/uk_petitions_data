        "additional_details": "Parking Eye operate private car parks across the country. Unlike council car parks they use ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) technology to track cars entering and exiting the car park. This is used to enforce an arbitrary set of rules for which PE charge disproportionate fines should they be broken.\r\n\r\nPE threaten people with court action, bailiffs and CCJs to those who break their rules (unwittingly or not). Threats are often veiled within vague legalese designed to scare people into paying up immediately\r\n\r\nPE's fines have been rebuffed by legal experts for a number of reasons:\r\n1: private companies cannot enforce fines\r\n2: the ANPR images only track the incoming and outgoing times, not the driver nor what the car does in the intervening time\r\n\r\nPE's practices have already been debated on Watchdog as well as Internet consumer groups. The government need to investigate this company and their appalling disregard for consumers",
