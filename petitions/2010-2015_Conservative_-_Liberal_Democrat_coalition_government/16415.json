Either\r\n < \u00a37,475 per year = No tax,\r\n < \u00a335,000 per year = 20%,\r\n < \u00a3150,000 per year = 40%,\r\n > \u00a3150,000 per year = 50%,\r\n\r\nConsidering the vast majority of tax payers fall into the two middle tax brackets, a fairer system needs to be put into place.\r\n\r\nI propose that a sliding scale of tax directly related to you pay should be in place instead of the HUGE leaps from 0% to 20% and then to 40%.\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing that someone earning \u00a312,000 a year pays the same percentage as someone earning \u00a334,500.\r\n\r\nIf 5% more tax were added every extra \u00a35,000 above \u00a37,475 up to 40% then the scale would be much fairer and see the tax system reflecting current living conditions.\r\n\r\nTax Needs To Be Fair to all!",
