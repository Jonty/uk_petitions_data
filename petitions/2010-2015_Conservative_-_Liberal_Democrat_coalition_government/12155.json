        "additional_details": "It has been credibly reported that Gus O'Donnell, a bureaucrat who heads the Cabinet Office, is opposing the release of information relating to the embezzlement of public funds via credit cards by senior civil servants. Effective government is impossible where the producer interest has so totally captured government, and democratic control of the machinery of government must be restored. Sack Gus O'Donnell and cancel his pension. Cancel all government credit cards, and set the maximum expenses for any civil servant at zero. ",
