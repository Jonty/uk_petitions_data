Those aged 16 to 24 who do not sign up for further education, apprenticeship schemes, training or have a job should then be made to do community work.  If they refuse, their benefit should be stopped.  There is so much work that needs doing around towns & cities the unemployed should be used as a 'taskforce' to be deployed wherever needed.  Cleaning graffiti, picking up litter, maintaining parks & gardens, clearing snow & ice in Winter etc etc.",
