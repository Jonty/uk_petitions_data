        "additional_details": "Many over 60s can afford bus travel. However, the benefit of blanket rule is that means-testing gets complicated, is costly in itself and it's hard to know when to draw the line. As people get older they get more frail etc (!) so bus passes and free travel should remain but should be for over 65s or 70s. Especially given that retirement age is 65 and only going to rise.\r\n\r\nGoverment money saved should be used to allow young people, under 21, free bus travel. This would aid the unemployed in looking for work, students (particular those in the 16-19 bracket) getting to /from college (reducing beaurocracy in individual educational institutes). Furthermore it would grant young people more independence, relying less on their parents/carers.  It would help those for whom running a car is just not viable, to get around, promoting equality of opportunity. By 21 hopefully most of these young people will be more able to cope independently. It would help break the catch 22.",
