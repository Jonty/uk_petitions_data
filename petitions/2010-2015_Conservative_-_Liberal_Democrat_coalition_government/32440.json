        "additional_details": "It is not a legal requirement for any UK school to administer medication.\r\n\r\nCare-plans and Medical Protocols are not monitored by Ofsted.\r\n\r\nMany trained teachers fear litigation if something should go wrong in a medical emergency.\r\n\r\nSchool, teacher and pupils need to be protected.\r\n\r\nAs it is a legal requirement for a children to attend school under the Education Act 2002, they should also be protected.\r\n\r\nTo not legally protect a child with a life threatening condition is a breach of their civil liberty and a breach of their human rights.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to consider 'Sabrina's Law' or similar legislation which will offer protection to teachers and children.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is also essential that this legislation extends to ALL schools State and Independent/Private schools this will protect child from any potential discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis will also protect children from medical and academic vulnerbility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
