            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nConsular officials in Dubai have provided Mr Emmett with consular assistance since we were informed of his wife\u2019s tragic death on 19 February 2013.  On 18 November, we were informed by the UAE authorities that the case against Mr Emmett has been concluded, that his passport will be returned to him in due course and he will be able to return to the UK.  We will continue to provide Mr Emmett with consular assistance as long as he remains in the UAE.\r\n\r\nIn cases like this the Foreign & Commonwealth Office provides British Nationals with practical advice about how to manage the difficult emotional and practical challenges that they face when a loved one dies abroad.  This includes information about the country and local process, in particular the legal system, repatriation and local lawyers, should this be required.\r\n\r\nThe UK cannot interfere in the judicial process of another country, and must respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK\u2019s laws and legal process.  Under UAE law, the authorities may retain an individual\u2019s passport while they conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding a death.  We understand that this is why Mr Emmett\u2019s passport has been withheld\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
