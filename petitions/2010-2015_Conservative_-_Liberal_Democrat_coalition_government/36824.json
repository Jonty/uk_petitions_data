        "additional_details": "The minimum wage has greatly damaged this nation where people are losing their jobs because businesses, mainly small businesses, cannot afford to pay them the minimum rate.\r\n\r\nAllowing people however themselves to opt out of the minimum wage, would create a cheap labour system, where the person willing to accept the lowest wage would take the job, making people scrimp more.\r\n\r\nBusinesses should be allowed to make a claim to an Independent Local Committee (so that way big business would not be allowed to cut the wage low) to what they would reduce their minimum to and how many people they would then employ.\r\n\r\nSurely this could boost the jobs market instead of continued government employment spending.",
