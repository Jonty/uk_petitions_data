        "additional_details": "New laws dictate that all cars must be insured or SORNd.  Not everybody has the spare land to get a broken down car off the road so even a seriously broken down car now has to be kept taxed and insured. (by seriously broken down, a typical case would be a broken cam-belt and bent valves, a blown head gasket or an exploded gearbox)  As the car cannot be driven it is iniquitous for the insurers to be charging a full premium but they say that \"They have no mechanism for giving a discount\".  Basically to call a spade a spade this is in my honest opinion INSURANCE FRAUD.  Insurers ought to be compelled to give a \"broken down discount\".",
