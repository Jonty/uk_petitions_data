        "additional_details": "Reduce the national school summer holiday from the current 6 weeks to 4 weeks. Finish the summer term later in July/August and return in September as normal so the age cutoff point can continue i.e pupils born on or after 1st September start a year below those born before in the year of birth. The holiday is too long and children become bored and therefore get into trouble, it can also cause stress on parents who have to either stay at home or find babysitters or childcare provision at extra expense. The reduction can be offset by more Teacher Inset days if necessary or shorter and more frequent half-term holidays. Short & sweet rather than long & protracted.  In light of the recent riots in which 'school age' children were involved it proves that the 6 weeks holiday at the warmest time and with the light nights only fuels anti-social behaviour. ",
