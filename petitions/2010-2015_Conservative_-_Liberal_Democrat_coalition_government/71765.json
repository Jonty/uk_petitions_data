We'd rather they were just dealt with properly and disposed of with capital punishment.\r\nUntil this happens, it is completely unaccenptable that the tax payer should pay even one penny for their upkeep.\r\n\r\nWe ask that all punishment (i.e. legal expenses, prison costs etc) should be fully financed by the criminals and/or immediate family members of the criminals. Those that can't pay should have assets seized. Those with no income and/or assets must have their benefits stopped.\r\nThe dept should remain until it's paid in full.\r\n\r\nThe law and punishment in this country is in an absolute mess and criminals are exploiting the governments weakness. It's high time the government starts listening to the people that pay their salary and keep them in power!!",
