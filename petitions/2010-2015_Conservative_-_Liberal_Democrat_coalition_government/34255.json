This phone number should be usable by the recipient of the call to return the call and speak to a person without having to pay. It should be illegal for the calls already mentioned to withhold their number.\r\n\r\nMaking call line identity a legal requirement will not only support revenue generation for the Office of the Information Commissioner in the collection of fines from silent calls, but will also place someone as responsible for scam and fraudulent calls (in other words someone has registered and paid for the line who can also be held responsible).",
