They are an aggressive breed of dog, and there are too many people injured by them each year, most of which go unreported.\r\n\r\nNot only are they notoriously aggressive, the majority of owners of Staffordshire bull terriers fail to control the dogs' aggression and prevent them from injuring people by training the dogs correctly.\r\n\r\nIn the interests of public safety, the possession, sale and breeding of Staffordshire bull terriers should be illegal; and they should be destroyed at birth, just like all the dogs listed under the Dangerous Dogs Act\r\n",
