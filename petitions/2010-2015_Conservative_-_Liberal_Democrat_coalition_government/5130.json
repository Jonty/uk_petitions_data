        "additional_details": "Under current British tax rules, consumers pay no VAT on \"essential\" foods and drinks but must pay 17.5% on \"luxury\" items such as smoothies, ice cream, and \"gingerbread men decorated with chocolate unless this amounts to no more than a couple of dots for eyes\".\r\n\r\n\r\nThe set of rules which dictates whether a product is taxed or not was created in 1973.  It is archaic, arbitrary, and unfair.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, smoothies - which contain fruit and help people live more healthily - are subject to VAT at full rate when junk food such as burgers, chips and doughnuts are sold tax-free.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe request that the government makes HMRC take a closer look at its taxation on foods.  This should create a more modern, clearer, and fairer tax system which takes into account the externalities associated with the consumption of all major food products.",
