This would mean the people of the UK no longer being subject to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights or the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. In the interests of national sovereignty, it is imperative that each nation formulates its own laws and human rights policies and it is patronising and insulting to suggest otherwise. ",
