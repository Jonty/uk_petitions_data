        "additional_details": "Brain tumours kill more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer, including more children and life expectancy for people with brain tumours has not increased for 40 years; they are responsible for an average loss of life of over 20 years and up to 40% of all cancers which initiate outside the brain lead to a secondary cancer in the brain, though many secondary brain tumours are not recorded. This petition therefore calls on the Government to:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tImprove brain tumour diagnosis by integrating guidance on identifying the symptoms and patient referral into General Practice and Emergency Medicine Practice guidlines\r\n\r\n\u2022\tenforce best practice in brain tumour care by setting a timetable, to fully implement and audit NICE\u2019s Improving Outcomes Guidance by 2013\r\n\r\n\u2022\tincrease the proportion of cancer research spending on brain tumours beyond its current 0.7% and ensure that at least 7.5% of adults with primary brain tumours are enrolled in randomised, controlled clinical trials.\r\n",
