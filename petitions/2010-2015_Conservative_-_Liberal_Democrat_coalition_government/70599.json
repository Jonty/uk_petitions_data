        "additional_details": "Areas of this road are dangerous when faced with high amounts of rain as drainage is inadequate, the vast majority is single lane, and some bends are almost 90 degrees. It also travels at some altitude in areas, creating issues with ice and snow during winter months.\r\n\r\nA combination of inadequate drainage, altitude, slow moving vehicles and commuters, single lane road and extreme bends often results in road traffic collisions. It is highly likely when a road traffic collision occurs on this road a fatality will occur.\r\n\r\nThe link between West Wales and South Wales (A465) was improved near to 20 years ago now. The original link road was akin to the A470 of now. Surely the time has come to improve the link between North and South Wales?\r\n\r\nNot only will an improved link road reduce the risk of road traffic collisions and fatalities, but improvements may be seen in the North/South divide in Wales.",
