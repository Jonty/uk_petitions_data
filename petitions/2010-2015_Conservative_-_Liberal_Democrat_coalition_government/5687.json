        "additional_details": "Children who start school around five years old must be taught another foreign language. For example French, Spanish, German etc.\r\nIt will improve their capacity to learn other languages throughout their school life and prevent language from being a barrier to employment in the future.\r\nWe live in one of the most culturally diverse places on the planet and  I think it's about time that being English wasn't the excuse not to learn another language.\r\nIn studies has been shown to increase superior brain development.\r\nPreparing our children for a global market when they reach employment is no bad thing!!!",
