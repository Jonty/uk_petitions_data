        "action": "Reject funds to increase unjustified adoptions / fostering",
        "additional_details": "Given Jack Straw MP has highlighted the increase in 'grooming' and abuse of vulnerable children not just in Blackburn this petition insists Blackburn with Darwen Council refuse, and return to government, any current & future funding paid to, that expects/promotes forced, coerced, adoptions & putting kidsin care.  Instead focus on helping families stay together. To end practices such as ignoring right of children to impartial representatives & not forcing \"fait accompli\" Cafcass involvement. To end exclusion of relevant family & adults/kids from the courts (UN Children's rights) To end practice of \"if in writing it happened\" perceived of some professionals. Finally to provide CRB forms when requested so proper CRB checks needed for safeguarding can be completed! A town so highlighted nationally should be protecting children from serious risk of abuse within the system, far beyond any unproven 'phropecised' future risk claimed.   No case referred to.",
