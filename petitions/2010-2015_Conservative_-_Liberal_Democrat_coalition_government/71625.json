        "additional_details": "We know two broad economic models: capitalism and communism. We also know communism failed and capitalism (in its current format) has major flaws. But we know little about economic variations to capitalism. This petition is to get our government to commission a study into how an economic model, as described by Silvio Gesell in his book the Natural Economic Order from 1916, can be implemented. The key elements of this model are: (a) negative interest on cash and electronic money. The revenue thus generated will allow us to get rid of income tax. (b) Nationalisation of the Land. To learn more about these concepts read Gesell's book (online: http://www.utopie.it/pubblicazioni/gesell.htm)",
