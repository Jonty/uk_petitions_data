If we had been hit by an English driver they would have been charged so why not a Foreign driver?? There was no charge, no fine, no points, no ban, nothing!! Why should foreign drivers be above UK law??\r\n\r\nAction the government needs to take:\r\nThe government should re-evaluate it's law so that anyone driving in the UK, British citizen or foreign has to abide by UK road laws. If you are driving dangerously, without due care and attention etc and cause an accident regardless of nationality in the UK you should be dealt with appropriately. (charged, fined, points, removal of licence etc). This is currently not that case and the government needs to change its law.",
