        "action": "Ban 360 degree security cameras on private property",
        "additional_details": "At present, it is illegal for commercial premises to have cameras that are able to view private property. However, there is no law in the UK to stop private individuals from placing a 360 degree camera on their property, adjacent to your property, capable of looking onto and into your property and evens blue to zoom in on details. This is at the least unpleasant and for those with children it is positively frightening and disturbing to know that the only recourse is through the European courts! The Police seem to have little or no power to act to have such cameras removed.\r\nPlease sign this petition and encourage everyone you know to do the same. It is perfectly sufficient to have fixed cameras directed onto your own property for your security. Nobody should be allowed to have rotating, zooming cameras capable of looking onto and into neighbouring properties. Why does the law apply to commerce and not to private individuals!",
