        "additional_details": "On Tuesday, February 12th, the International Olympic Committee voted by secret ballot to recommend that wrestling be dropped from the Olympics in 2020. Wrestling has been in the Olympics since it's ancient origin and has been included in the modern Olympics since 1896. I see no reason to eliminate it as a sport. Wrestling is also one of the most diverse sports in the world, with participation across 180 nations from all continents.\u00a0 It is an inclusive sport which provides opportunities worldwide, regardless of wealth, geography, race, gender or physical characteristics.A sucessful Olympic wrestler has to be a supreme athlete, combining immense strength, explosive power, speed of movement, agility, flexibility, balance and quick reactions.\u00a0 The Olympic movement is meant to be all about athleticism and talent and there are few sports in the Olympic programme that require an athlete to be master of all these disciplines - the complete package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
