They and I get very frustrated that some of the iplayer apps have no subtitle options, The most recent offender is the NOWTV box, great selection of movies and programmes but again no subtitles! I'm asking you to sign this petition for it to be mandatory for all these iplayers/apps/streaming companies to subtitle everything!",
