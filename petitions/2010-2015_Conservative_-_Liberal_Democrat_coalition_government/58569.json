        "additional_details": "UK and Irish Airlines must fall in line with the rest of Europe allowing small pets to travel with their owner in the cabin rather than as cargo, thereby cutting the high costs of air travel for cats and dogs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are *no* UK or Irish airlines that allow small dogs or cats to travel in the cabin of the plane (inside a pet carrier), which is something most other European countries\u00b4 airlines do allow. This is an affordable way to transport your pet compared to the astronomical cost of UK airlines and \"pet reception\" services. Ireland has it even worse because they need to fly to the UK first and then take a connecting flight from there.\r\n",
