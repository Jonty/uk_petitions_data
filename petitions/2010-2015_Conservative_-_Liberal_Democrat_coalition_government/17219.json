        "additional_details": "There should be a permanent memorial to the thousands of civilians who were killed by enemy action during world war two. Many of these people were buried in common graves because their families did not have the means to give them a proper burial.\r\nWe have numerous memorials in London, amongst the more recent are the one for women killed in wars, one for animals killed in action but nothing for the thousands of Londoners. There is even a memorial to those killed in 9/11. My mother died over twenty years ago with much shrapnel in her body having lost a sister, niece and nephew on Sept 7 1940. We owe these thousands of civilians decent recognition of what they gave their lives for.",
