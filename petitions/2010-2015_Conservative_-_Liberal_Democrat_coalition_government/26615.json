This has allowed them using the magical instruments of derivatives and short selling etc, fired by hedge funds, to manipulate currencies causing hyper inflationary periods which in turn place sound countries in debt to these private bankers. Poor people loose their houses and their jobs and the super rich get richer.\r\nAs recommended by Ellen Brown in her book \"The Web of Debt\" - issue your own currency and do NOT let it float",
