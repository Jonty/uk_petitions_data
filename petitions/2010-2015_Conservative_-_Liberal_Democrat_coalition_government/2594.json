        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call upon the government to end compulsory membership of the Institute for Learning (IfL) imposed upon teachers and trainers in further education and community learning. The IfL operates as a de facto closed shop, bureaucratically and financially burdening the state and those entering the profession and is a formidable barrier to closer co-operation between communities, employers and education and skills providers. Trade unions are not permitted to operate a closed shop, neither should the IfL. \u2018Professional representation' should be based on the principles of voluntarism and a genuine Big Society agenda. We specifically call upon the government to revoke compulsory membership requirements contained within: The Further Education Teachers\u2019 Continuing Professional Development and Registration (England) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007 No. 2116) and The Further Education Teachers\u2019 Qualifications (England) Regulations 2007 (SI 2007 No. 2264.",
