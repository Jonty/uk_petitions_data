        "additional_details": "The current First Past The Post electoral system is highly disproportionate and NOT democratic. For example in the 2010 general election the Conservatives gained 36.1% of votes but 47.2% of seats in parliament! Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats gained 23% of votes and only 8.8% of seats in parliament!\r\n\r\nSecond Transferable Vote is an electoral system which, while being slightly more complicated (simply ranking the candidates in order of preference) it provides a greater proportion in Parliament as well as helping gap the male/female ratio in Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis petition demands that Parliament conducts another referendum and instead of offering AV to the people it offers STV.\r\n\r\nIf democracy is our aim, FPTP must go and STV must be introduced.",
