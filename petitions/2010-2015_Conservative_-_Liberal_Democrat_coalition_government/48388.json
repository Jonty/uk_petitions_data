        "additional_details": "Footballers are the highest paid athletes in the U.K and get paid far too much for what they do. I propose a salary cap on all footballers and be fairly priced on their ability and age. The cap should be atleast around 50-75% of wages and then a further 15% on transfers and loans.\r\nIn the U.S and Canada most sports teams cap their clubs spending on players, physiotherapy etc.\r\n\r\nWhat should happen to the money that is being subsidised from them:\r\n1. The money will then go into government funding to promote other sports in the U.K for children in all areas.\r\n2. To actually make more elite sports recognisable in the U.K (only some sports are available to go and actually visit and are televised)\r\n\r\nWith this proposition, it will mean that clubs going into administration can regain revenue and to then broaden sporting events within this Country",
