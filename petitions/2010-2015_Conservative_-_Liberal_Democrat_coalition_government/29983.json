        "additional_details": "This petition stands to stop the Government from adopting the proposed Communications Capabilities Development Programme into legislation. The idea of monitoring UK citizens' phone records, their precise location, text messages, private Facebook and Twitter correspondence and Internet history is a direct breach of any individual's rights. If this is all being done to combat the forces of \"terrorism\", ask yourself if you feel afraid to leave your house. We do not need this legislation to fight terrorism. This is a blatant attempt to control the populous and make it easier to now detain anyone without charge. Under the Blair Government, we have seen our human rights smashed into tiny pieces.  He has systematically ripped away our right to protest, right to free speech, right to habeas corpus and the right not to be tortured. Do not let the current Government hold more information on you than you even know existed.",
