        "additional_details": "Mental illness will affect 1 in 3 people, with 1 in 4 people being affected during the course of a year. Suicide is the biggest killer for males aged 18-34. Waiting lists for Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is currently 18 months, and counselling services not being offered in every area on The NHS. Inpatient wards are filthy, inadequate and just plain disgusting. Yet our Government is cutting the chronically underfunded Mental Health Budget by a whopping 8%.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 11, I went to my GP explaining that I was depressed, and having regular suicidal thoughts, and thoughts of self harm. I was told to 'call the Samaritans' and told to go away. Since, I have been hospitalised, attended therapy (privately, due to the waiting times) and told to take multiple medications.\r\n\r\nOur government needs to recognise that mental illness affects so many people. Funding needs to be increased by at least 16% (an increase of 8%, pre-budget, plus an additional 8% to help fund the sector) ",
