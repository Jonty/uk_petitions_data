        "additional_details": "We are deeply concerned about the rise of Hindu extremism against Christians, the growing culture of religious intolerance and anti-conversion laws in India. We are calling upon the Indian Government to uphold the religious freedom guaranteed under its constitution and the universal declaration of human rights which India signed to in 1948. We want to point out that freedom of conscience and the right to practice any religion are guaranteed by Article 25 of the Indian Constitution.\r\nWe wish the UK Government to use its Commonwealth influence to ensure that religous freedom is guaranteed for the Christian minority in India.",
