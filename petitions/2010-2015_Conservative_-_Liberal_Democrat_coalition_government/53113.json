        "additional_details": "I propose that the government should change EU legislation and that the NHS should be only used by British citizens unless it is an emergency. Many thousands of Europeans come to Britain to take advantage of our NHS to have their children, to have non-urgent medical care that they would have to pay for at home. I think this is wrong and this is the reason our A and Es are so full and so slow. Keep the NHS for the British and don't allow any Europeans to take advantage of it.",
