        "additional_details": "The EU will soon vote on new motorbike legislation which includes compulsory ABS, Anti-Tampering, Bikes older than 7 years banned form urban areas, Hi Vis etc.\r\n\r\nAll of these legislations infringe on our human rights as a motorbike rider, we don't see car drivers being banned from urban areas in cars older than 7 years.\r\n\r\nAll of the new legislations have been thought up by politicians who know nothing of riding a motorbike.\r\n\r\nI for one am sick of motorbikes being blamed for all the problems when a lot of the time, it is the car driver at fault and yet we are the ones being punished.\r\n\r\nSo i call if this new legislation is put into effect that the UK government stands against implementing this and stands up for it's countries rights and riders.",
