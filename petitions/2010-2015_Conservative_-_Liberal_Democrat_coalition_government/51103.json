        "additional_details": "Given the recent attack against the soldier in Woolwich, and the subsequent outpouring of racist abuse against the Muslim community, it is necessary to make it compulsory for children to be educated properly about not only Islam, but all other religions - a lot of racism could probably be avoided if people were taught about the religions which they claim are evil (which obviously are not). These need to be taught in an unbiased way, not putting one as more important than another.\r\n\r\nEducation plays a vital role when combating racism and ignorance, so why not start to teach respect for other cultures from a young age to try prevent racism, rather than try to combat racism once it's an even bigger problem than it already is?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
