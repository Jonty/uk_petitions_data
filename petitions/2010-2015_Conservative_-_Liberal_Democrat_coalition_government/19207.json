        "additional_details": "Too many fathers are getting away with not paying for their children and somthing needs to be done about it. There are men out there that have jobs and when the CSA catch up with them and arrange payments for his children they still don't pay. They might make a few payments but don't pay off arrears owed to the children, they also pack in their jobs so they don't have to pay and this is wrong. When they no longer have a job the CSA can't take money off them that is owed to the children and the he gets away with it. If a father doesnt pay his child support and arrears to his children or packs his job in so he doesn't have to pay then he should be fined. It isn't right that fathers get away with this any longer, some fathers owe their children thousands of pounds and the children should have this money. ",
