        "action": "BAN SALE OF FUR IN UK",
        "additional_details": "The fur industry makes its huge profits by keeping production costs down to the bare minimum. Animals are kept in appalling conditions, crammed into row after row of tiny barren cages, and left to stand on metal bars for their entire lives. Even the method of slaughter is chosen purely with profit in mind, designed only to protect the valuable pelts, without any consideration for the animal\u2019s suffering. However, the barbaric fur industry continues to thrive, fuelled by the increasing consumer demand.\r\n\r\nIt is disgusting that products that come from these conditions and from this level of animal cruelty are sold in the UK. Please sign this petition and make the government do something about this horrendous animal welfare issue.",
