        "additional_details": "As most drivers will be aware  the road surfaces in the North West of England are deteriorating rapidly with Local Authorities taking little or no action to fill pot holes and resurface the worst affected roads.\r\n\r\nLatest statistics show that claims against local authorities for damage caused to vehicles due to improper road surfaces has risen 50% in 12 months.\r\n\r\nAlthough not an issue which is isolated to the North West of England it has been widely reported that the North West has the worst roads when compared to those else where in the Country.\r\n\r\nYet year on year road tax rises and there is little return on our money and increased danger round every corner.\r\n\r\nLetters to Local Authoritys rarely work as they hide behind the 'budget cuts' arguement. Well now is the time to make central Government stand up and take notice.\r\n\r\nThis is a petition to force 'our' Government to take this issue seriously and to devise a way to make our neglected highways safer to drive and ride on.\r\n",
