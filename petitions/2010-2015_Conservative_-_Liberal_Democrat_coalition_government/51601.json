        "additional_details": "The CCMCC was set up to centralise issuing of all money claims, speed up administration and ultimately reduce costs. The effect of this is to drive up legal costs in cases, cause delays and result in regional job losses. Court papers are lost \u2013 what good is it to return an issued claim form 6 months after the court has issued the claim form? Why are we required to amend court orders repetitively and return them to this court for approval? This Court granted an extension of time to serve a claim  by 28 July when the actual date for service is in fact 16 August? Urgent applications are not dealt with for 2 weeks minimum. It appears the CCMCC is inadequately funded and resourced as they cannot effectively deal with the volume of documents they receive daily. Local courts are on reduced counter hours and local jobs in the courts have been lost. The CCMCC is not fit for purposes and needs to be closed and money claims issued regionally again. Enough is enough!",
