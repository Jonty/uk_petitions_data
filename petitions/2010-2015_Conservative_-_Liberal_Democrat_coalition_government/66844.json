        "additional_details": "David was lured to Dubai on the false pretext of discussing a new London based job with GFH as well as meeting to resolve various outstanding financial matters relating to expenses owed to him from his previous employment with GFH. This subterfuge, which has been admitted in court, deliberately brought David into a jurisdiction under which he could be arrested and held for an unlimited period in custody without any criminal charges being brought against him.\r\n\r\nDavid, a British citizen, is now in his sixth week of incarceration in a shared jail cell. Far from being charged with criminal wrongdoing, he has not even been interviewed by police or public prosecutors.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Foreign Office to use all political means and relasionships with the UAE Govenment to allow David to be released on bail, so he may properly prepare his defence.",
