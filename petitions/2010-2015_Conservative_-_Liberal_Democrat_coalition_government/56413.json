        "additional_details": "Cola is one of the main cusses of obesity which is a growing concern across the UK. Cola is also one of the few drinks which contain caffeine which is addictive. The children of the UK are extremely vulnerable to the bad sides of soda drinks but cola is simply the one which stands out as a health problematic drink.\r\n\r\nI am asking parents of any children to realise the effects of cola upon there children's health. Please sign this petition if you would like an age cap on the use of cola.  ",
