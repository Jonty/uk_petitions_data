Feel enough of an hourly rate with the abuse 99% of us put up with daily from physical to verbal and with most carers getting paid the same minimum wage of \u00a36.31 for nightshift like me while some factory workers are getting the likes of upto \u00a310 pound nd hour to sit and Pack boxes of bread doesn't feel right. If your tired of breaking your back for what seems like pennies please sign and share this E petition to see if we can get the minimum. Wage for carers working in residential and nursing homes raised from \u00a36.31 to at least \u00a37.31 to feel like we are getting payed a decent amount for the daily pain + abuse we endure to help others feel safe and well",
