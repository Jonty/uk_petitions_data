        "additional_details": "The BACP have 'retrospectively' changed the membership criteria for new members - anyone applying for membership must have completed a minimum of 100 supervised placement hours.   This has impacted on any student currently studying on a course where the placement hours are less than 100.\r\n\r\nCurrent students who are in their final year and finished at the end of June 2013 will not have the opportunity to attain 100 hours due to time restrictions.\r\n\r\nCurrent students entered into an agreement (funding themselves following the governments change in education funding) that 60 hours would be the expectation.\r\n\r\nThe BACP changes are 'in the interests of public safety' (Therapy Today, April 2013) a result of government direction in order to further regulate the profession?\r\nWe would ask that the government urge the BACP to apply the changes on 1st July 2014. To enable current students to complete the course on the current criteria and still be able to join the BACP.\r\n",
