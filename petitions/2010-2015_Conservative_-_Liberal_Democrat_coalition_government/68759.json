Its against Human law right. Domestic Abuse is for both for women and man, I wish the Ministers to reconsider not to make a new law, it will effect people relationship and life and it will also destroy peoples marriage that vows. I hope Ministry of Justice to support for both parties to a man and women to as equal. More bad law, it will effect peoples life and living of the society.",
