        "additional_details": "Over the years the RAF have proven they can drop bombs and kill the enemy from a fast jet with ease. However their ability to move a large number of troops from A to B on time and with the minimal amount of fuss has proven too difficult a task. It is therefore proposed that this area pf the RAF is scrapped and contracted to a company which can provide this service.\r\n\r\nThe service provided by the successful contractor will increase the morale of all troops as they will be back from the theatre of deployment within a certain time frame and will not suffer from a poor service which is currently being provided by the RAF.\r\n",
