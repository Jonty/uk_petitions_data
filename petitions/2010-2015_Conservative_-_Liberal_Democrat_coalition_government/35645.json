        "additional_details": "Today it was announced that it is likely that Stanchester Nursery will be closed due to increased maintenance costs.\r\nStanchester Nursery is located within the grounds of Stanchester School, Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Somerset.\r\nThe nursery is managed under the local authority, Somerset County Council.\r\nThe nursery is in a class of it's own and highly respected. The loss will mean redundancies and approximately 30 families needing to find new options. Other facilities in the area are already at capacity and there are a number of families planning to use Stanchester in the coming years.\r\nIt is essential this decision is reverted and other means are found.",
