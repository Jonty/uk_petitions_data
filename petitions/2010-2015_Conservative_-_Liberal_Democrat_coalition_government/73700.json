        "additional_details": "Over the last 10 years teaching has become far more pressurised and stressful as a result of increasing administration and a steady decline in the behaviour of an increasing number of children/students. A recent wellbeing survey showed 87% of teachers had experienced stress and 42% had experienced depression over the last two years.\r\nThe problem is further exacerbated when schools and colleges are visited by OFSTED inspectors who have often been out of the classroom environment for many years. Consequently they have never had to work under the pressures that are being constantly placed upon today\u2019s teaching profession.\r\nWe believe that ALL OFSTED inspectors should return to the classroom/lecture-room and teach a full teaching timetable for two weeks every three years at the level they will be assessing. This would ensure that they were better equipped to pass judgement on a school/college and its teaching staff.\r\n",
