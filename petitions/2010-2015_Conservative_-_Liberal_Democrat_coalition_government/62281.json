People with Cystic Fibrosis should not have to pay for prescriptions as they require a lot on their prescription and it costs a fortune. Cystic Fibrosis affects the lungs, pancreas, liver and other things such as the gallbladder and sometimes the heart. It can cause infertility and diabetes. Cystic Fibrosis patients require a high fat and high calorie diet, which costs enough without making them pay for prescriptions as well!",
