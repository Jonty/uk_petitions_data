        "additional_details": "I have raised this petition because I wish to see serving members of H.M Armed Forces, Veterans and Reservists treated better in the jobs market. All too often, either through discrimination or through ignorance, many employers dismiss job applications from such groups of people without looking at their applications properly. Many just see that person as a Soldier, Sailor, Marine or Airman/woman without looking at their past skills and experience gained before, during and after service. I propose that it should be enshrined in UK law that all serving members of the UK Armed Forces, Veterans and Reservists be treated with respect by potential employers by being guaranteed a job interview or place at an assessment day in order to showcase themselves and demonstrate their skills alongside their non service/ex service peers. Please sign this petition if you believe in my aim too. Thank you. ",
