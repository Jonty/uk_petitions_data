At the same time we have a crisis of an aging population who need support in their own homes.\r\n\r\nThose on Job Seekers Allowance should recieve training in caring for the elderly and after a detailed CRB check, should be employed to take care of the elderly, such as taking them shopping and helping them with activities of daily living. Alternately they should be made to work for the councils and help cleaning the snow and collect rubbish from the streets. They should engage in reducing anti-social behaviour.\r\n\r\nFailure to comply and engage in community service should result in reduction or stopping these benefits.\r\n\r\nThis would help to make better use of the tax payer's money already spent on JSA and similar benefits and drastically reduce anti-social behaviour on our streets.
