        "additional_details": "In recent years the BBC has lost some of it's impartiality and has shown clear bias in several political and social areas over the past year alone. The NHS march in London earlier this year for example and the clear bias shown in the Scottish referendum clearly demonstrate this, as such I believe it has lost the right to call itself a true British institution of impartial journalism and as such I think it's lost the right to demand a compulsory licence fee from tax payers as do many people I have spoken to there for I suggest that the government drop the compulsory licence fee for the television services and instead make the BBC a subscription service as sky and netflix can stop none subscribers from assessing there programming I understand that radio transmissions can't be stopped so I believe that a small charge should still be in place for these services . If you believe the same as I do please sign this petition and let's make this happen .   ",
