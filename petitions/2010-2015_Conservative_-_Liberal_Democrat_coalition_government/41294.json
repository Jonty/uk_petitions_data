        "additional_details": "In order to justify a salary 3 or more x the National FTE average wage, the role of MP should be redefined, with specific performance measurements & other key elements of role articulated, plus processes to measure success & discipline failure.  For example, like most other key public sector roles, MP should be treated as a full time job (no moonlighting) and, like private & public sector jobs, should have certain requirements associated with it & monitored; suggestions: specific number of surgeries, minimum number of hours attendance at House of Commons, fixed amount of leave & process for booking it (not taken without prior agreement), sensible system of expenses (in real world of private sector, we have to produce receipts for everything, for instance).  In other words, redefine MP as a job like any private or public sector job, to justify the significant salary & perks currently applied to this important & prestigious role. ",
