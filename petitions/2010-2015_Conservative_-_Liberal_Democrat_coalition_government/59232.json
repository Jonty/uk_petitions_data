Enforce the Maximum sentence for supplying/dealing drugs as often as possible for all classes regardless of whether it is first offence or not\r\n\r\n. Keep Cannabis illegal and at class B in all circumstances legalizing it will only create more users and will start too give drug dealers a sense of power over the authorities\r\n\r\n.Upgrade GBL/GHB too Class B apart from the possibility of instant death it is also the favored date rape drug and tougher regulations could perhaps reduce the amount of date rapes overall\r\n\r\n. Something should have happened already but mephedrone should be a Class C or even a Class B illegal subsatnce\r\n\r\n. Over 'legal highs' such as poppers should also be regulated with an option to make all of them illegal\r\n\r\n",
