        "additional_details": "\r\nPlease consider these three proposals :-\r\n\r\n1. Reduce vat on food sales in restaurants, cafes and pubs.\r\n\r\n2. Increase vat on \"off sales\" (retail sales) of alcohol.\r\n\r\nIf geared correctly the second measure can finance the first.\r\n\r\nAs cooking and serving food is more labour intensive than retailing alcohol the measures would support SMEs and increase employment in the catering industry.\r\n\r\nThese measures may also slow or stop pub closures thereby benefitting communities and tourism.\r\n\r\nBy encouraging pubs to sell more food we may move closer towards the European \u201ccafe culture\u201d that was an original aim of licensing reform.\r\n\r\n3. Increase the minimum age for \"off sales\" to 21 (leaving \u201con sales\u201d at 18).\r\n\r\nThereby ensuring young people learn to drink and socialise in a supervised adult environment.\r\n\r\nCombined  - more expensive off sales and the already higher costs in pubs etc. should discourage binge drinking by young people leading to further savings for our economy.\r\n",
