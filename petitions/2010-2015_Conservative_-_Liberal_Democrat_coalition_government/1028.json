        "additional_details": "This petition aims to influence the Government to change the law allowing for images and sounds from any House of Commons debate to be used in a comedic and satirical manner. Currently, the law stipulates that such images and sounds cannot be used. Comedy and satire are increasingly becoming mainstream methods to express dissatisfaction with various policies, and it is a poor expression of the democratic right for the freedoms of speech and expression that this law is in place.
