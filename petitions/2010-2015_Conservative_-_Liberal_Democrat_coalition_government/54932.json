        "additional_details": "For those who don't know, I have a bad Toe, the big one on my left foot. I have had 10 operations to stop the problem but with no success, this has caused me to have a painful condition called CRPS, affecting my toe, foot and leg. The original problem in my toe still persists making this condition worse. I have begged and begged the doctors to take the toe off thus eliminating the problem, but they(doctors) wont budge. Forcing me to try and do it myself, but i couldn't. I'm hoping with this petition they'll listen and take the bloody thing off! thank you for reading ",
