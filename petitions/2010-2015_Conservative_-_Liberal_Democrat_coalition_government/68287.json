        "additional_details": "Many times we read the newspapers,watch the news online or on the television,only to be shocked at distressing images.\r\nNews broadcasters usually give a warning to the viewing public,which allows those who do not want themselves,a friend or family member to witness the images to look away or change the channel.\r\nThis option is not granted to people who find distressing pictures on the front page and inside of newspapers.Whilst people suffering atrocities have no choice but to see these images,outsiders such as those reading newspapers and watching news videos should be granted this choice.\r\nWhilst banning the publication infringes the freedom of the press to show these images,this Petition urges the Government to:\r\n- introduce legislation to force the press to warn the public before showing distressing pictures or clips in newspapers and news videos shown on the television and online.\r\n",
