        "additional_details": "The Benefits of Prefab Houses Prefabricated houses or modular homes are built from the inside out. They may take from one week to three months to build. There are a few key benefits to purchasing a prefab house. Buyers can expect to pay less for a prefabricated house. Buyers will pay about 10% to 30% less than they would for a normal house. Due to the fact that prefabricated parts such as windows or walls are constructed uniformly, not requiring a skilled worker, overhead costs are lower. Since, prefab houses are made within a factory; they are not dependent on weather conditions, which put aside eventual delays and hence extra costs. One of the advantages of prefabricated homes is the lower cost of construction. The amount of time it takes to complete prefab houses is also a great benefit to many home owners. Quite a few post WW2 prefab's are still in use today, and are incredibly popular. So please consider this option, it may well save the housing crisis in the UK!!",
