        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the government to commission Ofsted or another agency to inspect Local Authority Adult Social Care Services with the same level of statutary powers as Ofsted has when inspecting Children and Young People (CYP) Social Care Services.  At the moment LA Adult Social Care Services are not inspected as rigorously as CYP Social Care Services.   This seriously weakens the protection for people with critical and substantial support needs and their families and carers against poor decisions and practice by the LA teams.  As things stand finances can lead LA decisions rather than people's needs and aspirations as required by legislation.  Tighter inspections would lower risks of people being placed in inappropriate settings and also support best and improving practices by social workers and their managers.  r managers.  Everyone would be more likely to benefit from the inspiration people with disabilities give to the whole of society.",
