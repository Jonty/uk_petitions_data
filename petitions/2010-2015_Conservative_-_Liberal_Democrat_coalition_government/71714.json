They are being victimised by councils who are stealing from them because they have some money, its disgusting and morally wrong. My Polish grandparents fought in the war, yet they came to England for a new start and brought money into this country via business. England is supposed to be a safe country yet our freedom fighters are being screwed over, by white colour bull, maybe this government has forgotten about the wars previously fought to give every man,women and child in this land freedom and is too busy dealing with elections and helping every person except its own people.
