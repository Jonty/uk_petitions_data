This is an absolute disgrace, not only should they be fired, they should be banned from teaching, allowing them to keep their jobs will be the latest in failure after failure in dealing with this. A woman was fired for accidentally serving a muslim child pork but these people get to keep their jobs? It's disgraceful.",
