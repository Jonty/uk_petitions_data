        "additional_details": "COPD is a debilitating disease which affects thousands of people throughout the UK. What I wish to be discussed in parliament is the lack of facilities to help patients continue debilitating after they have gone through the phase 3 six week course. Phase 4 is the one which is being affected. There are clinics shutting down because they do NOT have the findings to allow patients to continue with an exercise programme that will help them to live a longer and more active life. Importantly, the gain in fitness and confidence with exercise reverses the spiral of reconditioning associated with COPD. One reason for the decrease in exercise anxiety is that patients become desensitised to the shortness of breath that they live with on a daily basis.\r\nThis needs to be brought to the attention of the Government and more done for patients with COPD.",
