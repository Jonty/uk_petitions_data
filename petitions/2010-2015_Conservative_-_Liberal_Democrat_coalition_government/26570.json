On the premise that some individuals will have lost their houses by the time they become eligible to claim their pension, they should be allowed to cash in to reduce mortgage payments, mainly, but other debts could be cleared! Terms and conditions would need to apply i.e. the individual would have to increase their contribution to a current pension scheme, a maximum eligibility age would need to apply etc. ",
