        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call for the removal with immediate effect of the Culture Secretary Maria Miller, in light of the recent revelations relating to her expenses claims. At a time when funding for culture and the arts in the UK is extremely precarious, where talented, creative and industrious people working across diverse media are struggling to maintain financial viability, it seems outrageous that the Government figurehead responsible for the promotion of Culture should remain in post, having used public money for her own indulgences.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, it seems impossible to have confidence in Maria Miller's aptitude for current role. The fact that she seems unwilling to resign at present would therefore necessitate her removal from office.",
