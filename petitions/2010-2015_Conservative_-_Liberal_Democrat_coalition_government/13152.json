These cause considerable tail backs in both directions.  I seek to petition tractors and other agricultural vehicles being banned, or severely resticted, on the A17.  With a bit more thought they could use the minor roads instead of creating traffic jams on a major 60mph A-road.  Also, could we include caravans as well?",
