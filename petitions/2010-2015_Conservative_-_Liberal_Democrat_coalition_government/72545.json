I don't want to have ask to have it removed, I wouldn't mind being asked if I wanted to pay it.  This particularly affects tourists who often tip on top of this charge unaware that they are volunteering to pay 12.5% on top.  This is a practice that should have died out in the 70's but is still prevalent in London, etc.",
