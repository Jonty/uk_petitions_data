Maybe, if children saw their parents sent to jail for their actions, they would think twice about committing the crime. Also, if children are old enough to commit the crime and are found guilty, then they are old enough to be publically named and shamed.\r\n\r\nIn the recent riots, children as young as 11 are known to have been stealing, looting and acting in an unlawful manner.  They know they cannot be touched and more importantly that their names cannot be published.  Parents need to take responsibility for teaching their children both morals and respect\r\n",
