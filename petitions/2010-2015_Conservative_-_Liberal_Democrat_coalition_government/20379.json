This is because in a free democracy if the people ask the MP to vote on an issue then MP should not only have the right to vote but also the right to a free vote. It is the job of Parliament to do the will of the people, and the Job of the PM to do the will of Parliament not for for the PM to dictate to Parliament and for him to tell the people that he know best.",
