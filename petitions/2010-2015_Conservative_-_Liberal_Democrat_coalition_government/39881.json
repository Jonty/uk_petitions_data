Money will be saved because police will not be prosecuting people for carrying cannabis, nor will their time be wasted in doing so, also money will be made from the revenue on the sale of cannabis, selling the product at a reasonable price thus cutting out street dealers.\r\nThere should still be laws and regulations on the use of cannabis just as there is with alcohol for example not to drive whilst under the influence.\r\nThousands of people are being prosecuted and criminalised for using and/or carrying cannabis, it is ruining peoples lives by having a criminal record. They cannot enter certain countries, work in certain job roles.\r\nSo I'm calling upon the government to; Decriminalise the proper sale of cannabis in a licensed premises to create more jobs.",
