        "additional_details": "The Government should be congratulated on finally introducing the Same Sex Marriage bill to give gay couples equal rights.  Should they now introduce legislation to allow heterosexual couples to enter into a civil partnership.  My partner and I have been together for more than 25 years but neither of us is religious in any way and so feel a traditional marriage is not for us. Should we not also have equal rights and be allowed to enter a civil partnership and have equal status in law with regards to issues like IHT if we chose?",
