        "additional_details": "\r\nWe, the British electorate, demand an immediate IN/OUT Referendum on the United Kingdom's continued membership of the European Union.  We demand that the Government immediately invokes Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and that the Referendum be held six weeks after that.  Further, we demand that only British Subjects who have been British Subjects for at least five years are entitled to vote, and that those who have been British subjects for less than five years or are EU Nationals only are excluded.  Furthermore, we wish the referendum to be held on fair terms, so that a simple majority of OUT votes will suffice and that if this amounts to less than 50% of British Subjects eligible to vote then an OUT vote shall still suffice for enactment.  If an OUT vote is the result, we demand an immediate withdrawal from all EU Treaties, Agreements and membership.  We do not wish to wait for any renegotiation.\r\n",
