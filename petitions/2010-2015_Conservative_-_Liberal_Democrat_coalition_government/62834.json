        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would respectfully suggest that our immigration laws mirror those of other countries, mainly Australia. There should be no admittance to this country unless you can bring a skill or something of benefit to these islands, that you are able to speak English, that you have a job waiting for you, and that you pledge allegiance to the crown. This is not an act of racism, just pure common sense. This is an island and there is only so much room and so much money. We can't keep paying for the world to stay here, when those who have paid into the system all their lives are being short changed, and yet polygamists, which is illegal in this country are claiming for five spouses and have never paid in. Wake up Cameron! It's simple financial sense. Charity begins at home. Let the other countries sort themselves out.",
