        "additional_details": "This petition asks the British Government to send a hospital ship equipped with surgical theatres and surgeons to be moored off the coast of Gaza, so that the injured inhabitants can be treated quickly and effectively without having to depend on  the land crossings being opened by Israel or Egypt.  This would be a fitting humanitarian response to the suffering that has been endured by the population of Gaza over the past four weeks.",
