        "action": "In Jade Goody's Memory - Smear Age",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to try and get the the age in which is currently set at 25 for having a smear test reduced to the age of 20, to run in line with Scotland, Wales and Ireland. The Jade Goody Memorial Page has been running now for 4 years and we have read so many stories of young women under 25 having cervical cancer or at least being found to be cin3. Cin3 if left for too long can and will develop into cervical cancer and by the age of 25 these young ladies are only being put at risk. Many of which are married with children by the time they reach 25, resulting in some sadly going undetected and leaving behind husband's and young children as well as their families. We have at the moment got 28K people visited the site and we have many of these asking for us to start a petition so that Jade didnt die in vain and finally her final wish will be granted. In memory of the late Jade Goody (The People's Princess), lets do this for her, her beautiful boys and her loving family. Thanks xx",
