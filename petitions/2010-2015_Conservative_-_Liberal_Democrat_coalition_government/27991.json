This is as things are moving onto an online platform such as epetitions and BBC streaming online, if we want equality in votes and information being propagated equally then people should have free Internet access. Allowing everyone access to the same information. A possible solution for this could be utilising funds that the BBC collect for TV broadcasting.\r\n\r\n",
