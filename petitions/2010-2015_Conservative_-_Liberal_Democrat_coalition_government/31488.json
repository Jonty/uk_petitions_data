        "action": "Restore Home to Duty allowance to voluntary cadet force staff.",
        "additional_details": "A recent defence spending review decided that service personnel would no longer be eligible to claim a home to duty allowance.\r\nSadly it has also been applied to the volunteer reserve staff. Previously we have been able to recruit specialist volunteer staff, such as radio technicians etc, from a wide geographical area as they were able to claim a mileage allowance to attend. With the instigation of this policy our potential recruitment pool has been substantially reduced and we are now finding it difficult to recruit volunteer staff to provide training and education to cadets.\r\nIt would be a shame for young people to lose such a valuable facility because of a change in policy that was originally intended for paid service personnel, particularly since the more senior, paid, members of the ATC (Regional Commandants) are provided with a MOD funded car and chauffeur. Withdrawal of these perks would go a long way to restoring home to duty allowance for volunteer staff.",
