        "additional_details": "If a landlord were to cut off water supply to a tenant and force the tenant to buy bottled water from the him, and him alone, this would be deemed unacceptable. Why is it acceptable, therefore, for landlords to engage in this restrictive and profitable reselling practice where gas or electricity supply is concerned? It is particularly harmful when the landlord is only willing to provide meter cards once a week. Tenants often have to go days without electricity until the landlord's designated meter card day comes around. This practice needs to be stopped immediately so that tenants can buy cards from any supplier. It is grossly unfair and highly uncompetitive. Please sign this petition.",
