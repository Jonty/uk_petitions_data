Sharia Law is barbaric, oppressive and demeaning.\r\n\r\nThe laws under which the citizens of the United Kingdom are expected to live are enacted by our elected representatives at Westminster.  No individual, nor any group should be allowed to introduce Sharia Law in any area of the country without the full approval of all UK citizens.\r\n\r\nUntil the citizens of the United Kingdom give their approval to introduce Sharia Law, by voting for it via the ballot box, the Government should end their current acquiescence on this subject and take all necessary measures to uphold the law of the land.
