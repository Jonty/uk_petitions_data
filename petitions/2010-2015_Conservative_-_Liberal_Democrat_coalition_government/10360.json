Prisons are overcrowded and the judicial system is too lenient.\r\nNational Service will instill discipline.\r\nAnd if necessary, send them overseas to fight for our country and bring back our true national heroes of the armed services.\r\n\r\nAnd before you close this petition like all the other \"Bring Back National Service\" petitions...I have scoured the site and it looks like you closed down all of them saying there was already a petition for this.  if you are going to close this one down, link to the true petition in your comments.",
