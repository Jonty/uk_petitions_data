        "additional_details": "I propose that a limit should be placed on the number of corporate tickets at sporting events. In accordance with the capacity of the stadia/venue, a maximum of 20% of all tickets should go to corporate sales. This would give 80% for the general public (fans of the sport/teams).\r\n\r\nRecent issues with Olympic tickets highlights something needs to be done. Top events are having over 50% of the venue filled with corporate tickets. Wembley stadium for the FA cup final had 40,000 corporate seats, only 25,000 seats each for the fans of the supporting team.\r\n",
