        "additional_details": "The NSPCC is a charity which is meant to support children who have been abused/neglected etc all acts committed on them by adults and through no fault of their own.  Access to proper counselling and support for the victims should be a right not a postcode lottery/matter determined by the amount of funding available.  The NSPCC should be a government funded department - these children should not be dealt with by CAMHS they should solely be dealt with by the NSPCC  The only way to ensure the cycle of abuse stops is to have the right help and currently they do not have the capacity to help/resources to help all the children who need them.  These children are our future.",
