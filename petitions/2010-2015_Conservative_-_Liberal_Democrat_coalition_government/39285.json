We deplore the abolition of the Police Rural Fund in advance of any review of such issues being completed and implemented.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Home Secretary with the involvement of representatives of rural police forces, to conduct a full thorough and urgent review of the police funding formula with particular regard to\r\n\r\n1 compensating fully rural forces for the unique problems they face in relation to delivering services in sparse areas often with substantial coastlines\r\n2 rebalancing the allocation of funding for deprivation which favours urban areas\r\n3 reviewing the formula with regard to policing roads with less emphasis on motorways and a greater emphasis on rural roads\r\n4 recognising many of the other issues rural forces face\r\n\r\nand that the results of the review be implemented immediately and in full.",
