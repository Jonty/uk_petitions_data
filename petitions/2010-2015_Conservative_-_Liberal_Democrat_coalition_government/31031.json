We continue to labour under this system, unnecessarily compromising the quality of life of millions of people in the UK and the causing the deaths of countless souls in the developing world. The UK government must serve the interests of the world's population by making the transition into a Resource-based economy, and apply the scientific governance method towards the long term social wellbeing of all citizens of the world.
