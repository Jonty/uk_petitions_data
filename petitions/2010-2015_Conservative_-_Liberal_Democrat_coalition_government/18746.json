        "additional_details": "Excess sugar contributes to obesity and type-2 diabetes, with devastating health consequences. Excess fat is associated with cardio-vascular disease.\r\n\r\nBut it is too Nanny State to tax consumer choices.\r\n\r\nSo tax manufacturer choices instead:\r\n\r\nBring bulk sugars and fats (the stuff that travels in tankers) under the duty regime. Making these cheap ingredients more expensive will incentivise manufacturers to change their formulations.\r\n\r\nStart with sugar. Few breakfast cereals contain less than 30% sugar and none (except plain porridge) has less than 15%. Glucose-fructose syrup is always near the top of the ingredients list. And it\u2019s not just cereals: sugar is secreted in every processed food, not to mention \u2018energy drinks\u2019 and alcopops.\r\n\r\nDenmark taxes fatty foods. France increases tax on fizzy pop. There is Europe-wide concern that something must be done. Britain could lead the way with an effective policy. Even an initial zero tariff would send a message to the industry.\r\n",
