Community service holds little in the way of deterrent. What about sentencing to overseas charity work, instead of imprisonment? I would think it would be fairly cost neutral. It would give charities a boost, especially given recent cuts. Perhaps seeing how less fortunate societies live might make offenders realise how lucky they really are, and raise any spark of humanity left within them. Offenders are only allowed to return once signed off by the charity. It may prove a better deterrent to such crimes as vandalism than what is currently offered.",
