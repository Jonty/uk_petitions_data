        "additional_details": "The Police and Crime Commisioner elections held on 15th November have generated controversy.\r\n\r\nThere are widespread reports of people spoiling their ballot papers in protest against the idea of electing a Police and Crime Commisioner and reported turnouts (which do not include spoilt ballots) are very low.\r\n\r\nAs a result it is clearly in the public interest to disclose the numbers of spoilt ballots in these elections, as it seems entirely plausible there may be more ballots spoilt than those taken by the winning candidates.  Should this prove to be the case there is a clear need for a broad review of the entire process.\r\n\r\nTherefore we, the undersigned, ask for the numbers of spoilt ballots in each constituency to be released.",
