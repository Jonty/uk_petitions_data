Broadcast at the same time with existing DAB multiplex. Eventually switching-over existing DAB multiplexes to the DAB+ Radio broadcast standard. Also increase spectrum bandwidth to allow higher bit-rates to be used. Since all newly sold DAB Radio's have to be by law DAB+ compatible and have been since 2009.\r\n\r\n2. Help make commercial Radio stations commercially viable again whilst providing decent sound quality on them. A lot them only broadcast in low mono bit-rates and not stereo.\r\n\r\n3. Help incur rage more diverse stations to be launched thus leading to an increase in DAB Radio listening. These are the main reason's why Radio station's are struggling to survive now and since DAB Radio's Inception. They need to be put right for UK DAB Radio broadcasting to flourish. ",
