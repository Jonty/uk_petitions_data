Numerous public servants (Tax payers) are quite rightly tested for illegal drug use, however SOME benefit claiments can happily spend substantial amounts of our taxpayers money on Illegal drugs which inturn fund criminal gangs...... If you choose to use drugs then you should pay for them? Not with my money though! I want my tax to pay for Hospitals, schools, and Public/armed services. If you take drugs, then no Benefits.
