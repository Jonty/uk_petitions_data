        "action": "Enforce Minimum Wage Act For Interns",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned request that the government enforces current minimum wage laws to the practice of internships. Leaked government papers recently stated that \"the concept [of internships] has become endemic\" and \"legal colleagues take the view that most interns are likely to be workers and therefore entitled to the NMW and other worker rights\". Under NMW laws anyone who does 'work' should be paid the NMW. We believe that the internship system is being exploited by employers as a way of getting cheap labour and to avoid having paid entry-level jobs. We call on the government to act on this immediately to remove tens of thousands of people out of illegal working conditions.",
