(\"Also no uk court or government has to follow any treaty made by the EU so it's a load of False lies\")\r\n\r\nPlus the moment the government Decided to join the EU they Committed an act of Treason!\r\n\r\nSo in Response to all of the above I Suggest making a BRITISH law to Legalise the Cultivation,use,sell of Cannabis.",
