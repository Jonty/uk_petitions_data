        "additional_details": "This is a petition to stop the introduction of Halal only foods in our primary schools, the main one Wormholt Park Primary School as this is one close to home. We believe that there should be a choice, and those who do not wish to eat Halal (of which is only eaten by a very small percent of the UK) are being discriminated against. Halal is not only cruel, but is blessed religiously according to Islamic law, a law which most in this country do not abide by! Please sign this petition to let people know that we want a choice and that there are people/children who don't want to eat Halal.",
