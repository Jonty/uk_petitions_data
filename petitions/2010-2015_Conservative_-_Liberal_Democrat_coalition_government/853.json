        "action": "Empower Registrars to marry couples anywhere",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to radically review and re-structure the laws surrounding suitable premises for a couple to be legally wed in. A new system where the registrar is individually registered and licenced to perform wedding ceremonies at any given location (provided it is safe and causes no distress to others) like many other countries currently operate is more suitable to the times' requirements.\r\n      This will have the added benefit of minimising money leaving the state as couples opt to wed abroad, due to the flexibility of where you may be wed.",
