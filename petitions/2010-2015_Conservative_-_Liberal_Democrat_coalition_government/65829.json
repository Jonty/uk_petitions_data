They are slowly destroying all of the fields and wildlife haven and if the access road goes through it will then only be a matter of time before all of the open spaces are car parking for them.\r\nThe area is home to bats, kingfishers, heron, pheasant, newts, barn owls, frogs and toads, another bit of wildlife cast aside!",
