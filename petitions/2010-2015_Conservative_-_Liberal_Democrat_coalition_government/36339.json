        "action": "'Clear Labelling' Consumer Goods Plastics Recycling Compatibility Bill",
        "additional_details": "Despite the prevalence of kerbside domestic recycling collections, many tons of plastic are sent to landfill every year due to incorrect, insufficient or simply non-existent labelling - causing confusion about what can actually be recycled. The current labelling legislation is severely lacking AND the lack of legislation governing the types of plastics used encourages the use of non-recyclable plastics. This bill will call for ALL plastics used in consumer goods (including food packaging) to be of either type 1 (PET) or type 2 (HDPE) plastics and to be clearly labelled with the correct type symbol. Both types of plastics are supported by kerbside collections. By enforcing this bill by 2014 and educating households, the recycling of these plastics may be encouraged, finally making the elimination of consumer plastic packaging in landfill a possibility.",
