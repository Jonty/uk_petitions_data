        "additional_details": "Yellow lines were introduced to control parkng in cities to ensure traffic flow was not impeded. They have now become so widespread that there is a great cost in the maitenance of lines and signs required to enforce them.\r\nThe government should ban all on street parking except in designated parking areas. The cost of marking areas would come from parking fees or in the case of residential streets resident permit schemes.\r\nThe provision of parking on streets would be the subject of agrrement by residents. Parking occurs in places where the Highway Code indicates vehicles should not be parked, e.g. bus stops.\r\nThe result of the total ban would be that police would no longer need to monitor parking. There would be no appeals against parking tickets on the basis that lines and signs were not correct.\r\nWe would thus have the benefit of yellow lines without the costs.",
