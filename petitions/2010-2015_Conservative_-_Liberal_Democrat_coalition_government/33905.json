        "additional_details": "The hunting act should be repealed.\r\n\r\nHunting is the most humane and most effective method of wildlife management.\r\nIt is the most natural method of wildlife management, as only healthy animals can escape. Like natural selection.\r\n\r\nHunting is also not cruel. Unlike other methods of control, any animal caught by hounds is either killed outright or escapes unharmed. No animals escape from a hunt wounded.\r\nThe hounds kill the foxes in a matter of seconds due to the strength of the hounds. If a fox is \"ripped apart\" by hounds, it is only after the fox has been killed. Hunting is more humane than other methods of fox control.\r\n\r\nThe hunting act is based off prejudice, ignorance, and a desire to settle old political scores, as admitted by some MPs who supported the act.\r\nThe government should stop listening to phoney animal welfare concerns, and the hunting act should be repealed.",
