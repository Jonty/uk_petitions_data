        "additional_details": "Don't Prescribe...Recognise is aimed at increasing the government\u2019s awareness over the lack of funding for counselling and wellbeing services. E.g. in parts of Wales there is a waiting list of a min. 6 months to see a counsellor (working voluntarily) whilst at several universities the wellbeing services are considerably unfunded. During this time prescriptions such as antidepressants are used to relieve symptoms. This petition is aimed at reducing these waiting lists; increasing available counselling services therefore allowing individuals to discuss their feelings/thoughts PRIOR to prescription use. This petition is NOT aimed at stopping prescription use as it is required at times, however increasing counselling services nationwide will not only aid those who desperately need to speak about their experiences but ultimately benefit the NHS! This petition stems from personal experience and has been set up with a true reflection of the problems surrounding counselling services in Britain",
