I have had the misfortune to go through the legal system and have suffered a miscarriage of justice which I wish no other person to go through.I am shocked at the level of lies and corruption which is covered by the Law!. 1)Solicitor firms misrepresenting bills which is legal under assessment of costs! 2) Judges in civil cases just following procedure and not applying common sense and fairness, being bias against litigants in person. 3) Barristers lying on behalf on their clients allowing perjury within the court system.
