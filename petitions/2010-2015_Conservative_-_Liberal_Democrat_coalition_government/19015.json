While Thatcher style cuts and tax rises take hold,people of this country become increasingly worried about their job security and streched standard of living. While the PM and his Torie counterparts hide away in their multi-million pound mansions and taxpayer funded secound homes ordinery people are losing theirs dues to job cuts,rising prices of food,petrol,gas,electricity,pensions and that's to name a few, do u really think the PM and his fatcat friends on 100k a year plus and thier TAXpayer expences know what it's like to live on these streets.WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER,THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIES HE'S COME OUT WITH SO FAR.\r\n",
