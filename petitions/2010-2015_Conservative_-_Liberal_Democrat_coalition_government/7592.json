        "additional_details": "After watching the ongoing riots across the UK it becomes clear that the justice system in the UK is breaking down. Courts have no real powers to deal with the feral youths who are becoming a blight to the hard working men and women who are watching their livelihoods being destroyed. To add insult to injury those same members of the public will see those committing offences like this walk away from court with Community Service Orders and the like knowing those soft sentences wont make the slightest difference to their future behaviour. Its time we had the birch bought back not only as a punishment for criminal offences but as a deterrent in schools once more. Enough is enough!!",
