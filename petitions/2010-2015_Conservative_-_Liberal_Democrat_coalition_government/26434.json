        "additional_details": "In December 2012 NHS Suffolk are proposing the closure of the Crown Health Centre in Haverhill. This facility is important in the provision of health care services in the town, especially outside of normal GP surgery times at weekends and evenings. In addition there is a need for the Crown Health Centre to remain in place as the population of Haverhill is ever increasing and the other GP surgeries are often unable to offer appointments at times convenient to many patients.Amongst some reasons given by NHS Suffolk for the closure have been that is expensive to run, but this must have been budgeted for when it first opened.It is also unreasonable that NHS Suffolk has stated the Crown Health Centre has not prevented the residents of Haverhill from seeking treatment at the A and E departments of Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds hospitals. Stop this closure.    ",
