What will get me arrested, what is my right?\r\n\r\nCiting an example: If drawing defaming cartoons of the Prophet of Islam is considered Freedom of expression, not Islamophobia, then what are the boundaries for \"Freedom of Speech\", which are especially needed for publishers and journalists.\r\nHow much defamation can be accepted?\r\n\r\nAnother example: the Hash-tag #KillAllMuslims was trending on twitter, but was again considered to be \"Freedom of Speech\". I would have considered that 'inciting genocide'.\r\n\r\nWhy is there so much debate about what constitutes \"Freedom of Speech\"?\r\n\r\nThe Government must work to remove these doubts!\r\nWhat are the definitions? That's all we want to know",
