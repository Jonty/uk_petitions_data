His humanitarian acts resulted in his kidnap, torture and finally in his barbaric murder by the terrorists known as Islamic State.\r\n\r\nHis exceptional humanity, courage and his ultimate sacrifice demands recognition of the highest possible order that he might be remembered and celebrated in perpetuity as an example to all of us.\r\n\r\nThe bravery and fortitude of Alan's family throughout their ordeal must be recognised by the country's gratitude and admiration.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to consider an award of the George Cross posthumously to Alan Henning.
