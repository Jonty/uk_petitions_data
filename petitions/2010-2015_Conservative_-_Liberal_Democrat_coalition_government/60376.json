        "action": "Ban the use of khat in the uk",
        "additional_details": "Khat is used by yemeni & east african communities with most users being from the somali community. There has been a number of widely publicised debates recently which mainly involved members of parliament & drug advisory groups who do not see the everyday & long term affects the use of khat has within these communities. Although some users are able to function well, the use of khat has also devestated lifes and shattered many young people's dreams. This e-petition is an opportunity for the affected communities who have not really had a say to voice their opinion & clearly send a message out to Westminster. Theresa May we support your stance on this issue but you need to stop dragging your feet, we are worried about the future of our children if khat remains legal due to the misuse & abuse we have witnessed, you & the parliament should also be worried too after all they are part of britain's future, this decision affects us the most so we say BAN THE KHAT & BAN IT NOW.",
