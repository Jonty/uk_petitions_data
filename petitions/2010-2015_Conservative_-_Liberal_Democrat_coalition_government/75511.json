        "additional_details": "I'm constantly concerned for children's saftey when entering and exiting out school. The curb is flat and most children when running out of the school run straight onto the road without knowing it! I believe barriers/railings/or even a raised curb could possibly solve this issue! It's a danger for all children without one of these in place! We have bollards on the opposite side so why not carry that on to maintain all children's safety?! One of these days I fear a terrible accident will happen, we need to put childrens saftey first. ",
