It teaches them to appreciate the value of effort and reward.\r\nThe present system of obtaining a permit to work is unweildy, expensive to operate and a disincentive to both employer and employee and should be repealed.  Parental approval direct to the prospective employer should be enough without the need for local authority intervention.",
