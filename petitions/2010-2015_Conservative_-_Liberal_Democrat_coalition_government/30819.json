        "additional_details": "\tIn 2007, following a consultation process, the Home Office\u2019s Misuse of Drugs regulations relating to non-medical prescribing (NMP) of controlled drugs were set to change. These changes would allow pharmacists NMP's to prescribe drugs controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act and allow Nurse NMP\u2019s to prescribe a wider range of products. These regulations mean that pharmacist NMP\u2019s can not prescribe many products to patients on the NHS, that they could legally sell to them under the Medicines Act. Five years have passed since these modifications to the Act were proposed and still they have not been passed into legislation\r\n\t I propose the expediting of these changes to allow NMP\u2019s to prescribe these products (which include many items that can be bought over the counter) and as a result increase patient access to timely care.\r\n",
