        "additional_details": "Provide more legitimate sites for gypsy people to live. This would allow the sections of this community who wish to settle down an alternative from travelling from place to place and causing problems by setting up camp where they should not. New affordable housing is built for non gypsy people.Many gypsy families want to remain in caravans this remains to be a part of their culture, but there is not enough legal council sites for them to stay.If there was more places for them to make home for them selves then a massive problem would be fixed and conflicts between cultures would not arise. Gypsy people were persecuted by Hitler, they are still persecuted today but this devide could be healed if the goverment and councils helped them with more permanent living places. So many issues could be settled if this was to happen i.e their children could get a education. ",
