It fulfils the criteria for inclusion set down by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and attracts larger audiences than several events that are already protected. There are 20 F1 races in a season, which equal 40 hours of programming per year. See here for more information: http://bit.ly/keep-f1-free-to-air",
