While hospital acquired infections are falling we should not be complacent They were the direct cause of 5,000 deaths and were the contributing cause of 15,000 deaths in the UK in 2009. [http://www.ojongo.com/Default.aspx?tabid=73]\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that hand washing would help cut this number dramatically. While individual freedoms should be upheld this is not a measure of a 'nanny state' as by not washing your hands you could affect the health of others. Would you not feel safer if you were in a hospital in which everyone was required to wash their hands before entering?\r\n",
