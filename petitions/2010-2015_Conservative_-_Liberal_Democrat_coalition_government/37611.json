        "additional_details": "Set up a new system that puts a persons criminal record on a credit score. For example a person could leave prison with 40 credits required to clear his criminal record (insofar as having to declare it to an employer).\r\n\r\nVarious jobs that are good for the community could offer credits to the offender so that s/he can clear his/her record and it will help him/her to find work. this way s/he will have an option to graft their way back into the working community.\r\n\r\nThis option will mean that anyone who works hard enough to clear their credit will have proved themselves as wanting to contribute positively to society and will also give them something to aim at to improve their life and opportunites.\r\n\r\nThe current system means that each criminal is branded the same, both those who wish to better themselves and those that are not willing to try. This system would give those who deserve a second chance the opportunity to get their lives back on track.",
