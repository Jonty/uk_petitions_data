        "additional_details": "I do ask to make mandatory change [re-install] and installation of new water meters at the customers' property like gas and electricity meters.\r\n\r\nNow customers are responsible for pipe which goes to their homes. Unlike to gas and electricity where \"handover point\" is at meter output terminals / isolator / isolation valve.\r\n\r\nThere are some instances where customer meter is fitted in meter well which is welle beyond property borders, (on the public land) and is more than 50m from property borders.\r\n\r\nThis:\r\n1. makes reading and leak detection more difficult - especially for elderly/disabled who are not able to lift well lid and duck into the well to teke a reading\r\n2. favours water companies - other suppliers have their meters at the property in question!\r\n\r\nPlease act quickly because this affects everybody on metered supply.",
