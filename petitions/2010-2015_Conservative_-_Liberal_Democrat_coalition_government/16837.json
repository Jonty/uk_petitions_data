        "additional_details": "Many new homes are now supplied by IGTs as they will lay the pipes from the central supply to the new homes at a cut price to home builders, thus cutting costs the the builder and creating a revenue stream to the IGTs. However the consumer  then has to pay in general \u00a345pa to the energy supplier. Why is this charge sent directly to the consumer?\r\n\r\nJust simply which street in a town a person chooses to live on should not subject them to this charge, and if this is the case then a clear warning should be given to each person who subsequently buys the house. If the ideal scenario listed below is not implemented then clear warnings must be placed before a supplier can tempt consumers into contracts rather than simply hiding behind three lines in their t & c's.\r\n\r\nIf we are to utilise the IGTs in such a way, the charges must be absorbed into the advertised prices of the energy companies.\r\n ",
