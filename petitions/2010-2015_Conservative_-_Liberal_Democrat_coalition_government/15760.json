The current house prices are much too expensive for the working class to afford.\r\n\r\nIf housing was more affordable many people, young families, and first time buyers would not be living in poverty - if they are lucky enough to even get a home of their own.\r\n\r\nThe people do not benefit if homes cost more than they will ever earn in their working life. House prices should be capped and banks should be more flexible with mortgages towards the less well off.",
