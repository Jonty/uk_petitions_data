        "additional_details": "The Government has announced proposed changes to the Feed In Tariffs scheme for small scale low-carbon electricity generation. The proposed cut-off date for the current rate of FiTs has been set as the 12 December 2011, instead of previously announced 31st March 2012.\r\n\r\nChurch and synagogue led schemes working to utilise FiTs for Solar PV have been developed to generate further funds for sustainability, social action, and community projects.\r\n\r\nSignificantly reducing the FiT ahead of schedule removes an opportunity for communities to reduce their carbon footprint and harms funding for further community work.\r\n\r\nShrinking the Footprint, the Church of England's environmental campaign calls for the Government to exempt not-for-profit groups from the reduction in rates, and thereby deliver huge social benefit and carbon reduction for the UK.\r\n\r\n",
