Many young people starting work lose money because they are on the wrong tax code, or find themselves easy prey because they don't understand their consumer and civil rights.\r\n\r\nMore importantly the majority of adults don't understand our voting system or the alternatives available. Why spend millions on a referendum when most people have no idea why the voting system works, no wonder turn out was so poor.\r\n\r\nI suggest structured and compulsory lessons in ALL secondary schools to make sure the next generation is less ignorant than our own.
