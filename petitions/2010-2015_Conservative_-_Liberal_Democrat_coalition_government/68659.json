        "additional_details": "Dipu Sultan Ahad has shamed NUFC fans everywhere by implying that Newcastle United fans are members or supporters of the Islamic State Jihadist extremist terrorists.\r\n\r\nThe Labour Councillor for Elswick ward in Newcastle upon Tyne posted a public picture on his Twitter and Facebook pages showing Islamic State terrorists holding a Newcastle United flag with the caption \u201cTony Army!!\u201d\r\n\r\nAhad actually condones and sympathise or support the atrocities of ISIS, in the name of Islam. This happens at a time of racial tensions in the city, which Ahad seems desperate to heighten by making everything about race and religion, rather than seeing people as people. Is he trying to divide NUFC fans?\r\n\r\nWe want him out of office and not to be able to stand again for the disrespect he has caused ",
