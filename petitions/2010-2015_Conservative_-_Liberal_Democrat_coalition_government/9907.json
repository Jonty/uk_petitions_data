        "additional_details": "Rather than simply making gradual, half-hearted regulation changes in the name of cutting carbon emissions, the Government can live up to its electoral \"greenest ever\" pledge by seriously promoting carbon-neutral industries and the perfection of more efficient, cleaner technology. E.g. plasma gasification of garbage to produce usable chemicals, thermal depolymerisation plants to turn organic waste into oil, adaptation of aircraft and ships to run on alternative fuels, retrofitting buildings with aerogel insulation, laser-glazing railways to reduce wheel friction, 3-D product printers, cheap e-readers as newspapers to save trees. Necessary funds can be raised by taxing 1% of the salaries of MPs, high-ranking military officers and civil servants, and the income of the wealthiest 3% of citizens.",
