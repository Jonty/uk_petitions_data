David Ward MP has called for the whole of the UK to be an Israeli free zone.\r\n\r\nThis petition is requesting the government discuss removing both these MP's from Parliament\r\n\r\nThe statements made by these MP's do not differentiate between an Israeli who supports the Israeli government and an Israeli who does not.
