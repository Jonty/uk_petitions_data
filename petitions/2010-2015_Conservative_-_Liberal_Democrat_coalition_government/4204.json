It therefore follows that we can, at a stroke, reduce around half of our problems with criminal activities if such persistent criminals are effectively dealt with like if they were (a) eliminated (by the death penalty) (b) neutralised by effective supervision (c) given proper surveillance (d) given hormonal treatment (as for 'chemical castration' of sex offenders) (e) incarceration by a long term of imprisonment (f) given effective education (g) empowered to obtain suitable employment, etc. ",
