        "additional_details": "The time for debate, discuss & contingency plan on this issue is now. If Scotland choose to be independent from UK, border checks on all migrants from Scotland entering England & N. Ireland would become necessary to prevent illegal immigration.. This possibility should be debated, discussed, considered & prepared for; as part of the debate on the referendum on whether Scotland should become independent from the UK. In addition to free NHS, prescriptions, schooling and higher education; an independent Scotland may find it difficult to also fund affairs of state like border checks, immigration, Scottish passports & driving licences, embassies, foreign affairs, EU membership, civil service, Inland Revenue, momentary system, policing, prisons, legal aid, welfare benefits, etc, etc. Independent Scotland\u2019s economy may well be stretched. Also new RN warships may not be built in an independent Scotland.",
