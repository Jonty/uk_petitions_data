        "additional_details": "Some 24,000 children in Britain are at risk annually of female genital mutilation (FGM or \u2018cutting\u2019) \u2013  50+ girls and babies every day, or 2+ every hour.\r\n\r\nBut no-one in the UK has yet (June 2012) been fully sanctioned for performing, procuring or permitting FGM.\r\n\r\nThe legal position on child protection is not remotely being upheld. The embarrassment of those responsible for safe-guarding children, and / or community unwillingness to intervene \u2018for cultural reasons\u2019, can never excuse inaction on serious criminal child cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe role of national FGM Co-ordinator was \u2018disbanded\u2019 by Government in April 2011, and a new cross-disciplinary approach introduced with just \u00a350,000 funding.\r\n\r\n\u00a350,000 is direly inadequate to address the risk of harm across Britain to thousands of girl.  This sum must be significantly increased, and the FGM Co-ordinator role must be reinstated immediately to ensure effective national delivery of safe-keeping.\r\n\r\nFGM in the UK must be stopped, now.\r\n",
