Therefore, it is not only unfair to include Spanish overseas properties to calculate temperature but it would appear to be abusing EU rules on the Winter Fuel Allowance being enshrined as an Old Age Benefit. Please recalculate, as the temperatures here in Spain from November until March are at night the same as they are in the UK - ",
