        "additional_details": "Currently the provider of telephone services to patients in NHS hospitals charge a minimum of 49p per minute for incoming calls. However, before you are connected to the patient you must listen to over a minute of 'information' with no means of skipping if you have heard the message before. If the patient does not answer for any reason, you are paying for the deliberately extended call each time you attempt to call.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition requests that the government (Department of Health)  intervene to outlaw this practice and enable fair and reasonable contact facilities for relatives of patients. In particular, the very first sentence of the message should be somthing like \"If you have heard this recorded message before, press * to connect to the patient immediately\"\r\n\r\n",
