        "additional_details": "We should not be forced to pay a compulsory BBC licence fee (called TV licence fee) to watch free television channels. There are many free channels now, yet we cannot watch them without paying a fee. Many people rarely or never watch the BBC, so why are they paying for a product they don't use? If the government think people want to pay to watch BBC channels then they should make them pay per view channels like Sky, but let the free channels be free to watch. The cost of the BBC licence fee (TV licence) is over \u00a312 a month, money individuals could and should be using for other household expenses. The action I want the government to take is to debate, then end the TV licence fee, which is the \"BBC licence fee\" (called TV licence fee to be \"more acceptable\" to the public) and, crucially, let the free channels be free to watch.",
