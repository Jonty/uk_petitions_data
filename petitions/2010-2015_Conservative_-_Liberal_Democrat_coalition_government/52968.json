With the use of this land for house building, which once destroyed, will never be used for food production again. There is only a certain amount of land on this planet that is able to grow food and with the world population increasing and wanting this food for themselves is this not a major concern now, because we will not be able to import as much, if any, probably at a huge cost! The answer is to solve these future problems now, not when they become an unsolveable problem for future generations and the dire consequences of food shortages and high prices.",
