        "additional_details": "Following the recent high-profile acquittals of Nigel Evans, Dave Lee Travis, William Roche etc, it is clear that a statute of limitations must be introduced for historic allegations.\r\n\r\nFor an offence under section 9 or 15 of the Sexual Offences Act (sexual activity with person under 16) a limitation of 12 months should be re-introduced. This limitation existed for the equivalent offence under pre-2003 legislation.\r\n\r\nFor an offence of rape, sexual assault etc, a limitation of between 2 and 3 years should be introduced.\r\n\r\nFor sections 5 through 9 (sexual activity with person under 13) a limitation of 10 years should be introduced. A longer period is called for as children that age are often reluctant to report such an offence.\r\n\r\nFor all other sexual offences, a limitation of 5 years should be introduced.\r\n\r\nThese limitations of statute would bring an end to the misery suffered by those people who are falsely accused out of spite, years after the alleged \"offences\" took place.",
