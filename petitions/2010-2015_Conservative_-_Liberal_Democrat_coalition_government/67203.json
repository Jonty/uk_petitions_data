Which means we will have a 45 minute journey to Northampton.\r\nFor someone who needs medical attention it would be life threatening for them to have to wait 45 minutes for help and then another 45 minutes to get there.\r\nIt would mean more money on fuel and possibly rapid response or air ambulance.\r\nWe see on tv incarcerate that time matters. For example stroke patients the longer it takes to get to hospital the less of the person u save.",
