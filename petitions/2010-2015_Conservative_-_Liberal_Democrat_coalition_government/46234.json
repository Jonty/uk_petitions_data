Persons suffering from Dementia, Alzheimers, Parkinsons and many other degenerative diseases, even in the advance stages hardly ever qualify.\r\n\r\nThis charade has got to stop. The existing system is nothing more that a DoH/NHS PR exercise.\r\n\r\nThe Government should either provide funding fairly with simple common sense qualifying criteria, or drop the pretence and don't offer it at all. Currently it a joke!  ",
