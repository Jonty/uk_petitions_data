        "additional_details": "If runway space at Heathrow is at a maximum why not expand facilities at Manchester and make use of its two under-used runways?\r\nMore long haul traffic from Manchester would decrease the present need for excessive domestic flights into Heathrow, thus reducing runway capacity and the need for a third runway! This could possibly also reduce the amount of unnecessary road transport too.\r\nWhy always the need to travel to London when wanting to fly anywhere beyond Europe? It's about time air policy was reviewed and made easier on the environment and the customer, rather than suiting pompous airline execs! ",
