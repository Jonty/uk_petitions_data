        "additional_details": "Everybody should get a travel pass for use on bus and train services within a 30 mile radius. This would be payed for by increase in tax. If people have already payed to use public travel services then they are more likely to use it. There will also be a need for councils to ensure that bus users never have to wait longer than 15 minutes (between 7am - 11:30pm) for a bus/minibus/tram at any stop. At some rural areas access to free local cab service may provide alternative value for money service.",
