        "additional_details": "The Saudi princesses have been locked up by their father - the king of Saudi Arabia - for 13 years for speaking out against the country's oppression of women.\r\n\r\nWomen in SA can\u2019t go to school, travel, open any business or get medical treatment without male permission. It is the only country in the world that prohibits women from driving.\r\n\r\nAttempts to resist the rules are few and rarely successful. The latest protest against the ban on woman driving in October 2013 saw some 60 activists taking to the wheel At least 16 women were stopped by police during this protest; they were fined and forced to obey state laws. Many Saudi clerics condemned the act.\r\nPlease help support womens rights share this petition to show solidarity against the oppression of women In Saudi Arabia and build support the demand to free the captive females right under King Abdullahs roof.",
