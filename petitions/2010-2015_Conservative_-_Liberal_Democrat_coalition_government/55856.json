        "additional_details": "I think the government should look closer to home before they start means-testing the unemployed and the disabled. They say that any hand outs that come from the treasury has to be means-tested. Just by them giving up their free meals and booze at parliament they could probably give all children under 16 free school meals. They have had this privilege of free food and booze at the cost of an average lotto win for many years. Each time you pick up a new- paper these days one of them is up to some scam or another, mostly fiddling their expenses. It`s alright them saying they are going to get Britain out of this recession but surely they should lead by example instead of lashing out at the lower ranks. I don`t see them means-testing the royals and they have millions in the bank. You would like to think that the royals would help to put the hand that feeds them back on an even keel.\r\nStop looking after number one, give a bit.\r\n",
