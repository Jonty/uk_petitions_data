        "additional_details": "As Shocking as it seems, t-shirt pornography is becoming what's deemed as 'normal' in society now. The government needs to remove them from the shelves for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1) Women are NOT objects.\r\n\r\n2) For the Psychological Development of Children; Pornographic magazines are hidden out of children's eye-sight, yet the government is quite happy for pornographic t-shirts to be worn in public; something is seriously wrong!\r\n\r\n3) There is a reason why the number of rapes over the years is increasing; it is precisely things like this in the media that brainwash men to see women as sex-toys.\r\n\r\n4) There is a reason why the number of female suicides/depression is increasing; no woman should be made to feel worthless.\r\n\r\nI saw a young boy aged 6, wearing pornography the other day. It fuelled my anger so far that I cannot sit back and let the world do this to us. Please help stop the sexual objectification of women.\r\nIf not for us women, do it for the children.",
