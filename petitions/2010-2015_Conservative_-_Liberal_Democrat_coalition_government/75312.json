        "additional_details": "American artist Azealia Banks has in recent months made several homophobic comments, showing no remorse for them and directly insulting members of the LGBT community on social media.\r\n\r\nHateful speech and prejudice has no place at British festivals and in our communities. It can stir up negative sentiments and endanger individuals. Azaelia Banks intends to perform at a number of events across the UK this summer. This is a petition to request that she is not granted a Visa to work and perform in the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
