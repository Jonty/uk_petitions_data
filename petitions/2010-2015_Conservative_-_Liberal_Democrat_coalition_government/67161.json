The limit should also be increased to that of the average salary of two working adults (\u00a353,000)\r\n\r\nUnder the Current system it is unfair that a family with one income of \u00a350,000 a year receives nothing while another family with both parents working and earning \u00a342,000 each still receive benefits\r\n",
