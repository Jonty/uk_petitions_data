I would like to suggest that you set up \u201cfamily forums\u201d to provide a direct link with ordinary people in the constituences. These forums would meet regularly, perhaps once a month, with ministers to discuss important issues facing the country. It would be opportunity for ministers to explain the decision-making process and reach an understanding with the voting public whose lives are affected. The forums should be heavily promoted in the constituences as a way for local people to influence the direction of government. ",
