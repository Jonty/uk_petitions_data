        "additional_details": "After the expenses scandal, to counter the loss of that gravy train, now MP's want pay rises that top 32% - taking their pay total from \u00a365k a year, up to possibly \u00a397k a year. This is grossly unfair on the taxpayers and private sector workers who struggle to get by on NMW as it is. Please sign this petition to take the debate to Parlament and stop this pay rise for greedy MP's from happening. Thank you",
