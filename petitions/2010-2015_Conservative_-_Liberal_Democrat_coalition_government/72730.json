Having this on our doorsteps will make our children and indeed the residents feel unsafe. We strongly feel that having the prison in the village will attract the wrong type of people.  The type we don't want around our children. This is a residential family country area.  Why ruin the history that Bestwood Village has to offer to tourists.  We say No to this prison. Please sign if you agree with us. We need your help.",
