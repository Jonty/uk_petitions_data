        "additional_details": "Restrict the ability for large supermarkets i.e. Tesco and Sainsbury's to use their dominance and financial power to destroy small businesses and therefore shatter local communities. We are responsible for supporting all sections of the communities and destroying local business in favour of greedy multi-nationals is counter productive and irresponsible. Mulit-national supermarkets are notoriously more expensive and this is not supporting the local senior population and those who are on low incomes who rely upon the local stores for their shopping. They're also make many family businesses go out of business - many who have been in business for years.",
