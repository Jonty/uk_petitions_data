        "additional_details": "We can improve UK immigration and asylum law by allowing asylum seekers to work legally in the UK, as they were allowed to prior to 2002. This will mean that the UK can meet our humanitarian and international obligations, but also allow the asylum seekers who are here under law anyway to become self-sufficient, live normal lives and contribute economically to our nation, meaning the UK will not have to take in non-political economic migrants as well. It will also mean asylum seekers would not be forced into dependency on state benefits for the duration of the time they are here and that we will not have to continue to run costly detention centres. This will meet our economic needs, while also allowing the UK to maintain its reputation as a compassionate nation and a world leader on human rights.",
