        "additional_details": "Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) or road tax, generates ~\u00a36bn for the treasury (\u00a332bn from fuel duty).\r\nYour cost is determined by the CO2 your car produces in a lab on a rolling road.\r\nThis penalises drivers doing fewer miles a year on the road. The CO2 measurement process has resulted in a 410BHP Porsche Hybrid producing only 61% of the emissions of a 2.0TDCi diesel Mondeo and a VED of \u00a30. No VED or fuel duty can be collected on the increasing number of electric and hybrid cars.\r\nA fairer method is to scrap VED and base tax on the number of miles driven annually. This could be collected every year when you go for your MOT.\r\nGenerating the \u00a36bn requires a charge of only 1.93p/mile driven. Then those that drive the most and use the most fuel, pay the most. Most tax is still collected from fuel duty and will encourage the uptake of electric cars but without exempting them for the costs of maintaining the road network.\r\nThe Government must introduce a fairer system of taxing vehicle owners.\r\n",
