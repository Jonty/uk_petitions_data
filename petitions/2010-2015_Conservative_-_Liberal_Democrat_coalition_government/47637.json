        "additional_details": "Statistically speaking, cyclists are far more likely to be mown down by someone in possession of a driving licence for a long period than a new driver. The holder of that licence is likely to be in their late 40's or older.\r\n\r\nDriving for many years increases experience but at the same time invites apathy and bad habits. High comfort cars provide an almost detached feeling from the surrounds and the possible dangers to others, as well as the driver. For this reason I am calling for the introduction of a five yearly driver personality assessment in conjunction with a short test. This should aim to also demonstrate the horrific effects of driving carelessly.\r\n\r\n",
