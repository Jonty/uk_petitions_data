        "additional_details": "Far too many motorists on our roads routinely break the law, potentially endangering the safety of other road users. Unfortunately the Police cannot be everywhere at the time, so a majority of offending drivers escape prosecution or fines. I propose that the Government invests in updating the cameras on our highways that have the same ability to record footage as on board cameras in Police cars, from recognising registration number plates, identifying stolen, uninsured, untaxed, or vehicles with no MOT, to tracking the speed of vehicles or those on their mobiles or commiting other driving offences. The cameras should be HD to help clearly identify those who are actually driving the car at the time of the committed offence.The cameras should initially be rolled out across our Motorway network, then installation on our dual carriage-ways and other major routes.  Money made from fines could re-invested into paying for the maintenance and upkeep of the network of cameras.\r\n",
