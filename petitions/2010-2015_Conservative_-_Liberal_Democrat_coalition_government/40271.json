        "additional_details": "Currently farm animals and those used in animal testing are exempt from the Animal Welfare Act in the UK. This means that every year many many millions of animals are neglected, starved, beaten and abused. Science has proven animals feel pain and are as sentient and conscious as we are. They have all of the same brain chemicals that we do. Farm and lab animals deserve the same protection under law as our family pets do.",
