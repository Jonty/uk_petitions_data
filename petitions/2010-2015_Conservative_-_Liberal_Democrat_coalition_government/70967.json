        "additional_details": "\"The average price of the cheapest tickets across English football has risen at almost twice the rate of the cost of living since 2011.\" BBC studies show.\r\n\r\nWe all regard football as \"The Working Mans Game\", but with inflation of football prices, is it simply becoming too costly? Across Europe, you will find many huge clubs charging cheaper than Conference sides in England. Why do English clubs insist on knowingly overcharge and destroy what is supposed to be the heart of their club?\r\n\r\nI would like to see HM Department for Culture, Media and Sport deeply look into a decrease in the price of football, enable access to matches for every type of fan. Bring back the meaning of religously flocking to football, because at the moment, the heart of the country's national sport, is being driven away.",
