        "action": "Ban the First Group from operating the First Great Western Franchise in 2015",
        "additional_details": "The First Group are one of the UK's largest transport franchise operators, they have been running the Great Western Franchise since 1998, in October 2013 the franchise was up for bid. Unfortunately the government awarded the franchise to the First Group without a competition, this was completely unlawful and left the other bidders (Stagecoach, Arriva and National Express) losing millions of pounds. Many commuters will agree that they are tired of this company, who have a persistently poor punctuality record.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is for the franchise competition to be reinstated at once and ban the First Group from bidding in the competition, allowing one of the other organisations to take over. What we would want from this is:\r\n\r\nImproved Punctuality.\r\nIncreased Services especially during rush hour where at some stations services are minimal.\r\nInvest in the network by buying new more environmentally friendly and modern trains as well as modernising stations and improving facilities.\r\n",
