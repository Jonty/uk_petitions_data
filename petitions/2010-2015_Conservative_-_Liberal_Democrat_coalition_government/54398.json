        "additional_details": "As chemical weapons are being used on innocent civilians in Syria, scenes are being produced of further killings by government forces. The UN weapons inspectors have to complete their job and a Parliamentary re-vote on military action has to be taken after their job has been completed. We need a firm and proportionate view on the unacceptable use of chemical weapons in Syria creating Holocaust-like scenes as bombs are being dropped in areas such as schools. It is in the best interest of not sending troops but strikes from Naval ships and war planes, with allied support is necessary. To not react to an atrocity such as chemical weapons would be an outrage to those innocent Syrian civilians who are suffering from these harrowing events ",
