        "additional_details": "Under current law, public footpaths and bridleways created before 2000 are permitted to run through people's gardens, driveways and homes, where the route was mapped out long ago.  This means that many people suffer unnecessarily, where it is acceptable for anyone to intrude on their property and as such their privacy, security and family life.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, the Government instated the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (CRoW, for short).  One of the features of this Act is that new public rights of way are not allowed any closer than 20 metres to a dwelling.  This has been agreed to protect the rights of homeowners - the same rights that are already being contravened by footpaths across the country!\r\n\r\nThe time has come for the Government to bring some consistency to its legislation.  This petition asks Parliament to draft a bill which would see all public rights of way moved away from the homes, gardens and driveways that belong to the general public.",
