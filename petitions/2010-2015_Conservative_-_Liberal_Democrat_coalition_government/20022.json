        "additional_details": "The Government has allowed a 10-year trial of longer lorries leading to increased safety concerns and making urban traffic flow more difficult. The Government gave the go-ahead for a trial of longer semi-trailer vehicles - up to 18.55m (60ft) long.\r\n\r\nThe longer lorries will make it more difficult for other traffic to enter the flow of traffic at slip roads and cause concern when overtaking cyclists. The DfT\u2019s own analysis found that the threat from certain slow manoeuvres could increase by as much as 9%. Cyclists are particularly at risk from lorries engaged in such manoeuvres, which from 2005 to 2009, accounted for 40% of fatal cycle crashes involving an articulated lorry.\r\n\r\nThe longer lorries are not suited to the smaller towns and villages across the UK and the claims made for their benefit are in question. HGVs have double the accident rate of light goods vehicles in urban areas. The trials should be stopped and alternative approaches more suitable to the UK, considered.\r\n",
