        "additional_details": "The lack of mass transport straight to schools means that traffic is vastly increased by multiple cars. It would be more environmentally viable and time effective for the majority of people if the government provided a potentially subsidized straight to school bus service. Not only would this help travel and fuel costs for parents, but it would also give children a rigid travel routine in preparation for possible later life careers. It could also provide shy children a basis to make more friends as the daily travel to school could give a community spirit amongst certain years and encourage inclusion.",
