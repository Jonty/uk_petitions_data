        "additional_details": "A Public Inquiry will expose all that has taken place and establish exactly why thousands of people have died.The Mayor/TFL have failed to comply with Public Law and to reduce emissions in London and as a direct result 4267 people a year have died.Thousands more suffer poor health and a diminished quality of life and continue to do so on a daily basis. Children walking to school and cyclists are breathing toxic pollution\r\nEvery day thousands of Underground passengers and staff are exposed to vented street level pollution which exceeds healthy EU Air Quality levels.\r\nAll London Transport workers are suffering. Government attempts to force action have been ignored.Many Assembly Members and Politicians have asked for action and none is taken; there has been no accountability whatsoever.The Mayor /TFL have tried to cheat Air Quality measurements The EU could impose fines of \u00a3300 million,Valid ideas have been ignored i.e. a peak time delivery ban or a clean up process for diesel vehicles.
