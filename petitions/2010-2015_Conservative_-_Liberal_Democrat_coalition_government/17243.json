        "additional_details": "In keeping with OFCOM recommendations, we urge the Culture Secretary to rectify the current situation in the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway whereby terrestrial broadcast originates in Northern England.  This effectively disenfranchises 250,000 TV License payers and deprives them of Scottish news content, political debates, and entertainment programing.  The south of Scotland is one of the worst places in Scotland for local TV.\r\n\r\nThe signatories ask the culture secretary to look again at the technological criteria and consider putting Dumfries and Galloway on the list.The awarding of regional television must not ignore the people of the South of Scotland",
