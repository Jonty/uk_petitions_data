Such environmental laws could be imposed on existing land users by way of initial grant funding to initiate and encourage replanting. For example, a 20 yard swathe of woodland around agricultural perimeters would make a difference on a global scale.\r\nNew conveyances could include the new environmental laws as mandatory legislation\r\n",
