        "additional_details": "British Waterways employees were denied a pay rise last year due to 'lack of funds'.\r\nThis year some staff were awarded a \u00a3200 PA rise and were told that there was no more money to offer.\r\n\r\nIt was recently announced that as there would be a 9 Million Pound defecit at the end of this financial year the Directors of British Waterways will be paid lump sum bonuses of up to \u00a315,000 this year.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Executive (Robin Evans) will get a \u00a315,000 payment on top of his annual wage of \u00a3222,000.\r\nOther Directors will all receive a \u00a312,500 lump sum payment.\r\nThe bonuses equate to one third of the whole pay pot for 0.5% of BW staff compared to two thirds of the pot being shared between 99.5% of the staff.\r\n\r\nThe signatories of this petition believe that the government should intervene and stop these bonus payments and the money should be spent on waterway maintenance instead.",
