We should have the right to choose whether we wish to pay for an organisation or not. Given the seriousness of the current Saville allegations, it is morally wrong that people should be funding this organisation.\r\n\r\nA TV license in itself is acceptable, but this should not be used to fund the BBC. The BBC must seek alternative funding sources such as the use of advertising.",
