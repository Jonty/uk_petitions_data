        "additional_details": "RAF Lyneham is closing in 2012.  This means that the spotaneous tributes given to fallen soldiers, as seen in Wootton Bassett, will no longer be held once repatriations are flown into RAF Brize Norton.  This petition is to ensure that repatriations are still allowed to be made public and members of the community are still able to pay their respects to fallen soldiers.",
