        "additional_details": "Vodafone is now the only network in Rutland that does not offer ANY data coverage, they cla that their 2G coverage is not sufficent for people using new phones such as the iPhone and Galaxy series. It's about time Rutland was upgraded every other network offers 3G and working data in the county, Vodafone customers can't even load a basic Internet page such as Google! Things need to change they are a multimillion pound company bragging about 4G coverage but they forget the smaller consumer towns!",
