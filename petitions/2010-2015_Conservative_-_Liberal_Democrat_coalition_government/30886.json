        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to adopt direct income tax relief for the donation of cars and other moveable assets worth \u00a3500 or more.\r\n\r\nCurrently an ordinary individual who donates a substantial asset like a car to a charity does not qualify for tax relief on his or her income. By contrast donated assets like land and shares do qualify for income tax relief. We believe this unfairly benefits the wealthy who can afford to donate such assets.\r\n\r\nGift Aid, although a wonderful incentive for charities to rally support, fails to reward individuals for their sacrifice, and promotes individual income tax relief only for those on higher incomes.\r\n\r\nWidening income tax relief would help struggling low and middle income families consider donation to a charity of their choice, and benefit charities by unlocking new ways to fundraise from a larger base.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
