The site system displays a notice saying that something has gone wrong.  Even the most popular petition has received a mere 30 signatures a minute (or one signature every 2 seconds) and yet the site falls over.  In this age of advanced information technology, this is, frankly, pathetic and whoever is responsible for creating a website that cannot cope with such a relatively low level of demand should be dismissed.  Think how many hits a genuinely popular site has and compare that with one hit every two seconds.  Another waste of public money?",
