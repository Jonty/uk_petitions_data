        "additional_details": "The latest NHS Smokefree advertisements are disgusting, I am pretty sure I am not the only person that has been drove to physical sickness from them, I believe they constitute an act of offensive psychological violence that is not in keeping with any sensible ideation of what should be transmitted via television or others means.\r\n\r\nThe NHS has overstepped it's function and role completely while disregarding it's role in mental health also by committing such acts of warfare on the populations psyche and infringing heavily on civil liberty.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to remove these advertisements and perhaps in their lieu use older more sensible adverts such as smokers in hospitals beds and so on.",
