        "additional_details": "With the current level of MPs Pay at approximately \u00a365K per annum, they are getting paid in excess of over 90% of the population, this puts them in a position where they have an apparent disregard for the problems of their constituents, as bared out by the recent survey stating that 55% of them think they should be paid in excess of \u00a380K per year. In my opinion setting there pay to the average wage of their constituents with allowances for ministerial portfolio, will make them more accountable, save money and put them on a better footing when setting restrictions on the Civil Service and benefits. The proposed average would be set each year at the start of the finacial year based on the allready regularly collected data held by the Office for National Statistics.",
