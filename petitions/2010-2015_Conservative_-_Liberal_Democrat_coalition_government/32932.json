        "additional_details": "We would like the goverment to consider using the already existing canal network to reduce the cost of a national water grid.\r\n\r\nThe canals were originaly built for industry to supply resources such as iron and coal across the country. The idea would be to repurpose them to transport water across the country instead, something they are already designed to carry.\r\n\r\nEvery few years significant portions of the UK gain drought status.\r\nAs populations increase and climate change occurs this appears to be getting worse.\r\nDuring a drought crops fail and business suffer.\r\n\r\nWe believe a national water grid would ensure that drought would be a thing of the past, and could help to end the monopoly of the water supliers.
