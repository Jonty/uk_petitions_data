        "additional_details": "A person on benefits and unemployed is assessed to how much they are being paid and then  given a reemployment code which equates to 50% of this figure.  If a person gets \u00a35k per year housing benefit and \u00a35k per year unemployment benefit their code would be \u00a310k/2 = 5000. Employers would be able to employ people and claim back in the first year off their PAYE bill an amount equal to the employees code. Iif a person with a 5000 code gets employed at \u00a316k pa for the 1st year the company can claim back through PAYE \u00a35k thus the employee only costs \u00a311k for the 1st year. The government save \u00a35k by not paying the person \u00a310k in benefits, and also start getting tax and NI from the working person\r\nThe company saves \u00a35k in the first year and would more probably take on an extra employee with that kind of incentive. The employee starts paying tax and putting money back into the economy\r\nNeed the government to back the idea and put procedures in place to allow employers to claim back the PAYE\r\n",
