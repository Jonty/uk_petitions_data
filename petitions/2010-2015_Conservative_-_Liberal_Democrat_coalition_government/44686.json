        "additional_details": "Electronic cigarettes use nicotine \u2013 an addictive poison that may cause cancer. Already banned in some countries - but unregulated in the UK !\r\n\r\nThe Nicotine Industry is unscrupulous, wanting nothing less than to recruit a whole new generation of nicotine addicts, and to have everyone buying and using these devices.\r\n\r\nThe NI would love these devices to be the next schoolyard craze, with children addicted to pocket money priced candy flavoured nicotine which they buy and smoke on the way to and from school, smoking them at bus stops and in playgrounds and classrooms; becoming lifelong addicted customers who potentially will move on to harder drugs.\r\n\r\nThe NI will do whatever they can get away with to recruit an addicted lifelong customer, and their uncontrolled lifestyle marketing is most effective with na\u00efve consumers (aka school children).\r\n\r\nWe believe these devices should be controlled identically to tobacco cigarettes \u2013 and available as a cheaper, possibly less dangerous, option.",
