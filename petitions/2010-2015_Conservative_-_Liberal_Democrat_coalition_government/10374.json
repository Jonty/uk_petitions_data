        "additional_details": "Introduce a scheme where people receive money for recycling. The cost of goods that currently come in recyclable packaging would have to increase by 5-10p but that would be a deposit returnable when packaging is returned to a recycling centre. Unemployed and homeless people will be able to make small amounts of money by recycling what they find. From an environmental perspective the streets would be cleaner, and more reusable goods would be recycled. See similar very successful schemes across the world; Canada, USA etc.",
