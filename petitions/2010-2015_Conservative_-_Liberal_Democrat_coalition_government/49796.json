        "additional_details": "Every year around this time, millions of teenagers Pass there exams, throw massive parties and get drunk. Police end up arresting a lot of these teenagers, causing them legal trouble for months or even years. So, there's a new debate about whether we should lower or even abolish the legal drinking age kids drinking illegally makes them look cool and rebellion to the police and government. Due to peer pressure, teenagers will get drunk and this will cause trouble if they get arrested for their school and future careers. Do you want your child to have a criminal record at the age of 16?\r\nTeenagers will always try to find ways to get alcohol. Maybe if they were not taught that drinking was such a \"rebel\" thing at a young age we wouldn't have so many teen alcoholics or so many teens over doing it at parties.\r\n\r\n",
