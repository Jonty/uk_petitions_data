        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a genuine consideration of the introduction of a 99p coin into the British financial system.\r\n\r\nIt would reduce the need for small change in the economy, make purchases more convenient and offset the loss of millions of pennies from the UK economy each year.\r\n\r\nA discussion is needed on this matter, as it could provide a boost to the UK economy at a time when it needs it most.\r\n\r\nThis is not a joke, it could genuinely help streamline the UK economy at a low-end purchases level.",
