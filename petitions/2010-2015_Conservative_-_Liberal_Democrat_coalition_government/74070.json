        "additional_details": "After the recent scandal in the lack of care being provided to the elderly and ill. I have felt there is a need to discuss this matter more openly. The vulnerable deserve the care they need. After working all their lives and building a Britain that we live in I feel it's time to give back to such people. Currently the government have a bill being considered in  parliament which states that the owners of care homes could be prosecuted if there is a lack of care being provided or people being neglected. By signing this petition we are investing in our old age.This petition is just to voice my own opinion and I hope you will also feel the same way.",
