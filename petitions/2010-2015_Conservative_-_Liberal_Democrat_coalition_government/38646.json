It should be made punishable by law if this happens. Sometimes we sit in silence and wait for that e-mail or phone call from an employer inviting us to an interview.\r\nI can name multiple occasions this has happened to me and many people I know. I think it is unfair and needs to stop. We would rather hear the bad news than nothing at all. ",
