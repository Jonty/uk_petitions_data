This would mean I would be deprived of the medicines that I have found to be so beneficial to my health.\r\n\r\n* If not revised the proposal would also have serious consequences for more than 2,000 homeopathic practitioners, many of whom would find it impossible to treat patients like myself because they can no longer obtain the appropriate homeopathic  medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
