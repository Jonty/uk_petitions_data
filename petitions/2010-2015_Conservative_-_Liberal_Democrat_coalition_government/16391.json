Thay are not not privatising education but using charities to run them,\r\n2. They ask for higher academic standards than many other state schoools because parents are involved.\r\n3.\r\nThey do not not bar any student from going. It is like any other school.\r\n4. They have competitive sport.\r\n5. If existing schools were already like this, free schools would not be as threatening to them.",
