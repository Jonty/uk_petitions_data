        "additional_details": "When walking down the supermarket aisle you can be presented with two similar items next to one another on a shelf, one has a price in pounds per KG, the other has a price in pence per 100 grams. All prices per amount should be standardised to a universally agreed set of units, e.g pence per Kg.\r\nThis way confusion is taken out of the equation and it allows people to determine the true value of what they are purchasing.",
