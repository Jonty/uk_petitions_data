        "action": "Fair compensation and mitigation for London\u2019s residents and businesses affected by the construction of HS2",
        "additional_details": "The Government has produced a discretionary compensation scheme to address disruption arising from its HS2 project, but several proposals in this scheme are limited to those living in rural areas.\r\n\r\nLondon stands to lose the most from HS2. Its residents and businesses have the worst compensation deal in the country despite more than a decade of disruption on their doorsteps.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to offer a fair and tailored compensation package for London, which includes: recognition of the scale of disruption; up-front compensation for businesses of all sizes suffering loss of trade and property values; replacement housing for those in homes rendered uninhabitable during construction and effective mitigation for those who remain; fair compensation and mitigation for the loss of community facilities.\r\n\r\nThis petition is presented by Councillor Sarah Hayward, for The Fair Deal for London Alliance, made up of London Councils and MPs whose communities are affected by HS2\r\n",
