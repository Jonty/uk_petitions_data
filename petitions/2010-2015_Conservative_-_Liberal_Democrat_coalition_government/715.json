Perhaps loans not available or when they are offered they are offered on too high rates so not viable. Or maybe banks at local level not aware of the govt enterprise allowance scheeme to help with applications that don't offer sufficient security. Or maybe just poor service or poor help to develop your business if so sign up and let the Govt know the taxpayer who rescued those banks is getting a bad deal.",
