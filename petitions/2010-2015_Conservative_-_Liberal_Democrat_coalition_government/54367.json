        "additional_details": "To launch strikes against the Syrian regime without UN backing would be an outright disaster for all parties involved.\r\n\r\nThe UK cannot act as a renegade member of the UN. It is the UN that is conducting the investigations into the chemical attacks and it is the UN's opinion that we should support.\r\n\r\nTo launch an attack without backing would be seen by many states as an illegal and immoral act (even if the technicalities state otherwise). Furthermore it would be a step towards disbanding the UN.\r\n\r\nWe do not want a repeat of Iraq where we marched in   convinced by flawed information. The UK's reputation in the middle east is already bad and further meddling would tarnish our reputation further.\r\n\r\nI want to be proud of my country. And I want to know that our politicians can hold their nerve until all the facts are certain and agreed by all parties.",
