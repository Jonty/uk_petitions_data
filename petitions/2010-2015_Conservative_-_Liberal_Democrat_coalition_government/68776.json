        "additional_details": "Penthrite grenades are currently an approved method of termination of whales and other cetaceans by the International Whaling Commission. These are harpoons with explosive penthrite heads that explode once embedded inside the animal via delivery of a harpoon.\r\n\r\nA grenade exploding inside a living thing, especially something as large and intelligent as a whale or other mammal, is surely a barbaric method of killing them for meat. The IWC stated in a recent publication that they wished the design of the harpoons to be 'improved'.\r\n\r\nResearch by Nammco claims that reported figures of Time to death (TTD) in whales have reduced significantly due to such methods, however these TTD ratings are recorded by the hunting parties themselves, and therefore are subject to unreliability.\r\n\r\nRequested governmental departmental action: DEFRA to lobby the IWC to ban these grenade harpoons, and other weapons like them, and pursue the goal of banning whaling and the killing of small cetaceans outright.",
