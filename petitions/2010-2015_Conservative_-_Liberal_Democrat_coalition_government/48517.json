Who will pay the cost of such an extra-ordinary, divisive, unpopular 'event'? This country cannot afford & does not need it. If it goes ahead, each & every UK taxpayer must be compensated in cash for the amount we have been (or will be) 'taxed' to make it happen. Please put this on for a vote in Parliament so we know who represents us.. ",
