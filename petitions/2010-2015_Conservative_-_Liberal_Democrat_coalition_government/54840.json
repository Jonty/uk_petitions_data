        "additional_details": "Sign this petition to ban the wearing of veils and Burqas in public. The covering of one's face in public is anti-social, disrespectful and rude to the general populace. It causes a sense of suspicion and distrust as one cannot tell the intentions of someone hiding their face. The wearing of Burqas in public does nothing for social cohesion and in fact creates a division as it is nigh on impossible to communicate with someone whose face is covered. The banning of this practice would help towards better integration of the many cultures within this society. Everyone is welcome in the U.K but you have to show your face to fit in.",
