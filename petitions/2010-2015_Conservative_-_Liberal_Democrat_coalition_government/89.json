        "additional_details": "Our armed forces are one of this countries greatest assets, yet nearly all our political leaders seem not to think so. The Labour party and Conservatives have both underfunded and mismanged them for years. We are in financial hardship but we will come out of that and i for one would rather come out of it without sacrifing a good portion of this countries security. We need to review the SDSR and halt some of the disastrous decisions that have been made based on finance and not security. We need to increase the defence budget and increae the oversight so we know the tax payer is getting value for money.",
