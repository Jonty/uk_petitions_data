        "additional_details": "On 30/04/2012 The Prime Minister told Labour MP Dennis Skinner, to \"take his pension\" during heated questioning in the Commons over Jeremy Hunt.\r\n\r\nNot only was this comment directed at an MP who has more integrity than most others, who has consistently taken low expenses, refuses to drink in the House of Commons subsidised bar on moral grounds, and is generally considered a pioneer and fighter for the people of this county, but it was also deeply offensive to everyone else.\r\n\r\nWith his comments Cameron suggests that people over the age of 80 have little to no worth, and that they should retire. This is a DISGUSTING statement coming from the Prime Minister of this country, someone attempting to represent EVERYONE within this country.\r\nI urge you all to sign this petition, not that it will be listened to, to ensure that Cameron recognises his mistake, acknowledges his ignorant behaviour and most importantly, apologies to Dennis Skinner MP.\r\n\r\nKind Regards.\r\n",
