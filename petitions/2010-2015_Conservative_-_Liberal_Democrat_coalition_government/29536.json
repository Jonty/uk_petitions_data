Evidence clearly shows that signage alone will NOT slow drivers, thus putting lives at risk. Speed limits within residential areas have to be enforced, not advised, as Government stastistics CLEARLY show that most drivers have little hazard awareness whilst driving. PLEASE SLOW DOWN AND SAVE SOMEONES LIFE.",
