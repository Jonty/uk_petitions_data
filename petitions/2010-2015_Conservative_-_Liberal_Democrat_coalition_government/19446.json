Rather than meaningfuly adress and deal with this tragic accident, they cut away and focussed upon comparing indycar with F1.\r\n\r\nSky charges an extortionate amount for their subscriptions and has already been shown this year to have a disgusting influence over the media. This is just the latest shameful episode in their history.",
