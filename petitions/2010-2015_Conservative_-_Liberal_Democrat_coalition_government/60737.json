Why on earth should these people hold back their feelings. Is it not their job to get the people watching excited about what they are watching? Do you think that the American commentators are holding back their feelings for the sake of their Canadian neighbours?? No they are not because they are proud to be American. I loved the fact that there was a British competitor screaming for her fellow Brit and that the commentators were crying on air. It made me proud to be British and want to watch the BBC. There are more British people in this great country so why should we not cheer for our people? I am not racist before you start, but this is not race it is Patriotism.",
