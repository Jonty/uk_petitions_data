I know I have done this many times.\r\n\r\nThere are many 'good news stories' that don't get mentioned in the news, purely because they focus on the doom and gloom surrounding the economy.\r\n\r\nI think we should make the Government debate the merits of ensuring that each news station broadcasting in the UK devotes a minimum period of time to reporting something good about the country - to give the News a feel good factor and show them it's not all doom and gloom.  A lot of businesses do very well in a recession and in times of austerity.  In addition, so many good things happen that we hear nothing about!\r\n\r\nLets join together to make sure we hear what we need to hear when theres not much of it being broadcasted!",
