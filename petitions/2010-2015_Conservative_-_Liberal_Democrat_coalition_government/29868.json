        "additional_details": "This petition is to scrap the work for benefits scheme in which claimants are forced to work for benefits, and includes those on incapacity benefit and those struggling and suffering with cancer.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is not only unfair, forcing claimants to work for less than minimum wage, but also can worsen health problems for those on incapacity benefit.\r\n\r\nAnother problem which should prevent this scheme is the fact that the jobs taken by unpaid workers are being sought by those seeking paid work, which then forces them to stay on benefits and is bad for the economy.\r\nIt needs to be stopped.",
