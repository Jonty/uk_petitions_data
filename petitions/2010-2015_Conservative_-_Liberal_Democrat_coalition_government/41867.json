        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that legally binding options for 'Re-open nominations (RON)' and 'Leave position vacant' should be added to all ballot papers in order to cater for circumstances respectively where no available candidate or any potential candidate for a role are acceptable to voters. This will more accurately reflect voters wishes than the current voting system or options to not vote or spoil ballot papers.\r\n\r\nWhere 'RON' receives the highest proportion of the vote then a new election should be held and all candidates from the first election barred from standing again.\r\n\r\nWhere 'Leave position vacant' receives the highest proportion of the vote then no individual should be elected and no further election held for the role under consideration until the regular electoral cycle would necessitate one to occur.",
