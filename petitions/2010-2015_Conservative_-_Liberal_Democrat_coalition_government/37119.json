The visitors to our city loved it, the athletes loved the fans and the atmosphere generated at all venues and we showed the world how it's done. We are a sport loving nation and are ready to do it again. I would like the Government to bid for the Games again or failing that be on standby for 2016 if Rio isn't ready.",
