        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, object to the proposed Margaret Thatcher Museum and Library. There have been many great prime ministers in the post-war era, and in comparison to some, her achievements were small and many find her legacy extremely distasteful. Moreover, the electorate, whose money may be spent on this project, do not want to see  funds, in this time of austerity and extremes in wealth and poverty, used on such a senseless homage to the Conservative ideology that put us in this position in the first place. We demand you desist with plans for this proposed monstrosity. ",
