        "additional_details": "Kenmont Primary School are asking the local authority (Brent) to make the junction of Harrow Road and Wrottesley Road safe.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the window for crossing is very short, putting children at risk of incredibly serious injury if they are caught midway across, and the cars begin to move.\r\n\r\nThis is of particular concern at school start and finish time, when 10-15 children are trying to cross simultaneously, and on school trips, when teachers have to get 30 children across the junction safely.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, cars travel very fast along Harrow Road and around this corner from Wrottesley Road, with some actually jumping the lights.\r\n\r\nThe solutions are simple:\r\n\r\n1. Extend the time that people have to cross over (e.g. alter the times on the pedestrian crossing).\r\n2. Provide a lollipop lady at critical times (e.g. when school begins and closes and multiple children are trying to cross).  ",
