        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call for an end to the persecution of responsible dog owners in the UK.  Councils and other organisations across Britain are using the actions of the MINORITY of irresponsible dog owners to ban the responsible ones from beaches, parks and other open spaces.  The situation is getting completely out of hand, fuelled by fanatics and those with their own aims in mind, and it is time it was halted.  Responsible dog owners have rights, too, and we want them recognised.",
