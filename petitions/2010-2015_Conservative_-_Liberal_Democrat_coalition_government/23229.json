For Example, Diane Coyle, is also a member of the labour party and a political aide to the labour party whilst a Trust member as a member of the Competition Commission. I don't know how a BBC Trust Member is impartial whilst being a member of a political party. If they were a member of the Conservative Party, labour would be kicking up a fuss.",
