        "additional_details": "The Rt. Hon. George Osborne  MP. is considering offering financial benefits for communities that will be affected by Fracking for Shale Gas.\r\n\r\nShale gas is a gas that is trapped within certain types of bedrock below the water table.\r\n\r\nIn order to extract the gas a bore hole is drilled through the bedrock layer into the methane bearing shale rock. The borehole is then lined and used to inject water and chemicals that cause a hydraulic shock.\r\n\r\nOther dangers of Fracking are :-\r\n\r\n\u2022 Chemicals used for Fracking polluting the water supply chain.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Methane Gas entering the water chain.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Top soil pollution affecting the food chain plants and wild life.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Water shortages due to the water demand for Fracking.\r\n\r\nWe want the Government to stop any current fracking operations in the UK and invest more money into renewable energy sources for everyone.",
