        "additional_details": "I would like the government to seriously consider changing the length of terms at state schools, to avoid a block of six weeks' holiday in the summer. The patterns of work have evolved in the UK enormously in the last few decades away from manufacturing to service industries and office-based employment or retail. Many parents do not live near close family members who would assist with the extra childcare needed over the summer. The financial burden of additional costs would be reduced if there was no long break in the school terms every year. People, please support this request for this issue to be properly looked into by the relevant Department. ",
