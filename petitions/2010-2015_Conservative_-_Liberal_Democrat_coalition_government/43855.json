        "additional_details": "In the interests of balance and Natural Justice, we, the undersigned, humbly request, that the tireless work of Prof. Malcolm Hooper, over many years, in his service to the Community of sufferers from the severe neurological illness M.E ('CFS'), and in the face of concerted and relentless, opposition from the unscientific, yet heavily represented and publicised, psychiatrists known as the 'Wessely School': be recognised with the well-deserved introduction to the order of Knights of the Realm of this Land, the United Kingdom.  We feel that this would in some small way go towards righting the great sense of Injustice and dismay experienced by this community of poorly-served and neglected patients, on hearing of this latest Award to the aforementioned Simon Wessely.",
