        "additional_details": "Most parents choose to send their children to school with packed lunch so they know they are eating healthy food, as many schools do not serve nutricious, healthy meals.we do not know where the food is sourced from or what additives,preservatives etc are in it that affect health. While agreeing children should not have crisps, sweets and fizzy drinks in lunch boxes, banning fruit juice is ridiculous, homemade fruit juice and bread is beneficial in moderation.I disagree with scientific analysis that food is healthier when cooked, it loses almost all nutritional value and is healthier in it's raw form.Headteacher's should just continue to moniter lunch boxes.It is the parent and child's choice, parent's are responsible for their children's diet and health NOT the Government. Also school's will pay more tax on hot food served,taking away funding needed for text books, exersize book's etc, thus affecting education in the long run. ",
