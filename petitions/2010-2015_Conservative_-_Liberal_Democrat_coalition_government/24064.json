If such regulation was in place the public would not have found out about the \"dodgy\" dossier for the second Iraq war as any publication could be banned. Government coverups such as those involved in 7/7 would become common and the public would have no way of knowing anything about them. The press would become subservient to the government rather than free from control.\r\nRegulation is always abused.",
