        "additional_details": "The politicians and political system consistently fail to provide the people of this country with an acceptable service. We do not have confidence in politicians and are bored of the games they play. We endure spin, stories and changing promises when we deserve honesty, professionalism and accountability. We want strong politicians representing parties that deliver clear differences in their policies. The welfare state, immigration, tuition fees, prisons and sentencing, the NHS and the military are all major issues that have not addressed properly and consequently the tax payer picks up the bill. The political system requires change and an independent review should be carried out to determine what changes are required so that the political parties can start to engage with the public and win back our respect.",
