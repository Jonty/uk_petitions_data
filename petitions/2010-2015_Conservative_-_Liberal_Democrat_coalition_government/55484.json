        "additional_details": "700000 mobile handsets were stolen last year, according to the Home Office. This represents significant cost & drain on police resource & even greater loss to the public who pay for the police & thefts.\r\nTechnology could make mobile phone theft less viable & less attractive. The government should look at getting operators/manufacturers to bear some of these costs if they do not introduce crime reduction methodologies or campaigns.\r\nOperators, manufacturers & the public should be more proactive in using existing security facilities & capability of the current mobile phone generation.\r\nOperators should be required to run national campaigns, making public aware & able to set up security & other measures, e.g. tracking & immobilising.\r\nFinally, the public should be incentivised to implement available security measures to the full. Consider making mobile phone insurance mandatory & raise excess premiums for theft victims who have not implemented these security measures.",
