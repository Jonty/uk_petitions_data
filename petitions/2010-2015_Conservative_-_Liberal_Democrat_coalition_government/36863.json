Regularly teenagers are having multiple children to increase their benefits reducing their need to work.\r\n\r\nIf benefits were swapped for food stamps this would reduce the number of people claiming benefits as they would not concieve children to increase their benefit income knowing that they can't spend any money on alcohol or any other of life's luxuries. This would not take away Every humans right to feed themselves. However the food supplied should be basics again providing motivation to become employed.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair for a working couple not being able to afford to have children when fraudsters out of of work are claiming benefits are having 2,3....children who are also taught how to avoid work and claim benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
