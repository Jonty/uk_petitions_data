They don\u2019t represent us, but they\u2019re deciding laws behind our backs.\r\n\r\nIn the name of patents, ACTA would give large corporations the power to stop generic drugs before they reach the people who need them and stop the use of certain seeds for crops.\r\n\r\nThe European Parliament will soon vote on ACTA. This VOTE will be the occasion to say NO, once and for all, to this dangerous treaty. As citizens, we must URGE the govenrment to reject ACTA!!!\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/citzRjwk-sQ\r\n",
