        "additional_details": "Before it is too late, sufficient funding should be allocated towards the development of barriers to prevent flooding as sea and river level rises (as a result of climate change), perhaps coupled with building artificial landmasses, barriers and islands.\r\n\r\nAirports can also be built on artificial islands or land masses, thus reducing noise and smog pollution, etc as well as acting as a barrier against flooding. British built Hong Kong airport is built on an artifical island, for example.\r\n\r\nExtra resources given to flood defences and building artificial landmasses and islands will be well spent real estate and infrastructure investment for UK.\r\n\r\nInstead of a third runway in Heathrow, why not have an artificial island off UK mainland for an international airport? In order to save costs, why can't the Royal Navy ships also built specially to reclaim/conquer land from the sea?",
