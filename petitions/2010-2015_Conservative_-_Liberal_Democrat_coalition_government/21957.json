In other cases it should be illegal to use that title in publications, branding etc. Best practice & high standards should underpin the title to instantly convey to the public a company's commitment to Customer Services. Listed Companies can be ejected from the Stockmarket where they only provide lip service to Customer Services.\r\nAmazon set the benchmark of good Customer Services. The mysterious legend of Rolls Royce mechanics flown to Alps to repair a Rolls: do the job and vanish. No charge to customer because as we all believe Rolls don't breakdown! That's unbelievable Customer Services.       ",
