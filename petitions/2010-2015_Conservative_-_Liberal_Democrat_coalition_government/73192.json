        "additional_details": "Norfolk County Council have recently opened a Consultation Process surrounding their proposal to withdraw their 15% subsidy currently applied on school hire fees charged to all Voluntary and Community Organisations.\r\n\r\nIf this proposal is carried it will cost local clubs such as swimming and dancing clibs who hire such venues thousands of pounds that they do not have. If this goes ahead clubs will need to put up their fees and this will impact on the less well off. It will mean those who have less income will be hit and not be so able to participate in local sport, dance and creative opportunities.\r\n",
