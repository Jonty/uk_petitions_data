        "additional_details": "Half a million vacant houses across the country that are owned by local councils and housing associations which are more than suitable for people to live in. The dwellings are left lying empty for months before the local authorities move families into them.\r\n\r\nThis is a travesty given the number of people left on the housing waiting lists.\r\n\r\nI propose councils and local authorities are fined or punished in someway so that whoever\u2018s in charge in the authority for housing gets a kick in to action or are sacked.\r\n\r\nSign this petition for your say on this matter.\r\n",
