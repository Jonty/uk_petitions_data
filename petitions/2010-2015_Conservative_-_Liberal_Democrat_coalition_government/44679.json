The British government even allows the People's Republic of China government to force these loyal Queen's citizens to have Chinese Nationality. This is not acceptable to treat our own citizens as outsiders. We must rescue our citizens from the Communist and give the Hong Kongers the Full British Nationality or at least the right of abode in the UK. ",
