For those undertaking postgraduate courses, circumstances from three years ago frequently have no bearing on current circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, an individual may have been living independently for two years, but is still required to provide proof of parents' income for three financial years ago, which can result in the individual not being eligible.\r\n\r\nReducing this three year span to one financial year would resolve this issue in the majority of cases.",
