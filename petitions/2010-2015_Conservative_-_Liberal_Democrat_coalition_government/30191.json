        "additional_details": "The government should abolish existing grammar schools and prevent the creation of new ones. They are devisive and cause a sense of failure amongst many children at a young age. Children who are coached for the 11+ exam are sometimes then unable to cope with the academic demands of the grammar schools. Grammar schools are unncesssary as good comprehensive schools cater for all levels of ability with setting which allows children to be appropriately challenged in different subjects according to their ability in those subjects. Able working class children and those on free school meals are under-represented in grammar schools which tend to be dominated by those from middle class families or those who can afford coaching prior to entry.",
