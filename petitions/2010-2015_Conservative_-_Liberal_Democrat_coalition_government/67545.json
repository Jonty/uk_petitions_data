        "additional_details": "The history of institutional child sex abuse in the UK, under the BBC, NHS and potentially even Westminster, deserves the most thorough and credible response.  The recent appointment and resignation of Lady Butler-Sloss to head an inquiry demonstrates a strong need for somebody independent of the establishment to lead this work.  Edward Snowden is clearly fit for this role.  His asylum in Russia demonstrates his lack of links to the establishment in the UK and other western countries.  His ability to expose abuses of citizens in his own country speaks for itself.  Recruiting Edward Snowden to this role would demonstrate that the UK Government puts the protection of children above its own political interests.",
