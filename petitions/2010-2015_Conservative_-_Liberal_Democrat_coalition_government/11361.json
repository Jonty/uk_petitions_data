        "additional_details": "The British colony of Southern Rhodesia was an active military participant in both World Wars and the Malaya Emergency. In the World Wars, more than 17000 men of all ethnicities served in active combat areas, with more than 10% of them falling in battle. Since Zimbabwe left the Commonwealth in 2003, these men have not been honoured alongside those of other Commonwealth countries during the annual Remembrance ceremonies. The undersigned would like this situation to be reviewed and measures put into place to have this rectified, allowing those from this part of the world who served and sacrificed to be appropriately honoured.",
