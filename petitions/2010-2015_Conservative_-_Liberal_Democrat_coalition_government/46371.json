We need to stop paying taxes which have anything to do with the BBC. Let them stand on their own feet and lets stop feeding this 'loophole' system for them.\r\n\r\nI want the BBC to fund themselves, like any other publication does. What gives them the right?\r\n\r\nThe information provided above is courtesy of the Daily Mail.",
