The bill will allow the government to hold hearings in secret behind closed doors instead of in the public domain and with a jury of your peers. They will be attended only by security vetted 'special advocates' and the bill would give authorities the ability to keep the truth concealed. All this will be done in the name of security and as the quote by Benjamin Franklin informs us 'Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety' ",
