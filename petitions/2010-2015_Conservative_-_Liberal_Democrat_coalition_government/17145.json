This practise is very inconvenient and very frustrating for wheelchair users and the elderly who have great difficulty getting off the bus because some inconsiderate person has parked in the bus stop.  The sad thing is that there is no protection from the law for this problem, it should be illegal and there should be a fine for it!  It is not mentioned in the Highway code even.",
