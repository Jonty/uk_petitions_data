But at the moment here on the island when using google play to download an android map, we get the response\r\n\r\nnot available in this country.\r\n\r\nwe have to wait until we travel to England for example to get these apps. these are things such as airlines which serve the island, coffee shops doing business in the island.\r\n\r\nGeographical limitations are understandable for some apps.\r\n\r\nBut the island and others is not even listed in the list of countries or even recognised. this needs to be changed so that the UK crown dependancies, overseas territories are classed on google play as part of the UK, to allow the down loading of these apps",
