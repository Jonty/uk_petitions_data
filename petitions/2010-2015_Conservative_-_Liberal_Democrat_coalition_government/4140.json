This may leave burglars and attackers free to commit further crimes.\r\n\r\nA cost-cutting commission should be set up to find ways of jailing at a much lower cost. That way, criminals who should be locked up may be kept behind bars without such a ridiculously high cost to the public purse.\r\n\r\n",
