        "additional_details": "The UK Government and UK Parliament delegated the power to hold an independence referendum on the Scottish Parliament when only 6 MPs (SNP) could claim to have a mandate on the issue. In doing so, it crossed a constitutional Rubicon as the prospect of independence had never been put to UK voters and it is the only major constitutional change in modern times without a mandate from general election manifesto pledges or specific referenda. To avoid this becoming a dangerous precedent and send a clear message to the electorate that they will always have an opportunity to vote on constitutional change, the UK government should i) request that the UK Parliament apologise to UK voters in passing the referendum legislation without a mandate; and ii) introduce legislation that all future constitutional legislation must have a mandate either from a general election manifesto pledge or as a result of a specific UK referendum.",
