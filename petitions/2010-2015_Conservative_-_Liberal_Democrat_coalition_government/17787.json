        "additional_details": "Drug companies are reluctant to put money into R and D to develop new antibiotics. This is because any new antibiotic is unlikely to widely used due to worries about resistance hence little profit. Yet modern medicine is dependent on them especially after operations and in child disease.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to substantially increase funding for new antibiotics. This will save money in the long run as death and disability due to infection will be reduced. Society must act to maintain  public health. It is in all our interests.",
