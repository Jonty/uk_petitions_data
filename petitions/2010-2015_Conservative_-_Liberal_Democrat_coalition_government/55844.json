        "additional_details": "Over 100,000 families sell up and move each year because of problems with their neighbours.  Many more are powerless to do anything about it because the current law in the UK requires home owners to disclose if there are any neighbour disputes prior to the exchange of contracts.  For those people who suffer from persistent acts of anti social behavior at the hands of a neigbour, this can have a devastating effect on the value of their homes and cause buyers to drop out. This is further punishment for the victim, and is wrong.\r\n\r\nWe are calling for a change in the law whereby homeowners, who engage in persistent acts of anti social behavior against their neighbours, can be forced to sell up and leave, accepting whatever loss their property attracts.",
