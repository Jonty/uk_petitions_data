In the past 2 years over 20,000 new jobs have been created and 300MW of clean power generation installed.  This growth has been underpinned by the Feed in Tariff, which this Government has just announced will be halved from 12th December.\r\n\r\nIs this what we can expect of the 'greenest Government ever'?  Or is it more like the 'greediest Government ever'!",
