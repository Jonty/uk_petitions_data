Electric powered cars are here but the infrastructure to charge an electric car isn't.\r\nLets get Parliament to debate whether passing a law to force filling stations 'nationwide' to install a minimum of 2 electric charging points is a good idea, so we can all enjoy 3p a mile instead of \u00a31.35 a litre.
