        "additional_details": "We request the HM coroner for the Birmingham and Solihull district to consider in appropriate cases the use of MRI Scans which is a less intrusive examination of the deceased as an  alternative to a normal post mortem. A post mortem, or autopsy, examination is a very invasive technique of determining\r\nthe cause of death of an individual for either medical or legal reasons. Many individuals, whether it be for religious or cultural reasons, wish for their loved ones\r\nnot to undergo such an invasive procedure after death. Too often a post mortem is deemed necessary simply because of a referral to the coroner from the general\r\npractitioner, as the patient had not been seen by the general practitioner for several weeks, even though the patient may have had a proven history of disease. In these cases the families of the deceased may feel that an unnecessary invasive procedure can potentially be avoided by the use of the MRI facility available.\r\n",
