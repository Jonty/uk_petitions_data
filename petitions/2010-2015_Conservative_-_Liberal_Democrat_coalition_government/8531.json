A government that cannot guarantee the safety of the people should allow the people to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nAll of the gun laws should be reformed allowing all British citizens with good character to posses a concealed pistol for personal protection.\r\n\r\nWe should all have the right to protect our selves and our property. We should have the right to shoot a person or persons who threaten another person\u2019s life or property.\r\n\r\nWhen we live in an environment where the only people in possession of firearms are those intent in doing harm we are all in mortal danger.\r\n\r\nAllow the law abiding people to protect them selves, let the people carry firearms.\r\n",
