        "action": "Implement Full Financial Compensation for  individuals serving Jury Duty",
        "additional_details": "It is said that it is a public duty to serve when called for jury duty.  If this is the case then why is it that an unfortunate minority are forced to foot the bill.  This can be a very expensive exercise for many.  If jury service is not to be voluntary, as it should be, then those who are forced to serve should not suffer financially as a result.  Full compensation should come from the public purse and the burden not be placed on the individual.  This is an infringement on civil liberties and quite frankly an outdated practice.\r\n Please sign this petition to show your support for a change in the law to provide those who serve the justice system with full financial compensation for loss of earnings.\r\n",
