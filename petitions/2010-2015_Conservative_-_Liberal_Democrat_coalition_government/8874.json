        "additional_details": "The conviction of anyone resident in Council or other Social Housing for a riot-linked offence should lead to ending of the tenancy for the housing and eviction without resettlement for a period of 5 years.  Similarly, the arrest in the vicinity of a riot of anyone resident in Council or other Social Housing should lead to loss of tenancy without resettlement.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Communities and Local Government should set up a parallel legal procedure to end tenancies for rioters under the age of criminal responsibility.\r\n\r\nArrest in the vicinity of a riotous assembly should be grounds for action.  The burden of proof would be on the individual to prove that they had a valid reason for their presence.  A defence (in case of arrest rather than conviction) should exist of being within 2 miles of their home.  Legal aid should not be available for any eviction-related proceedings.",
