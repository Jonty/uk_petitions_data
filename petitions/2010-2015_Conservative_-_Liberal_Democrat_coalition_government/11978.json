No benefits will be paid to any citizen who cannot provide evidence of positive contributions. 2) The unemployed have a duty to apply for at least two jobs every week. 3) All adult citizens capable of working have a duty to provide for themselves and their families and to only apply for benefits in emergency situations. 4) All citizens have a duty to learn English and integrate. 5) All immigrants have a duty to study British history and British culture to GCSE level. No benefits will be provided to any immigrant who lacks this qualification. 6) All children have a responsibility to respect teachers and adults who treat them with respect. 7) The courts have a duty to deport immigrants who fail in their responsibilities. It should be written into law that The Human Duties & Responsibilities Act trumps all EU law and all Human Rights law.",
