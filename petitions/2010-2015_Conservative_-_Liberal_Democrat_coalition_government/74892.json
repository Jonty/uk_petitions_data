        "additional_details": "Our hospitals are inundated with people needing treatment for self inflicted injuries and illnesses caused by abuse of substances such as alcohol and drugs. A&E departments are unable to cope under the pressures of rising abuse cases and hospital staff are abused whilst giving care to people causing harm to themselves.\r\n\r\nNot only is it a travesty that so many cases at A&E are related to this matter but the rise in numbers and costs for treatment of illnesses after immediate care are growing and a burden on the NHS.\r\n\r\nI believe that as a deterrent for numbers and to lower crippling costs put on the NHS through abuse cases, all abuse care should be charged so that funding can be bolstered for more urgent and critical care treatments at A&E and for after care.",
