        "additional_details": "Utility bills in the UK have soared. Many people can no longer afford to heat their homes during winter. Even the majority - middle income families - are finding it difficult to pay for what are basic needs. People are dying and something as basic as keeping our citizens warm should not be in the hands of companies that are only concerned with profits and dividends. The UK utility companies made PURE PROFITS of between \u00a33.8 billion and \u00a315 billion in 2011. I propose that it is time the UK utility companies were deprivatised and control returned directly to Government, who are responsible to the people. ",
