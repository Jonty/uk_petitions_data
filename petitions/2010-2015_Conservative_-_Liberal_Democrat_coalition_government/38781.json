        "additional_details": "After speaking with several parents we want to start a petition that we can use to show how many parents are fed up wih the constant misuse of parent and child spaces. There are plenty of spaces for people to use but on too many occasions they use these parent and child spaces, which are minimal, and they are never monitored. We are asking supermarkets to monitor these spaces, put signs up sayi they are for parents and under 5's and misuse will result in clamping and fees. This way parents can park safely and are able to get there young children out without a struggle. Please sign this petition and pass it on in the hope we can get some support from the supermarkets.",
