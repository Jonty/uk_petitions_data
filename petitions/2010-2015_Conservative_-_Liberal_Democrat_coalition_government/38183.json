        "additional_details": "My son, Alex, died in a head-on collision in November 2011. Dualling the A1 would help to prevent families, like mine, from losing loved ones. In the past year there have been two fatalities on the same stretch of road. This needs to stop. The present single carriageway is outdated for the volume of traffic of the present day. With the help of the Berwick Advertiser, I am urging the people of Northumberland and beyond to support my Project Alexander campaign by signing this petition to dual the A1 from Morpeth to Berwick. I need your support.\r\n",
