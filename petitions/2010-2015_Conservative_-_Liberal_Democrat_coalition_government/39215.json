Only occasional leave.\r\nSoldiers came under fire many times and had to risk lives to apprehend IRA Subjects.\r\n\r\nI believe that Soldiers serving  during those periods\r\nshould be recognised and receive the same Award.\r\n\r\nUp to this time no such award has been given.\r\n\r\nI urge the Government to grant to these Soldiers the\r\nrecognition they deserve\r\n",
