        "action": "Abolish VAT on Badged School Uniform.",
        "additional_details": "School uniform designed for those aged 14 and over is levied with the full 20% VAT even though it is compulsory for under 16s. This makes a difference of roughly \u00a33 on every school jumper purchased or around \u00a38 if your child wears a blazer.\r\nWhilst it can be argued that adults may buy the plain black trousers for work purposes there can be no such arguments made for badged or embroidered secondary school clothing.\r\nOne fifth of all the money you have spent on your 14 year olds school uniform is VAT.\r\nVAT is for non essential goods. Badged or embroidered school uniform has no other use than its compulsory one so surely VAT should not be applied to it. Please sign and circulate this petition as with enough signatures it will be raised for debate. ",
