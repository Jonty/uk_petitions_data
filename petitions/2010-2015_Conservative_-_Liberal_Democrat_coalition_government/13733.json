        "additional_details": "As a Council Leader Stephen Carr should set an example, he has failed to do that by his flouting of Health and Safety Law and then bragging about it. Section 7 of the HASAWA places an obligation on Mr. Carr to take reasonable care of his own safety. This is statute, he was told to wear a hard hat, he refused, he is in breach of the Act. He can not choose which laws he will obey and which ones he will not. This makes a mockery of the system. Stephen Carr should be in court for his negative attitude towards the law of the land. Rules are put in place and if authorities can\u2019t follow them what chance does anyone have in enforcing safety. ",
