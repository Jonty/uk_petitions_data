        "additional_details": "I am petitioning the Ministry of Justice to make an exception in law in the case of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby and permit the judge presiding over the trial to use capital punishment against those found guilty of this crime.\r\n\r\nThis is a truly barbaric crime, yet the criminal justice system is such that those convicted will be afforded the continued right of appeal over many years, prolonging the pain and suffering of the soldier's loved ones, friends, colleagues and those members of the public who witnessed the murder. Capital punishment in this case will provide absolute closure for everyone involved and is a proportionate punishment given the horrific circumstances of this crime.\r\n\r\nI do not advocate capital punishment but in this instance there are clear reasons to demonstrate that an exception should be made.",
