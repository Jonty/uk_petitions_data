        "additional_details": "The State Pension age for men and women must remain at 65 and 60 respectively. No current or future governments are to change that.\r\n\r\nIf people are living longer that does not change the fact that a 60 year old is still 60 years old - with all the hardships and weariness that come with age.\r\n\r\nWorking for 40 years is enough for anyone, but women and men are different. Women carry human life. This is not an equality issue (maybe an equality of misery issue).  We do not want our mothers, sisters, daughters and wives to be forced to work until they are older than 60 years old.\r\n\r\nThe people of this country will do what they can to help this country.  But we will not be forced to work until we drop. Birth, school, work, death.  There has got to be more to life than that.",
