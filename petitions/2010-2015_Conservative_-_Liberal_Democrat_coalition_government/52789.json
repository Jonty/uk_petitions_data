See a pattern? Yes, all male! On British Sport TV, even premium channels (e.g. Sky Sports, BT Sports, ESPN) hardly broadcast Women's Super League and Women's Internationals. This is obviously shows inequality in a supposedly 'equal' sport. My petiton will make more than 70% of women season & international matches broadcasted on British Television. Thank you.",
