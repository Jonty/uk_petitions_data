        "additional_details": "I am looking to identify the decision makers and consultants in this incident over ten years, terminating with the most senior government official.\r\n\r\nTo examine the mis-use of British and European legislation in terms of anti-racist and human rights in protecting the reputation of a muslim community at the expense of the lives of little white children.  This is in terms of murder and ruined lives and consequences.\r\n\r\nTo identify dereliction of duty through discrimination of white British children, neglect, child endangerment and the causing of harm by act or ommission or vicarious liability.  To ensure that this is not and will not occur in Britain again.\r\n\r\nTo prevent police and  social services from being directed to neglect their duty or to mis-interpret the law for ulterior or political motives.",
