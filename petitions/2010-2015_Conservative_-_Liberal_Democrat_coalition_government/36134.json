        "additional_details": "there needs to be strict guidelines brought in when it comes to the arrest of a minor who has adhd or asd disabilities. these children really struggle with the concept of being attacked by people/strangers and retaliate with a mechanism built in from birth. once a child is stressed an adrenaline is produced just like the rest of us and our natural instinct starts the fight or flight mechanism. however if the police approached these kids in a calm manner and spoke to them without grabbing them , im sure there would be a lot less of these poor children in our system with a conviction for assault of a police constable.\r\n\r\ni would like the government to bring in proper training for officers and specialised training in the handling of these children, not to bully them or use there uniform as a weapon.
