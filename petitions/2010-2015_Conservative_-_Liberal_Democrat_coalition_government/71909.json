        "additional_details": "I want to see the Government ban the practice of smoking at all types of bus shelters - both enclosed and open, in order to protect the health of non-smokers, and to prevent the spread of the 'smoking culture', which is reaching an increasing younger audience.\r\n\r\nAt all bus shelters, there is a large volume of people in a confined space. This means that if someone was to be smoking in or around the bus shelter, many people are affected. As a regular commuter to school everyday, I see, on average, someone smoking at a bus stop 17 out of the 25 times a week I am at a bus stop.\r\n\r\nAs recent reports suggest, smoking may be banned in public places, like parks, that have a large volume of people in a much larger area than a bus stop. If this is being currently considered, I cannot see how my point can be overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe Government should do its utmost to prevent the non-smoker suffering from the consequences of someone else's actions.
