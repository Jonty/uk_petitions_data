        "additional_details": "I propose that the government rethinks average speed check cameras as they can be dangerous due to 'speed watching'. I spend most of my time on the camera routes checking my speed rather than looking at the road in front and I think this is dangerous. Others I have spoken to think the same so therefore this petition",
