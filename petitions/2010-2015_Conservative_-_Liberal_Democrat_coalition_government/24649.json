        "additional_details": "    Currently, only a small group of men with certain pre- existing conditions can obtain the tablets  on a  NHS prescription, while the rest of men, the vast majority in fact, must obtain a private prescription and pay \u00a328 for just four tablets! Paying \u00a37 for a 'single use'  tablet is unacceptable. For many, this works out at over a \u00a3100/ month, more in some cases.\r\n\r\nWith the obvious long term impact this condition has on: family life, relationships break-ups and savings that could be made to the NHS with no doctor referrals  this  seems like  a win win situation  for everyone.\r\n\r\n   These tablets should be available in sufficient quantity and dose for all men who need them from time to time REGARDLESS of any pre-existing medical condition at  the  standard  prescription cost for one item.",
