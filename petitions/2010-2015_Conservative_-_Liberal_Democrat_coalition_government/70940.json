        "additional_details": "Currently it has been announced that Britain is sending a Trade Delegation to Zimbabwe, also that there is only a very childish travel ban which serves no financial purpose to the UK and will only serve to alienate trade with Britain.\r\nThe local embassy needs to be restaffed, currently only locals who were  anti government were employed and British employees were also anti government.\r\nClearly any trade delegation will fail and be a waste of funds as opposition contacts will unlikely be a source of business or have contact with government..\r\nThere is a need to open up the embassy to all businessmen British and local irrespective of their political affiliation, be apolitical, and conduct trade rather than economic sabotage.\r\n",
