        "additional_details": "In 2004 the age for cervical screening was raised from 20 to 25, since then too many young girls have been diagnosed with cervical cancer under the age of 25, sadly a lot of them have lost their battle and are no longer with us, a lot of them leaving children to grow up without a mummy. We want the goverment to start protecting our girls and lower the age back to 20.",
