Now out passport applications have to be sent via courier to a different country for renewal, this involves postal costs and as always a much higher fee for renewal that applications in the UK, a passport in the uk costs 90.54 GPB, an application from an expatriate costs 154.50 GBP as well as courier costs.  Keep the cost the same for UK and overseas applicants and allow applications via embassies again.",
