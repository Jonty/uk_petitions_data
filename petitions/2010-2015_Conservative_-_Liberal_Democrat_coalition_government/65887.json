        "additional_details": "More than 100,000 British Pashtoon originate from Pakistan and Afghanistan. Although they speak Pashto which is distinct from urdu and punjabi, they have to pick either punjabi or urdu on forms (census etc), they also have to refer to themselves as Pakistanis as there is no Pashto or Pashtoon option. Pashto is the most spoken language in Britain after English, and the Pashtoon people have been in Britain as long as other migrant groups from Pakistan (Kashmiri people) but still the government hasn't recognised the people or their language truly.",
