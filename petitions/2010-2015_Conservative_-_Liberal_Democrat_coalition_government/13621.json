If the Government was formed as a true coalition (all parties) then there could be no arguement. However is was not and is therefore an unconstitutional partnership rather than a coalition running the country. (Maybe)\r\nBoth parties involved have blatantly lied to the electorate and no longer even pretend to represent the issues that they campaigned for.\r\nTherefore I claim that this Government is illegal and unconstitutional and cannot be allowed to prevail.\r\n\r\n",
