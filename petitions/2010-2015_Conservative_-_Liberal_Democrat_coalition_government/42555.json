        "additional_details": "This petition is calling for members of the public to ask the government as to why the proposed rise in fuel duty was postponed in September so as to keep the level of inflation low in order to keep the new rate of pension payments low as the new rate is calculated in September.\r\nAlso this petition is asking the government why the energy companies waited until after September to increase their prices?\r\nBoth of the above situations have increased the annual rate of inflation well above the triple lock put in place by this government as we well know that high inflation in September does not sit well with the government.\r\n\r\nDavid McClements\r\n\r\nI am calling for the government to take the current situation into consideration and tell us pensioners what a fair and reasonable rise in our state pension will be for next year.",
