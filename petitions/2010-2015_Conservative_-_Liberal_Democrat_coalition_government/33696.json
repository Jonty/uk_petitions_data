If there was a more interesting selection of aircraft - military and/or vintage would suffice, along with the quieter passenger aircraft that are becoming available, then the expansion of airports would be a lot less troublesome.\r\nI therefore propose that 2 to 5 % of all air traffic on a route below 12,000 feet should be of more interesting aircraft. This can be at least partially funded by the airlines operating this route.",
