        "additional_details": "I am starting a petition for the government to help those working families find affordable housing. Whilst we struggle with high council tax bills, other who are unemployed profit from our hard work by receiving free housing.\r\nFor people who have to rent and can't afford to buy, there needs to be housing which is reserved for them.\r\nThis would enable the thousands of uk children who face moving every year as well as live under fulfilled and under nourished lives, to have more permanent housing and happier parents.\r\n\r\nAs it stands thousands of unemployed parents not only get to see their children everyday, but also don't face homelessness.\r\nToo many working parents are living on the edge and their children are suffering.",
