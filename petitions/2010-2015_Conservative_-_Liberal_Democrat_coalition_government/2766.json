Yet, the government has said the license will go on and on, rising faster than the rate of inflation and enforced by criminal sanctions against those who do not wish to pay it.\r\n\r\nWithout any discussion or consultation, the BBC itself claims there is no alternative.\r\n\r\nWhat Britain needs in the 21st century is a public broadcasting system that answers to viewers and listeners. Not a bloated BBC hooked on extracting money with menaces from every home in the land.\r\nThere are plenty of proven alternatives to the license fee; subscription, advertising, underwriting, sponsorship, public access, membership or combination of any of the above.\r\n\r\nWhy are we paying the fee in a digital age with more choice than ever, and very little by way of innovative shows coming from the BBC.",
