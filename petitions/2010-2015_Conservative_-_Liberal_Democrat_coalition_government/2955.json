        "additional_details": "In a civilised society, we have criminal laws to protect against ethic and sexuality discrimination. i.e. Racially or homophobic verbal abuse is a criminal offence. Therefore, why can not people who are registered disabled get the same protection. Verbal abuse to disadvantaged and vulnerable people creates depression, uselessness, more severely suicidal tendencies, and forces them to hide indoors and be sheltered when they are supposed to be welcome and treated like any normal person, therefore we petition the government to bring in new criminal laws to protect our precious vulnerable and disadvantaged people from discrimination.",
