        "additional_details": "A murderer killed 12 people in America on the 20th of July 2012, during a screening of Batman. He used a Glock model 22 handgun, manufactured in Europe.\r\n\r\nSomeone killed 32 people in Virginia Tech in 2007. He used a Glock and a Walther P22, another European gun.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, 11,493 people were murdered with guns in America. A huge proportion of those guns were made in the UK, Germany, and Austria.\r\n\r\nWe can't change American gun laws and we can't stop them from shooting each other. But we can stop them using our guns to do it. We can make the price of murder more dear.\r\n\r\nThe government should press for an EU-wide ban on the export of handguns to the United States.",
