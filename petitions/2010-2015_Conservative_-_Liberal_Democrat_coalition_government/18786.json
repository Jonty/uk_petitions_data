Grocery shops, small cafe, news agent , health food shops suffering not only due to decling sales but also government's policy such as  tax. How can you pay the same rate of tax with bigger companies who make millions profit and micro business who hardly get any profit after paying rent,rates and tax.\r\nGovernment need to give some incentives to these micor businesses and differentiate with small, medium and big businesses. There should be some government body who can support these micro businesses with skill training, financing etc. If government make better policy for these micro businesses many unemployed people can start self-employed business with their clever ideas.
