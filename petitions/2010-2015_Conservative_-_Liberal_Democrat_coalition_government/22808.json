Crude symbols are slowly becoming socially acceptable. Although this issue may seem insignificant and somewhat trifling, a political/social utopia can not develop without focus on the 'little things'. The English language is being used in an incorrect fashion, this problem has to be solved though punishment and education. In many peoples opinion it is this symbol and this symbol alone which is causing the systematic failings in the British education system. I do hope people take heed of this problem.\r\nPROTECT OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS, PROTECT OUR LANGUAGE. Please also note the symbol is offensive to people without tongues.",
