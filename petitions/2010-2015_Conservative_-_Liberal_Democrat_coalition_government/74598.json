        "additional_details": "The outline plans are to put a segregated lane down both sides of Green Lanes, a cycle highway from Enfield Town to the North Circular. Unless these plans are modified it will remove most of the parking for residents as well as the two high streets which form the centre of Palmers Green and Winchmore Hill. This will be a massive inconvenience for residents and could potentially be very damaging to already struggling businesses.",
