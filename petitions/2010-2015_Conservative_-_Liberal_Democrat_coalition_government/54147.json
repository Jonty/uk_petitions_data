        "additional_details": "My proposal is for the UK Government to introduce gender neutral gender markers for ID purposes for those who do not identify in the gender binary categories of male and female as an extension to the Gender Recognition Act of 2004. For example my suggestions for some markers would be GN for those who identify as gender neutral, GF for those who identify as gender fluid and so on. To prevent the abuse of these new gender markers, those wishing to attain these markers should be required to go through some sort of gender therapy to act as proof to the Gender Recognition Panel that they do not identify as  gender binary.\r\n\r\nI feel this legislation would provide better legal recognition and more legal protection to those who do not identify as gender binary within the UK.",
