        "additional_details": "Today's job market doesn't look likely to be getting any better if we do nothing. The government needs to do more to stimulate private sector growth if it is to reduce unemployment.\r\n\r\nThis petition suggests that an initiative be set up to provide help, guidance, advice, contacts and access to the resources required for an individual to set up his/her own business, or go freelance. Its members should work closely with individuals to get them onto the right track. The aim would be to help people who could/would set up a business but find the idea daunting or lack the knowledge required to get themselves started. This could help to stimulate growth in the private sector, and hence, create more jobs.",
