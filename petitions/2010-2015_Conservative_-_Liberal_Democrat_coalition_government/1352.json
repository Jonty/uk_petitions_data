        "additional_details": "Under the current system fathers are treated as second-class citizens.\r\n\r\nThe government should implement equal paternity leave for fathers and mothers. This will end the stereotype of mother as homemaker and father as breadwinner, and reduce employability differences between males and females.\r\n\r\nThe government should create the legal presumption of shared residence when parents separate. This will ensure both parents are treated equally regardless of gender.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition - you owe it to your children.",
