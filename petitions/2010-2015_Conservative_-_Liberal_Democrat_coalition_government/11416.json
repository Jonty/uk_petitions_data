        "additional_details": "to keep all children in the education system until they have attained standard grade level or higher.stopping holidays for those lagging behind so they can catch up ,no child leaves school until they have reache this level of education even if this means that they remain in school until early adulthood .penalties for parents who do not send their kids to school loss of benifits and or fines. i believe this will maximise potential for inward investment by having a well educated workforce in future years. also imagine the difference between an ill educated 16 year old school leaver compared with the same person leaving school at 18/19 with a higher standard of education.",
