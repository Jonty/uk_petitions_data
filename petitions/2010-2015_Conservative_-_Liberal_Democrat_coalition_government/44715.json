We want them to arrange a game of football, between England and Germany, in the Stade de France on Christmas Day 2014 - to commemorate the actions of the men in the battlefield who recognised that their 'enemies' were simply men like them, and that the true enemy were those who led their countries to war.\r\n\r\nLet sport unite!",
