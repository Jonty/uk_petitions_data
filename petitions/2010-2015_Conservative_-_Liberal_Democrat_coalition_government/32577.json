        "additional_details": "It can currently take 6 weeks + to get issued with a blue badge.  it also seems that depending on where in the country you live, depends on whether you can also be issued with a temporary blue badge.  I have recently broken my ankle and now have limited mobility for upto 6 months until it heals.  Therefore making it hard for me to do normal routine things like going shopping etc.  Why can't temporary badges be awarded based on assessments from the doctors.  I wouldn't mind paying for the badge for the period of time i would need it for, if it would make it easier for me to get around and live my life as normally as i can.  i am sure that i can't be alone in this! 6 weeks is also too long to wait for a blue badge.  It can't possibly take that long to process an application.",
