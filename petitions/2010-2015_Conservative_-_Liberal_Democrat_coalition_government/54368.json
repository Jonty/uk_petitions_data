        "additional_details": "Since Jade Goody died the government introduced the HPV vaccinnations for girls aged 13 years upto around 22 years. Therefore there is a 2 year gap of women that have had neither a HPV vaccination or a Smear Test.\r\nAs a result of the above I have unfortunately been diagnosed with incurable cervical cancer at the age of 25 - as I was one of these women in the middle who have had neither.\r\nI propose that the government give women between the ages of 22-25 the opportunity to have a smear test to prevent anyone else being in the same position as myself.
