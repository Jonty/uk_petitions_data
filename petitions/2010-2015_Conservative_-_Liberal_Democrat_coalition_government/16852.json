        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a review of UK contract law to make doing business easier and more predictable.\r\n\r\nWhile the UK is ranked the fourth easiest place in the world to do business by the World Bank; it is ranked 23rd by them for ability to enforce a contract.\r\n\r\nIt is far too easy for an unscrupulous trader to avoid contractual obligations using loopholes in arcane contract law. Many small businesses and start-ups which cannot afford expensive lawyers are relying on contracts which are not worth the paper they are printed on.\r\n\r\nOne simple improvement would be to change the law such that written contracts take precedence in the case of dispute.\r\n\r\nAn overall objective of such a review would be to simplify contract law in such a manner as to create an environment where justice prevails over legal technicalities.\r\n\r\nA test of success would be increased numbers of businesses surviving because they are paid and a reduction in stories of businesses being \u2018legally defrauded\u2019.\r\n",
