It is an ever-present force in advertising and television programmes but research has shown that nobody actually listens to this 'music' for pleasure.\r\n\r\nClearly The Dubstep has been created by The Corporations to bludgeon our brains into mush so we buy their laptops and mobile telephones and laserdiscs.\r\n\r\nI propose that The Dubstep is a dangerous entity when our economy is so fragile and incomes are so low and as such should be banned until such time as our economy rights itself, not unlike an upturned tortoise.",
