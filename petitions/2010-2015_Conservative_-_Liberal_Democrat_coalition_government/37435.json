While I accept that a charge should be made if the account goes overdrawn, if the D/D is less than the non-payment fee the D/D should be paid and the appropriate over overdraft fee charged. If the D/D is more than \u00a315.00 the D/D should not be paid but the charge should be limited to the amount by which the account would be overdrawn had the D/D been paid. i.e. Should a D/D be for \u00a325.00 but there is only \u00a320.00 in the account, a fee of \u00a35.00 should be charged.",
