        "additional_details": "This is a petition to call for the government to prevent state-funded faith schools using a child\u2019s religion (or lack of religion) to discriminate against that child when allocating school places.  Additionally, it is to call for balanced, realistic and un-biased teaching of all religions in these schools rather than teaching that specific religion as fact.  -----\r\nMany state primary schools are affiliated with local churches and, as such, priority is given to children whose parents attend a specific church when assigning places in the school.  This is nothing but discrimination and should be outlawed.  -----\r\nWe believe that any privately run school should have the right to discriminate based on faith but we believe that in a fair and free society, religion or lack of religion should not be used by the state to discriminate against individuals, especially children.
