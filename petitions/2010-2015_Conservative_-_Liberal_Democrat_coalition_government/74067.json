        "additional_details": "We believe students with full time school education do not deserve to be doing homework after a long and highly exhausting day at school. Homework causes stress amongst many families. Many teenagers with homework become stressed and some even lead to mental health problems (ie depression and other anxiety and tiredness related illnesses). We know a group of students who have suffered with lack of sleep due to worrying about not doing the homework properly and therefore getting a detention or other sanction. Homework should be optional and students should be rewarded if they ask for homework regularly and complete it with effort.",
