I watched in horror an advert for Maybelene Mascara which involved tiger cubs being cuddled by a model and treated as play things. Isn't animal testing by the cosmetic industry banned? There is no need for these type of adverts, Maybelene is not the only one there is Hallmark cards using elephants (which I suspect is done via CGI) and Vanish also using a ritual elephant. In this day and age I feel we should not allow this to continue. ",
