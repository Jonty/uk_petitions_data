        "additional_details": "Since the start of school leagues the standard of education received by English pupils has declined, whilst the shortage in quality teachers has increased, sciences and maths being taught by people who at best have nothing higher than a GCSE.\r\nSchools climb the tables by cheating (perversely, these schools are richly rewarded by the government), the fun and academic rigour of subjects has been removed, with pupils spending up to 3 months on intense revision before their finals.\r\nHeads and HoDs discourage teachers from expanding beyond what will be in the exam, ignoring difficult topics only worth a few percent in the final test, while forcing pupils to take worthless GCSEs/A-Levels to boost league points, leading to a decline in English pupils taking challenging subjects at school or university.\r\nLeague tables should be removed and teachers allowed to teach, the government refuses to see the brain drain to countries without league tables, where teaching is valued as a vocation.",
