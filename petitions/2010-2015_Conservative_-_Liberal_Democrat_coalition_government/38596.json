Their student visas should expire on the month they graduated. Foreign students are expected to pass their exams after serious high academic work. The academic institution teaching foreign students on student visas should give annual reports confirming good attendance & progress of all foreign students, as one of the requirements of student visas. e-ID cards & IT systems should be introduced to track foreign immigrants on visas  (like employment, education, NHS treatment, DWP claims, marriage) to ensure that they keep to the conditions of their visas.
