        "additional_details": "The Govt introduced 24 hr licensing in the belief there would be a cultural change in drinking habits and an improvement in the economy. Since doing this the late license has passed the initiative to the supermarkets. People still binge drink on a weekend and start drinking at 8pm, however now they are consuming large amounts of cheap alcohol from the supermarkets and then descending on town centers at midnight or later. These drinkers are already drunk. They spend little in the late economy but cause greater costs ie security and staffing. Police used to be aware of mass exits from pubs at 11pm and clubs at 2am, now they are having to police into the early hours. The 24 hour licensing benefits supermarkets and alcoholics - nobody else! If you are not able to consume enough alcohol before 2am, then there is a problem. I have worked in this industry for many years and see it dying because of these reasons. Save Our Pubs. Please return to 11pm close for Pubs and 2am Clubs. ",
