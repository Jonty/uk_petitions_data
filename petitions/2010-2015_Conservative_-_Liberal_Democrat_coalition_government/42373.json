I passionately feel the asylum seeker aren't being treated with respect and aren't getting the basic human rights that they deserve. when they come to this country for asylum, it is a last resort for safety through their welfare being at risk from their own country. asylum seeker treatment has become so bad that in a growing percentage of asylum seekers wished they had never left their war-torn or politically coruppt country. the government should be taking this as a big warning sign and yet they still choose to ignore the suffering that these people are under.",
