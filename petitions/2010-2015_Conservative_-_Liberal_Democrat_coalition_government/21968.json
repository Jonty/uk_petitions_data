        "action": "A rethink of land use around motorways.",
        "additional_details": "In recent years various parts of the motorway network have been seriously affected by events which take place in close proximity to it. A large scrapyard fire in April 2011 closed a part of the M1 motorway causing major disruption. A recent crash on the M5 could have been caused by a nearby fireworks display.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that we need to re-evaluate the use of land around high speed transport links in order to ensure that activities undertaken on that land do not endanger the road users and that our economy does not suffer due to incidents that cause disruption.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition is to spark debate on how to regulate the use of land around motorways. Possible solutions could be to change the planning laws to create a new kind of land use for land close to infrastructure...\r\n\r\nSupport my petition to re-think how we use the land around our high speed roads.",
