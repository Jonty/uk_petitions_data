Every day we hear about YET ANOTHER member of the House of Lords who has been involved in something which proves that he or she is not a proper person to be in the House of Lords, in any capacity, yet we cannot remove them.  Times are changing Mr Cameron, it is time the archaic system of patronage in this country was changed so that criminals who occupy seats in the House of Lords can be held to account for the activity and removed.  If the most powerful man in the most powerful country on the planet, the President of the USA, can be taken down then who are those who have NEVER been elected to the House of Lords to be able to cock a snook at rules and regulations and standards of behaviour which they violate routinely with impunity.",
