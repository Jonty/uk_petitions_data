        "additional_details": "Little is known about the true effects that grey squirrels are having on other wildlife, and quoting DEFRA they do no more damage than any other rodent. The red squirrel was considered vermin and culled readily before the arrival of grey squirrels, and were already in decline due to both this culling and also habitat destruction.\r\nThe threat of squirrelpox on reds is clear and indisputable, however as a disease it is potentially treatable given better funding and a shift of interests.\r\nIt is our solemn conviction that killing these creatures without a real, thorough exploration of the viability of vaccinations or contraception is nothing more than sport wrapped in a veil of false duty.\r\nWe urge DEFRA to freeze cull plans nationwide in favour of data gathering, non-lethal control solutions and the isolation and protection of red squirrel populations.
