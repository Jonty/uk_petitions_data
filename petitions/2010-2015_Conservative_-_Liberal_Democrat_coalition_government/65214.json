        "action": "Abolish the Lake District National Park Authority",
        "additional_details": "The Lake District is one of the UK's most popular National Park, but it is also a living and working community. Unfortunately, an unelected body the Lake District National Park Authority manages its affairs. \u2028Their management of the Park is not carried out with the welfare of long-time Park residents in mind, rather with the requirements of big business and their own personal likes and views. Certain members have shown clear bias against businesses that support the local community and could increase jobs and there has been discrimination against law abiding residents just because they ride motorbikes. \u2028I would like to see the Authority abolished and replaced with a body that is accountable to local people.",
