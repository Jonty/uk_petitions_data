        "additional_details": "Over the past 30 years the people of Cornwall have witnessed a destruction of everything that makes our Duchy unique:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tOverdevelopment of towns and villages\r\n\u2022\tMassive solar farms\r\n\u2022\tWind turbines\r\n\u2022\tSecond Homes\r\n\r\nNone of which has truly benefitted the people of Cornwall, apart from short term employment in the construction trade and now we are at a tipping point, where the uniqueness of our Duchy could be lost under concrete and housing developments.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on Cornwall Council to withdraw the plans for 47,500 new homes and to re-evaluate the needs of Cornwall.\r\n\r\nWe need jobs, we need infrastructure and we need our communities to thrive.  These current proposals do not serve us \u2013 They merely pander to out of Duchy developers and investors.\r\n\r\nTime for us to take Cornwall back for the Cornish!\r\n",
