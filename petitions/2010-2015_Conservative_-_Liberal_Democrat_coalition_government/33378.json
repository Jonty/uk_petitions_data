        "additional_details": "Many fathers have exes who claim csa payments from them, but make it unreasonably difficult and expensive to see their children, but who maintain that they struggle financially. However, the mothers still get child benefit and child tax credits and csa for those children, even when those children are with the father. MAKE THE SYSTEM FAIR. Today's world seems to be intent on making mothers rich, and seeing fathers in the gutter. Fathers want to provide for their children when their children are actually with them, but the system means fathers provide for the children while they are with their mothers, but cannot afford anything while the children are with them.",
