This would bring the process of adoption in line with maternity rights as maternity appointments are currently granted to individuals without need to use annual leave whereas adoption meetings are not and individuals going through the adoption process are required to use annual leave and negotiate this with their employer which I feel is an unfair stress on those beginning the journey of adoption.
