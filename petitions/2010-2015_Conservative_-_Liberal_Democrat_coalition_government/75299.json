The work programme does not help people get jobs they consists of sending  the unemployed to apply for jobs at a slow computer which could be done at home. The job centre do make sure that the un employed do this anyway. It is a big waste of tax payers money. Please search this company on the internet and make you own opinion. Unfortunately they are funded by the goverment and can treat people in anyway they see fit ( they treat people badly) They have been in trouble before for making people work for 6 months no pay and the unemployed that they find more difficult to place eg single mothers, fathers and the disabled they dont help to get back in employment, the staff are not effitant. Please help the unemployed get back in employment in a more efficient way and sign.\r\nThank you.",
