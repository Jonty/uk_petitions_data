What I do not agree with is the fact that some employees offer and advertise a job with a set wage for different ages. If everybody is doing the same job then why should somebody be on a higher wage due to their age? This to me has all ways been a strong subject and I believe the government should create a law which makes all employees responsible for advertising a job as a set hourly wage and not a different wage for different ages!
