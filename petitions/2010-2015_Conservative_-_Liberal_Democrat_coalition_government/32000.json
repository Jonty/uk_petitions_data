        "additional_details": "The Raspberry Pi foundation (UK charity number 1129409), has produced a fully-featured computer in order to teach computer programming.\r\n\r\nThis low cost (\u00a321) computer is the spiritual successor to the BBC micro computers of the 80s that kickstarted the current workforce's computing abilities. Britain needs to re-discover its computing talent to keep us at the forefront of intellectual property development.\r\n\r\nThere are approx. 2.8m schoolchildren of age 11 to 15 that could be provided with their own RaspberryPi computer to learn computing, both independantly and as part of the school curriculum. This would equate to a yearly cost of around \u00a310m.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe request that the Minister consider purchasing a Raspberry Pi computer for every schoolchild of relevant age to ensure Britain's strong tradition of independant computing and software development is not lost to future generations.",
