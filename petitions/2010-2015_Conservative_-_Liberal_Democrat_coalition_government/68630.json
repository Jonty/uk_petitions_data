The cost per mile is already excessive, so this additional 'standing charge' is a rip-off and is a taxi tax.  If you enter a supermarket, and spend \u00a320 on food, you do not expect to pay an additional charge (of \u00a33.60 plus), just because you have entered the shop.\r\n\r\nBan the standing charge in taxis.  Ban the taxi tax.  Fair fees for fares.",
