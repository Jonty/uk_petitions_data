        "action": "Remove the VAT on all British made motorcycles.",
        "additional_details": "Making all motorcycles built in the UK VAT free would boost the British Economy, make transport more affordable for consumers, and at the same time help to support and protect our struggling manufacturing industry. The amount of new bikes that would be sold would surely make up for any shortfall in VAT earnings. More investment, more jobs and ultimately more tax revenue would inevitably follow the implementation of this bold scheme. It would also help to ease congestion on Britain's roads: More bikes means less traffic jams. This would save the government yet more money, which would otherwise have to be spent on costly infrastructure projects. On top of all this, the increased number of bikes on Britain's roads would lead other motorists to become more bike-aware, reducing the percentage of accidents involving bikes and unsuspecting car drivers.\r\n\r\nWe hereby call on the government to exempt all British made motorcycles from Value Added Tax.",
