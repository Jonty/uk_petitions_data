        "additional_details": "At present, the Animal Welfare Act only makes it an offence to to give away an animal as a prize if the person can reasonably be believed to be under 16 and is not accompanied by an adult (there are some exceptions in sections 11(3)-(6) of the Act).\r\n\r\nThis is not the case in Scotland, where under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006, it is an offence to offer or give an animal to another person as a prize (whatever their age), except where it is offered in a family context.\r\n\r\nThe situation in England and Wales is not enough. It does not stop fish or other pets being kept in unsuitable conditions by fairgrounds and then being given away as prizes to unsuitable owners.\r\n\r\nThe law in England and Wales should be made stricter, and brought in line with that of Scotland on this issue.",
