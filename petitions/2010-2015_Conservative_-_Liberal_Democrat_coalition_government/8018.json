        "additional_details": "The riots in London this week are yet another example of the lack of deterrents out there to stop people committing crimes. The worst any of these thugs will get will be 6 months in jail or a community sentence. And to be honest, prison\u2019s with fully kitted out gym\u2019s, playstation areas etc are not a real deterrent.\r\nI\u2019m not in favour of capital punishment for the more serious crimes as mistakes can be made, but as soon as someone is convicted of a crime they should face harsher punishments and any human rights should be revoked automatically. If they can\u2019t respect someone else\u2019s human rights why should they get any?\r\nStart by removing any luxuries from the prison\u2019s, the convicts are there to serve a punishment, not use it as a hotel. Create schemes where the convicts are set to work either within the prison or the old fashioned \u201croad gangs\u201d. That way, they can pay for their keep as learning a working ethic.\r\n\r\n",
