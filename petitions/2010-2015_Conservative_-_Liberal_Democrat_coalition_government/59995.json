Far too many of our historical buildings have been turned into corporate money spinners, with no consideration for the local people!\r\nFor over a 144 years The Anstice has served the working men and women of Madeley!  Pantomimes, Sunday school productions, choir performances, wedding receptions, British legion meetings, the boxing club meets, not to mention the history of its dances with one of the best sprung wooden floors in the West Midlands.  The Anstice is steeped in history and memories lets not lose this vital part of our community, let's fight for our heritage and join together as our ancestors did in the memory of the local icon that was John Anstice.
