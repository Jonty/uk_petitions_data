        "additional_details": "Due to the threat of undesirable characters and very recently 2 girls being 'flashed ' while using this cut through (this not being the first time something of this nature has been reported )\r\nWe have approached the local MP regarding having lights along this footpath . At the moment there is no lighting along there apart from a street light at the top end . The more signatures we can get the better and we hope you will support us . This will not only benefit the community but more importantly this jitty runs along side a school and we feel\r\nas parents that the children should be in a safe well lit area walking home . Thanks for taking the time x",
