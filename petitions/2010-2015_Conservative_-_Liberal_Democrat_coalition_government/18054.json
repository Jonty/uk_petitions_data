        "additional_details": "This petition is to ask for the antiquated flight paths which currently disrupt late nights in the village of Burnham to be shifted over local unpopulated farmland. The change is almost insignificant but would have a positive impact on the lives of 100's of families currently having to suffer the incessant roar of aircraft engines as late as midnight, practically every night",
