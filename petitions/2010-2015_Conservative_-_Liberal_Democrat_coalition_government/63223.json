        "action": "Don't Raise the Court Fees for Divorce",
        "additional_details": "The Ministry of Justice has recently proposed that the fee payable to the court (which is separate to any other fees that an individuals may be required to pay to solicitors, online providers etc.) rise from \u00a3410 to \u00a3750.\r\n\r\nI believe that this will prevent many people from accessing this service and will place families, already facing a testing time due to separation, under even greater duress.\r\n\r\nI accept that it is reasonable to encourage people to try and resolve their differences and remain married whenever possible but, as an individual that works within this field and that has spoken with thousands of people that are going through the process, I have not yet encountered someone that did not take reasonable steps to try and save their marriage and that did not take their decision to divorce very, very seriously.\r\n\r\nRaising this fee will, in my opinion, be harmful and the relevant proposals should be dropped immediately.",
