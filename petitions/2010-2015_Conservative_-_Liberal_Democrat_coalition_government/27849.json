The spaces that are available are few and far between, and yet some feel that they are of higher importance than those who the spaces are intended for. Being overweight, lazy or having kids is not a reason to use a disabled space...disabled people have no choice unlike the idiots that can't be bothered to walk an extra 10 feet, when they plan to wander around a supermarket anyway! My mum, like all disable people, has little or no choice in where she parks...wheelchairs need space when loading and unloading from a car...people who have walking difficulties need to be closer to shop fronts than able bodied people...it's just common sense, unless your thick! So, can we stop being selfish and just think before we park?",
