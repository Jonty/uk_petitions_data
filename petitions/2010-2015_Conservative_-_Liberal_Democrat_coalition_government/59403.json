        "additional_details": "The Chief Executive of my local hospital in York was last year awarded a pay rise of \u00a330000, taking his salary too \u00a3190000, approximately \u00a350000 more than the PM is paid for running the country. York NHS is in debt, A & E waiting times are far worse than the national average and yet he gets a pay increase of nearly 20%. In this time of austerity where we're all supposed to be in it together to save money, this is simply astounding. I emailed the Department of Health who stated as York is a Foundation Trust it can set its senior executive pay itself despite being advised to adopt the national 1% pay increase for the whole NHS. I cannot believe my taxes go on increasing someone's salary who in my opinion already earns sufficiently enough, when patient care is deteriorating so badly due to a shortage of front line staff.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to limit senior civil service executive pay to no more than the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThank-you.",
