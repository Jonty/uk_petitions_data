The actual evidence should also be presented and not just a skewed summary.\r\n\r\nThe idea that intelligent design can not be taught is not sensible as good science should look at the evidence first and then infer a theory and not the other way round.\r\n\r\nHow are children to learn about good science if they are not allowed to look at all the options?",
