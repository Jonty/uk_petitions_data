        "additional_details": "Currently, it is illegal for cyclists to cycle on pavements - it is suggested that it is dangerous to pedestrians and cyclists can be fined for it. Arguably, however, it is far more dangerous for pedestrians to walk in cycle lanes, both for the pedestrian and the cyclist. There is currently no law against this, no fine and no deterrent. This is clearly not only unfair, but dangerous and impacts the lives of everyone.",
