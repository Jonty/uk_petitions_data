        "additional_details": "I am petitioning to have the train and tube times be extended past the normal 11/12am curfew.\r\n\r\nFor many people who require public transport late into the evening, it is a major inconvenience to have to consider alternative travel arrangements after the trains stop running. It costs British tax payers extortionate amounts in taxi fares, and encourages car use, which altogether is bad for both the environment and the bank balance. It also risks leaving vulrnerable people stranded in areas they are unfamiliar with.\r\n\r\nHaving the trains run later would encourage so many more people to use them, and would allow people to attend later shows/events without worrying about travel.",
