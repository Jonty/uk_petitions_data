        "additional_details": "Yes English is spoken all over the world, but it is important to know at least 1 other language at fluency level for children of today.  They are much more likely than other generations to find work anywhere in the world and to be able to speak a second language (probably French, Spanish or Mandarin)  will be a huge advantage for them in applying for and securing careers abroad. Small children absorb information naturally without thinking about it and if language was taught right from age 4 when children started school, they would practically be fluent by the time they started secondary school.  Age 11, for many children, is too late and they find it difficult to grasp the complexities of foreign grammar.   Some primary schools do offer maybe French or Spanish lessons but these are on a voluntary and after-school basis.  We are callling for language lessons to be made mandatory and to become part of compulsory primary curriculum.",
