        "additional_details": "I propose a new voting system in which MPs are awarded varying 'voting points\u2019. The system rewards MPs for having a large proportion of their constituency's vote as well as for representing more people. A grossly oversimplified example follows. (Assume that a country consists of only Constituencies X and Y.)\r\n\r\nConstituency X:\r\nParty A receives 54% of the vote, Party B receives 46%.\r\nParty A's MP wins and represents 120 people (pop. of Constituency A).\r\n\r\nConstituency Y:\r\nParty A receives 20% of the vote, Party B receives 80%.\r\nParty B's MP wins and represents 80 people (pop. of Constituency B).\r\n\r\nVOTING POINTS:\r\nCalculated by multiplying percentage of vote in an MP's constituency by the proportion of the entire population that they represent;\r\n\r\nX: 0.54*(120/200) = 0.324 voting points for MP A.\r\nY: 0.80*(80/200)   = 0.320 voting points for MP B.\r\n\r\nMP A has (slightly) more of a say in the House of Commons. We must get away from the idea that 1 person should always equal 1 vote.\r\n",
