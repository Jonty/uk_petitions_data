The Landscape Character Assessment of 2009 recognised the special quality of the Teign Estuary and it's 'enclosing slopes' and adopted an overall strategy for it's conservation and enhancement. This 'Assessment' also noted the estuary's sensitivity to new development on the fringes of the urban areas! The site in question is visually part of the Teign Estuary which is why the Council strove to protect it from development for so many years. Nothing adverse has happened to this site which would warrant abandonment of  previous policies. ",
