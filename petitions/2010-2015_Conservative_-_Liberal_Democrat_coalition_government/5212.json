        "action": "Devolve control of Welsh energy resources to Welsh Government.",
        "additional_details": "Wales produces a disproportionate amount of natural water resources used in the UK, yet derives no fiscal benefits from the diversion of the resource beyond the national boundaries. Parliamentary debate should be encouraged on the topic of devolving control over energy sources such as water and wind, to the respective national governments, whereby those Governments (while the title indicates a Welsh specific issue, it would be appropriate for similar measures to be taken with energy produced in Scotland, as well as those generated from within England as well) will be able to control the sale and distribution of such resources, to other parts of the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe intention of these proposals would not be to give devolved Governments the leverage to hold other regions to ransom, but to better control the revenue streams and job opportunities afforded by such access to naturally occurring resources.\r\n",
