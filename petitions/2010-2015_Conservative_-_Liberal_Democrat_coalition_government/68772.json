If this is not done and a customer has an allergic or anaphylactic reaction, the restaurant/manufacturer/employee can be charged with manslaughter and forced to cease trading if an allergen is not listed in the menu, website or ingredients list and an allergy sufferer dies from anaphylaxis after consuming the product.",
