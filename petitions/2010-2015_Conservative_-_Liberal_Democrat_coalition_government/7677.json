These riots would not have happened if ordinary police officers commanded greater respect and were able to not only protect society, but defend themselves and other members of the emergency services in the legitimate delivery of their duty.  Frankly we would not have a situation where people find it acceptable to spit in the face of police officers if each one had a firearm strapped to their leg, let alone riot in such a manner.",
