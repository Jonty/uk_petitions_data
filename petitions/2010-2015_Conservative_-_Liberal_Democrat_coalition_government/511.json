HMRC is failing to SERVE the public and is continuing to ABUSE the public it is supposed to be serving.  The Ombudsman is upholding increasing numbers of complaints against this failed department.  However, the thousands of complaints not upheld are a more serious and sinister concern.  The Ombudsman does not judge complaints against ordinary standards of decency and justice, but against HMRC's own codes of practice.  Urgent reform is required.",
