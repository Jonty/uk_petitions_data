This vaccination was designed for children in years 8-13 at school, but now there is no funding, children are being turned away and told they can not have the immunisation.  Not all parents can afford the cost of \u00a3400 for the course of immunisations, and the Department of Health should put the future of the country first.  Prevention not cure.",
