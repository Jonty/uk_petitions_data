        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the Government to reject the Appeal by Goodman Logistics Development (UK) Ltd to build a Strategic Rail Freight Interchange (SIFE) at Colnbrook, Slough.\r\n\r\nThe Strategic Gap at Colnbrook is the most threatened part of the entire Metropolitan Green Belt, having already been massively eroded in recent years by urban sprawl and projects including Heathrow Terminal 5.\r\n\r\nIn its current form the proposed scheme makes such limited use of rail to make it impossible to justify the loss of 183 acres of open countryside; it is primarily a road-to-road facility masquerading as a \"green\" initiative in an area already blighted by empty warehousing.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Secretary of State to throw out the Appeal when it lands on his desk.",
