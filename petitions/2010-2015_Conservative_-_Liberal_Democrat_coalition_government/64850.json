        "additional_details": "Prevent cuts and secure long term funding for Crossroads Training Services for Carers, which is currently under threat of closure on 30th June 2014.\r\n\r\nCrossroads Training Services focuses on prevention, supporting the person with care needs to be cared for at home avoiding carer breakdown due to carer injury and the risk of admission into hospital or residential care.\r\nWe give Carers the knowledge and skills to move and transfer the person with care needs in a safe and appropriate manner helping to reduce the risk of injury to both parties. Carers self-report they feel more confident and have the knowledge and understanding around moving and transferring the person for whom they care, This moves them forward in a positive way and helps reduce the need for intervention of other services i.e. Occupational Therapy, District Nurses, Social Worker, Care Agencies, Hospital Admission or a person going into care, On average we work with 640 new Carers each year.",
