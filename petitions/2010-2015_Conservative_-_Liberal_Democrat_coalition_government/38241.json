        "additional_details": "Cheshire East Council has failed its tax payers because of its incompetence, profligate waste and inability to punish the perpetrators. The unitary authority must be dissolved as soon as possible and replaced by the pre-2009 county and borough councils. The public referendum that preceded the enforced 2009 reorganisation voted in favour of no change, with a single unitary council for Cheshire as the second preferred option. The option of splitting the council in two was not popular with the public, but was forced in by the then government, and for us in Cheshire East has proved disastrous. This wrong must now be righted!",
