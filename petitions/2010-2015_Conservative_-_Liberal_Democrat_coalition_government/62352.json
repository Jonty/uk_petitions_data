The people should have the legal right to see EVERYTHING passed to a government minister in the performance of his job.  If Mr Grieve wishes to keep these letters secret then he should be invited to pay the legal costs out of his own pocket - and WITHOUT the opportunity to reclaim them through the MPs Expenses Scam.",
