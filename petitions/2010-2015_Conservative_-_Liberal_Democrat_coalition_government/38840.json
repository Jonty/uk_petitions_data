I feel that this P.R should be conditional.\r\n\r\nIf over a prolonged period of time EITHER of the parents shirks their responsibility, the responsible parent should then have the right, and support, to take the irresponsible parent to court.\r\n\r\nIf evidence can be produced showing that the irresponsible parent has not engaged with the child's school, G.P, consultants or other care givers then the courts should then have the power to give the responsible parent 100% P.R.\r\n\r\nI feel it is important for children to have contact with both parents and in NO WAY should the above have any effect on any contact arrangements in place.\r\n\r\nBUT, I feel that it is not right, or beneficial to the child in question, for a parent to be able to make important decisions about education, extra support and medical treatment if they have not taken any interest in these areas.\r\n\r\n",
