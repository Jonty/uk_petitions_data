        "additional_details": "I urge the government to change the law banning specific breeds from being owned in the UK.\r\nMy own personal opinion, matching that of the majority of professionals in this field including Vets, Police Officers etc is that a dogs behaviour is not based on its breed, but the upbringing of the dog by its owner/owners.\r\nI believe that more should be done to protect the public from dangerous dogs, but that any dog can be dangerous if it is trained to be that way. I propose that all dog owners be licensed/registered and their dogs be regularly checked by professionals, not only for aggressive behaviour, but for ill-treatment and improper care by the owner. Please sign this petition if you wish to end Breed Specific Laws in the this country (UK), Thanks!",
