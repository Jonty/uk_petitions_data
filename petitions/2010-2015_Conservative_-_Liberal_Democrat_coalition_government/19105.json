What is the point in harassing airline crew, confiscating their drinks, toothpaste and deodorant, when each and every one of them could bring down an aircraft with their bare hands if they had the desire.\r\n\r\nIt is humiliating for staff, it is frustrating and it is completely pointless.  Stop this nonsense!",
