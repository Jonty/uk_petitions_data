        "additional_details": "Mr Mohammed Rizwan who is a resident of Oldam is opening a funeral business on a main arterial road into Bradford where there will be hundreds of people outside and hundreds of parked cars. This road is also one of the main ambulance routes into Bradford. The application for planning has been applied for 3 times, the 1st time it was rejected due to public uproar, the 2nd time it was withdrawn and now the 3rd time somehow it has been granted! We require as many signatures as possible so we can have the decision overturned and save lives! We need to act now before its too late.",
