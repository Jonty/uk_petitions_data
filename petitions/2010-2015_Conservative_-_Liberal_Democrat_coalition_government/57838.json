        "additional_details": "This petition is for the UK government to review the medical standpoint and policies of UK hospitals in order to ensure patient and family member satisfaction, comfort and well being is kept in mind during medical procedures.\r\n\r\n-Research into Family Presence has demonstrated multiple benefits for the patient, family and health care team. These advantages include helping the family to understand the severity of the illness/trauma/procedure and to see that appropriate attempts were undertaken to save/help their loved one\r\n\r\n-Family Presence can also improve communication between the health care team and family. In spite of evidence supporting Family Presence as a useful practice for patient, family and health care team, the use of Family Presence is uncommon within UK hospitals.\r\n\r\n-It is unfair family members have to deal with the emotional and physical aspects of a patient 90% of the time only to have a surgery disallow participation during actual procedures",
