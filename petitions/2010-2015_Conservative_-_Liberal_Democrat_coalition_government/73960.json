        "additional_details": "We petition the UK Government, itself, to enable equal offer of involvement to the leaders of the Green Party and the Scottish Independence Party in any General Election debates involving other Party leaders which are broadcast UK-wide using any broadcast medium.\r\n\r\nTheir involvement is necessary to ensure democratic balance. The Magna Carta, the Declaration of Arbroath and the Act of Union clearly demonstrate that ultimate power lies in Our, the Peoples', hands. You, the Government, have been lent democratic power and entrusted to care for and guard the democratic process across the Union. The latter\r\nis a fundamental governmental duty within any democracy - regardless of Party flavor. If you do not do that then you act in tyranny over Us.",
