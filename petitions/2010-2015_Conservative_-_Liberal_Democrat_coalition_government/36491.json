This petition asks members to consider the known positive benefits to children when both mothers and fathers are positively and substantially involved in the parenting of their children. Equal rights means being treated equally, under today\u2019s family court rulings mothers get everything they want and the father has to put up with this.Ensure all fathers have guaranteed access to their children, substantial penalties for non compliant mothers.\r\nThe govenment\\courts need to change their attitude towards fathers and recognise their automatic rights, and force the courts to take action automatically where those rights are breached.\r\n",
