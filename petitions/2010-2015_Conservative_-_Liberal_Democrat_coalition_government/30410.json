The current alternatives are the creation of a \"senate\" with publicly elected members on a longer term span and larger constituencies than the Commons, or the house's complete abolition. I say, for the valuable time the government could be debating other topics -- to do with the economy, education, benefits, immigration, etc. (things of importance to the public) -- spent fruitlessly debating the cosmetics of HM Government.\r\n\r\nAre the elected so removed from matters of state interest, they debate the fa\u00e7ade of parliament?\r\n\r\nI call upon the parliament to remove House of Lords reform from their listings and not to bring it up until such time we have a stable economy and a living standard (on the HDMI) comparable to that of Luxembourg.
