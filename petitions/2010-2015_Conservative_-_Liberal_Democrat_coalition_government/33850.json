        "additional_details": "We ask that the government review the current legislation and issue guidance to police forces on the exemption  for  vehicles carrying out the transfer of organs for transplant.\r\n\r\nEmergency services personnel routinely are asked in the course of their duties to transfer organs for transplant between hospitals. The law regarding the use of Blue Light exemptions seems to be enforced differently by police forces across the UK.  Resulting in a number of people being prosecuted.\r\nSome transfers require the driver to travel across different police forces, the interruption of the legislation may be different in each area.\r\nGuidance  issued to all police forces in the UK in plain English will remove the misunderstanding  and will also inform ambulance services or organ transplant units of the correct status of the journey.\r\n",
