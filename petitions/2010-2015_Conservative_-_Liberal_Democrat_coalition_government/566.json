As such a giant change it should be fair and equal for the whole of the U.K.\r\n\r\nHowever this is untrue.While the Welsh turn to Cardiff, the Irish to Belfast and the Sottish to Holyrood the English have been forgotten. It is now the only home country in the U.K. to have its own policies and laws decided by others.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of fairness and equality I strongly request that this is brought to the parliament's attention and resolved either by only allowing English MPs to vote on English matters in the House of Commons or creating a separate home for a English Parliament.
