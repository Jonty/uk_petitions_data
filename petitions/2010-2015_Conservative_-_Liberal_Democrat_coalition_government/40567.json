Yes there are countless organisations protecting this destructive beast thing of the poor farmers who every time they get infected have to pay 30,000 pounds to get rid of it! The cull has been proven to work, in the last cull in 6 months alone it saw a 28.35 decline in the T.B infections. If its proven to work, and the people who are effected want the cull, why don\u2019t we have one? ",
