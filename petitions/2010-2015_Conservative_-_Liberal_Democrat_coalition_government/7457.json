The use of water cannons, tear gas, dogs, and rubber bullets would easily have been justified and should have been used within the first 6-12 hours of trouble. If there were not enough police to physically control the crowds, then the army should have been called in.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to get answers and to ensure that the government installs a plan against future riots and public disorder so that the august disturbances are the last the UK see of riots.",
