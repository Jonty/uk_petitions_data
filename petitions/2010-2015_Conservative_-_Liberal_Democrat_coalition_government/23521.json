Zufiqar mirza is here in the UK and has backing from Lord Nazir and Lord Qurban and has openly said he will ask the Taliban to assit him and this was said in the meeting room of the House of Commons on the 18th November, this is the youtube link (http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&v=pvy50blnY7s) where he has openly said he will go to the Taliban. Lord Nazir and Lord Qurban are from here and they know how serouis this matter is, but still did nothing. Please review this matter before it becomes trouble for us here and abroad, and action needs to be taken against people like these to stop promting terrorism in an open manner. And Mr Mirza's visa needs to be canceled.",
