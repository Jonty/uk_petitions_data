        "additional_details": "We are very concerned that a minority representation in the UK has distorted our negotiating position at the EU Brussels summit of Dec 8-9 2011. We urgently call upon David Cameron to look beyond narrow national and party interests and to recognise that Britain's future lies broadly within, and not outside, the European Union project. The Prime Minister should immediately signal the UK's willingness to re-enter any necessary negotiations - treaty or otherwise - to secure the best possible EU deal to protect the Eurozone's financial well-being.",
