The people concerned may have a propensity to cover-up the truth by agreeing with what previous witnesses have said as broadcast. This simply isn\u2019t good enough.\r\nA criminal or police led investigation would prevent important issues being swept under the carpet and stop the issue from simply resigning without a fair outcome.\r\n",
