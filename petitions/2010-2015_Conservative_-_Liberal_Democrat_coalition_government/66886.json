        "additional_details": "One of the great benefits of being British is the UK passport.  This has nothing to do with the title on the cover but has a great deal to do with the reputation of the UK and its standing in the world.  Many, many people have reasons for being grateful for possessing a UK passport, for pragmatic, humanitarian and sentimental reasons.  One only needs to remember the 29,000 Asians who came to the UK after being expelled by Idi Amin from Uganda.  In the possible event of a yes vote in the Scottish Referendum these advantages may well be lost to Scottish citizens. To prevent this, the UK Government is urged to continue to renew UK passports to all Scottish citizens after the date of Independence.",
