        "action": "STOP EU regulation of Buy To Let Mortgages",
        "additional_details": "There are fears regulation will restrict mortgage availability, force landlords who are unable to remortgage to sell up, with falling house prices & fewer properties to rent among the results.\r\n\r\nAccording to analysis by the Building Societies Association, EU intervention could prove disastrous.\r\n\r\nSome 1.4m landlords are set to be affected by the proposal, some might find they no longer qualify for a remortgage in as little as 2 years\u2019 time.\r\n\r\nRead full article here: http://tiny.cc/b90bn\r\n\r\n\u201cOver time this could lead to a reduction in private rented sector properties. At the extreme, current BTL borrowers may be forced to sell their property portfolios, which would have obvious implications for existing tenants & the housing market as a whole.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis petition is to express the strength of feeling & possible effects of such regulation, to URGE the Government to prevent this action to protect both British Business & Individuals\u2019 rights.",
