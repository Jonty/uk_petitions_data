        "additional_details": "The aim of the petition is to legalise DMT. (Dimethyltriptamine) which is a chemical your body naturally produces when you sleep, this is what helps you have vivid dreams.\r\n\r\nIt is also used by shamans in the Peruvian jungle as a means of reaching altered states of consciousness. Religious purposes.\r\n\r\nPeople should have the right to take this substance in the privacy of their own home to explore the infinite realm of their inner minds.\r\n\r\nIt will also save people a lot of money traveling to Peru where it is legal.\r\n\r\nI hope the UK can legalise the harmless recreational substance being one of the world leaders in democracy.\r\n\r\nThanks.
