        "additional_details": "Private health insurance costs private individuals up to 50% more than for employees covered by company schemes. Employees now pay benefits  tax on their premiums  but this is a fraction of the cost paid  by individuals and  retirees out of taxed income.   Retirees in particular are finding the increase in their premiums impossible to sustain.\r\n\r\nA viable private hospital sector relieves pressure on the NHS, provides additional beds to treat urgent NHS patients, gives our top medics an additional source of income fully justified by their skill and training and gives key staff from industry  prompt treatment for a quicker return to work and now allows the NHS to boost its income with private treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury must act by restoring tax relief on individuals\u2019 health insurance to keep premiums affordable if both the private hospitals and the new NHS private developments are to be sustainable  to continue to provide much needed resources, skills and financial support to the NHS.\r\n",
