        "additional_details": "Last night as me and my boyfriend found a cat injured in the road. It was clear it had been hit by a car and was suffering a lot. Many cars before us had just gone straight past, but what's worse is that the person who hit the cat just drove away.\r\n\r\nThis caused prolonged suffering of this cat, which had to be put to sleep because of the extent of its injuries. If this were a human, or even a dog, it's illegal not to stop and report it.\r\nI would like to see the government enforce in the law that the welfare of cats is protected better by making it a legal requirement to stop and report it if you hit a cat whilst driving.\r\n\r\nPlease help by signing this petition, it could really make a difference to the welfare of cats in our country. It has to reach 100,000 signatures to even be considered by  the government, so every name counts. ",
