Religion should be taught at a church or temple, not at a school.\r\n\r\n\"In France, the state recognizes no religion and does not fund religious education. However, the state subsidizes private teaching establishments, including religious ones, under strict conditions of not forcing religion courses on students and not discriminating against students according to religion.\"",
