        "additional_details": "None of the recent rioters have had a decent family upbringing. They might be loved in an \u201cI\u2019ll buy you some designer trainers\u201d way, but they have not been set any boundaries and therefore have no discipline. Having no sense of belonging they join gangs. Sadly, they will probably grow up to be bad parents themselves. Given the availability of contraception and abortion, why do people have children they neglect? Obviously they are encouraged by the benefits they attract. It is no coincidence that the recent rioting followed a period of additional spending foolishly trying to address the problem of \u201cchild poverty\u201d. Paradoxically, it\u2019s the money that is actually causing the problem. Just like drugs, stop the supply and you stop the problem. By stopping the benefit for all children borne more than nine months time away, no current parent or child would be affected. It would simply mean that the decision to have a child would be taken more seriously, and parenting standards would rise. ",
