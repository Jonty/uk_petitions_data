This will happen again and get worse if nothing is done about climate change!\r\n\r\nIt has been predicted that by 2050 we would have exhausted all of our resources. As a result of this there will be more diseases, natural disasters, conflict, lack of clean water and lack of food. Do you want to live in a world like this? if not, sign this petition so we can prevent all of these things.",
