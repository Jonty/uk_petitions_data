Some women or couples suffer hugely after abortions with no prior knowledge of how it would make them feel.  According to the latest report funded by the Dept of Health, there are several factors which indicate whether a woman or couple is likely to suffer from Post Abortion Stress Syndrome (e.g. co-ercion, wrong information about the fetus, feeling there is no other choice, blackmail, a bond with the fetus).\r\n\r\nA standard assessment prior to the abortion, will help to flag up a woman or couple likely to suffer from Post Abortion Stress Syndrome, due to their circumstances.  They can then be offered further support and be warned of the possible emotional side effects of abortion so that they can make an informed decision.  This will reduce the amount of women and couples who suffer so traumatically afer an abortion.  ",
