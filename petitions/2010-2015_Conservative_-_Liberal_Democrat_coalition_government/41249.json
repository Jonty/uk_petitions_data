        "action": "Provide government funing for FOP Research at Oxford University.",
        "additional_details": "We ask that government funds research into FOP at the University of Oxford to let everyone know that Rare Diseases do matter and to keep the UK at the forefront of cutting edge research.\r\n\r\nFOP is one of the rarest, most disabling genetic conditions known to medicine; it turns otherwise healthy people into human statues.  A healthy mind locked inside a frozen body.\r\n\r\nInformation from FOP research will have far reaching implications for other common disorders such as fractures, osteoporosis, hip replacement surgery, and other forms of heterotopic ossification that occur in trauma and burn victims.\r\n\r\nResearch being carried out at the University of Oxford is low-cost in terms of medical research programmes.\r\n\r\nA treatment / cure for a FOP sufferer means the difference between a normal healthy life or a short-lived existence trapped inside their own bodies.\r\n\r\nPlease support our petition.",
