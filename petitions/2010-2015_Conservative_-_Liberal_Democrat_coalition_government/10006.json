        "additional_details": "The last few years has seen a massive increase in smart phones to which nearly every youngster has a mobile device that he/she can access the internet or sms features.\r\n\r\n Being in a class/lesson/lecture is not really the time to do this as its learning time.\r\n\r\nMy letters have also been forwarded onto the state of education, who has repied and said that they are looking at giving certain teachers/staff powers of search and to confiscate devices.\r\n\r\nThis will surely alienate the member of staff and make them a target for violence and such like.\r\n\r\nIf we can get the telephony act ammended so that we can create a goverment backed company set up to install signal blockers within educational building and operate at set times, we feel the youth will get a better education.\r\n\r\nThe argument about emergency calls not being able to made has also been looked at and all systems will have cut off switches etc implemented.",
