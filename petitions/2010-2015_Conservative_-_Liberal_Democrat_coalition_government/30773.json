        "additional_details": "We are looking at an obesety epidemic and are told we should take more excersize. So why are we encouraged to eat rather than excersize by TV programs.\r\n\r\nTV programs influence the actions of people greater than you may think. When programs like \"ground force\" were on the air, many people used to go into thier gardens and create. Now, when we are subjected to many hours of cooking programs, people just eat instead.\r\n\r\nThe deparment of health should put pressure on the TV companies to produce programs that show healthy things as fun and how anyone can get involved. Gardening is considered a mild excercise and benificial to health, unlike preparing and stuffing yourself with rich foods.\r\n\r\n",
