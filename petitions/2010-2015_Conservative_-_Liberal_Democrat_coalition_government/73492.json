        "additional_details": "This is a petition to raise greater awareness about the issue of domestic violence in the UK.\r\nDomestic Violence is still a big issue in the UK but is often overlooked as most domestic violence happens behind closed doors and the victims often find it very difficult to do speak out.\r\nAnother reason the issue of domestic violence is often overlooked is because there is not enough awareness raised about the issue in our society and so people tend to get more involved in it, not realising the consequences, and others do not do much against it as they are not much aware of the issue.\r\n By raising more awareness about the issue of domestic violence and its consequences, we can help reduce the amount of domestic violence in he UK.\r\nBy signing this petition you hereby support that the government should invest in more facilities to raise awareness about the issue of domestic violence, so that it hopefully reduces in the future.",
