        "additional_details": "Every day we read of hundreds of thousands of taxpayer pounds being used to pay fines and compensation orders which arise out of the criminal acts of taxpayer funded employees.  There is no employment contract in existence which authorises employees to commit criminal acts on behalf of the taxpayer for which the taxpayer takes vicarious liability.  Taxpayer funded employees have no disincentive to do no crime, in fact many take advantage of the moral hazard situation whereby they KNOW that they will not be called to pay the fine or compensation when their crime is discovered.",
