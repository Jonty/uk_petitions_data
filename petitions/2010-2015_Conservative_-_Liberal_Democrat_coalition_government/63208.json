        "additional_details": "BBC Panorma highlighted the bias and corruption in the Tower Hamlets office of mayor. It is obvious that Luftur Rahman is a self publicist who is funding ethnic minority interests with Islamic bias in favour of other peoples. He has already been shown to be that he will not report to the committees that look into spending and oversights,and is not democratic in the way he operates. He is looking to gain power solely for ethnic people's with his own outlook and funds them to vote for him. He is corrupt and needs removing from office.",
