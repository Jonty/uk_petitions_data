        "additional_details": "The undersigned believe that it is no longer acceptable for MPs to behave in what can be described as a \"childish\" manner in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this refers to MPs holding private conversations, heckling, laughing, shouting or using mobile phones while someone is speaking. These behaviours are counter-productive, and it speaks volumes of our current democratic process that they occur during both major and minor parliamentary debates, as well as Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\r\n\r\nRegarding what action should be taken, all MPs in the House must make separate and immediate declarations that they will no longer engage in these intolerable behaviours. This is an endemic problem that disgusts and alienates the electorate, while putting the country into disrepute. This problem is so basic that there should be no policy time wasted on its resolution. Rather, MPs should, of their own accord, immediately desist from these behaviours.\r\n",
