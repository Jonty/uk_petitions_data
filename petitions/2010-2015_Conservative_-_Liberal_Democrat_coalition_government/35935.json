Teaching english history will improve patrism and perhaps encourage people to do there best. people should strive for the nation we once had and learning about our history will help them realize. this isn't asking for anything discriminative, it's just asking us to be british again.\r\n\r\nwe must remember that most children today don't know the national anthem nor the lords prayer.",
