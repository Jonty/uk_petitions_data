        "additional_details": "This petition is put forward with a view to remind the British Prime Minister (David Cameron) that he has a responsibility to the electorate and the citizens of the United Kingdom to actually represent the UK in a public debate on the issue of the Scottish Referendum.\r\n\r\nWe, the electorate, expect to see the national/international representative of the UK (David Cameron) take this issue seriously and not shy away from this very serious democratic development..\r\nA debate on Scottish Independence is not something the PM should have a choice to duck out of... It is in the national interest that he represents the UK in this debate.\r\n\r\nBut since the PM has shown his unwillingness/inability to enter the debate of his own accord, it is now down to the people of the UK to demand it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
