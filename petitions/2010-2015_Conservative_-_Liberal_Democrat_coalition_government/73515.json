        "additional_details": "All too often we (the general public) are lied to by our elected individuals. I propose that legislation be introduced to make lying in any sort of political statement (manifesto, promises to the public, etc) be punishable by prison sentance, a 10 year ban on any polical work and an unlimited fine.\r\n\r\nThe public will not put up with this much longer and we demand much better from our seats of power. Hench the reason I demand this be introduced within 1 year of the date of posting. It shouldn't take more than a 3 months, there is never any excuse for decit and this nation is far above it. There is no reason not to introduce this except pure greed and treason. ",
