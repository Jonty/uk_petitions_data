        "additional_details": "Following the riots in Tottenham it became very apparent that the police were unable to intervene to prevent arson, beatings and lootings and in fact were forced to stand on the sidelines rather than be allowed to disperse the rioters and arrest them on the spot. Police powers in this extreme instance have been eroded over the years. In European countries the police use water cannon and CS gas in these extreme circumstances to prevent loss of life and damage to property by the lawless minority. The government needs to allow our police the same powers as those forces in Europe to deal quickly and firmly with rioters and criminals and to equip our protectors with what they need to keep us safe whether that is CS gas or increased powers of arrest.",
