He was a ferryman before the original footbridge was built.  His family still reside in Shoreham.\r\n\r\nWe want  the name of the new footbridge to reflect the history and people of Shoreham and it should be named after Harry Elmer. We want West Sussex District Council to add Harry Elmer to the shortlist of names so that the local people of Shoreham can vote on it.",
