I believe this will be good for Dorset. But the No vote is the only one that seems to have a voice. If you believe that Navitus Bay should go ahead. Show your support.\r\n\r\nFind out more information yourself here http://www.navitusbaywindpark.co.uk/bournemouth The echo has done a great peace looking at the real effect of wind farms on the local economy after looking at Margate that has a wind farm much closer from the coast than this proposal.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/briefing/navitus/navitus_stories/11622603.Three_windfarms_and_the_council_that_backed_them___our_special_report_from_Margate/\r\n\r\n",
