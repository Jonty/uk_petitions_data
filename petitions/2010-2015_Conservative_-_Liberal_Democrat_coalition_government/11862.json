        "additional_details": "The Government should command the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Gus O'Donnel, to report to Parliament details of expenditure incurred by Government Departments in the last 5 years  through the use of Departmental credit cards. This expenditure should be analysed into appropriate expenditure categories. This review should identify cases where individuals in those Deaprtments have authorised or incurred expenditure of a non-Departmental nature, which is not a correct charge out of the public purse,  The  names of those individuals, their Departmental rank and the amounts involved should also be identified in the said.report.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this petition is because it appears that credit card abuse could be a similar but larger scandel than MP's expenses.",
