        "additional_details": "Mumbai, one of the largest cities in the world and busiest UK visa centres is having its visa staff reduced from 70 to 20, with decision-making being centralised in New Delhi, 850 miles away, despite receiving the same volume of applications every year.\r\n\r\nPeople from the Mumbai region, including the state of Gujarat, depend on its services, including the friends and families of British Indian citizens. Now only \u2018priority\u2019 services will be processed at the cost of \u00a3600 for each application.\r\n\r\nThis decision will damage relations between our two countries, inconvenience the many hundreds of thousands of people who apply, and lead to less effective and accurate decisions on visa applications.",
