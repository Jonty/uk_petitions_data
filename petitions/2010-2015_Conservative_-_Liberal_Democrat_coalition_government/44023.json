(the list is never ending).\r\n\r\nMPs should get their salary's and that's it. It means that MPs cannot cheat and there will be no need for all the unnecessary fuss that we currently have due to these scandalous MPs.\r\n\r\nWe know that MPs cannot stick to their promises and that their \"sorry\" does not mean anything. To prevent further fraud, we should stop giving MPs the freedom to make claims, even if they are genuine, as they simply cannot be trusted.\r\n\r\nI hope you are with my on this and that you feel as passionately about this topic as I do.\r\n\r\nThank You",
