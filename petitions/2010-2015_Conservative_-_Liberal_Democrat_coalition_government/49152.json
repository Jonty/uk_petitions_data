        "additional_details": "It has been reported that 1300 people have died after being placed in the \"work-related activity group\". The Atos Work Care Assessment has been branded as \"not fit for purpose\" by the British Medical Association, due in part to its rigid application of a \"logic integrated medical assessment\" to an area subject to much fluctuation in human experience. The incidence of death following these assessments is unacceptably high, and the DWP in the shape of its responsible Minister Iain Duncan-Smith should be calling for a full enquiry into the situation behind what is an escalating human tragedy.",
