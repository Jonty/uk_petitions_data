        "additional_details": "We think it would greatly benefit the enviroment and the general public's fitness if bikes were to be freely provided within major cities.\r\n\r\nThe system would work like the Barclays Bikes within London already, but would run more like trolley systems within supermarkets.\r\n\r\nPeople would enter an amount of money as a deposit (the amount would depend on the length of time they were planning to use the bikes) for the bike and they would recieve the money back upon retur of the bike.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering signing this petition. If you would like further infomation please E-Mail us at: freebikesincities@gmail.com\r\n\r\nAlso consider taking part in our anonymos survey about Free Bikes in Cities at: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/K5V88YL\r\n\r\nThank you.",
