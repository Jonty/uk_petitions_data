        "additional_details": "I would like to propose that a larger deal is made of ST George's Day.\r\n\r\nIn this country I feel that there is a lack of pride; as evidenced by large amounts of graffiti etc. Furthermore schools and colleges refuse to celebrate St George's day for fear of alienating foreign nationals.\r\n\r\nBy making a larger deal of St George's Day it would grant us the opportunity to reflect, as a nation, upon how fortunate we are to have such an interesting cultural heritage, such hardworking  and dedicated public services, a right to high quality education and a diverse and welcoming culture.\r\n\r\nWith regards to the concern of schools about alienating foreign nationals there is little concern as all of them can appreciate these things and can hopefully see how great our country is.\r\n\r\nI feel that we play these things down to much and should should celebrate in a way akin to how the American's celebrate the fourth of July.",
