Who has attended their parties and rub shoulders with them.  It should be led by an independent who does not know Murdoch or the family.  If this was a criminal trial and a jury member knew the defendant they would not be able to sit to decide the person's fate and this I submit should be the same.  A personal friend of the family is NOT good enough  he must be removed ",
