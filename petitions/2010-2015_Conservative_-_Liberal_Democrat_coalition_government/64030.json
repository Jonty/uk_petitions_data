        "additional_details": "A simple change as changing the coulor of our streetlights to blue can reduce crime and suicide rates. This has been done in Japan and Glasgow already and seems to be working. There is a lot of research into the psychology of coulor. Research looking into short wavelength light (blue) has demonstrated that it is a potentially effective treatment for seasonal affective disorder which is a type of depression. And also has a calming effect on people. ",
