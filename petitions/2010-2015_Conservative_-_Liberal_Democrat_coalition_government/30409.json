        "additional_details": "HMG has invested around \u00a345bn (84% shareholding) & \u00a317bn (41% shareholding) into two UK banks at the height of banking crisis about 3 years ago. These assets/collateral are owned by HMG & therefore has the clout to insist the 2 banks to invest (by lending funds) on worthy/promising  manufacturing, infrastructure, R/D projects (like building an airport on the Thames estuary, aerospace, R/D in stem cell research, nuclear fusion) identified by HMG. Nuclear fusion is THE holy grail of unlimited energy supply of the future. Currently only \u00a31bn pa are invested in nuclear fusion worldwide in total. Nuclear fusion is the most powerful energy source in the universe & is the energy source of billions of stars in the universe.  Fusion power stations do not produce radioactive end products can be turned on, as required, to generate limitless energy supply required by human civilisation.",
