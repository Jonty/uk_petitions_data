        "additional_details": "Researchers at major car companies, and Google, are developing self-driving cars based on cutting edge artificial intelligence sensors / programs, and communication between nearby vehicles.\r\n\r\nExamples of places that are supportive of testing and developing them on roads, under strict controls, are Nevada and California.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that accident rates will reduce through this technology, that lives will be saved. Allowing the UK to participate will boost the UK car and tech industries, creating / saving jobs. I believe fuel consumption and congestion will be saved, thereby reducing CO2 and expensive road-building projects.\r\n\r\nWe must be more proactive about this in the UK, else the German and US manufacturers will further impact jobs in the UK. It's coming anyway folks.",
