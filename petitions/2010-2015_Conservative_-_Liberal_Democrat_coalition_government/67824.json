        "additional_details": "Banning all weapons has happened before. Tibet was once warlike and dominated its neighbors before it realised it was losing its best young men to war and banned all weapons. It then enjoyed centuries of peace because it was geographically isolated. It is simply a logical progression of culture. Today, ISIS has American weapons in Iraq and Ukrainian separatists can shoot down passenger jets. This can be prevented and we should start discussing how to change the UN to make it possible. Britain, with its experience of losing vast numbers of young men in two world wars, should lead the effort to disarm the world.",
