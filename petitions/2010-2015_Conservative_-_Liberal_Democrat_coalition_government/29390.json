Cyclists often jump the traffic lights, regarding themselves as a \u2018law to themselves\u2019 (above the traffic law). Cyclists would often ride their bicycles on pavements, use pedestrian crossings (like zebra, pelican crossings, bypasses) and then switch to cycling on roads, roundabouts, junctions whenever it suited them. Cyclists do not need insurance, driving licence, road fund licence, MOT and not likely to be stopped by the police for being drunk.",
