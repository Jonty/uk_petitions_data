        "additional_details": "A truck driver was killed, after hitting a truck parked in a layby. Truckers have limited time to drive, and have to park somewhere for the night(Or day). Motorway service areas charge up to \u00a330.00 for the privilege of disgusting food and cold shower( If working at all!) And a lot/most companies won't pay for this. So the driver has to park in lay-bys and Industrial estates and risking their lives/ loads/ diesel etc... We are urging the government to sort out somewhere for our truckers to park safely, and freely in this country. Places like Germany/France/Spain etc...All have free parking for trucks, Why can't we?",
