        "additional_details": "On the basis that alcohol is legal, how can cannabis be illegal ?    Long and short term alcohol is FAR more dangerous, harmfull and addictive. In one night it is possible to drink ones self to DEATH !! The effects of alcohol effects our A and E wards everyday of the year. How many voilent crimes, and road accidents  are commited everyday because of the effects of alcohol. It would be unfair on the thousands of responsible drinkers, who go to work everyday and pay their taxes to illegalise alcohol because of this, and yet all the responible smokers are criminalised. This is hypocrisy and it needs to end.  Holland has'nt got mental institutions in every town, how many cannabis related deaths are reported each year? And why shoud smokers have to worry about going to prison because of how they chose to unwind after a hard days work? ",
