These people have voluntarily travelled to learn to fight and inflict death and misery to support their own militant views. In the event of their return to the United Kingdom, the skills they have learned could well be used to fight against the law abiding majority of people in the United Kindom irrespective of their religious views. These people present a real threat to our people, and we demand that the UK Parliament, in following its' basic mandate to protect its people, refuse re-entry to the people and renounce their UK Citizenship!",
