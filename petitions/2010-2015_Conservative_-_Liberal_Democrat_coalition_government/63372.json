        "additional_details": "Culture secretary Maria Miller has shocked MPs by delivering the briefest possible apology to parliament after being found guilty of breaching its code of conduct with her obstructive attitude to an inquiry into her finances\r\nBut the Commons' standards committee reported she had \"breached the current code of conduct by her attitude to this inquiry\", declaring: \"That is more serious\".\r\n\r\nIn effect, it accused her of deliberately not co-operating \"fully and frankly\" and only doing so when pressed. And it ordered her to apologise in a personal statement to parliament for her attitude\r\n\r\nMaria Miller has escaped serious censure and avoided repaying more than \u00a340,000 after a committee of MPs overruled an official inquiry into her expenses claims.\r\n\r\nBenefit cheat? no,  MP Maria Miller just made a \"mistake\" when she overclaimed \u00a345k for a house her parents lived in.  Michael Portillo just said Maria Miller's position is \"unsustainable\".\r\n",
