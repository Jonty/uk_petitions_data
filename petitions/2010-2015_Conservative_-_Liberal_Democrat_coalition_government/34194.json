        "additional_details": "In veiw of the foreign ownership by business men for investment of some of english football league and fa premier league clubs,\r\nFinishing 4th in the fa premier league has become a business necessity can we ask the fa to respect the fa cup and bring back the glory and pride of the once world famous fa cup final, by giving the 4th champions league qualifying place to the winners of the fa cup or runners up should the winners finish in the top 3 in the premier league.\r\nThis would return the competition to one of the most valued trophies to win for every league club once more. Why shouldn't the likes of cardif city or portsmouth have a run in the champions league if they beat top oposition to get to the final they would deserve it.\r\nTherefore i would like the government to have a public referendum so all football fans can have their say on this matter ",
