        "additional_details": "This petition calls on the government to make illegal the re-sale of tickets to cultural events for profit. The findings of the 2007 Select Committee on the benefits of the secondary ticketing market in the UK are not, for the most part, in question. However, the suggestion that competition (in the secondary market) leads to lower prices for consumers is absurd and quite incendiary. Regrettably, it is now inevitable that 'big' cultural events sell out in a matter of minutes on the primary market only to appear for re-sale on the secondary market at obscene mark-up.  This parasitical practice is wholly exploitative: in an era when pressure mounts on governments worldwide to pass anti-piracy laws, NOTHING is being done to prevent big business and private individuals from 'ripping off' performers and YOU, the fan, for THEIR OWN material gain. Enough is enough. ",
