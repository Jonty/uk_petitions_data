This should be either on community projects (not just picking up litter or some other such activity that does not teach them job skills), or with local companies. There should be a small increase in job seekers allowance for those participating, as both an encouragement and to show them that work pays.\r\n\r\nThose companies that opt to take on individuals should be rewarded with a tax break and should be calculated according to the company size. ie a PLC would receive less than a sole trader.",
