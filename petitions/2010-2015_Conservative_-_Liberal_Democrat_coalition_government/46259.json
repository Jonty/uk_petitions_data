But no such argument can be made for their inheritors.  Their children may be effective individuals, rather than slovenly wasters, but there is no reason economically that they would be more effective than anyone else in managing their inheritance.\r\n\r\nIsn't this, after all, why we are in the currently crisis; that those with wealth have managed their money poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
