        "additional_details": "This Government should stop the indiscriminate granting of permission to erect high, noisy and inefficient wind turbines that only benefit the individual landowner. Permission is often granted without due consideration to nearby residents and locations near to, or even inside Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The scientific data used in making decisions is often outdated and contradictory and needs to be revisited. Moreover, applications should only be considered by referring to the recent 'Revised National Planning Policy Framework'.\r\nFurthermore, local communities should also have a say in the final decision and all approved applications should have a planning gain for the local community, as with other construction applications.\r\nGovernment should be so very careful, otherwise, 'Never in England's green and pleasant land, will so much be surrendered by so many, to benefit so few'.",
