        "additional_details": "This petition is in favour of the Scottish Parliament facing legal consequences if a \"NO\" vote is given from the Scottish Independence Referendum.\r\n\r\nThe fellow people of the UK signing this petition want the Scottish Bill reformed to make any future Independence Referendums illegal unless the UK Government is completely satisfied that UK law is being followed.  The Scottish Parliament will be reduced to a Scottish Assembly, based on the same principles of Wales and Northern Ireland with the same laws.\r\n\r\nEach Nation of the UK should have the same levels of funding per head.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government will also enact an English Assembly Act to give England the same Assemblies as the rest of the UK.",
