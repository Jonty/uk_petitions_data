        "additional_details": "The current and previous governments have consistently ignored the recommendations of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs. This includes David Nutt's dismissal in 2009 and the ignoring of its published recommendations on Khat in January 2013. As its recommendations are not taken into account and decisions on drug law are clearly made based on political, not scientific reasons, the council serves no purpose. Disband the council to stop wasting taxpayers' money and spare the public the pretense that decisions on drugs are made meritocratically.",
