        "additional_details": "This petition calls for all car, van, and lorry drivers to have annual cyclist awareness training. Rather than having a one day course which will quickly get forgotten this petition calls for all vehicle drivers to have to spend several days throughout the year experiencing life on UK roads as a cyclist. This would have several benefits; improved roadcraft of all vehicle drivers, safer roads, and it would help to get more people off our roads doing exercise, which would be of benefit to the NHS too.
