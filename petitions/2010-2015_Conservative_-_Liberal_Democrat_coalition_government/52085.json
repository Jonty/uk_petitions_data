        "additional_details": " As you are aware money transfer companies play vital role in Somalia and other parts of the world.. The recent announcement by Barclays to close the accounts of 250 money transfer agencies will lead to famine and chaos in Horn of Africa.  For more than 25years these agencies have played a vital role in averting famine and hunger.  We would like the UK Government to put pressure on Barclays Bank to reverse its decision to close these accounts.\r\n\r\nMillions of the poorest in Africa are kept alive by the diaspora community, sending money through these agencies to buy food and other basic essentials.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to reverse the decision made by Barclays Bank or give money transfer agencies 6 months extension to find alternative arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
