        "additional_details": "The greatest threat to the UK is no longer invasion by foreign powers or even action by terrorists, but rather the challenges presented by climate change and coastal erosion.\r\nThe UK should therefore use less of its resources in fighting wars overseas and more in defending our shoreline from the sea.\r\nTo this end priority projects should be identified and planned in partnership with the Environment Agency. Projects should be delivered using Armed Forces personnel and other Defence resources whenever these are not deployed overseas.\r\nAdoption of this policy will make better use of scarce national resources and will provide useful training for forces personnel.",
