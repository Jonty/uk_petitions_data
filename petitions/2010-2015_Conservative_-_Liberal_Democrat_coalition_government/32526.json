        "additional_details": "HMS Plymouth is the last surviving warship from the Falklands Conflict in 1982 and she is currently under threat of being scrapped. Various schemes to save her have come to nothing, mainly down to berthing restrictions or unsuitable arrangements.  HMS Plymouth should be preserved for the nation as a memorial to those who lost their lives in the conflict, particularly the Royal Navy. In the year that commemorates the 30th anniversary of this event this ship should not be allowed to become razor blades. Please sign this petition and help to save this ship.",
