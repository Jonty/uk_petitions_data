        "additional_details": "Across the country, Diabetics are being denied Test strips to monitor and control  their blood sugar, meaning millions will eventually suffer complications like gangrene, blindness, heart failure and premature death. Many are also beiing denied regular HBa1C tests which test the average blood sugar over previous 2-3 months. Although this is being justified on the grounds of a recent scientific study, this is in reality a cynical short-term cost cutting exercise.<br>\r\n\r\nThe government has stated that PCTs should not have a blanket policy on this. But it is evident from all the major Diabetic forums that that they do and are pressuring Doctors into compliance.\r\n\r\nI would call on the government to stop this blanket policy immediately, and allow doctors to reinstate test strips for Diabetics who wish  to manage their own condition.",
