        "additional_details": "Toilets in Central Park, Haworth, are threatened with closure as part of Bradford Council\u2019s cost-cutting plans.\r\n\r\nThey are relatively new, modern, award winning toilets in a popular area. Closure of the toilets would effect the local community and visitors to Haworth.\r\n\r\nHaworth is a tourist area, famous for the Bronte Parsonage Museum and the Worth Valley Railway. It attracts visitors and trade into the community. Along with events such as Christmas, Steampunk, and  Forties weekends, the Tour de France will even be coming through Haworth this year.\r\n\r\nClosure of the Central Park toilets will affect elderly and disabled people, who require easy access to public conveniences. It would leave inadequate provision for children using the park.\r\n\r\nGood public toilet provision enables everyone to partake fully in civic life, attracts visitors and boosts local economics.\r\n\r\nPlease support this e-petition and help us to prevent the closure of the toilets in Central Park, Haworth. Thank you.",
