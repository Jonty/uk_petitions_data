        "additional_details": "How many people know that the ambulance service is not an emergency service it is classed as an essential service. It is classed in the same catagory as the gas, electricity and water boards yet we still retain the 999 status and drive under blue light conditions. Calls for an ambulance are going up but the amount of ambulances on the road are going down due to cuts in funding. It is about time the government classes the service as an emergency service and give us the same funding as the fire and police then we wont be running around in dirty old ambulances that have done 300,000 miles and not breaking down all the time, putting more life saving medics on the road and meeting the targets the government set us.
