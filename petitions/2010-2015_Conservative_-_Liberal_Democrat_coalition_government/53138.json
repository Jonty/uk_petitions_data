        "additional_details": "From its conception the Muslim Brotherhood has been a cesspool for terrorism. Qutbism the violent terrorist ethos which was founded by key MB figure, Sayid Qutb, has been the main ideology behind many terrorits, such as Bin Laden and his Alqaeda organisation.\r\n\r\nSince Morsi was deposed in 30/06/13 the violence they have caused claimed 200 lives in shootings and bombings.\r\n\r\nThey made threats against peaceful protesters. An MB leader, Hegazy, said \u201cthey will chop their heads\u201d and  another El-Beltagy said that \u201cthe violence in the Sinai peninsula will only stop if their demands are met\u201d.\r\n\r\nThey have justified terrorism when their Elerian has justified the Boston bombing by linking it to the deployment of Troops in Mali.\r\n\r\nThey have prepared for terrorist acts when Morsi pardoned 570 terrorists some convicted in high profile attacks.\r\nWe ask of you to add the Mother of modern terrorism to the list.",
