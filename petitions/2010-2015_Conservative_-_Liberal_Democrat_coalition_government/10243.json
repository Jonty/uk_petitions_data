We the undersigned believe that all monies paid in benefits claims should be in the public domain to help bring the benefit thieves to account for their crimes. We want the government to introduce legislation to make claim details public, either by name or by address, to make it possible to report benefit thieves. This is not to humiliate genuine claimants, but to help remove thieves from the system ensuring more money is available to those that genuinely need it, and to reduce the massive ammounts of money stolen.
