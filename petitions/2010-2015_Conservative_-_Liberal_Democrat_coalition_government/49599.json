This represents an unfair attack on the benefits that older people have campaigned for over the years \u2013 partly in recognition of the inadequate level of the state pension \u2013 and we call on Parliament to oppose any such changes.",

This includes: free eye tests; free prescriptions; free television licences for the over 75s; free concessionary bus travel and Winter Fuel Payments.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
