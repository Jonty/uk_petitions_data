Too high tax deters people from this country and unfairly penalises high earners.\r\n\r\nWith a reduced tax rate, the country will have more millionaires which as a collective body pay more tax so everyone is the winner; Her Majesty's Treasury and the Country get more money, millionaires pay less, and more millionaires exist, which can boost the economy.",
