        "additional_details": "I propose that the government build secure housing units/homes on blighted estates rather than sending perpetrator(s) to prison for crimes of less that a two year jail sentence or in the case of evicting individuals/families for persistent ASB or Hate Crimes which generally only moves the problem to another area.  The monies saved would be used to train/empower residents of the estate(s) in the skills needed to manage, run, care and educate those incarcerated.  When properties became empty due to those being incarcerated, grant monies would be made available to be used to train unemployed adults and youth who live on the estates in much needed building and refurbishing skills.  So as not to alienate those housed in the units/homes and as part of there rehabilitation programme those incarcerated would work alongside residents in ground maintenance, general gardening work together with community food growing projects.",
