        "additional_details": "We call on the Department for Transport to fund a lift with the new railway footbridge at Kidbrooke Station, to give full access for all users, especially the disabled, the elderly, those with other mobility issues.\r\n\r\nWe are surprised Network Rail does not meet Disability Discrimination legislation with new build, and claims it is the Department of Transport that holds funds to do so.\r\n\r\nKidbrooke Station is at the hub of a major re-development, with increased housing, increased pupil roll at Thomas Tallis School, increased rail users, plus the new Kidbrooke Village with a supermarket, retail outlets, health facilities, offices, hotel and major sheltered housing scheme.\r\n\r\nThe new railway footbridge gives access to all this, but without lift access leaves many with a long walk to reach the other side, and some services (eg station office, taxis, the new Village) are on one side, while others (eg buses) are on the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
