It is setting a terrible example to young boys and girls about the role of women in society. There is a zero tolerance stance on racism in adverts, and now it's time for a zero tolerance stance on sexism in adverts. Please ensure the Advertising Standards Agency has the powers necessary to ban or regulate these adverts. ",
