Yet the govenment feel that we do not deserve the right to vote.\r\nWe want this right. We're just as informed as adults are, if not more so. With the current compulsory citizenship studies most 16 year olds take in schools they will be equipped with just as wide a breadth of knowledge concerning politics as most adults. Why not put this knowledge to good use?\r\n\r\nSign this petition today and tell the government that we deserve a voice",
