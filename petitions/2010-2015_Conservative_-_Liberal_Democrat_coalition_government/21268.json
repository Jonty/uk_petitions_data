If this were to be the case then it would allow the public to request or petition the government to safe guard us and to ensure that we the public receive value for money and that the cost of insurance is an acurate reflection of what we recieve by way of a service.  Without this being in place we are at risk of a private industry sector causing poverty of those who need a private car with the shelter provided by the lawful requirement of motor insurance.",
