Lordi is currently in the UK and has applied for refugee status; she is currently classified as an Asylum Seeker.\r\n\r\nHer fianc\u00e9 lives in England and they have been together for 5 years.\r\n\r\nNow, the UKBA is threatening to send Lordi back to Lebanon, where she could die for being a lesbian engaged to another woman.\r\n\r\nAs an appeal to the UKBA, King's College LGBT Society are setting up a petition to get as many signatures as possible before the 26th March, 2013, to show that Lodi has support from a large number of UK citizens.\r\n\r\nWe need the UKBA to recognize that Lordi deserves to live an open and free life in this country, as opposed to a life shadowed by the death penalty in Lebanon.",
