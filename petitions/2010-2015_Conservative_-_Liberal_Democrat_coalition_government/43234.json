As home insurance is not mandatory there is no guarantee that the vehicle owner can claim and cost incurred for repairs back, nor is there any guarantee that the cyclist will give the correct details. This can be solved by attaching identification style plates, such as a number plate, on to the bike that anyone can record and find out the true identity of the cyclist.",
