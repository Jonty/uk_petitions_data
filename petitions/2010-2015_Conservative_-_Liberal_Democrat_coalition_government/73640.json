        "additional_details": "NHS staff work a 24/7 job and as a reward for being so flexible with shifts they receive extra pay when they work nights and weekends. Most staff rely on this due to the pay freeze for staff on increment pay.\r\n\r\nNHS Staff suffer more than those deciding their pay can ever imagine,\r\n\r\nThey are beaten and abused daily, working unsociable hours and 14 hour shifts. They have to pay to park at their workplace and all they want to do is help others.\r\n\r\nI am calling for the government to keep their hands off NHS unsociable hours pay.",
