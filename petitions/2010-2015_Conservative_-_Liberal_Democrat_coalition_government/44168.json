        "additional_details": "This epetition is to call for a change in the government to have working class people within the government instead of just rich people.\r\n\r\nCurrently the government and house of commons is filled with people who have never once had to live a single day on benefits or spend a single day working in a shop, warehouse etc.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of people who want to see a change to the way the UK is currently run. Working class people and people on benefits are becoming poorer and being attacked by MP's over money issues when in fact it should be the MP's that are looked at due to them wasting Tax Payers money on things like clothes \u00a380.000 no one needs to spend that amount on clothes and is ridiculous.",
