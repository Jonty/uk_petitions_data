        "additional_details": "In the Spring of 2011 nearly half of the population of Bahrain protested against the undemocratic rule of the Bahraini Royal Family, calling for democracy and the right to fair elections. The uprising was brutally crushed and later medical staff that had treated the injured and dying were arrested for their efforts, and under brutal torture signed documents admitting guilt to a variety of trumped up charges. They now face up to 15 years in jail.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to use pre existing diplomatic relations with the Bahrain Government to apply pressure to make changes to the way they treat their citizens, make changes to their appalling human rights record and to influence the release of the Medical Personnel currently on bail awaiting trial or in prison after the events of 2011.\r\n",
