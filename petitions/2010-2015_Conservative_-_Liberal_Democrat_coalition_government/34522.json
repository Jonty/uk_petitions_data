            "details": "As this e-petition has received more than 10 000 signatures, the relevant Government department have provided the following response:\r\n\r\nThe Animal Welfare Act 2006, which makes it an offence to cause unnecessary suffering to an animal, was reviewed by the Parliamentary Select Committee for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) last year.  The Committee did not recommend increasing the maximum penalties available to the courts.  There are, therefore, no proposals to increase the penalties for cases of animal cruelty.\r\n\r\nThe Government considers that existing maximum penalties of a fine of \u00a320,000 and six months imprisonment are appropriate.  The courts must decide what the penalty should be for each case taking into account its individual circumstances and the Sentencing Council Guidelines.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Government appreciates that the RSPCA spends considerable amounts of money in bringing prosecutions each year, we should not forget that they are a registered charity.  The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) can only consider prosecutions on behalf of the police (public prosecutions).  In such circumstances, the RSPCA could not investigate complaints and then pass on files to the CPS to prosecute as RSPCA prosecutions are private prosecutions.  Furthermore, RSPCA inspectors and prosecution case managers have developed a great deal of skill and knowledge at investigating and prosecuting animal cruelty cases, which makes them best placed to continue this work.  Therefore, the Government could not consider the suggestion that the RSPCA be brought within the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\nThe RSPCA are not publicly supporting this campaign.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
