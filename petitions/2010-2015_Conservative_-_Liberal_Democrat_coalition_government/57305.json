        "additional_details": "Making Social Services part of the Police Force would then make a real difference. A specialist Unit within police forces is required because it would then be illegal to not investigate. Mis trust in many local authorities has rendered them \"not fit for purpose\".  Evidence suggests that the government need to act quickly to stop more children from being abused or even killed. Have we not seen enough of the high profile cases of children dying because of departmental failures and inadequate responses from local authorities.",
