        "action": "The removal of Gary Neville from Sky Sports",
        "additional_details": "As a main pundit on Sky Sports the person employed should be unbiased and give every team involved in the league there opinion based on true facts and not based on hatred and rivalry. Gary Neville who has been employed by Sky Sports is only intrested in one team and that is Manchester United.Neville due to his playing days has a serious dislike and disregard for most teams who are not his beloved Utd. He's admitted to hating Liverpool and Man City aswell as others.How can someone who thinks and feels that way be asked to give a fair and unbiased opinion on the Premier League? Andy Gray the person he has replaced played for Everton but never made any biased comment, only honest and deserved criticism. I propose that Gary Neville is removed from his duty as \"pundit\" before Sky Sports loses thousands of viewers. Add to this his face insults alot of people and needs to shave off his \"facial hair\"",
