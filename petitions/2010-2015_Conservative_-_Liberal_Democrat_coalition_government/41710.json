        "additional_details": "Barry Wright worked for his community and was loved by all who came in to contact with him at the local shop. His community collected for a memorial bench after his death in 2001. It was placed at the bus stop, specifically for the elderly. It was taken without the permission of his family by the council after a complaint was made that youths were using it late at night. It now sits in storage. Please sign this petition to get the council to put the bench back on the estate to be used by the locals that he loved.",
