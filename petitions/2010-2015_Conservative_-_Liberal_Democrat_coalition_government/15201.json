        "additional_details": "The renovation of Euston station in London comes soon after the restoration of St. Pancras station, also in London, and Moor Street station in Birmingham. In those two instances, architects mimicked the original styles of older stations with great success.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, as well as the popularity of the Euston Arch Trust, this petition calls for the Euston Arch, constructed as part of the original Euston station in the 1830's and demolished in the 1960's despite a public outcry, to be incorporated into the design of the new Euston station, as it would not only give the station a harmonious appearance, but would be beneficial for London tourism and would help to boost public morale by celebrating London's past.",
