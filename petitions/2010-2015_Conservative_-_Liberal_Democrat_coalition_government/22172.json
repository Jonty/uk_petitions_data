        "additional_details": "It is of course right that persons who have given outstanding service to the nation and/or their local communities, or charities, should be recognised for achievements and dedication. However the current system of honours seems rather antiquated. References to the \"British Empire\" may not still be relevant, or even appropriate, today. The same might apply to the creation of new hereditary titles, since the honour is bestowed for personal achievement, not that of one's ancestors. Finally the system of selection should show some transparency, and must not be open to abuse for political ends.",
