        "additional_details": "Banks now often charge 'arrangement fees' which range from \u00a3100 up to \u00a32000 or more. These are supposedly meant to cover phone bills, staff time etc. Yet there is a clear correlation between low APR rates and higher 'arrangement fees'. I.e. Banks lost profit on lower APR is made up on arrangement fees.\r\n\r\nBanks should be more honest, stop misleading the public and include these supposed arrangement fees in their APR.\r\n\r\nIt would make comparing mortgages a lot easier. Arrangement fees should be banned.",
