        "additional_details": "A petition to re-instate the bus service from Packmoor to Tunstall.\r\nAll Packmoor residents are now unable to travel to their nearest town of Tunstall as the bus service there has been cancelled. Should anyone wish to get to Tunstall from Packmoor they now have to travel to Kidsgrove or Burslem first. This causes a great deal of inconvenience to the residents of Packmoor who do not have other means of transport and wish to shop in their local town. The transport companies are given subsidiaries to cover the costs of non-profitable routes but have cancelled this one. It isn't clear where that percentage of the subsidiary has now been used.",
