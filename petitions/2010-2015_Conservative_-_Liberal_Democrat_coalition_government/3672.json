        "additional_details": "Britain's Roads are grid locked for most peoples journey to work. After visiting the USA and driving on their roads, I feel we need to adopt a similar system to their red light rule. Unless stated you can turn right on a red light which keeps the traffic flowing. So why not adapt that rule for us in Britain, being able to turn left at a red light. It makes loads of sence and will keep traffic flowing especially at peak times. Let's get a parliamentary debate on this as I'm sure many of you viewing this will drive.",
