Although this aspect of the 1989 Children Act has now been repealed in the 2004 Children\u2019s Act, it remains the case that fathers of children born before December 2003 still do not automatically have Parental Responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe government should now make an amendment and give retrospective Parental Responsibility to those fathers who were not given parental responsibility prior to December 2003.\r\n\r\nIt should not be necessary for a parent, in this case a father, to have to seek Parental Responsibility through the other parent or through the courts to have a responsibility for their child's health, religion and education.\r\n",
