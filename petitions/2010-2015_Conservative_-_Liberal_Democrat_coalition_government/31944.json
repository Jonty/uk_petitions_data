The draft standards appear to set a suitably ambitious description of the characteristics such a teacher might display. However standards of this kind cannot be produced in isolation and need to be complemented by clarification of many unanswered questions. It is, as yet unclear how the new standards relate to teacher\u2019s pay and conditions, the performance threshold and upper pay spine. Who will be eligible? How will they be assessed? What is the meaning of \u2018consistently outstanding\u2019 performance? Like many other current educational initiatives this review is in danger of focusing on the detail before it has established the overall framework within which these standards will operate.\" Brian Lightman - ASCL\r\n\r\nLet's keep the current framework for teacher standards or review the current proposal before it's too late.\r\n\r\n",
