        "additional_details": "Responsible department: Department for Transport\r\n\r\nEuropean Legislation was introduced in September 2008 & September 2009 and is forcing drivers of HGV's and Coaches to undertake 35 hours of training over a rotating 5 year period to obtain a Certificate of Professional Competence. The basis for the legislation is to improve a Drivers Competence. I understood a drivers competence is assessed when a driver passes his/her driving test, with further training provide by an employer.\r\n\r\nThousands of Training providers have seen this legislation as a profitable venture, as it is a legal requirement for a Driver of the said vehicles to undertake this training in order to retain his/her licence. This is Not Fair on the Industry.\r\n\r\nDue to the variation of work involved particularly within HGV Road Haulage, training should be the responsibility of the employer for the role that the driver is undertaking.\r\n\r\nScrap the CPC (Certificate of Professional Competence) ",
