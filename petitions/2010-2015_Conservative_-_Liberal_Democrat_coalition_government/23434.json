        "additional_details": "Northern Rock has been sold at a cut price to a private investor at expense to the British taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThe taxpayer had no choice in contributing billions to the bailout of Northern rock and no choice on the sale or price and timing of that sale to private investors but now on top of that we learn of a secret deal, involving \"European authorities\" that ensured Northern Rock had to be sold by 2013!\r\n\r\nWhat was this secret deal, who exactly was it made with and why was it made and most of all why were the British taxpayers not informed about it?\r\nThese are very important issues and they relate directly to issues regarding insider trading (Who knew of this deal and who did not)\r\n\r\nEssentially the taxpayer was forced to buy a bad company and pay over the odds and then forced to sell this company at cut price.\r\nThis issue has much wider implications too so let's have it openly debated and get some answers!\r\n",
