        "additional_details": "Pakistan, among many developing Commonwealth nations, was made independent to follow The Spirit of the Law. Yet, using the same laws created by The British for preventing blasphemy against G-d, these governments support minority victimization through concocting breach of holiness against sons of men.\r\n\r\nZaffar Bhatti, Chairman Jesus World Mission, is among the many Christian, Ahmadi, and other minority members who became victim of the law. Rimsha Masih was the only blasphemy victim officially released in Pakistan. Whereas, the accusing clerics, the militant Talaban and the terrorists are being released regularly for lack of evidence.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate European Union stance on moratorium in Pakistan to prevent death sentence on blasphemy victims. Please do not support the world to destroy itself with plots against heaven. Do Not Support Blasphemy Victimization. Urge Release of Zaffar Bhatti and other blasphemy victims in Pakistan.",
