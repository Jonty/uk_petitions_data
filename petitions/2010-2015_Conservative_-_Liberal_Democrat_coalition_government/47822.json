        "additional_details": "The commons expenses are set to rise this year to 5.8 million. This is set across the 9 restaurants in the House of Commons, who cater to all MP'S. These expenses are funded by you and I, the UK tax payer!! Basically their lunches are being paid for, by us!! I don't know about you, but I'm lucky to grab a homemade sandwich, on the run, at a desk....if im lucky, in a shift!! Are MP'S not also a public service, there to serve the public, rather than enjoy a glass of shiraz, on us, at lunch. Please sign this to express to them that these expenses are unexceptable and unjustified. After all, are we not supposed to be saving money and reducing the deficit. Maybe it's time for us to make a stand and start singing from the same song sheet. Please sign..thanks.",
