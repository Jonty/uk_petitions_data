The handling of the Environment Department by Lord Smith shows he is incapable of running the Department and his statement that the none dredging of the canals in Somerset is not due to the flooding, shows what a complete fool he is. He is more interested in forming wetlands for birds than people\u2019s homes and belongings, more than the farmer\u2019s crops that are in the ground and the crops that should have been planted by now. Farmers should be allowed to keep there ditches clear. The poor people of the area will find there insurances rising that\u2019s if they can get any.  Once you add on the cost of the fire services and council workers and police the amount will be enormous. Lord Smith should resign at once and if he does not he should be sacked along with some of the senior staff responsible for the lack of not keeping the canals clear, and the jobs given to someone with brains.\r\n\r\n",
