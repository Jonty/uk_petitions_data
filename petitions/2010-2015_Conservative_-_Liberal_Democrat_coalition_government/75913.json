        "additional_details": "In the UK there is a lack of safe off highway parking for both overnight and short stay situations.\r\nMotorway service areas are too small and over priced and it's becoming common place to see LGV's parked along sliproads causing a hazard.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to use some of the money raised from vehicle tax should be put into investing in providing properly  segregated well lit rest areas with toilet facilities (similar to what we see in France) along major routes  that can be regularly patrolled by Highways Agency  Traffic Officials  as part of their duties..\r\n\r\nI believe that this action will  improve road safety, reduce crime and improve the welfare of Professional Drivers.",
