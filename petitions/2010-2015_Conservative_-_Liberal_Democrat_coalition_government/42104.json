        "additional_details": "This is a petition to lower the 18+ student oyster card fares. The student oyster card is a scam. I go to City & Guilds Art School and therefore have to travel into school at peak times everyday (classes start at 9 30 and end at 4 30). The student oyster card only gets you 30% off on tubes when you travel off-peak, which no student will have to do. This means that struggling students attempting to start independent lives are paying the same amount for travel as adults with steady incomes. Students have to pay full price (the same as an adult oyster card) every time they take the bus. Going from free bus travel to \u00a31.35 is a leap that students can't afford. For the average student, it costs at least \u00a380 a month just to travel to and from college. Therefore, we are asking you to sign this petition, as the fares are going to keep rising with the new policy in January and we need to take action ! ",
