        "additional_details": "I would like to see the replica, scale model British Airways Concorde sited back at the entrance/exit to London Heathrow. It is disgraceful that a foreign carrier should be the first thing our millions of visitors see upon their arrival in London. I cannot think of another country that would allow such a key position  to be used for advertising by a foreign airline. The Government should buy (or lease) the land the Emirates plane stands on and replace it with Concorde - a symbol of British ingenuity and perserverance and a lasting accolade to all the people who made her fly. She did not retire in disgrace and deserves a permanent, visible tribute to her beauty & their achievements. Being the year of the Olympics & the Queen's Diamond Jubilee should make this a top priority.",
