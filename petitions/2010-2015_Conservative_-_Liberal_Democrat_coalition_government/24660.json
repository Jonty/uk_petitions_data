        "additional_details": "I believe that cuts in funding for youth services are having a serious affect on youth crime. Young people left with very little to do find unorthodox, and often antisocial, ways of relieving their boredom. The cost of these crimes may well be greater than the total savings being made from the youth service budgets across the country. The sooner the Government acts to reverse these cuts, the better for young people and for society in general. ",
