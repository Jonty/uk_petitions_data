(This includes ALL wealth, property, money hidden in foreign bank accounts, written into wills etc). In short the rich would cease to exist, along with their grossly unequal influence on society. Their money will be redistributed to WORTHWHILE causes and no longer relegated to the world of self-interest and personal profit; the world in which this money is currently wasted.\r\n\r\n This is to ensure the equality of our land, improve the lives of the normal UK citizen and to rid the UK of wealth hungry individualists and their incomplete and amoral ideas of society. To reset the moral tone of our corrupt and disgustingly self-interested age.",
