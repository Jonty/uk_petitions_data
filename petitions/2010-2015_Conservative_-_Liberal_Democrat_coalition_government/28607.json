        "additional_details": "In households of more than one person, the maximum percentage of council tax payable per head is 50%.\r\nHowever, in single person households the current single occupant discount of 25% means that the percentage of council tax payable by sole occupants is 75% even though such individuals do not cost councils 25% more than individuals in shared households.\r\nThis unfairly discriminates against people who live alone for a wide variety of reasons. Such discrimination against people solely because they live alone is incongruent with action taken by governments in recent years to combat discrimination on the grounds of factors including gender, race, religion and sexual orientation.\r\nTherefore, the government should legislate to equalise the maximum rate of council tax payable per head in single occupant households with that of households with more than one occupant by making it mandatory that single occupant properties are given a 50% reduction in council tax.",
