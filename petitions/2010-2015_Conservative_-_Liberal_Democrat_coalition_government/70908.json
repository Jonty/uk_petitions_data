Any disabled individual that can carry out the same role as a fully able worker while dealing with their own physical or mental barriers should be worth more than the NMW rather than just claiming from the state.\r\n\r\nAlso, I feel that just an apology and a slap on the wrist isn't enough; Lord Freud should be removed from office.",
