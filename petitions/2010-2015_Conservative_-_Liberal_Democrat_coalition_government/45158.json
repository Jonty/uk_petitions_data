        "additional_details": "The government's proposals to increase the ratios allowed for staff/children in nurseries by between 33-50% (from 1:3 to 1:4 <2y/o, from 1:4 to 1:6 for 2-3 y/o) will not save parents money, nor will it increase the quality of care.\r\n\r\nFar from it - increasing the ratio allows government to increase the number of children existing facilities can take on, nothing more. It's a short-term fix, not a long-term solution. Quality of care and staff time with children should not be sacrificed because of a lack of childcare centre/nursery capacity.\r\n\r\nThe government should lay its proposals aside and instead concentrate on finding more nursery staff for existing facilities, and more innovative places and ways to set up nurseries/childcare centres.",
