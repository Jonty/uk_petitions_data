In addition to this we'd like all high school children to be taught about water safety and the dangers of swimming in open water every year. It\u2019ll help save lives by deterring youngsters from swimming in stretches of open water.\r\n\r\n400 people die from accidental drowning every year and it is one of the biggest causes of death among children. By making sure swimming and water safety is taught as part of the national curriculum it\u2019ll help prevent these tragic accidents from happening.\r\n\r\n",
