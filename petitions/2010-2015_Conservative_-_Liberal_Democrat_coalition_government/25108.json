We live in a world aiming for equal opportunity... it is unacceptable to portray women as sex objects in this manner for all ages of our society to view alongside genuine 'news' papers. The Daily Sport is beyond offensive and I would hope 'out dated' and needs to shift to a higher shelf with much higher censorship. If you agree let's get it moved UP!",
