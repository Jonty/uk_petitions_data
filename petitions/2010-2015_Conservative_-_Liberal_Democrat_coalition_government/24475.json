        "additional_details": "The government has allowed riders under the age of 21 to take a motorcycle test that lets them ride any motorcycle cc engine size, as long as it's restricted to 33bhp, for two years. This means the motorcycle's performance, no matter the engine size or motorcycle brand or motorcycle style, is drastically reduced and/or affected, limiting the motorcycle to the power output of a 125cc motorcycle.\r\nHowever, motorcycle insurers ignore these restriction kits and on many bigger cc motorbikes, they simply flat out to refuse to insure you.\r\nThe government has allowed us to take this test, to ride these bikes, legally and yet insurance companies won't cater to this. The government needs to address this issue, and force the insurance companies to recognise the restriction kits and alter their quotes and their rates accordingly.",
