        "additional_details": "Positive action is one of the Government's range of measures aimed at ending discrimination in the workplace under the Equality Act 2010.\r\n\r\nIn recruitment and promotion, it allows an employer, when faced with two or more candidates of equal merit, to select a candidate from a particular group (eg a particular racial group, age group or gender) that faces a disadvantage or is under-represented in its workforce over a candidate who isn't from that group, to achieve diversity in its workforce.\r\n\r\nHow it is fair to reject someone based on the colour of their skin or sexuality just because they are over-represented in a certain work place.\r\n\r\nPositive action is just another name for discrimination. Any employment should be based on skill alone, not someones background.\r\n\r\nThousands of hard workers are refused promotion and career progression because they don't 'tick a box'.\r\n\r\nAny form of discrimination is wrong no matter how you word it.\r\n\r\nIt's time to ban positive action.",
