This reduces their ability to manage their condition and increases their risk of serious illness,\r\n This is a ticking time bomb and could lead to much greater Government spending on health in the long term. In order to help people manage their conditions safely and ensure better health outcomes, the Government must address the ever increasing cost of prescriptions. We call on the Government to honour its commitment to make the prescription charges system in England fairer by: freezing prescription charges increasing awareness and uptake of prescription prepayment certificates and continuing the freeze on the cost of these certificates  and; aiming to make prescriptions free.\r\n\r\n\r\nSign this petition\r\n\r\nNot received your confirmation email?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
