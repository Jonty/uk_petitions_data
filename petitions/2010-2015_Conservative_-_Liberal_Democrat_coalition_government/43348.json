        "additional_details": "The NHS ambulance services, like other public sector bodies, have had their budgets slashed.\r\nThe East of England ambulance service for example, has to cut \u00a350 million over 5 years.\r\nThese measures will inevitably affect the service the public receive, and it is reasonable to predict lives will be put at risk.\r\nWhat we, the undersigned propose, is that the government recognises the difficulties faced by the NHS ambulance services, and eases their financial burden by the abolition of fuel duty for emergency and non-emergency ambulances.\r\n",
