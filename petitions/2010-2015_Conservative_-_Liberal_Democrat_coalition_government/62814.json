        "action": "Mandatory lengthy prison sentences for those convicted of the theft of military service medals",
        "additional_details": "Sentences imposed against those convicted of theft are often unduly lenient and the true impact of the crime on the victim is not sufficiently taken into account. Nor is there sufficient deterrent effect. One crime that is particularly abhorrent is the theft of service medals from Armed Forces personnel, veterans or their families. These awards very often have extremely high sentimental value and the originals cannot be replaced. Military personnel often have to risk life and limb, often over a period of years to be eligible for an award. This petition calls on HMG to enshrine in law mandatory very long prison sentences against all those convicted of the theft of or knowingly receiving or selling stolen military service medals and others such as Olympic medals or criminal handling thereof.",
