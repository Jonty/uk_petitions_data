Discretion is needed due to the complex reasons and circumstances that parents may find themselves in thus requiring leave in term time.\r\n\r\nShould headteachers feel a need for a penalty for a parent taking persistent unreasonable leave, then this should be open and available.\r\n\r\nWE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO REVERT BACK TO THIS POLICY BEFORE THE NEXT GENERAL ELECTION.\r\n",
