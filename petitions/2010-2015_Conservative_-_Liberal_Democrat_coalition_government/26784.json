        "additional_details": "Unfortunately, the great telegraph system that allowed Britons to communicate with one another and those that are abroad, has been severely damaged. The people of the United Kingdom require a system that would allow them communication at a near-instantaneous level, far faster than regular post. People have often missed, thanks to the relatively slow speed of the regular postal system, many important occasions due to a delayed or lost message. Many people do not have access to the 'internet' or 'electronic mail' and now, thanks to the loss of the General Post Office's telegraph facilities, they are unable to sent urgent messages at a sufficient pace. Therefore, This petition asks for the restoration of a telegraph service, preferably within the General Post Office.",
