        "additional_details": "With fuel prices on the upwards trend- too much for the general public to be able to afford paying for it and fossil fuels predicted by scientists to run out within the next 50 years, I would like to suggest for the coalition government to look into alternative fuel resources other than electric as that is still dependent on fossil fuels. One good example would be Hydrogen fuel cell technology as it is both environment friendly and hydorgen is abundant on Earth.",
