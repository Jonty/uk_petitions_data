        "additional_details": "Along with most British people, we opposed an attack on Iraq in 2003. At least half a million died and the country was devastated. Now, less than three years after US troops were pulled out, the US is bombing again. The British government is considering joining military action, not just in Iraq but in Syria too. All the experience of the varied military action taken by the west in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya shows that such interventions kill innocents, destroy infrastructure and fragment societies.\r\n\r\nWhile we all reject the politics and methods of Isis, we have to recognise that it is in part a product of the last disastrous intervention, which helped foster sectarianism and regional division. And further intervention will only exacerbate the situation. We urge the government to rule out any further military action in Iraq or Syria.",
