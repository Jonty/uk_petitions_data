        "additional_details": "The Oscar Pistorius trial centres on the charge of the killing of a defenceless young woman.  As such, it is unacceptable that betting companies in the UK (including Paddy Power) should be taking wagers on the result of a very serious criminal trial. Please join this petition to lean on UK government to ban betting companies from profiting from matters pertaining to domestic violence.",
