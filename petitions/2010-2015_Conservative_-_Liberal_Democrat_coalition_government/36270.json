        "additional_details": "SS Gairsoppa was returning from India when it was sunk by German U-Boats and hence it is highly likely that the silver on it belonged to Indian people. The UK is planning to keep 20% of it which is not going to make any difference to the treasury or to it's citizens. Should we not be brave enough to retun it to India and prove that we are a great nation? We've come a long way since WWII and I hope we can continue the progress.",
