The banks are not passing the money on to the people because they do not want them getting into even more debt.\r\n\r\nIt is time for the government to invest in its citizens rather than the banking system.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to pay off all its citizens' debts to enable them to start spending again, thus kick-starting the economy.\r\n\r\nThe money would have to pay off all existing debts and measures would be put in place to prevent citizens going back into debt.\r\n\r\nThose who are not in debt will also receive the same windfall.\r\n",
