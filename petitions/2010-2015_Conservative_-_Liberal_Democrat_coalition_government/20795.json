        "additional_details": "The government expects the general public to cope with managing their personal finances and make greater private provisions for retirement. However, has anyone ever taken the time to explain basic finance to the general public?\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose a basic finance course covering everything from current accounts, credit cards, ISAs, mortgages, pensions and even the Benefits System to all Year 9 classes (before the stress of GCSEs). The aim being that when they leave school after GSCEs/A Levels, they are prepared to cope with managing their finances.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel this especially pertinent now that many teenagers are facing high university charges, high levels of competition for jobs and apprenticeships and high levels of youth unemployment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you believe that you would've benefited from such education or that it would make a difference to you or your children's lives, please sign this petition.\r\n",
