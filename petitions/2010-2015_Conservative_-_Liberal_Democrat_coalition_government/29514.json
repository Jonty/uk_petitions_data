        "additional_details": "Danny Alexander has stated that he wants to remove the extra rate relief on personal pensions. This petition is to voice our determination that this has disastrous consequences and it is ill thought because\r\n1. It will remove incentive to save for retirement\r\n2. It will mean less money will be invested in personal pensions so when people retire, less tax will be paid to the treasury\r\n3. This was not in any party manifesto therefore not been voted for by the people\r\n4. This is not a tax saving as suggested as this is our money we are investing for our future - it is another tax raid\r\n5.  It will affect the squeezed middle more, people earning between 40k and 60k\r\n6.  Reduces incentive for those on lower earnings to strive to better their incomes as there is absolutely no incentive now to do so\r\n7. Taking away the reward for hard work, commitment to further educate themselves, motivation and persiverance as what is the reward for it now",
