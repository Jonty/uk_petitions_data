        "additional_details": "For far too long, the UK has allowed transglobal corporation influence, by lobbying and party finance, to steer governmental creation of legality, quite often in contrast to common law. This has resulted in the UK being dragged into financing wars and conquests that contravene the human rights of both its patrons, and overseas populations; moreover, financially creating unlawful debt creation for which the taxpayer has had to bear, despite it not being their doing; and corporation tax is being avoided to the mass detriment of the UK. No longer should we allow money to influence how our government serves the public interest. We should return to rule of common law. This would prevent investment in world atrocities and create equality in our lands again.",
