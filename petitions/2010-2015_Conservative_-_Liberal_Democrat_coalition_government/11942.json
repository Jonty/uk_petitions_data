Imagine what a entire estate would generate.  There are around 2.5 million council homes in the uk).\r\n\r\nWith 2.5 million homes fitted with solar panels CO2 emissions would dramatically drop.\r\n\r\nSo in short (more money for local councils)\r\nFewer emissions.\r\nAnd energy could be fed into the grid, meaning energy costs would reduce for non council tenants also saving money for everyone.\r\n",
