In other words amend the Part 1, Regulation 3 (Universal Credit Regulations) that states mixed age couples have no entitlement to Pension Credit.\r\n\r\n\u2028This regulation states that a mixed age couple will not be entitled to state pension credit and will be treated as a working age household.\r\n\r\nThis could be resolved with the inclusion of a pensioner premium within Universal Credit for couples such as us. This would need to be added to Part 4: the elements of an award of the regulations and reflect more accurately the current situation where a couple with one person above pension age and one below pension age (a \u2018mixed-age\u2019 couple) are entitled claim pension credit.",
