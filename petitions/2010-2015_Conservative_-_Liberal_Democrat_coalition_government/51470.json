        "additional_details": "We, the residents of North Tyneside are against the merger between Kings School, Tynemouth (fee paying school) and Priory Primary School,Tynemouth (local authority school) to make 'Kings Priory Academy', which will be government funded.\r\nWe strongly believe the selection criteria has excluded a vast majority of North Tyneside children (with even children residing in Tynemouth itself being excluded from the selection criteria).  The initial consultations kept residents very much in the dark.  The negative ripple effect will be felt by local nurseries (especially local authority Sir James Knott nursery in Tynemouth), primary schools, high schools and colleges/sixth forms.\r\nNorth Tyneside have proposed a judicial review into this merger-we are in favour of this going ahead ",
