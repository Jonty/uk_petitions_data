        "additional_details": "It is time to acknowledge that the reforms of the 1980's have failed the country miserably. It is time to debate the merits of returning to the ideals of the CEGB. Costs associated with energy suppliers, including connections, transmission, distribution and generation are higher than ever before, even after inflation. The conflict between multiple government bodies (OFGEM, DECC, others) does not inspire confidence from either the consumer or industry bodies. The lack of any central authority inspires no confidence in the ability of the country to cope with the future. Existing investment plans are heavily subsidised anyway. Recentralising it would solidify our long term plan for the common good.",
