This would be an enormous and permanent threat to the heart of Acton which, instead, could have a master plan that embraces the potential of a public space/town square here \u2013 opening up, linking, and regenerating Acton High Street and Churchfield Road. A town square could be a magnet for social, cultural and commercial use, as well as residential use; a gated community would be a deterrent to Acton\u2019s regeneration.\r\n\r\n",
