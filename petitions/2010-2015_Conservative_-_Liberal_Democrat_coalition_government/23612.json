        "additional_details": "The Government announced on 21st November 2011 its intention to promote large scale housing development including whole new market towns with up to 10,000 homes. Their press release can be found at: http://www.communities.gov.uk/news/newsroom/2033731. Is this want we want? A substantial amount of demand for housing is due to rapid immigration and one person house ownership, so the Government should look at these causes first. We can't keep building homes to satisfy these demands. Our country is already short of gas, electricity and water, so how can increasing demand be justified? The government should reverse the plans announced on 21st November 2011 and consider instead reducing the demand for housing, as this situation is not sustainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
