        "additional_details": "Mis fueling at the pumps is more common then people realise. People accidently put petrol into a diesel vehicle or the other way round.\r\n Having a vehicle cleaned because of misfueling can be very costly. I suggest a helpful solution to this is not to have petrol pumps and diesel pumps side by side. That way a driver cannot accidently pick up the wrong fuel hose. But garages need to do more to prevent these accidents happening. Needs goverment action to implement.",
