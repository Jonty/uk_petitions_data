The health benefits of encouraging cycling outweigh the risks of being helmetless.\r\n\r\nCyclists should be responsible and safe, and the evidence shows that compulsory helmet wearing is a backward step.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cyclehelmets.org/1139.html\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cycle-helmets-safety-essential-or-health-risk-2328003.html",
