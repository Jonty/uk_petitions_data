        "additional_details": "Foreign aid is being handed out to countries such as India, which have publicly stated they do not require it, and to countries like Nigeria, that are so corrupt it is likely the citizens of that country don't see any of the money. We are currently borrowing money, which ultimately we pay interest on, before we just hand this  out to other countries. Therefore, allow the public to vote on whether to continue aid to certain countries, and let us decide whether OUR taxes should be used first and formost, towards lifting OUR country out of our current situation.",
