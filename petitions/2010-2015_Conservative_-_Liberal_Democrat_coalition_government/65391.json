        "additional_details": "On the 22nd of May 2013, Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered in Woolwich, South East London. Despite calls for a memorial to be created,this has been rejected by both a local MP and the local council. I believe that this is wholly wrong and that a memorial should be created as a tribute to Lee Rigby.\r\nThis is a belief that has been referenced by Lyn Rigby who today (22/05/2014), backed calls for a memorial to be placed in Woolwich.\r\n\r\nTherefore I would ask Greenwich Council to reconsider their decision and place a memorial as a mark if respect.",
