Cameron and Clegg, STOP TAKING MONEY OFF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE THE MONEY AND ARE CONTINUING TO TURNING. DONT TAX THE SUCCESSFUL. TAX THE PEOPLE THAT EVADE TAX, TOUGHEN PUNISHMENT AND ABOVE ALL HARDEN THE BOUNDARIES OF OUR GREAT NATION. WINSTON CHURCHILL WOULD STUB HIS CIGAR OUT IN HIS ASHTRAY AND SEND YOU BACK TO SCHOOL.",
