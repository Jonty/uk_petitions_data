        "additional_details": "The European Convention on Human rights is being used as a tool to circumvent the rule of Law in the UK. We are prevented from implementing our own laws and regulations by this interfering Convention which does not protect the majority but instead perverts natural justice, protects criminals from being sent to their country of origin and challenges British legislation. It is too meddlesome and should be replaced by a British convention on Human Rights which is based around the rights of the majority of law abiding British citizens.",
