        "additional_details": "Polls show the majority of the Public want the former Nationalised Utilities and NHS to be re-nationalised and democracy dictates the government should carry out the will of the majority of the people. Without direct control over the essential services Governments have no direct ability to put people first ahead of profits which any civilised society should do. Many of the profits now being made by the former utilities are going abroad and in some cases to foreign Governments. We call on the Government to re-nationalise the previous utilities as soon as possible.",
