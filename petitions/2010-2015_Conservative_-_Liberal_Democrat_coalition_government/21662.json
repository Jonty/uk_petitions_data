        "additional_details": "The requirement for volunteer drivers licensed after 1997 to hold a PCV license to drive a 9-16 seat minibus over 4.25 tonnes MAM hinders the provision of rural transport as non-profit Community Transport Operators cannot afford to train volunteers to PCV and there are very few vehicles under this weight suitable for rural bus routes. The MAM limit should be exempted for volunteer community transport so that Category B licenses can operate 9-16 seat buses over 4.25 tonnes MAM when in Section 19 or 22 operation, just as pre-1997 D1-entitled volunteers can. There is no impact on safety as CTO volunteers take non-compulsory MiDAS training.",
