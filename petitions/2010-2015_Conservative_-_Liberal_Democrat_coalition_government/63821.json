It looks to me like the Police are just trying to make BNP look a disgrace!\r\nI know many people do not like BNP but they are a legal organisation and Police should therefore let all people from legal organisations work for them.\r\nI heard an officer got sacked from Merseyside Police simply for being a BNP member, he has done no wrong.\r\nJust because someone is a BNP member it does not mean they cannot do Police duty. People just do not understand BNP.",
