        "additional_details": "I want to put the topic of cannabis use up for rational debate in Parliament. Politicians are there to represent the views of the people they serve. For too long they have ignored not only public interest, but scientific enquiry as shown by the sacking of Professor David Nutt and the resignation in protest by Dr Les King. Holland has identified the risks in strong cannabis use by putting stronger variants on a par with drugs such as cocaine and heroin. The varying strengths and side effects are why millions of people travel to Amsterdam for expertise and choice, rather than what is given in a \u00a320 wrap off a drug dealer. In the UK, it is thanks to Government policy and Police tactics that cannabis use is all but decriminalised. Our liberal values have prevailed but the dangers of cannabis use are evident. Education, legislation, taxation, rational debate and scientific enquiry are needed, not political knee jerk reactions.\r\n\r\nSign if you wish for knowledge and not political rhetoric.",
