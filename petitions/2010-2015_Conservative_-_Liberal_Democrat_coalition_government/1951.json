        "additional_details": "1) - The government should offer the vote only to those people who have paid income tax in the last 2 years. (or similar sensible period associated with contribution to the country). 2)- Those who work but don't pay tax should have the right to vote. Due to low income jobs or registered carers for example. 3) - Pensioners with a history of contibution should have the right to vote also\r\n\r\nThis could be administered using HMRC records. This would promote a sense of citizenship and fiscal responsibility among the voting population as only those who contributed to taxes (or had during their life) would be able to vote. It would help reduce a culture of governments promising benefits/ payouts in order to win votes which is financially unsustainable for the country and results in cycles of increasing national debt/ deficits before periods of austerity.",
