        "additional_details": "I am a wheelchair user with cerebral palsy and mental health problems and I myself have been a victim of the lack of support that is available to individuals with disabilities when faced with court proceedings.\r\n\r\nI was forced to represent myself in a bankruptcy court procedure (despite being solvent) while the other party had complete representation. This was because I could not find representation from a Legal Aid solicitor in spite of being eligible for Legal Aid.\r\n\r\nI am not the only one who has been let down and I have heard of other vulnerable individuals who have found themselves embroiled in court proceedings without support. Legal Aid and support for vulnerable individuals with disabilities is quite clearly failing!\r\n\r\nThe government needs to take into account what actually happens in reality. The government needs to provide further funding and promote solicitor involvement in the Legal Aid scheme to prevent miscarriages of justice. ",
