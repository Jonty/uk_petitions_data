        "additional_details": "The recent London riots have proved that prison sentences are not a deterrent anymore.  Most prisons now have gyms, pool tables, sky tv and are more like holiday camps.  For someone coming out of prison who has nothing and has to find work, the easiest thing to get food and lodging is to commit another crime and go back to prison.  Prisons should be a place that deter people from committing crimes, the current prisons are too nice and some people in todays society thinks it's something to brag about.  Make our prisons a place to dread....not a place to get a bed.",
