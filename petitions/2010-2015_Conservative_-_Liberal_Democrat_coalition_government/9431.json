        "additional_details": "A number of people (approx 60 so far based on recent media reports) have been evacuated from their homes following fire and structual damage caused in the London riots.  Most left with just the clothes they were wearing at the time and are now staying in emergency shelters or with family/friends. Their homes now uninhabitable and possessions will never be recovered.\r\n\r\nLondon has thousands of vacant properties and I urge the Government to \"gift\" a home to these people.  Give them a chance to rebuild their broken lives and move forward. Make 2011 be remembered as not the year they lost their home, instead the year they were given a home, Government support and renewed faith for a fresh start.",
