        "additional_details": "This petition, if actually recognized by the government would stop 1st generation immigrants from claiming benefits. They come to our country to work and that's what they must do, not sap off our deeply flawed benefits system. As most immigrants are low skilled workers this would force them to find a job. The offspring of the immigrants could claim benefits however, as they now have the opportunity to become a high skilled worker.",
