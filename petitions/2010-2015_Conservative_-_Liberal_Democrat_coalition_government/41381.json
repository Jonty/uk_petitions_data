        "additional_details": "Environmentally friendly alternatives to polypropylene and other plastics are beginning to be developed.\r\nAs one example of this, NatureWorks, a division of Cargill, has developed a corn-based plastic called polylactic acid (PLA).\r\nWhile it looks and functions like other plastics, PLA is fully biodegradable because it is derived from plant-based materials. Whether it is composted or landfilled, PLA will biodegrade into its constituent organic parts, though there are debates as to how long that process takes.\r\nCoca-Cola has started experimenting with replacing its traditional plastic soda bottles with a corn-based alternative.\r\nAs part of its green overhaul, Wal-Mart in the USA announced it would replace 114 million plastic produce containers a year with PLA varieties, sparing about 800,000 barrels of oil annually.",
