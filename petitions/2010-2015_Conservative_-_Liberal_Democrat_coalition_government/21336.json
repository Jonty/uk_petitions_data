Some fortunate well-off people do not need their benefits and may prefer that their benefits be paid directly to worthy causes of their choice. It had been calculated that if only 1% of those in receipt of winter payments prefer to donate them, it will be worth \u00a324 million. Such nominated donations should not supplement or replace HMG allocation of resources however. Worthy causes could include donating them to national job creation schemes, supporting fledging industries in return for shares in them, supporting the genuine homeless, help the aged, donating the purchase of expensive lifesaving medical equipment & research.
