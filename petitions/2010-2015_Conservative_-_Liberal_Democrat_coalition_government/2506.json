        "additional_details": "I believe stamp duty when buying a property should be much fairer.  Most family homes in the South East are well over the \u00a3250,000 threshold and therefore families are paying 3% on the whole property value.  I believe the govenment should look at the following options;\r\n\r\n1) Changing the thesholds by region.  The average house price in the North of England is \u00a3142,800 compared to the south of england which is \u00a3273,334.  Therefore a family buying a average sized house is going to cost the average family in the south over \u00a38,200 in stamp duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) If the govenment insists in keeping the current thesholds, then 1% should be charged upto \u00a3250,000 and then 3% should only be charged for any value over the \u00a3250,000 and NOT for the whole amount.  This should also apply to propertys in other stamp duty bands.\r\n\r\n",
