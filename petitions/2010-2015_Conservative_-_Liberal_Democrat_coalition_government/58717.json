        "additional_details": "On 24 Dec 2013, computer pioneer and codebreaker Alan Turing was given a posthumous royal pardon.\r\n\r\nThough Turing was instrumental in cracking German Enigma codes at Bletchley Park during WW2 he was convicted of homosexuality in 1952 and punished with chemical castration. He (allegedly) took his own life in 1954.\r\n\r\nConvention says that a person cannot be knighted after their death. Isn\u2019t it time that the system was adjusted to allow for aberrations such as the case of Turing?\r\n\r\nBritish actress Maureen Lipman proposed this idea on the BBC Radio 4 \u2018Broadcasting House\u2019 programme on Dec 29 2013. Turing\u2019s life will be documented by Hollywood in 2014 with the release of \u2018The Imitation Game\u2019.\r\n\r\nWill the government be able to modify the Honours rules before the movie is released so Turing can be knighted? The world will be watching the UK.\r\n\r\nBBC News: Turing Pardon\r\nhttp://j.mp/1ajev4z\r\n\r\nBBC Broadcasting House\r\nhttp://j.mp/1fWdPWW\r\n\r\nThe Imitation Game\r\nhttp://j.mp/1h9v5f7",
