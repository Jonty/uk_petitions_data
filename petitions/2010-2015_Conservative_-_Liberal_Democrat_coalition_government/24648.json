Today public sector works are on strike over cuts in their pensions. I thinks we can make cuts elsewhere. Namely MP's expenses. In these times of austerity I don't think it's right that people earning \u00a365,000 a year should have extra money just to do their jobs. The average worker doesn't receive extra money to get to work, to eat at work or do any of the other things MP's claim for. When they are earning a significantly higher wage than the national average they should have to pay for the same things that we all do.\r\nMP's shouldn't receive any expenses,they should pay for things using their wages just like the rest of the country.",
