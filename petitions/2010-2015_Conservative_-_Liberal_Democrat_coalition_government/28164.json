Our arguement is that the only reason that the A556 is used as a trunk road is that there is no way of moving from the M6 to the M56 and vice versa without coming off it!  Surely one can see that it would be preferable to all to be able to keep on the motorway when travelling across country.  It has been archived that when the M56 was built, that this was a glaring ommision.",
