        "additional_details": "Cats, both domestic and feral are a nuisance and a health problem.\r\nCats allowed to roam, often 24 hrs a day, urinate and defecate in gardens causing health problems, typically by spreading the 'Toxoplasma gondii'  parasite, as well as simply being unpleasant for both children and adults.\r\nIn addition, they regularly predate on small songbirds especially during breeding seasons.\r\nCat fights and caterwauling can be extremely disturbing when woken from sleep in the dead of the night.\r\nNo other domesticated pet is free to exhibit such anti-social behaviour and should be curtailed.\r\nI petition that ownership and care of cats should be on an equal status to that of dogs and other domesticated pet animals.",
