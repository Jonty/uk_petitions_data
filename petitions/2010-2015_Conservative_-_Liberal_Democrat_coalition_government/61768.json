I think we need a review of the entire charity sector and when they are using these adverts the charity in question must have on the same page as the advert how much of every pound goes to the cause so as an example 80p in every 100p. After watching the Public Accounts Committee investigating the Charity Commission I am now more than ever sure that this sector needs reviewing.",
