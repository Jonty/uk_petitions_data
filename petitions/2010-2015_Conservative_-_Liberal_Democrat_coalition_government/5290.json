        "additional_details": "Roundabouts are self regulating so traffic lights are not required in most cases. Traffic lights are expensive to install and maintain. Vehicles have to stop even when the way is clear; this wastes time, fuel and adds unnecessary carbon dioxide to the environment. If a feasibility study indicates that a certain roundabout would benefit from traffic lights, make them part-time only, i.e. operational only at peak times. This should aid traffic flow in all circumstances and could be applied to all roundabouts.",
