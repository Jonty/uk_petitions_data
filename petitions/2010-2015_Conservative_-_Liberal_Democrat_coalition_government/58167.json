        "additional_details": "This petition hopes to draw attention to the poor treatment of modern football fans and put it to a stop.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that previous bad behaviour by football \"fans\" has led to the victimisation of today's fans. We are a completely new generation and yet are still often treated like cattle.\r\n\r\nGeneral issues involve:\r\nKO times changed to inconvenient hours in order to suit police needs.\r\nOccasionally fans forced to travel a certain route in order to be allowed to collect tickets and therefore attend a match.\r\nHeavy-handed police who create problems out of nothing within stands.\r\nFans having to remain behind after full-time (can result in missing trains etc).\r\nNo alcohol in stands (what makes football fans different to music fans).\r\nClub bans handed out for minor crimes committed away from football.\r\nHarsh sentences for football fans relative to regular citizens.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to review the police action at stadiums across the country.
