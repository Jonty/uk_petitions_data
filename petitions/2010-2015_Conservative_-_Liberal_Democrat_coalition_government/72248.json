Costs to be partially funded by the tax payer & partially by citizens applying for the licence. ABSOLUTELY NO SUBSIDIES FOR ANYONE WISHING TO APPLY.  The application to involve an interview whereby the local authority can determine the eligibility of the applicant. Carrying without a licence should incur extremely harsh punishment.",
