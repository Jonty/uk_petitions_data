How is Government benefited out of this.\r\n\r\nThis is causing a lot of families to split and not been able to meet thier parents for a long time. The children of these parents are all settled here in the UK and working and due to the work they are not allowed to visit parents on long term basis and care for them but the parents are old and retired so they can move around but the Governement doesnot allow them to visit the country.\r\n\r\nI understand the governement is trying to cut immigration for the EU citizens so there are more jobs for the British but how a old aged frail parent can poach British jobs.\r\n\r\nTHESE RULES ARE UNFAIR AND NEEDS TO BE CHANGED SOON....",
