Just because students are working a lot harder to get higher grades doesn't mean that exams are getting easier, as a student that has recently done them I am well aware of how hard all students actually find GCSE's and how hard they work towards them. Getting rid of GCSE's for E-BAC's is a very bad choice and perhaps Michael Gove should be replaced with someone that actually has some knowledge of modern education.\r\n\r\nI also believe that the exams should become much more coursework based for one huge reason, coursework tests your knowledge of a subject, all that exams do is test how good you are at taking exams they barely test your knowledge of the subject.",
