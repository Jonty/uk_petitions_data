        "additional_details": "The current system uses the same limited claim form, doctors\u2019 information request and medical assessment form regardless of the disability/ illness of the person claiming.  These \u201cone size fits all\u201d forms are not fit for purpose and, it seems, do not provide a full and true picture of a claimants condition(s) so it can be correctly assessed.   This may be one reason for the high percentage of successful appeals we have heard of lately.  A person entitled to this help has enough to cope with without having to \u201cfight\u201d for what is rightfully theirs.\r\nThe assessment physical tasks which take only a few minutes in total cannot accurately determine a person\u2019s abilities.\r\nToo many of those who desperately need DLA are being turned down.  Are we prepared to see these people neglected?  Are we going to let the small amount of bogus claimants stop us from caring for those who are suffering?   I say NO and I hope you do too.  Please sign.  Every name counts.\r\n",
