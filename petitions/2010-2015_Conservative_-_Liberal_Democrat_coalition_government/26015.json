        "additional_details": "The US government is pushing through a law that will damage the internet globally, effecting UK business, in that smaller businesses and creative individuals will have far greater difficulty getting a foot up in the marketplace.\r\nIt also causes freedom of speech issues, as the sites that are affected are also used as platforms of political speech, and it can be used by corporations to suppress negative press that is in the public interest.\r\n\r\nIf this government believes in a future where the internet remains free and accessible to all, it should pressure Washington into dropping the SOPA and PIPA bills currently being forced into law.",
