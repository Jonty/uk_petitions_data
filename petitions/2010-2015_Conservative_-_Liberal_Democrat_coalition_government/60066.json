        "additional_details": "Nuclear waste disposal is an important topic with discussions raging about just how the country and indeed world can dispose of Nuclear waste in a way which does not damage the environment or hamr locals.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this could be to fire Nuclear waste into space.\r\n\r\nOur country should invest funding into developing functioning Mass Drivers in order to achieve this rather than spending funds and time arguing about where to hide waste. This would give the UK a way to dispose of Nuclear waste harmlessly and allow us to do so for other countries for a charge.",
