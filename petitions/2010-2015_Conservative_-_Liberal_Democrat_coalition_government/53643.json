        "additional_details": "We petition the Government to review the impact of the smoking ban on pubs and clubs and consider an amendment that would give licensees the option of separate well-ventilated smoking rooms.\r\nThe smoking ban has effected pubs all around Britain, since the ban on smoking was introduced.\r\nIf the ban was lifted for pubs and clubs, trade on these premises will become a great business again. People would now rather sit at home with a cheap larger than go to their local, with more than 20 pubs closing each week.\r\nThis needs to stop, let pub owners offer a full smoking pub, half smoking pub (with well-ventilated room) or no smoking at all.",
