        "additional_details": "Create a UK and US trade agreement to trade David Cameron, the Conservative Party and Nigel Farage for President Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nThe country should be unwilling to have leaders in our country who do not think about others at the heart of their policies. We want dynamic leadership which cares about every man, woman or child on the street from whichever country they come from.\r\n\r\nThe UK is about being a diverse society that accepts we have a rich culture by welcoming other nations.\r\n\r\nWe feel President Barack Obama would have the opportunity with a wider mandate to implement his plans in the UK. He is as one individual more than equal worth to David Cameron, the Conservative Party and Nigel Farage put together.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition. Let your voice be heard. Let us actually create the country we want. ",
