        "additional_details": "As a Hong Konger, I strongly disagree with what Ethan Turner mentioned in his E-Petition, \"Democracy in Hong Kong\". The majority of Hong Kongers do not want the British rules anymore, since we do not want to become the second-class citizens again; we also do not need the travel document, BN(O). In addition, in the 21st century, no one with a good conscience wants a place, especially his/her homeland, to become a colony that has no democracy. During the colonial time, all Hong Kong governors were appointed by the British government, but now we can elect our Hong Kong Chief Executive in 2017, so we have no reasons to ask the British to come back and hate our current Hong Kong government.",
