        "additional_details": "people have proven that we have unreleased technology such as unlimited energy. why does the government still claim they do not have this technology. they will continue to carry on this lie until the contry is out of poverty in the mean while hundreds if not thousands of elderly people will die because they can not afford to pay there heating bills the government is essentually killing people for profit which is a crime. Another arguement you could say is that if you see someone is about to be killed it is our duty to try and help them as best as possible so why is the government not doing the same it is our human right to be happy and to make our living more comfortable and not having to worry about bills would change everyone and make them be happy and give them more money to buy other things crime rates will go down we can stop this rubbish about going to other countrys to find oil we wouldnt need any of it and the world could start being more unified",
