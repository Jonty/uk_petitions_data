To be genuinely reflective and reduce the influence of unelected lobbyists, media outlets and companies and ensure parties engage in genuine dialogue with the whole country Parliament must be reformed. Constitencies should be re-drawn 400 MPs should be directly elected for maximum 5 year terms; 250 should be called to serve for a year by a lottery of everyone who is registered to vote.",
