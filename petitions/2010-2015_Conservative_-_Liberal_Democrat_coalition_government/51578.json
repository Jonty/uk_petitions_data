        "additional_details": "As the law stands, if A threatens to kill B if he does not kill C, then B will be convicted of murder but A will not. In my opinion this is completely unfair as it expects ordinary people to sacrifice their own life or the lives of their family e.g. Is it fair that a mother should be charged with murder when someone has threatened to kill her child if she does not? I believe that the government should introduce a law that ensures that duress can be used as a defence to reduce murder to manslaughter in such situations.",
