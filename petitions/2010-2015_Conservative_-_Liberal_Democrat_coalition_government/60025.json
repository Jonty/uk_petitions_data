It is not cruel to have human ears pierced tongues pierced or even private parts pierced or cut if the cropping makes the dog look good and the owner is happy with this then there shouldnot be a problem\r\nI'm hoping to get enough signatures to introduce cropping and docking in uk just like other European Asian countries ",
