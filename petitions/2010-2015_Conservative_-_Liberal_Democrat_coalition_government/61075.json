        "additional_details": "This e-petition is aimed at the Travel Insurance Companies who currently cover people who have or had cancer.  At the moment it is difficult for anyone who is or has suffered from cancer to obtain travel insurance.  The limited companies who actually cover us then offer policies that can cost more than the holiday covered.  The formatted questions under the pre-existing medical conditions are so general that the company cannot possibly know enough about the person requiring cover.  This needs to be looked into and the questions need modifying.  Someone who has gone through cancer and it's treatments surely deserves to be treated like everyone else and not penalised for having been ill.  Please sign this          e-petition if you agree that the Travel Insurance Industry needs to be investigated for this matter.",
