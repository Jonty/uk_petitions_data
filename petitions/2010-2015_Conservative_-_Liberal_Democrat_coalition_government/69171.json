        "additional_details": "Urenco have submitted 2 Planning applications to build over 700 car park spaces along Rectory Lane and Ledsham Lane in Capenhurst and Ledsham. 14/03524/FUL & 14/03525/FUL.  The main issue is public safety and traffic throughout the village. It is single lane outside Fox covert, the road is national speed limit and when two cars meet, cars often mount the pathway at speed and drive along this where accidents happen, In areas there are no footpaths or lighting, &visibility is poor. The noise and light pollution will destroy the rural greenbelt country lane.  The council are pushing for a quick response and any objections are only being received online and not by mail.  Some residents are elderly and have no means of internet to submit their objections. The village has not been notified properly and fairly about the applications.  ",
