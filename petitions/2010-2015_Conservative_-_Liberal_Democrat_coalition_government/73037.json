        "additional_details": "School starts way too early In the UK. Most schools expect you to arrive at 8:30 which means lots of pupils have to wake up at around 7:00 or earlier just to get there on time. This means that students will be tired and possibly stressed out for the rest of the day which, consequently, means that they are not focused enough to concentrate in class. This means that levels will be lower and students will not achieving  as much as they should be. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I hope you agree.",
