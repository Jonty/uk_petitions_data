        "additional_details": "Morrisons chesterfield have a designated smoking area next to the area in which baby trollies are kept. This is also next to the parent and toddler parking area. I requested the smoking area be moved but instead the trollies have been moved. Moving the trollies means parents have to walk with babies in arms/cars eats through  a busy car park then navigate the trolley through the car park to the entrance of the supermarket. I believe the smokers should be moved and the safety of babies should not be jeopardised.",
