        "additional_details": "I want the procedures for stopping drivers on motorways to be changed.\r\n\r\nThe hard shoulder is for emergency use only. When we break down on the motorway we are advised to leave our vehicle on the hard shoulder and get to a safe area preferably behind a crash barrier if there is one available.\r\n\r\nWhen we are stopped by the police we are pulled onto the hard shoulder and told to sit in the back of the police car usually with the rest of the family still inside the car. The police are putting the lives of innocent people at risk on a daily basis and as an HGV driver of some years I can tell you I have narrowly missed hitting police cars and the vehicle they have pulled due to gusts of wind. This procedure MUST stop immediately. VOSA pull lorries by pulling in front of them and turning on a sign that says \"follow me\" the lorry then follows VOSA to a safe area OFF the motorway completely, why can't the police adopt this procedure?\r\n\r\nAct today and save a life.
