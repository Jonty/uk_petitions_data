It is not only against the law for formula milk to be promoted or advertised but also for it to be included in any discount offers or loyalty bonus point schemes.\r\n\r\nIt is disproportionate to the aim of encouraging breastfeeding to discriminate against formula feeding parents in this way. Having offers on formula or allowing bonus points would not encourage more parents to use it, after all breast milk is free! It would however make a difference to formula feeding parents, making it seem a little less demonised.\r\n\r\nA small change to the regs is requested to remove the parts re advertising and sale. ",
