        "additional_details": "The BBC Television Centre located in Wood Lane, White City, London has not only brought together the most amazing talent from writers, producers, technicians, directors to actors and actress's but allows all to focus, to be inspired. Resulting in the most amazing amount of top quality television work produced over the past fifty years in the world. It has inspired generations world wide. The building is a unique, one time, purpose built structure that enthralls everything that you need in the field of television that nothing better is possible. It is part of our culture, who we are. The centre must not be turned into a sterile hotel and museum of which we have many. Losing one of the great buildings it's purpose whilst disbanding the focus of inspiration resulting in poor quality TV and fragmentation of raw tallent. It should be fully reinstated and refurbished to the greatest television centre in the world as it once was.\r\n ",
