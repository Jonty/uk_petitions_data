        "additional_details": "Too many cyclists, and other vulnerable road users not protected by a metal frame and legislation, are killed and injured by drivers eventually sentenced to minor sentences as police are unable to enforce anything other than \"causing death by careless driving\". A 6 month prison sentence and an 18 month driving ban is not enough to deter aggressive, dangerous and anti-social behaviour by some vehicle drivers on their own - they need reviewing to protect the growing number of road users who use the public highway using any vehicle other than a motorised one.\r\n\r\nOur roads are getting more congested every year, and recent studies have shown the number one deterrent to people taking a bicycle rather than a car is driver behaviour. I propose that the driver of a motor vehicle in an incident, whether it causes death or injury, should be assumed to be 100% at fault unless it can be proven otherwise. ",
