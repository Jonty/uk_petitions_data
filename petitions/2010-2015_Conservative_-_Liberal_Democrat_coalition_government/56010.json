By creating a \"not for profit\" company all profit would be pumped back into the services and this should cut costs as there will be no greedy shareholders creaming off from the top. The services that so many old & vulnerable people rely on should not be exploited by those greedy few who just want money and have no conscience or thought for anyone else!  ",
