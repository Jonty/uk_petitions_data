We hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be an embargo on ALL political parties except UKIP which is being barraged with what is perceived to be damaging news reports when, in fact, the obvious result is that support for UKIP is increasing exponentially.  The people need time to reflect on what politicians have said but cannot do so in this circus of political discrimination against one party or another - nothing to do with their promises or policies.  We MUST be given 7 days before any election TOTALLY free from political comment or party bashing in ALL of our media outlets.",
