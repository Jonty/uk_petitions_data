        "additional_details": "The petition is to stop Royal Mail describing its main  postal service as First Class.\r\nThe description First Class is miss leading and only rarely complies with Royal Mails claim that 1st class items arrive within 1 working day. They do not,the majority of 1st class items mailed only arrive on the 2nd working day and in many many cases up to 5 days.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not right that Royal Mail should be allowed to describe this service as 1st class when it clearly is not.\r\nIt is a miss leading description and could also be classed as false advertising due to Royal Mail continually failing (in some cases purposely) to deliver mail within the specified 24 hrs.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to stop Royal Mail using the description 1st class for its mail services.\r\n\r\nStandard service better suits their description of this mail service.",
