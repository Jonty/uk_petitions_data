This is both unfair, and bizarre.\r\n\r\nCitizens of EU countries on the electoral roll are of course entitled to vote in Local and European elections.  Due to an accident of history, citizens from Ireland and the Commonwealth may also vote for MPs.  Given all of the other barriers that have come down across the EU, it is therefore surely all the more odd that EU citizens are excluded from Parliamentary elections.\r\n\r\nThe 1918 Representation of the People Act should be updated to allow the UK resident EU citizens the right to vote in Parliamentary elections.
