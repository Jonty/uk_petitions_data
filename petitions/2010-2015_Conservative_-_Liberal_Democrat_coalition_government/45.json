        "additional_details": "Usage of Internet Explorer 6 by government departments is creating significant extra costs for the government. The costs of changing have been unrealistically overstated previously, and the government advice on this issue so far appears to be just plain wrong. IE6 is the least standards aware browser of all, and it is commonly understood that UK Government now represents the significant rump of users refusing to update to a standards aware browser. This also has significant costs to the UK creative industry, and this petition calls for the UK government to immediately start phasing out this very outdated browser that even Microsoft themselves no longer want to be used.",
