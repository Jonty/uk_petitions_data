        "additional_details": "Hi everyone, I'm sure there are many people who will agree with me that different school holidays for primary and secondary school are a joke. I have 2 children, one in primary and one in secondary, my eldest is now off for 2 weeks and my son breaks up this week for 2 weeks.. That's 3 weeks altogether that although it does not effect me being at home with my youngest child anyway, it DOES, however, effect so many working parents...\r\n\r\nwho can take 3 weeks holidays???...\r\nCan you afford to get childcare???...\r\nIt also makes it difficult to book a holiday if the children aren't off together.. Etc..\r\n\r\nI needed to vent my frustration and see how many others agree and hopefully get our view across and heard. My view is... All schools in each area should have the same school holidays, who's with me??...\r\n\r\nPlease sign now!\r\n\r\nThanks",
