        "additional_details": "Free school meals are only available for those families who are in receipt of income support, job seekers allowance, child tax credits  without working tax credits,\r\nstate pension credit &  empolyment and support allowance.   School dinners cost  \u00a32.10 per day per child yet there are those families who only receive \u00a38.50 a week working tax credit and are therefore not  eligible for free school meals, so if you have  2 children at school and you want to provide them with a hot meal at school  \u00a38.50  simply doesn't stretch . Worse  I propose that if you receive under  \u00a320 a week working tax credits you should be eligible for either  free school meals or half price school meals.  After all if you are in Receipt of working tax credits shows that you need the income boost in order to provide for your family!!",
