Why is our money being given to such an abhorrent Government?\r\n\r\nUganda appears 140 of 175 countries on the Transparency International index, proven to be one of the most corrupt in the World.  Why is our money being given to such a corrupt Government?\r\n\r\nThe UK Government should create a charter which details the terms under which aid should be granted to other countries which reflects the views and opinions of it\u2019s people.",
