        "additional_details": "Taking one and two pence coins out of circulation will bring benefit to the economy for the following reasons.\r\n\r\nThey cost more to make than they are worth.\r\n\r\nContinuing inflation means their value falls steadily all the time. (which exacerbates the previously stated problem.)\r\n\r\nThey are essentially out of circulation already since they are not used for transactions most of the time but rather stored.\r\n\r\nThey waste people's time during attempts at utilising one and two pence coins.\r\n\r\nNew Zealand, Australia, Finland and the Netherlands have already done this and experienced not inflation or drop in charitable donations.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is sound for the economy to take one and two pence coins out of circulation and round all transactions to the nearest 5 pence.\r\n",
