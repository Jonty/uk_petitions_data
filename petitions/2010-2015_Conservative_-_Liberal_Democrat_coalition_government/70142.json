        "additional_details": "In 1895 Oscar Wilde was convicted of \"gross indecency\" (homosexual behavour) and sentenced to two years hard labour, which played a significant role in his early demise.\r\n\r\nOscar Wilde was an awesome character, a prolific and astonishingly skilled author of both novels and plays, such as \"The Importance of Being Earnest\", \"A Woman of No Importance\" and \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\".  He is one of greatest literary talents ever to put pen to paper whose oligarchy use of language is simply sublime.\r\n\r\nEven without his many and splendid accomplishments it is surely time to pardon a man who's only crime was that he was ahead of his time.  His belief that any man or woman should be free to love any other man or woman is now seen as a bastion of a free and liberal society.  The UK now supports gay right and gay marriage, we see the virtue of love in all it's forms.",
