My flat is in a Georgian building, converted well before the year 2000.\r\n\r\nI want the government to look into providing grants to help everyone in a similar situation who cannot afford an approx minimum \u00a320,000 to try and improve the situation. After all, we wouldn't have to live in flats if we could afford that kind of money.\r\n\r\nI would also like to see noise factors included in surveys when buying or renting new property. ",
