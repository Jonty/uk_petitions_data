        "additional_details": "When we want the best for our children we ensure they have the best.  Chidrens shoes from companies like Clarkes and Start Rite ensure the childrens feet are nurtured whilst growing.  They are also tax free to encourage adults to help look after their childrens feet.  So why are they allowed to charge huge prices for this service?  They know they have an almost monopoly on this business and this should not be allowed.  Gas, Electric companies etc have rules they have to abide to, so why does this not apply to childrens measured shoes.  Eye test, dentist etc are free through NHS and I am not asking for this,don't sacrifice the health of childrens feet becase of  a rediculous price.  The government should manage this as they have monopoly on their product.  Its a health issue not a fashion issue, and should be treated as such.  Please support this campaign get the government to help us do our best for our children",
