        "additional_details": "I believe the no fault firing suggestion as detailed in the Employment Law Reform is not a suggestion that will encourage the economic growth of Britain as suggested by the Conservatives. It will merely lead to employees fearing for their jobs, promoting a culture of blame and a culture where employees are no longer able to have a freedom of speech. It will reduce morale significantly and this will lead to decreased productivity from our workforces, which in turn will decrease our output from our businesses and therefore damage our growth. It will also increase the number of unemployed, something that needs to decrease not increase, and will reduce potential employees\u2019 motivation to apply for new roles as it will become much easier for them to be dismissed and therefore much harder to stay in employment.",
