        "additional_details": "The main change in law that we are campaigning for is:\r\nThat a victim of sexual assault and rape only has to relive her ordeal once in court and give evidence in person once at a trial.  If, by no fault of her own, (i.e. \u2018legal technicalities such as failure to submit paperwork on time by CPS) a retrial has to be called, then hearsay evidence from the previous trial should be allowed to be used.  Especially, when it is proven that the victim cannot come forward due to illness or mental incapacity.\r\n",
