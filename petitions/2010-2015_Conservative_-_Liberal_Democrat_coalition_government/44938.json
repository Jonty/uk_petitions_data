Whilst some people have managed to weather the storm it is clear that after two years even the strong businesses and individuals have simply run out of savings and are now in a state of catastrophe. The government must change its policy immediately and restart investment in infrastructure, stop fighting wars overseas that we cannot afford and rebuild our schools and hospitals. Immigration must be kept under control and properly managed, bringing our troops home and redeployment for this task seems to make sense. Come on \"Coalition\" its time you looked at what is happening at home and made some major policy changes. Our country needs you and it needs you now.",
