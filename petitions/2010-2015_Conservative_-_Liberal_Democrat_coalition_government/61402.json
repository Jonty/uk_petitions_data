Fees would be paid by home owner disputing boundary. Most homes do not have legal boundaries, therefore any damage caused by undesirable neighbours cannot be resolved by the police. 1000's of police hours are wasted and solicitors costs can escalate up to \u00a3100,000 for the home owner looking to protect their property against bullying neighbours.
