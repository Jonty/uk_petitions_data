        "additional_details": "Currently those held in UK prisons have ICT lessons that by no means reflect the skills that employers are looking for. In order for the rates of reoffending to come down, offenders need up to date skills that can be transferred to a variety of jobs upon release. Offenders simply going over the same subjects of Office Word, and Excel is not doing anybody any favours. Offenders of whom many are very bright and very capable need skills that are useful, purposeful, and worthy of working hard to achieve.\r\n\r\nI want to se the UK government introducing real lessons that give real skills to those inside who are interesting in the subject area of IT/Computer Science. This should include, web page design, development, networking, other programming.  lets give UK prisoners are real chance at reforming their lives and update the awfully outdated not to mention boring IT curriculum currently available.",
