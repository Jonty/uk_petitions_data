Abilty to pay is not considered and is not means tested as is done with other parts of goverment.\r\n\r\nA system that spends more than is recovered for familys is unstanable, but for some reason is not acknowledged by this goverment, who cut payments to disabled children while spending your money on a system that has cost us billions on wasted computer systems and a completly unfair tool that only caused rifts in familys rather than the original intended vision.\r\n\r\n80% of so called absent parents were willing tp provide for their familys without the need for this department.\r\n\r\nAbolish this state funded extorsion now..!",
