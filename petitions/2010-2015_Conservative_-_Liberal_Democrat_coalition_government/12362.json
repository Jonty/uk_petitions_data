        "additional_details": "Discipline, team building, skills learning and leadership skills are what these young rioters need to be taught. Im order to cure the rot of the youth today, bring back Military conscription. Not just getting them off the street, but setting them up with the skills sought after in business whilst creating a new generation of leaders and maintaining our military strength in a world where it is also becoming blatently obvious that we have cut the military so much we have been left sitting vulnerable by our Government that should be putting our safety first. All in all a golden bullet for getting youths off the streets, building our military and creating new business leaders.",
