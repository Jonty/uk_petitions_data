        "additional_details": "Give approved methods of disciplining children back to teachers and parents. I am not suggesting the cane or corporal punish but teachers need to feel that they can teach those that are there to learn and remove those that aren't. Parents should be accountable and forced to take time out of work to take their children home if they are poorly behaved or disruptive. You would hope that the embarrassment factor and potential loss off earnings could be an incentive for the parents to maybe take an interest in their children's education and improve home discipline and subsequently behaviour. \u00a0",
