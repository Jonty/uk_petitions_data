In addition, prison has become less of a deterrent in recent years given all the luxuries it has to offer. Bringing back the stocks would save a great deal of taxpayers money by reducing the need for prison and would act as a deterrent given it's humiliating effect on the offender and would identify for all to see who they are. The approach is non-violent and effective.",
