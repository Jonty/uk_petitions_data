There should be a longer period of around 12 years because dental problems often take several  years to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ombudsman service failed to investigate my complaint.This was even though I provided proof of negligence from the Dental Reference Officer, and from the clinical literature  that the treatment I had (which was only a scale and polish) was not the correct treatment for periodontal disease. I lost many teeth, jaw bone, and had two mini-strokes as a result.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want the Ombudsman Service to be made accountable and transparent. They currently only investigate approximately 1% of complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDentists are getting away with malpractice and it has got to be stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of the UK are denied Justice.\r\n\r\nHow much longer will this go on ?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
