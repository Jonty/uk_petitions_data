        "additional_details": "The Government needs to make councils pay all housing benefit directly to Landlords or their Agents.\r\n\r\nUnder the current system all housing benefit tenants receive their benefits directly. Numerous tenants do not forward this benefit to their landlords creating rent arrears, financial hardship for the landlord and forcing the landlord to take legal action through the courts for possession of their property.\r\n\r\nThis places further burden on the local authorities who then have to re-house these evicted tenants.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to install common sense back into the system and pay housing benefit directly to landlords or their Agents.",
