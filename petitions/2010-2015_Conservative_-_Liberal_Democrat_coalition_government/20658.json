        "additional_details": "The Government should give new powers to SOCA - the Serious Organised Crime Agency - to enable it to seize the assets of corporate bankers and top financiers who were in charge of banks at the time of the banking bailouts.\r\n\r\nBankers and financiers should be forced to return bonus money collected by them during the false wealth and fools gold years of 2002-2007.\r\n\r\nThis petition is about establishing new powers to do just that.  (The new powers to be used in conjunction with the Inland Revenue in a bid to identify and track down such top earners based on tax receipts.)\r\n\r\nIdeally, bankers' current accounts and assets would be frozen and a proportionate amount of money taken from each and returned to the banks that are now technically bankrupt.\r\n\r\nLegislation is a blunt instrument, but privatising profits and socialising the loss is not on.  I believe this proposal deals with the 'moral hazard' issue as well.\r\n\r\nA referendum should be called before enacting the above.",
