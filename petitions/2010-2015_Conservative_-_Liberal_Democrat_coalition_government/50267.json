        "additional_details": "I have read news articles recently suggesting that some individuals would like to decrease the age of sexual consent from 16 to 13. (UNCRC) Is not legally enforceable and is hence 'aspirational' only, although a 2003 ECHR ruling states that, \"The human rights of children and the standards to which all governments must aspire in realising these rights for all children are set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\" The SOA 2003 covers consentual and non-consentual factors to prosecute. I myself lost my virginity at 19 years old and I believe that to increase the age of sexual consent to 18 years old is adequate and responsible. Domestic legislation makes children's rights recognised and legally binding and these rights should be respected and upheld!",
