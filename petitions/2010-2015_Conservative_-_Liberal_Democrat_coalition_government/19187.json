        "additional_details": "Abolish motor insurance and road tax and set up a government insurance scheme paid for at the pump. This will ensure all road users are automaticly taxed and insured every time they fill up with fuel. This will make for fair insurance for all road users and cut out the risk of accidentally driving uninsured or purposely driving uninsured.\r\nRetain the MOT test replacing the certificate with an MOT disc resembling the current road tax disc. This will be linked to having a valid driving licence.",
