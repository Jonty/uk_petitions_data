        "additional_details": "It is well known that children under the age of 11 are more likely to suffer dog bites.  We have seen in the press very sad stories of children killed by dogs.  THe USA, Canada and Australia all have national schemes in place to educate children how to be safe around dogs.   The UK does not have such a programme.  This programme should be delivered to all primary school children which in turn will reduce the number of children requiring hospital treatment for dog bites!!  It is an easy and effective way of tackling the problem",
