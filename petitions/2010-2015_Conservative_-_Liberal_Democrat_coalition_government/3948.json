We are not interested in the tribal drum-beating and point-scoring of Westminster: we just want to be governed well.  We are interested in politics, not so much in 'party' politics:\r\n(1) One party does not have to take up the opposite position to another party just for the sake of it;\r\n(2) Members of the same party can hold different views - two cabinet ministers disagreeing will not lead to chaos in the streets;\r\n(3) Admit mistakes, and say sorry.  We don't expect you to be infallible;\r\n(4) Do not immediately call for resignations from the government as soon as blood is smelt;\r\n(5) Stop lying, we know your doing it!  For example, on Election Night Broadcasts don't all say you've got 'promising results' - one of you must have lost!\r\nIn general just be brave, be honest, and stick to your guns.  We will respect you for it.",
