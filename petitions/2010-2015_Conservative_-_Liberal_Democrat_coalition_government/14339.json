        "additional_details": "a judge overturned uk law and common sense when he ruled that convicted paedophiles have a right to family life under the Human Rights Act, and so can have access to their own children.  This puts the rights of convicted paedophiles above child protection.  Since most child abuse happens within families, this is putting children at high risk of being sexually abused.  I ask the Government to act to overturn this judgement and protect children from sexual abuse.",
