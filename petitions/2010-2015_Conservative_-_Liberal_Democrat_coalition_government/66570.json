Creating in the first instances serious cloud coverage. On behalf of the Free Energy Party Uk we the undersigned protest and demand that this is stopped with immediate effect. We are not an experiment and nor is our planet. We demand to know why and what and mostly who is spraying the population of this country and the rest of the world. We the undersigned demand that this is debated in the open and not censored, as public servants and representatives we remove any implied permission this government may think it has to conduct this spraying en masse ",
