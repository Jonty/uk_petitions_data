I started a blog about the problems with the F35, the replacement for the Harrier, encountered with various aspects of the development of this very expensive aircraft. You can see the blog here:\r\n\r\n\u00a0https://bringbacktheharrier.wordpress.com/\r\nIt is now reported that the US are considering using the UK Harriers in storage and bringing them into service if the F35 doesn't hold up.\r\n\r\nThis country should buy back the Harriers and operate them ourselves rather than America.\r\n",
