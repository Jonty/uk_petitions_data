F1 has reached the viewing figures that it has through coverage by the BBC-a publicly funded body.  BBC has agreed to a miserable farce of an alleged race day coverage between themselves and BSkyB. Why is Mr Ecclestone allowed to dictate the terms of a sport that has been cultured through tax payers money via the television license.  Also in view of the  conduct of the Murdoch's now becoming apparent via the exposure of the News International issue - why is the BBC being allowed to broker this deal during a governmental inquiry into the actions of a major shareholder of BSkyB.
