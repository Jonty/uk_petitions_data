        "additional_details": "Football is a wonderful game. However it can be spoilt by inaccurate decisions from referees especially when it come to debatable goal line decisions. If tennis uses Hawk Eye technology why can't football (especially premiere league matches and other sports. This would help remove whether referees are biased towards a team and remove some speculation of match fixing. I would like the government to enforce the use of Hawkeye technology where possible to make sports decisions fairer in sports especially football.",
