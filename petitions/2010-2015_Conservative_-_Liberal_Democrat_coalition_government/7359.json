New laws should be passed to introduce a 'Benefits Blacklist', and it should be made clear to people that they irrevocably forego their entitlement to any state support if they commit certain crimes (the more types of crime on the list, the better). No tuition fee support, no JSA, no NHS, no benefits, no pension. This should not only be a deterrent from committing crimes, but also will save our ailing economy a fortune.",
