        "additional_details": "Over the past few decades the amount of time spent in school by pupils seems to have fallen year by year. Just as the length of school holidays seems to have grown.\r\n\r\nI hereby ask that our representatives look into reducing the length and amount of holidays school children are allowed to have so that they spend their time in school being educated rather than walking the streets bored and with nothing to do after several weeks off of school. I also ask that when a school takes a day off due to adverse weather, they should be required to either come in on a weekend or shorten their holiday period by the equivelent time to make up the education time lost.",
