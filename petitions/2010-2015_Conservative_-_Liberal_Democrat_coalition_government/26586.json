It should be applied to both \"Shechita\" (kosher) and \"Dhabihah\" (halal) in all forms, e.g. raw, packaged, cooked, as constituents and supplied through all outlets, e.g. retail shops, farm shops, supermarkets, restaurants, take-away stores. It should become an offence to supply foodstuffs required to be labelled without labelling.Potential offenders will be slaughter facilities, wholesalers, packagers, retailers, restaurants and the like. It should not be applicable in domestic situations.",
