        "additional_details": "We've all had them, sometimes daily. The letter from the charity, containing heartbreaking stories of poverty, cruelty or disease, thanking you for your regular donation AND ASKING FOR MORE. I want the Government to ban charities from asking regular donors to increase the amount of their gift, which is tantamount to blackmail - based on the premise that you are not giving enough and that it is your parsimony alone that is responsible for the suffering. Money that has been donated to a charity MUST be spent on relieving suffering and not redirected to fund raising. Mailings to people not already contributing would be exempted from such a ban.",
