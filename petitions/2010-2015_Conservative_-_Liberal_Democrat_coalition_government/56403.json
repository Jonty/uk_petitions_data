        "additional_details": "This petition is asking for the government fund and run the equine industry as happens in other European countries.\r\n\r\nAs a country, we are flooded with low quality horses that have no purpose and are neglected as a result, due to overbreeding of poor stock. These animals often end in the food chain, with abbatoirs failing to check passports. This petition asks for a breeding management plan such as those in countries on the continent, whereby it is illegal to breed poor quality animals, and correct passporting with one single government agency to prevent further scandal. Furthermore, there should be a government-approved qualification scheme to prevent charlatan trainers, and new horse owners ought to be required to attend some form of short course due to the complexity of equine welfare, such as the courses run by the German Equestrian Federation..",
