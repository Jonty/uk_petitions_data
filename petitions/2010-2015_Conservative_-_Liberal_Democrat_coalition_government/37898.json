        "additional_details": "We ask the House to bar ex-Prime Minister Mr. Anthony Blair from attending the Remembrance Service at the Cenotaph on Sunday 11th November 2012. His presence at the ceremony in recent years is seen by the families of service men and women killed in the war against Iraq as an act of hyprocisy, given that Mr. Blair was responsible for engaging this country in that unnecessary and unjustifiable war. His presence at the Cenotaph is offensive to those families and also many members of the British public.\r\n ",
