        "additional_details": "We currently have a secretive and hidden system of recruitment in the UK, where perfectly qualified candidates are consistently rejected without explanation and where 'networking' - read nepotism - is seen as key to landing a decent wage.\r\n\r\nThis needs to change. The jobs sector needs to be more transparent. It should and must be made obligatory for employers to tell applicants on what grounds they have been rejected.\r\n\r\nThis will benefit everyone; job seekers will know where they are falling short and can improve future applications, whilst employers will receive a higher standard of applicant. It will also ensure that jobs are allocated fairly in a process free from subjectivity and corruption.\r\n\r\nIt should no longer be about \u2018who you know\u2019 but rather \u2018what you know\u2019.",
