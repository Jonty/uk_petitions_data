        "additional_details": "We believe it is a safety hazard and health issue to use piercing guns therefore they should be banned.\r\n\r\n- Piercing guns cause blunt trauma to the tissue, where as a professional hollow needle will simply make a slot for the jewellery to fit in.\r\n\r\n- Many piercing guns are re-used, many are also made of plastic, therefore cannot be put in an autoclave to fully sterlise.\r\n\r\n- The re-used plastic piercing guns are usually only cleaned with an alcohol wipe, therefore it does not kill any viruses such a hepatitis or HIV.\r\n\r\n- Piercing guns used of any cartilage (Usually the helix or nose) may shatter the cartilage due to blunt trauma.\r\n\r\nFor a demonstration of how a gun affects the tissue, please watch this video:\r\nhttp://youtu.be/IKCW76znIwk\r\n\r\nThanks.",
