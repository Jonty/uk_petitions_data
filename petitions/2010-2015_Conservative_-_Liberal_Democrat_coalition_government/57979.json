        "additional_details": "The two tier system of local governance in Essex is confusing and extremely costly.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see local issues around schools, Highways and Social Services dealt with at the grass roots of a community, making local government more open and transparent and delivering greater control by individuals, community groups and businesses over local services in communities.\r\n\r\nThere are growing concerns around decisions made that affect a substantial number of rate payers including Street lighting, School closures, Highways, Youth Services and individual cases being dealt with by Social Services.\r\n\r\nThese kind of decisions effect local communities in different ways because the make-up of the County\u2019s Districts is diverse in terms of demographics and culture.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see local decisions made meaningful locally and ask that a review of the cost-benefits to the tax-payer of abolishing Essex County Council with replacement new local Unitary Authorities be undertaken.
