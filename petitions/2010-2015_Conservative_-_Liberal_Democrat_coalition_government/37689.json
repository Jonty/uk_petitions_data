        "additional_details": "The marks and grade boundaries should be put back to where they were so that pupils who deserve a C grade should get it.  Controlled Assessments were criterion referenced.  This means English teachers assessed the skills pupils demonstrated, matched these to the grade descriptions in the syllabus & mark schemes and allocated the appropriate mark for that grade.  These were then moderated by an exam board moderator and declared accurate or adjusted as necessary.  It is blatantly wrong to then take marks off pupils at the C grade to ensure they come out as a D. This is what one exam board did, others simply upped the grade boundary.  Either way, it means that pupils who achieved the standards required for a C grade were marked down to a D grade due to political pressure on exam boards.  This a betrayal of pupils, teachers and parents and totally unacceptable.\r\n",
