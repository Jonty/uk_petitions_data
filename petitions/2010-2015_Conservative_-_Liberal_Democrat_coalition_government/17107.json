        "additional_details": "Due to high rent and sales tax on drinks, the smoking ban, and other factors, local/village pubs which have been the centre of the community for years and sometimes centuries are closing and being converted into private housing. Once this happens they are lost to the local community forever. A village/district is poorer without a focal point in which to meet, and these pubs should be protected as a national asset, with Government providing fiscal assistance if necessary  ",
