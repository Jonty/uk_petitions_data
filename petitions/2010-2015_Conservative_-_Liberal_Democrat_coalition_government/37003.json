But with the use of new DNA and more advanced forensic science the return is now.\r\n\r\nFeel that there should be a new debate and possible referendum to give the people of this country the right to say if Capital Punishment should be brought back into Law. It still stands for treason or killing a Police Officer but no one has been given the death penalty when found guilty of theses offences.\r\n\r\nThe people of Britain are now sick of all the stories they read and see in the news on TV and all you here is that the perpetrator or guilty person is look after under law while the families of victims have to suffer for life.\r\n\r\nI am not asking for a total death penalty for every case only those that are classed as first degree.\r\nIt is time for change and its time the Government whichever party in power now listens to the people.\r\n",
