        "additional_details": "The government\u2019s proposed changes to the ownership and management of public forests in England pose a very real danger to UK motor sport \u2013 and in particular Stage Rallying.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Panel established earlier this year to look at the forestry issue and make recommendations to government contains only one representative of leisure users \u2013 and that is the Ramblers\u2019 Association. Consequently, there is a great danger that the interests of motor sport will not be considered in the panel\u2019s final report; the disastrous impact of this would be to risk motor sport being excluded from both the public forest estate and any of the forests transferred into private ownership. This would also have a knock on effect with the companies which supply UK motorsport of this nature with parts and services, putting jobs at risk!",
