We already live in a society were people think they have the right to take whatever they want from whoever they want. this could make some areas a no go area. this would only encourage thieves, muggers, rapists and even murderers Basically the idea will save the local council a little but potentially cost the emergency services a lot more. This decision has already contributed to the death of an 18 year old according to the coroner at an inquest. If your council are not yet implementing this, they will soon",
