        "additional_details": "If like me, you are currently in private renting, you will be told that due to this you have a *Home* and therefore have very little chance of a council home. I am sick of sitting in the local housing office and watching Polish, Romanians immigrants etc being told that they will be housed in our council homes asap. Really? So as a UK Citizen, I have no secure tenancy for myself & 2 children but its ok for immigrants to have that security. Why not put them in private rents and give US the homes we desperately need. I didnt foresee a divorce, hence why I am in a private rent. Your circumstances maybe similar, lost your job etc etc. I cannot afford to take full time employment because of the high private rent per month. I just cannot afford too. If I had my council home, I COULD. I am sick of the policies in this country, where non UK Citizens, clearly come first now, with prisioners due to being realised, they become another priority for local housing. ENOUGH!",
