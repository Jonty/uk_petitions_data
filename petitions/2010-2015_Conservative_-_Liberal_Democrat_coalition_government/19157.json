        "additional_details": "Through out the United Kingdom nurses struggle to maintain adequate levels of patient care. Nurses are desperate to provide quality individualised holistic care, as they have been trained to do. However due to high patient staff ratios of 1:12 or 1:14 or if the other nurse is off sick 1: 28 how is any form of care maintained? Nurses want to care...it's time to speak up for the Nurses, allow them the capacity to do their job. Patients as I write this are suffering and there is one Nurse hoping their patients will be alive at the end of their shift, this has to change now.\r\nI petition for good Nurse Patient ratios of 1:4 like the health care system provides in New Zealand and Australia. Patients need to stop suffering and nurses want to start nursing. Sign now make a difference",
