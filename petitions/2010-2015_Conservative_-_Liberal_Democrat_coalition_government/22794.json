        "additional_details": "These tolls cause hardship to many motorists and companies that have to use the motorways for their day to day buisness. They are far too expensive at \u00a35.70p for a car and well over \u00a317 for large goods vehicles, This has to be passed onto the customers. With high fuel costs this money could help maintain the bridges.  Also it is unfair that disabled people travel over the bridges free, they are able to either drive or be driven on the motorway, they do not have to leave the vehicle so their disability does not come into it.",
