It has not progressed since then and the website 'Parliament.uk' states that 'there is no indication of when the Bill will progress further'.\r\nThis petition aims to reinforce the importance of the Access to Mental Health Services Bill  so that it may be moved for debate and progress through the House of Commons.",
