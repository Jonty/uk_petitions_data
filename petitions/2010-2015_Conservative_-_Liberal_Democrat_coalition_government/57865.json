        "additional_details": "Reintroducing capital punishment for extreme offences, as in murder, terrorism, anyone who is a danger to others and therefore can not be released, anyone who has been sentenced to 'life' and wouldn't be getting released.\r\n*It will ease up on the overcrowding of our prisons, meaning we can give sterner sentences to those who deserve them.\r\n*It will free up more of the countries finances, to be able to give more funding to and support our armed forces, emergency services and NHS, schools, helping the poor/homeless and elderly.\r\n*It would deter people from committing these crimes in the first place.\r\nI feel that if a person wishes to act like an animal, they should be treated like one. I think that once they commit such a crime, they give up all of their human rights.\r\n",
