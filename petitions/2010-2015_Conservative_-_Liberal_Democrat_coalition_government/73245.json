        "additional_details": "There is no reason why these elitist universities (Oxford and Cambridge) should have their own UCAS deadline - currently 15th October. Plenty of other universities interview students now so the reason provided by Oxbridge institutions is invalid. The government is supposed to be creating a level playing field for all students applying to university. There is no need for a two tier deadline system. All applications should be submitted by 15th January, this gives all institutions plenty of time to interview and offer places. ",
