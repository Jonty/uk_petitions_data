        "additional_details": "The Dartford Crossing currently has 4 lanes of motorway road in both directions, and 14 lanes to collect tolls.\r\n\r\nThese toll booths create huge daily tailbacks, regularly over 4 miles long, as recognised by the signage now in place warning of congestion and queues likely on the M25 some 5 miles out.\r\n\r\nThe tunnels and bridge have been paid for, which was the original reason for a toll.  It has now been re-labelled a Congestion Charge, despite the obvious fact that the actual congestion is caused by every vehicle having to stop and pay money to pass through the gates.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to take decisive action to open the motorway and finally remove these toll gates to keep the traffic moving.  The environmental cost to the surrounding areas cannot be good, nor can the regular 1 hour + delays faced by people going about their every day business. ",
