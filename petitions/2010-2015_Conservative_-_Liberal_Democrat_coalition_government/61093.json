        "additional_details": "The Staffordshire county council proposes to save 4,5 million pounds by ceasing to directly deliver youth services. This would have a devastating effect on young people, parents, carers, communitys in which young people live, study,volunteer and work, public and voluntary organisations who work in partnership with the Staffordshire youth service. Staffordshire youth workers are skilled, professional and experienced people who care about young people and make a difference to people's lives. What county council are proposing will destroy a much needed service. ",
