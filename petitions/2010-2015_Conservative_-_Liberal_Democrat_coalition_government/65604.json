        "additional_details": "Authorisation pendings are the standard method of claiming money when people pay using credit or debit card. The money is put on hold by the bank for up to five days and then is deducted from your balance.\r\n\r\nHowever this current system can have dire consequences for families on low incomes. If a supermarket make an error and have to cancel a transaction it can leave a person without access to those funds for up to 5 days. When this money is benefit money intended to feed an entire family this can leave families stranded without food and without cash.\r\n\r\nAuthorisations pending are no longer necessary in modern banking and there is no reason money cannot be refunded immediately.\r\n\r\nWe the people call on the government to end authorisation pending and force banks to return funds to a persons account within 2 hours.",
