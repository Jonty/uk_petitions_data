        "additional_details": "\r\nRESTORE IRANIAN DIPLOMATS\r\n\r\nThe Iranian government did not damage the British Embassy in Tehran. It was Iranian citizens, enraged by decades of repressive sanctions and threats of military strikes by Israel.  Theories that Tehran incited the mob are negated by Iran's constant attempts to negotiate, thwarted by unreasonable pre-conditions.\r\nTehran deployed dozens of riot police to save the Embassy but were overwhelmed by an explosion of pent-up hostility to extra UK-supported financial and other restrictions.  Tehran has apologised for the damage.\r\nYou virulently supported demonstrations in Libya.  Withdrawing diplomats and curbing finances and trade denies Iran\u2019s democratic rights and exacerbates disputes between us.  The UN Charter requires all diplomatic efforts before Mr Hague\u2019s hasty action gave only 48 hours\u2019 notice.\r\nBritish people do not want another war.  We protest most strongly.\r\nWe appeal to your sense of justice to restore full diplomatic relations with Iran.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
