The British Medical Association have condemned the current WCA as \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d.\r\nThe current WCA does not sufficiently\u2014or even at all\u2014take into account fluctuating conditions, especially episodic mental health problems.\r\nThe opinion of assessed persons own doctors or of other specialist medical personnel who are treating them are either ignored or overridden.\r\nNo less than 41% of decisions are appealed, of which 38% are won. At \u00a360 million in a single year, the appeals have cost the taxpayer more than half of the \u00a3110 million that was spent on the original assessments.\r\nThousands of people have died after being put into the wrong groups or being denied benefit all together.",
