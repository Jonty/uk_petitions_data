Little wonder this will continue to happen as society increasingly breaks down, authorities officially act for the most ridiculous reasons and the constant bleat of human rights voices continually bray!\r\nPrison is the denial of freedom, denial of rights, denial of home comforts and the price you pay for anti-social behaviour. Not a holiday camp!\r\nPunishment should fit the crime. A proper sentence for a crime committed. The sentence should be served IN FULL!! Life should mean life, no parole, no soft life.\r\nWhen sentenced to a prison term, you forfeit any rights, because you arbitrarily denied them to your victims!\r\n",
