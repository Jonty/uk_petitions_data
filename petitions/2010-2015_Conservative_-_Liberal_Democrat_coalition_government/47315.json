        "additional_details": "In view of the history of brawls within the Palace of Westminster, it is clear that certain politicians are unable to behave in a professional manner when they have access to alcohol in their place of work. Over the last couple of decades, government departments, police stations and other public buildings have been closing staff bars situated on their premises, and it is time that our national politicians should follow the example they have been imposing upon others.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned therefore call for the complete ban of the sale of alcohol within the Palace of Westminster, with the exception of off-sales to tourists on the condition that these are never consumed on the premises.",
