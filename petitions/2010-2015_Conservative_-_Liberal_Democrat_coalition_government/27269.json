        "additional_details": "The Government should fund the replacement of women who have PIP implants, both NHS and private.  Why on earth were these implants approved in the first place???  Ultimately the Government is responsible for allowing these implants to be placed into women's bodies so surely it should foot the bill?  Why should we have to pay another \u00a34,000+ for an operation because of the MHRA's unbelievable and shocking neglect? About 90% of women in the UK cannot afford to have these replaced, so have 2 options: (a) sit tight and wait for the implants to rupture; or (b) have them removed but not replaced which, as the Welsh health minister has stated, \"could result in unsightly scarring, loose skin, and potentially the accumulation of fluids, need for drainage, and risk for infection\".  We put our faith in the Government to make sure that we're at least getting the correct healthcare yet when there's a problem it doesn't claim responsibility.",
