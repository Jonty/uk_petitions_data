        "additional_details": "The Department for Work and Pensions states that:\r\n\"Its key aims are to help its customers become financially independent\".\r\n\r\nRather than encouraging new parents to return to work, the current childcare legislation actually does the opposite by making the cost of childcare so expensive that, for some, returning to work after having children is just not viable.\r\n\r\nFor working couples and single parents, prohibitive costs of childcare can lead to a reliance on benefits until their child reaches school age, which can in turn lead to loss of skills and a greatly reduced capacity to become \"financially independent\".\r\n\r\nMaking childcare more affordable would not only help allow new parents to return to work, it would also create jobs in the childcare sector and, crucially, help fulfill the aim of the DWP.\r\n\r\nThis petition is asking for a review of current childcare legislation and a debate on ways to make childcare more affordable for working families.",
