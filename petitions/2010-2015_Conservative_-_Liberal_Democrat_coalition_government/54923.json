        "additional_details": "Over the past few years larger airports have begun charging operators of smaller aircraft types higher landing/slot fees for using their airports, this is most recently highlighted with the Flybe - Gatwick situation, where flybe have ceased all routes to-from LGW due to being priced out of the airport by the airport authority, this comes as a blow to thousands of passengers who rely on these smaller regional aircraft which connect the smaller regional airports of the country to the larger ones.",
