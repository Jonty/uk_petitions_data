        "additional_details": "Reasons include, easy life in prison, can get more involved with crime in prison, re offending rates, very expensive, breaks family, punishes relatives and friends indirectly etc...\r\n\r\nHowever they should be in PUBLIC and TOUGH. What about have a community wall in the centre of a city, which gets sprayed in graffiti every night, and people have to go there and work to remove it from 9.00 to 6.00 perhaps. At the same time the opportunity would be there for people to take there sons/daughters to the wall. They could also 'try it out'. What would happen, well they would probably after a short time be very bored and stop. Then if you make them have another go perhaps even have a 'teenage tantrum'. They when realising if they did a crime thy would have to do that tiring boring work all day every day, they may not want to commit the crime again.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you think it would be an interesting idea.
