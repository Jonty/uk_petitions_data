        "additional_details": "With over 650 MP's representing more than 60 million people it is now more imperative that every Bill put to the vote be voted by every MP. It is possible for MP's to never to vote on important issues. If it were made compulsary for MP's to vote on every Bill in person or by Proxy then the public could see the voting record of every MP and know if that MP was voting how their constituents wanted. Clarity on exactly what our MP's stand for, letting the voting public know if they really want to re-elect an MP that represents them.",
