        "additional_details": "David Cameron has been quoted that he would do everything in his power to protect the union of the united kingdom, however he has avoided any sort of transparent public discussion regarding the matter.\r\n\r\nAt a time where there seems to be conflicting and in some cases misleading information given within both sides of the debate I believe that a public televised discussion surrounding the independence referendum is essential to gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of independence.\r\n\r\nI believe that as the Prime minister of the United Kingdom it is David Cameron's duty to take the debate seriously.",
