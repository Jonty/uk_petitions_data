        "additional_details": "When Tendring Council switch lights off from January 26th 2014 between the hours of 12 midnight to 5am does it mean we get a council tax rebate? Does it mean they will contribute to our higher home insurance, (as I am sure these will go up, as we will be classed a higher risk)? Does it mean higher compensation being paid to the vunerable having accidents because of bad light/bad paving? We want safe streets, we want LED street lights that can cut energy bills, reduce carbon emissions, be operated remotely and linked to smart technology. Councils should take note! LED lighting can last between 3-7 years thus cutting maintenance bills... Is this not the way to be thinking? Be cost effective but keep the streets safe!",
