        "additional_details": "The UK Climate Change Act will cripple the UK economy by imposing the most restrictive measures on \"carbon emissions\" of any nation on Earth. This is to support the discredited hypothesis of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming that the \"climategate\"scandal exposed as fraudulent science. The only people who support this are those that seek to gain financially - academics (from grants), government (from \"green\" taxes) and vested interests such as providers \"green\" technologies and \"Ponzi -like\" carbon trading scams. The Climate Change Act must be repealed.",
