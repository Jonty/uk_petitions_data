When a crime is committed, offer criminals two sentences:  either a combination of years in jail + a large fine, or a longer jail sentence.\r\n\r\nFine the offender according to what they have done and/or how much money they are thought to have/have stolen.  Make sure that at no point are jail sentences reduced below present day levels.\r\n\r\nThis would provide a great way of getting stolen money back from criminals (who keep any stolen money under the current system).",
