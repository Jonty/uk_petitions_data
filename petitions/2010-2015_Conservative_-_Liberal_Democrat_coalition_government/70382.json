It exists to redress the disadvantages that the Armed Forces community faces in comparison to other citizens, and to recognise sacrifices made.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the assumption that they follow this, the discount should be made available to military families beyond that of their partner and extended to include their children, unless they no longer count as part of the armed forces community.\r\n\r\nTherefore I petition the MOD to change the list of people eligible for the discount card to include children of serving personnel to fulfill what is in the Covenant ",
