        "additional_details": "We believe that the House of Lords Act (1999) was founded on \"no comprehensive plan or principle\" and that it in fact runs contrary to the established principles of the British constitution. Not only that; it was unwanted by the majority of the electorate and has been detrimental to the functioning of the Upper House. Accordingly, we call on the Government to include the option of a full or partial restoration of the Hereditary Peers in any future debate on the composition of the House of Lords. ",
