A good example would be that the government tackles a certain group of migrants that come from member states such as Holland, Denmark and Sweden. The government can tackle this trend by enforcing the 6 month claiming limit that has been introduced this year and making sure that if they surpass the limit then the respective individual will not be able to claim any benefits, only if they can provide proof that they have a good chance of being employed. Also, they should not be entitled to housing benefits. ",
