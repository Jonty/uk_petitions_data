        "additional_details": "Reinstate Kevin Pietersen to the England Cricket Team. Cricket is one of largest participation sports in England and is at the heart of our cultural identity. The dropping of Kevin on 'non cricket' grounds is a threat to the levels of participation and our cultural legacy. Kevin has inspired countless young people to take up the sport and should be given the chance to inspire the next generation and to help keep this wonderful sport part of the fabric of our country. The fact that the decision was made on 'non cricketing' grounds makes it an issue of governance hence the petition.",
