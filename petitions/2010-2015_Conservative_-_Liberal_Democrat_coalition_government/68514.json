        "additional_details": "I believe that the Government should take more responsibility for monitoring external websites, posting of children's photos via facebook (especially naked ones that Facebook refuse to remove). It is not seen as a serious crime when a person uses the internet to harass a person and threaten them, post lewd pictures of them. Look at the case of Ruth Jeffrey whose life was destroyed by 3 years of online abuse. The internet is real, we have no control over what is posted. People can do anything they want it seems with your images, even naked child photos. Any parent out there who thinks that social media needs to be cracked down upon and regulated please sign. If you don't want an abusive ex to destroy your life via the internet sign. How many people had had an ex threaten to post things of you online? We need help to stop these people, specific laws regarding this behaviour.",
