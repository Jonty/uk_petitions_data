        "additional_details": "Since the metropolitan elite have seen fit to knight a large number of stage actors it is essential that William Roache' contribution to the acting profession and to entertaining on a regular basis the vast majority of television viewers over a perod of more than 50 years, is recognised. He should either be elevated to the House of Lords or at the very least Knighted. In comparison to many of the \"luvvies\" who have been knighted or made peers it's is quite clear that Bill Roache has provided more entertainment, light and comic relief that all the other luvvies put together. Neither has he, to the bat of my knowledge, been sent to prison for perjury or fiddling his expenses.",
