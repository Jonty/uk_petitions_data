        "additional_details": "We believe passengers on buses are being put at risk due to the hours bus drivers are being forced to complete in a normal week. In many cases drivers are expected to work thirteen and a half hours a day, for five days a week. These so called \u201cSpreadover\u201d duties can start at 06.00 and not finish until after 19.00.\r\n\r\nThis includes driving through both rush hour periods, taking our children to and from school, elderly . But bus drivers  suffer with high blood pressure, stress, huge adrenaline surges and abuse from some passengers every day.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition calls for the government to legislate such that a bus driver can only be made to work a maximum of 8 hours a day and 40 hours in a 5 day week. For the sake of them, their families and their passengers.",
