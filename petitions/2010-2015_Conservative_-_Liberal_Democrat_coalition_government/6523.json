        "additional_details": "This is NOT a homophobic group or way to harass any members of the gay community. This is just a regular Christian guy taking a stand for what is right. We already have civil partnerships for same sex relationships so lets leave it at that. Now is the time to stand up and say enough is enough. Marriage can only be between one man and one woman, and should be conducted in a Church before God. The purpose of this petition is to ensure gay marriage never comes to pass.",
