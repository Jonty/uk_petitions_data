        "additional_details": "Tom Cleverley, owner of 13 England caps, has been regularly selected by Roy Hodgson in his squads without possessing any genuine qualities whatsoever. We believe for the reputation of this proud footballing nation that he should be prevented from attending this summer's international showcase. Whilst England are considered to disappoint at major tournaments, further embarrassment could be avoided by not having his inept performances undermine the rest team's efforts.",
