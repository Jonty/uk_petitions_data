        "additional_details": "We the under signed call upon the government to make all forces pensions tax free from income tax. This will remove only a small portion of the tax generated. But, it will remove some of the strain from the Ex-forces members who are struggling. It will also allow more purchasing power to those Ex-forces members and therefore stimulate growth in the local economy. It will reduce payments to those Ex-forces members who are on the poverty line because they will have more money to look after themselves. But most importantly it will send a message to all who have served their country in both peace and war. That message is that the Government and the people of the UK are grateful for their time and the sacrifices that they have made in order to ensure that this country remains free.",
