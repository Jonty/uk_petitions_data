        "additional_details": "A lot of young offenders such as the rioters are not deterred by the expensive process of overcrowded and often further corrupting prison sentences. I suggest using some of the money we spend on aid to set up government run schemes to send young offenders to third world countries to work on various aid projects. Being involved in witnessing and improving true poverty is proven to be a life changing experience. It would be very hard work but at the same time would hopefully inspire these young people and give them a sense worth and value. The schemes would also provide paid jobs for others as obviously people would need to oversee and assist in these projects. Please sign my petition if you agree\r\n",
