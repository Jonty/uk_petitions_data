        "additional_details": "Support workers, domicillary workers and home care workers often have to visit many clients within their working day. Many are very low paid workers and it is common practice for care organisations not to pay these workers for their travel time between clients' homes during the working day. This means that workers are paid for only a fraction of the hours during their working day. We the undersigned wish that this government highlight this endemic poor treatment of care workers and take swift action to ensure that care workers are paid properly for their time.",
