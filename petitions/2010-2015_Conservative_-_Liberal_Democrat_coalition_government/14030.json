        "additional_details": "In order to bring us in line with the rest of the European Union (which despite suggestions of a referendum we're still to remain part of) the UK should have one Bank Holiday per month. At present we have 8 Public Holidays per year, the lowest amount for any EU member country, we propose that this 8 should be raised to 13 days a year, this brings us in line with Germany, Greece has 15 public holidays a year, Spain allows a maximum of 14 public holidays per year and would put us above France who have 10 days. There is no suggestion that any of the holidays we currently have should be moved just the months without a public holiday be given one. ",
