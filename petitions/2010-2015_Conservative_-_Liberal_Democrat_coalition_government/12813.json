        "action": "Increase HMRC private fuel tax allowance when using car for business use",
        "additional_details": "The cost of fuel is continually rising but yet the mileage and fuel allowance figures published by HMRC remains static. The cost per mile is supposed to account for the cost of fuel plus an amount towards the depreciation and maintenance of the car. However, with increasing fuel charges, the allowance now barely covers the cost of the fuel.\r\n\r\nIts about time that the government re-evaluated the allowances to bring them inline with the current cost of fuel.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to demand that HMRC re-address the gap between fuel and mileage allowance and current cost of fuel by raising the fuel allowance.",
