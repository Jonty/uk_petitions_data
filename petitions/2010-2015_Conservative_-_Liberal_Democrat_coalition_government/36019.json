It will also have serious adverse effects on internationally important research taking place at the hospital, including Europe\u2019s leading research programme for cystic fibrosis.\r\nRoyal Brompton Hospital is a world renowned centre of excellence and is known for its first class care, treatments research and highly skilled teams that have taken years to build.\r\nWe are asking the government to prevent the destruction of children's cardiac and respiratory services at Royal Brompton Hospital.\r\n\r\n#SOSBrompton",
