        "additional_details": "I would like the government to TAKE ACTION to help those, like me, suffering with the hair-loss disease Alopecia Areata by FUNDING RESEARCH to FIND A CURE.\r\n\r\nAlopecia is an autoimmune disease- the immune system attacks hair follicles. The exact cause is unknown. Approximately 1.7% of the population are affected by Alopecia.\r\n\r\nIt affects men, women & children - about 25% of people affected have a family history of the condition.\r\n\r\nAlopecia can destroy confidence & self-esteem and can have a detrimental effect on relationships, families and careers.\r\n\r\nAlopecia is not taken seriously by many health professionals as it's not life-threatening. BUT it is NOT \"just a hair issue\". It is a HEALTH issue. I am a bald 29 year old woman. I have no eyebrows, lashes or body hair. That is not healthy.\r\n\r\nOur bodies should have hair. Hair serves a purpose. It's not just to look pretty.\r\n\r\nResearch is needed into the cause, and hopefully cure, of Alopecia. Thanks. ",
