Broken hands, electrocuted testicles, stripped naked and witnessing other distressful assaults while in prison.\r\n\r\nWe want to know why The United Arab Emirates embassy were forbidden from taken photographic evidence of the tortutre inflicted upon these British men by the Dubai Police, when they went to visit them to conduct reports.\r\n\r\nWhy won't they let us prove that these men have been tortured?\r\nWhy have the Dubai police kept them in custody since July 2012 without trial?\r\nWhat kind of world do we live in where this kind of behavior is condoned?\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to make the government take this matter more seriously, and to keep our boys safe.",
