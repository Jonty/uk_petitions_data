I believe that the benefits should only cover the essentials until a person/s finds a job.\r\nI am therefore requesting the Government to issue VOUCHERS to be used at national supermatkets which can be swiped at checkouts for such things like food and  clothes. Only a part of their allowance should be in cash which again can be used at cash machines which could be topped up weekly.\r\n\r\nThis will mean that the claimants  only has access to limited cash and this money can not be used to pay for alchol, drugs etc.\r\n\r\nPlease give support for this good cause, thanks",
