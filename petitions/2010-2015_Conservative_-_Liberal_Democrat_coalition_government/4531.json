Most knife carriers are aged between 14 \u2013 18 and are part of gangs. This is often either through peer pressure or through the fact that they feel they have to protect themselves from other gang members. If it is drummed into them from 12 years old that you will get a mandatory 3 years inside if you are caught with a knife with no exception no early release within 5 years you will find that the majority will stop carrying. I also feel that if they know this then you deserve a fixed term for taking a knife out with you.",
