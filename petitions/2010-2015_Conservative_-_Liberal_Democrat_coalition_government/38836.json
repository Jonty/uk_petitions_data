        "additional_details": "       The Ukrainian government employs an antiquated system of \"care\" to house people with disabilities.  When a family gives up a child with disabilities they are stuck in the system for the rest of their lives with extremely little chance of freedom or adoption.\r\nOn a recent trip to Ukraine I stayed at an orphanage housing boys, girls and adults. I witnessed block treatment, ratios of 1 staff to 20 inmates and human rights infringements including violence towards inmates.  The inmates are allowed no possessions and have to share clothes with others in their building.  Toileting outside in old potties is common place for all ages.  Run-down and damaged play equipment is very often is a state of disrepair and is extremely dangerous to use.\r\nIt is time the British government stepped in and supported Ukraine to change policy and practice and to stop the abusive treatment of people who cannot stand up for themselves.\r\n",
