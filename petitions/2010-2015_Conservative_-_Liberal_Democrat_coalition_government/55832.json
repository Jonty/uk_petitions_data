However, large firms such as Accenture, Shell, JP Morgan and various other large firms have found a loop hole which directly does not discriminate against age. These firms do not offer any form of work/experience for those aged 16. Rather all of their experience schemes are aimed at under and post graduates. Now, it is time to end age discrimination once and for all!",
