        "additional_details": "On Thursday 8th November 2012, David Cameron appeared on the popular ITV show This Morning. Whilst being interviewed by Philip Schofield about paedophiles, the Prime Minister said- \"I do think it's very important that anyone who's got any information about any paedophile no matter how high up in the country or whether they are alive or dead, go to the police. There is a danger, if we're not careful, that this can turn into a sort of witch hunt, particularly against people who are gay.\"\r\nAs a gay man, I know myself and many people are very offended by these comments and feel it likens homosexuals to paedophiles- we would like a full apology from the Prime Minister.",
