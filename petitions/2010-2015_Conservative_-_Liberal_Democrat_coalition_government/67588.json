        "additional_details": "I hereby would like to call the government to propose a cull of all seagulls in british coastal towns. The reason why is seagulls are causing destruction in all seaside towns by ripping rubbish bags, polluting the streets with their faeces. Also residents are fed up of having to pay out costs to repair chimneys, roofs and outhouses due to the damage they cause. Not to mention their faeces on cars which eat into the paint on a hot day and damage the paint needing a respray. Their noise also effects many people from sleeping.\r\n\r\nI think a cull is in order as so many seagulls are breeding causing a uk wide problem off to many gulls please sign the petition to get the numbers down",
