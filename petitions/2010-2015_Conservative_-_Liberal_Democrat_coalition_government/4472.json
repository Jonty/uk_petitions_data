        "additional_details": "Its time that our UK goverment started realising we have a drugs epidemic in our country. I used to live in an area in which Heroin was freely available and it was causing heartache and problems all over the community as a result.\r\n\r\nMy e-petition is simple, ANYONE found to be selling heroin will face a minimum mandatory 5 year sentence with no chance of parole. This will mean 5 years IS 5 years. This will deter most criminals and help to clean up our towns and cities which are blighted and overwhelmed by this kind of problem.\r\n\r\nAnyone distributing heroin, selling it or acting as a courier again will get 5 years MINIMUM jail sentence.\r\n\r\nPlease sign my petition, it is a sensible, practicle way to deal with the problem of heroin in a modern society.\r\n\r\nFor too long we have let criminals sell this rubbish and get our children hooked on these horrible drugs. Its time for us to make a stand and so \"No More!\"",
