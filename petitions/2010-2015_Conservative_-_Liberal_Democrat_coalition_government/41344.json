        "additional_details": "Currently social services in some circumstances will try to place a sexually abused child back with their abuser. I believe if somebody commits a crime against a child it should be a custodial sentince, as mandatory precedure, also a accessible database naming them and their crime, this could save lives ultimately. Furthermore it could save a lot of children from abuse from oblivious parents and careers. Our children are most vulnerable, so we should have more power to protect them from unnecessary suffering whitch lasts a lifetime.",
