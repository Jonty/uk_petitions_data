        "additional_details": "The art of riding a Motorcycle is a highly developed skill.  Motorcyclists are highly trained and must at all times out-perform car drivers with whom we must share the roads simply to stay alive.\r\nMotorcyclists need to understand and anticipate our position and that of others, relative speeds, weather, road surface conditions and the likely intentions of other road users in a way that car drivers are simply not even aware.\r\nMotorcyclists are simply better than car drivers and deserve to have these higher levels of skill recognised by permitting them to ride above mandatory speed limits outside of towns and when it is safe to do so.\r\nIf this petition is successful, then legislation must be amended to allow this.  The burden of proving that exceeding the speed limit under any given circumstances is dangerous would reside with the prosecution with the assumption being that the Motorcyclist was driving safely.\r\n",
