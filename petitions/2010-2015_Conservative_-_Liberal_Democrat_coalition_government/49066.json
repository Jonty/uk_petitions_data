        "additional_details": "The police today are obese and fragile. The Daily Mail have reported 52% of met police to be overweight no doubt this trend spreads nationwide. (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2115335/Fat-cop-crackdown-Police-officers-unfit-beat-face-pay-cut--later-retirement-looms-current-head.html)\r\nRegular 2 month fitness tests should be introduced whereby the officer must achieve a minimum of level 12 on the bleep test.\r\nAlso a minimum 6 foot height regulation should be in place for Male officers. Today it seems police are not intimidating or a deterrent to criminals. It seems to arrest one person 6 officers are needed as the current police just are not physically capable. Minimum height restrictions should give the police a forceful look and be larger than the national average height of 5ft10\". Height and fitness test regulations will create a better police force which Britain deserves.",
