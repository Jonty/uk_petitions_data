        "additional_details": "BECAUSE OF \"TOO BIG TO FAIL\" SINCE THE BANKRUPTCY OF LEHMAN BROTHERS, AND THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER INEVITABLE FINANCIAL CRASH, THE BANK OF ENGLAND AND THE FDIC ARE JOINTLY WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE LAWS THAT WILL CONFISCATE BY LAW ANYONE THAT IS AN UNSECURED CREDITOR IN A BANK IN THE EVENT OF ANOTHER FINANCIAL CRISIS. (IE ANYONE THAT HAS THEIR DEPOSITS OR SAVINGS IN A BANK IS CLASSED AS AN UNSECURED CREDITOR).IN OTHER WORDS PROVISIONS ARE BEING WRITTEN THAT UNSECURED CREDITORS (PEOPLE WITH DEPOSITS AND SAVINGS IN A BANK), WILL BY LAW HAVE TO \"BAIL IN\" THEIR DEPOSITS TO PROP UP BANKS & FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. GREECE WAS THE BLUE PRINT AND NOW UK & US DEPOSITS ARE NEXT DUE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THIS JOINT REPORT. THIS PETITION IS DESIGNED TO NOT LET THIS SCANDALOUS EVENT OF BAIL IN EVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. BADLY RUN BUSINESS INCLUDING BANKS SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF BANKRUPTCY AS THE LAWS OF A FREE MARKET NATURALLY DETERMINES",
