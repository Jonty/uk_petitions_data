        "additional_details": "It has been announced that to commemorate the Jubilee, the clock tower that houses Big Ben has been renamed Elizabeth Tower, this has been done without any consultation with the public.  The image of \"Big Ben\" is one of the most iconic of all of the sites in the UK and is one that symbolises the Nation.  It has nothing to do with the Royal Family; in fact it is the one place in the country that the monarch is not even allowed to enter.  This should be reversed.  It is not a matter of being pro or anti monarchy; it is to do with keeping a British icon British. ",
