One of the biggest reasons for this is the existence of the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThe current House of Lords should be replaced with an entirely new upper house consisting of people elected by local councils and mayors (or even the general public) so that local communities are represented fairly, as opposed to the higher classes having a much larger say than the common person which has caused a serious divide between people and their politicians.",
