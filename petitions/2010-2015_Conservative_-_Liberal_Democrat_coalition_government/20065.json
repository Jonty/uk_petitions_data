When it comes down to a referendum, such as the referendum on the European Union, so called 'Whips' in each party are forcing out MPs into voting against the referendum. This is not right as MPs represent the public. A major governmental reform is needed to oust these whips, it is not correct, and in Britain, the home of democracy, we the public deserve a lot more respect than this electoral dictatorship.",
