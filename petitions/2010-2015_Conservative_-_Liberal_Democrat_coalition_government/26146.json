And to stop banks and credit card company's increasing credit limits which itself increases debts.\r\nThe Maximum per person should be set to \u00a3250, and also banks and credit company's should not increase credit levels above that.\r\nThis would reduce use of credit cards ,and  encourage savings to purchase items",
