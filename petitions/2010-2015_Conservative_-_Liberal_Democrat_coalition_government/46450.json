James Martin is trying to change this but is meeting red tape.  If a decorated chef can provide meals within a budget, why will most Trusts not allow him in.  We have a government  who are about all the devicit yet they are letting our NHS trusts hemorrhage funds. LISTEN TO JAMES MARTIN AND COLLEAGUES., THEY ARE AWARD WINNING CHEFS AFTERALL.
