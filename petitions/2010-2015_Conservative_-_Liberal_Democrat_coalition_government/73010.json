        "additional_details": "On 12/12/14 Jonathan Webb was sentenced to 19 years in prison for stealing money from cash machines.  We belive that he should be punished for the crime he was found guilty of, but believe the sentence is far too harsh. 19 years. No one was injured, killed or even harmed by what he did. Murderers, paedophiles and rapists receive lighter sentences and there crimes destroy entire family's. Reduce the sentence. ",
