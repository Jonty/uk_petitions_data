That something is the respect for authority and society that, thanks in part to the parents, the rioters do not have.\r\nIf we send them to jail they will simply come out 6 weeks later even more disillusioned of and disaffected by society. Additionally, the cost to the taxpayer would be enormous.\r\nTherefore, spending that money on educating those guilty parties through military schools, rather than putting them through a prison system that doesn't work, is advised.",
