        "additional_details": "I suggest to the Department of Transport that the former Great Central line be reopened for passenger,and maybe frieight traffic between its current line finish south of Twyford in Buckinghamshire to Rugby in Warwickshire using the disused path that exists of the past trackbed.\r\n1: It is in growth area for housing and industry.\r\n2: It would also  link with the planned East -West Rail link with a terminal near Twyford and feeding both lines.\r\n3: Other Parkway type stations could be located at Brackley , Woodford Halse , and Braunston for Daventry, plus a terminal and a link with the WCML at Rugby.\r\n4: This would also cut down motor mileage for those who commute to current railway stations.\r\n5: It could also see an increase of public transport to these terminals as a connection between bus and rail.\r\n6: Also at Brackley a spur line is built to serve Silverstone Circuit cutting down car use to it ,and road congestion .",
