        "additional_details": "The average annual leave and public holiday entitlements across all EU states is 34 days. The UK and Netherlands provide just 28 days off while Ireland gives 29. At the other extreme, Greece, Austria, and Finland provide the most time off - 37, 38 and 39 days respectively.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the UK statutory entitlement of annual leave from 20 to 25 will not only allow people to spend more time with their families but it will also increase consumer spending thus giving a welcome boost to our economy.  Exceptions may need to be made for very small business, e.g. those with less than 5 employees, as finding cover for holiday absence is much more difficult.",
