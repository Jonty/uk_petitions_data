        "additional_details": "We believe the triple fold increase in Tuition Fees is unfair; that it will have dire consequences on our generation, producing a globally uncompetitive work force and a widening class gap. Therefore, we want Tuition Fees reduced. We understand the government needs to raise money to escape the biggest recession since the 1930's. However, we do not support a 'tax on learning' as former conservative leader Ian Duncan Smith called it in 2003. There are more creative funding alternatives such as Bank sponsorship.As the 2010 protests proved (which 50,000 students attended), the public do not support this decision and are extremely angry about the broken pledge Nick Clegg committed to. To make matters worse both Further Education and Vocational Courses\u2019 funding has been cut. So students who can\u2019t afford university will soon have no educational alternative. Taxes have risen, so has unemployment. Pensions have been slashed. We are fed up paying for banker\u2019s mistakes and government cuts!",
