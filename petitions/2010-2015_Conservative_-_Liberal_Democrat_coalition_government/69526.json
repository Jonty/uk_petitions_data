Culture, Media and Sport to act on this behalf and lead the Media to use the correct words to represent 'Un-Islamic' groups with accurate sentencing and description.\r\n\r\nA really no brainer example:\r\n\r\nCorrect:\r\nUn-Islamic terrorist group\r\n\r\nIncorrect and Misleading:\r\nIslamic terrorist group\r\n\r\nPlease help us to make and portray Islam correctly.\r\n\r\nInspired by: http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/13/term-islamic-state-slur-faith-david-cameron",
