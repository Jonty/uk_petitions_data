Public sector pensions subject to the same tribulations as private sector, money should be invested in the same way with a proportionate contribution from the employer ie HMG All pensions should be renegotiated with no exceptions. Any  employee objecting to be advised to re-apply for  position.\r\n MPs must be subject to pension review, under the auspices of the Taxpayers Alliance,  totally independent, responsible body with public interest at heart. Expense claims to be accompanied by a receipt, irrespective of value and open to scrutiny by  same body. Private industry insists on this without exception, for the benefit of taxation and accountability, why should MPs be exempt. All local councils to renegotiate any contract for employees with salary exceeds \u00a330000, inviting relevant employee to re-apply for their job.",
