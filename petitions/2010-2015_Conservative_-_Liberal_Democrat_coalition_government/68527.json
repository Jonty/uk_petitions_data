He was sent appointments but due to his mental illness and no help he didn't attend his appointments and so was abandoned. People with any type of mental illness need more recognition. If people don't attend their mental health appointments send someone round to check on the situation. Do home visits. The reason for their non attendance could be their illness. Don't ignore it!",
