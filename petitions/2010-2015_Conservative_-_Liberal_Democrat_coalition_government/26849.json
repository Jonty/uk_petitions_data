        "additional_details": "There is much talk of an Olympic legacy: The legacy local goverment pension reform is ordinary people working longer, paying more and earning a smaller pension.  It is wrong to fund a sporting event when the DCLG is demanding local government staff fund short term savings out of their pay.  Many local government staff love sport, but, if we cannot afford to honour pensions agreements, it is luxury none of us can afford.  Local Governement staff are 'Team GB' every day, every week and every year. Our legacy lives in every street, and our trust is earned by those we work for.",
