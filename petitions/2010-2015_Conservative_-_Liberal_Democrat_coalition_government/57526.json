        "additional_details": "We WANT the Government to scrap the HS2, between London, Birmingham Leeds and Manchester, at a cost on current conservative estimates, over \u00a350,000,000,000,or over 5.6% of our \u2018generational\u2019 national debt.\r\n HS2 has little confirmed economic benefit to the country, will be divisive, environmentally damaging, unproven need and with inexpensive alternatives not fully investigated.\r\nThe full facts showing the need for HS2 have not been made available, nor have the economic figures been robustly proven. In fact several Govt Select Committees have poured scorn on the figures together with many economic organisations including the Tax Payer Alliance and the NAO have questioned both the figures and the methodology used.\r\n More than half the country according to ALL the Polls, do not want HS2 including the North.\r\nPlease sign this petition to send a clear message to Government that we wish HS2 to be cancelled and our money to be spent more wisely with greater benefit to ALL of The UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
