        "additional_details": "The Liverpool Care Pathway is currently being used as an excuse to put a limit on life, and who is allowed to survive in hospital. It is a cynical way to free up beds and resources within the NHS. The idea of rewarding NHS trusts for using the LCP to manage 'terminal' patients is wrong, and a direct contravention of the Hippocratic Oath. Family should ALWAYS be told before relatives are placed on either LCP or DNR, and medics NOT allowed to overrule family wishes. The LCP must be withdrawn from use in Hospitals and Care Homes by the Government, or public faith in the Health Service will divebomb.",
