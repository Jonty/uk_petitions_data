I would like you to bear in mind pre WW1 the UK\u2019s biggest trader was Germany; this still resulted in war. Trade agreements can be made in writing; they do not require unelected commissioners to run a parliament which a CONTINENT undemocratically elects.\r\n\r\n5th century, the Romans became liberal in their politics. Threatened by barbarians they began to invite leaders to Rome to allow them to experience the Roman life. The barbarians didn\u2019t follow this and exploited what they knew and sacked them.\r\n\r\nIsn\u2019t that what is happening now? Forced to bend to other wills?\r\n\r\nEach year the EU puts us further into debt when we are a poor, would you take out more loans to pay for debt?\r\n",
