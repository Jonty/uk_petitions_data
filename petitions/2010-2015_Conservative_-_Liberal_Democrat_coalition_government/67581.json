        "additional_details": "It should be made compulsory for Self Employed Individual to pay child support even though they \"do not earn enough money\" They cant get away with just declaring Loss or No Profit and not having to pay anything towards upbringing of their kids. Many individuals will get away with it for decades, with numerous partners just because they say on the paper I do not earn enough...Nobody does regular check or asks for proof, accounts and so on..This needs to change, children deserve better than that. If they are not in their lives they should at least assure that children have everything they need. We need help, we need justice, we need change....In many other countries people go to prison if they don't take care of their children...why not here? We are quick to help abroad, give to charities but not helping own who struggle in single parent families...Please support this change!",
