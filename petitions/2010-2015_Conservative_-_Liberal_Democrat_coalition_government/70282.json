This is not right. The dog should be assessed before the order for it to be put down is made.\r\n\r\nI have spoken to a solicitor who has a 100% success rate in appeals of this nature, proving that these destruction orders made under the Dangerous Dogs Act leads to unnecessary deaths.\r\n\r\nWhilst we accept that magistrates are trying to protect the public, they are not dog experts and therefore dogs MUST be assessed before they are ordered to be put down.\r\n\r\nI am calling for the Government to make this law.\r\n\r\nThis is in memory of Tia the Staffordshire Bull Terrier: http://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/gasp-attempts-save-Derby-death-row-dog-Tia-fail/story-23027051-detail/story.html",
