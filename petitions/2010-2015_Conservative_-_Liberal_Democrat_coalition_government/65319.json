        "additional_details": "I am a college student who is half way through BTEC level 3 Childcare, who is also doing functional skills in Maths as I did not get a grade C in GCSE Maths at school.  I have been working extremely hard to get Distinction grades.  Now our college class has been told that we cannot commense the final phase of this course if we do not have GCSE Maths as functional skills will no longer qualify us to work with children 0-8 yrs of age and in its place we will have to study a Specialist Diploma for ages 5-16 yrs of age,which Is only a Pass grade and will not allow us to persue our careers to become a Nursery Nurse.  We would like the Department of Education to review this matter for those who are half way through the course as we believe you do not need GCSE Maths to teach children of 0-8 years of age.  PLEASE sign this petition if you agree.",
