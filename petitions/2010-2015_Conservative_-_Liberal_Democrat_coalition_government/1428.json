        "additional_details": "In light of the financial crisis it is absolutely crucial that we teach our children about finances, including basic things like, mortgages, credit cards, borrowing money from banks.   This should become a fundamental part of the curriculum, with a compulsory exam to be taken at the age of 15/16. The majority of adults, never mind children, do not know anything about finances and increasingly more people end up in debt and living in poverty. I think to some extent we can prevent this or at least get young people saving from an earlier age. ",
