        "additional_details": "There are only two consequences which have been recorded after completion of ANY public inquiry set up by politicians.  The first is that there has NEVER been anything changed following them.  The second is that lawyers make HUGE amounts of money because of them.  Since most politicians are lawyers there is an ENORMOUS conflict of interest by vesting that power in the treasure chests of lawyer politicians and it is NOT a probitive reason to carry out a public inquiry onto anything.  Much more reliable and honest for taxpayers to consider how much should be spent on inquiries as opposed to politicians deciding on how much they should further enrich their family, friends and colleagues who are practising lawyers, by allowing them to order inquiries which never achieve anything.",
