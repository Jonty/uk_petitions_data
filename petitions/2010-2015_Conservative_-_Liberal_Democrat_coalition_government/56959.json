        "additional_details": "We believe that gun laws in the U.K. are not tight enough. In 2011/2012 according to parliaments own website, approximately 170,000 people were affected by gun crime in the U.K.\r\n\r\nCurrently the law in the U.K. is under the 1979 HM revenue and customs act section 170(2), if you smuggle guns into the U.K. you could get away with only a \u00a32500 fine and six weeks in prison.\r\n\r\nWe want this changed. We want a higher fine or sentence to act as more of a deterrent for gun crime. If you agree, please sign this petition.",
