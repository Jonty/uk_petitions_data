        "additional_details": "B12 Deficiency & Pernicious Anaemia left untreated can be fatal and cause irreversible neurological damage.The NHS guidelines state that 2/3 monthly jabs is adequate treatment to be able to maintain the illness but there are so many people still suffering! I took my health into my own hands after suffering for 3 years and self treat with regular injections that I do myself, just like an insulin dependant person. B12 is not available to buy in the UK but is in other countries. I source my own supplies syringes, wipes & sharps bin. I lost my job due to this illness and I struggle financially so approached my local needle exchange and was refused help.Drug & steroid users can freely go without being judged and get everything they need. Without this treatment I am housebound/suffer Seizures/paralysis/Neurological symptoms. I would like the government to change and make Needle exchanges available to use for people with B12 needs. ",
