By making vouchers that are redeemable at many outlets it would help many smaller businesses as well as save money. This would not be to entirely remove cash money from benefits as there are other conflicting circumstances but this would reduce the amount of disposable income and lead to people making a responsible decision as to where their benefits go.",
