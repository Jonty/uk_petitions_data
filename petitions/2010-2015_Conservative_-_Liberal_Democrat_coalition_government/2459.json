        "additional_details": "Whilst accepting at the outset that alcholism is a major problem for a minority, the different licensing hours on a Sunday versus other days of the week is not a solution to this serious problem. Similarly the restriction on food sales and shopping on a Sunday makes no sense, especially for the non-religious majority. Please abolish these inconsistencies so that we can have the same opening hours for shops and alchohol sales on a Sunday as on the other days of the week.\r\n\r\nThis would allow us to for instance, buy a bottle of wine on a Sunday morning to enjoy a picnic or lunchtime barbeque with friends or even to enjoy a lovely family day out on a Sunday and then buy fresh vegetables on a Sunday evening at the local supermarket for the week ahead. Neither of these are currently possible, the supermarkets in England are forced to close early.",
