        "additional_details": "After the magnificent Olympic Games and the outstanding performance of all GB athletes let us take the opportunity to develop sport throughout Great Britain by retaining the Olympic Park for the purpose it was created - to develop and showcase the very best of British athletic talent.  The start is to not give away such a fantastic range of facilities to football without a thought for the implementation of a national development facility for all British athletes based here at Olympic Park.  With the right investment in facilities, resources and people Great Britain can consistently challenge the very best in the world. Let us give our sports men and women the very best opportunity to shine on the world stage for generations to come.",
