        "additional_details": "We demand that the BBC Trust Board reverses its decision to cut Radio Lancashire's budget by 20% and restore it to its former level, in fact it should be increased to combat the growing local commercial stations biased news and opinion output.\r\n\r\nThe proposed reduction of our local programmes is unacceptable to Radio Lancashire listeners.  Radio Lancashire is a wonderful asset to our community.  Its commitment to providing local news and national news, which affects us locally, is exemplary.  It makes sure local people take part in its programmes, in which many of us have contributed.  It certainly reflects the needs of our community and covers local sport very well, particularly sports not covered by national radio and local television.  It gives prominence to local musicians and artists, supporting local culture.\r\n\r\nWe demand that Radio Lancshire is preserved at least in its present form.",
