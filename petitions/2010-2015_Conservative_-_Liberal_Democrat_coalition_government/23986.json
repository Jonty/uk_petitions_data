        "additional_details": "The credit crisis and its economic repercussions have left the British public in no doubt that we are subject to an increasingly interconnected global economy.\r\n\r\nAs such, the UK would benefit from the creation of a Secretary for International Economic Affairs. Along with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, this individual would share responsibility for monitoring and guiding ongoing economic cooperation between the UK and other countries. More importantly, the new Secretary would be charged with outlining the government's response to changes in the global economy and the UK's fluctuating role within it.\r\n\r\nThis simple move would provide the British public and the House of Commons with a single figure who represents the government in this little-understood feature of the modern world.",
