The BBC portrays Deaf and disabled people as an underclass not fit to be shown as the \u2018face\u2019 of the BBC. See for yourself, watch the BBC and if you agree please sign the petition to ask the government to either force the BBC to employ more Deaf and disabled presenters or abolish the licence fee for Deaf and disabled people.\r\n\r\n",
