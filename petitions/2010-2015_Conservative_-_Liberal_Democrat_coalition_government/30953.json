        "additional_details": "This is a petition aimed to put pressure on the UK government to aid the capture and arrest of Joseph Kony, who is responsible for the mass murder, abduction and sex politicianry of children in Uganda. For over 20 years Kony has been allowed to continue his reign of terror, abducting over 30,000 children from their parents are forcing them to become soldiers or sex politicians. If this happened to a single child in the UK it would cause outrage, yet it has happened repeatedly in Uganda and it is ignored as it is not in Britain's interests to get involved. However if enough people make it known to our government that we want change and we want to stand up for what is right - not what it profitable, then we can make a difference. America has sent in advisers to aid Kony's arrest and Britain needs to do the same. If you want to prevent more children being abducted and forced to kill under Kony's reign please sign this petition. Stand up and be counted.",
