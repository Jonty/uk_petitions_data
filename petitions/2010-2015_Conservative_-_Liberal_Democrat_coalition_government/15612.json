        "additional_details": "Our economy is not as unbalanced as we are often told.  There are commercial success stories all over this country. However, when it comes to getting the right regulation, the right investment and the right international marketing, London and the South East (where Parliament is based) and financial services (in which lots of MPs used to work) get a head start.  I do not begrudge them this success \u2013 I just want to see it spread more widely.  The British Government must find out what would help businesses of all types and sizes and from all parts of the country to fulfil their potential.  The Government must establish a series of Business Review Commissions \u2013 for different industries, regions and business sectors.  The business people involved would meet to discuss their experiences and agree recommendations to put to the Government.   The Government would not be able to accede to all requests but it would gain a better idea of how to promote a diverse and successful economy.  ",
