        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand that BBC Television re-commence production of the early-90's BBC 1 soap opera, \"Eldorado\". This show was produced using licence payers money, and was cruelly axed, despite ratings improving massively in its final transmissions. We expect the BBC to honour their commitment to drama and make plans for a new series.",
