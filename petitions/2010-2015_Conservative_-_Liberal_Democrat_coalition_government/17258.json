        "additional_details": "People who knowingly drive uninsured are highly dangerous. If there were a psychology test for drivers, they would display the wrong mindset for driving. Irresponsible, a lack of care and consideration for the welfare of others and a willingness to break the law. So they are unfit to drive vehicles at all.\r\n\r\nThese people show that they will not care about the condition and safety of their vehicle, tyres, brakes and worse their manner of driving too.\r\n\r\nIn view of the foregoing, they should, on first conviction, be fined with a lifetime driving ban. A repeat offence would carry a long prison term.      ",
