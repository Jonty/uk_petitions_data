        "additional_details": "The SRA code of conduct states, \u201cWhere two or more Principles come into conflict the one which takes precedence is the one which best serves the public interest in the particular circumstances, especially the public interest in the proper administration of justice.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently the SRA has the power to strike-off the Solicitors but has NO POWER to enforce the law and compel the struck-off Solicitors and their own Professional Indemnity Insurance to make full recompense. It is therefore failing to serve the public interest.\r\n\r\nWe would like the law to be changed so that the SRA Compensation Fund and the Solicitors' Professional Indemnity Insurance are compelled to settle promptly all charges and all cost incurred levied against any Solicitors who were struck-off, and have caused unnecessary financial loss and huge distress to innocent parties.\r\n",
