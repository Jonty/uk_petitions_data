The actions of some companies and governments threaten the fundamental freedoms of the Web.\r\n\r\nThe world wide web was designed for collaboration and the free flow of ideas. It was never intended to be the all seeing eye of the state.\r\n\r\nWe would like permanent constitutional protection for the the Internet / world wide web that puts restrictions and controls on those who seek to spy on us.\r\n\r\nA magna carta for the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\nI also urge you to sign the petition here as well: https://webwewant.org/\r\n\r\n",
