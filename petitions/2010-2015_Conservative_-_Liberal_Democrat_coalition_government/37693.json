        "additional_details": "As you have probably read GCSE and A level grades have decreased this year, and it's not because of tougher exams. The exam boards under clear political pressure increased the grade boundaries at the last moment, because 'too many' people were expected to get a grade C. Not only does this destroy the chances of many candidates getting into sixth form or futher education courses, it completely goes against the principles of improvement and progression. ",
