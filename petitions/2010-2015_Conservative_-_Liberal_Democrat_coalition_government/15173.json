        "additional_details": "Smoking related sickness causes untold suffering to families and communities across the UK. The costs to the NHS from smoking related illness could well offset the tax revenue gleaned from tobacco products. The kingdom of Bhutan made tobacco illegal in 2010 and has not suffered to any great degree as a result. The undersigned would like to see an end to the pernicious blight of smoking, which currently plagues households throughout England, and agree that making the possession of tobacco illegal is a vital step toward that goal.",
