Such a measure would bring the Recruitment Industry into line with that of Estate Agents in terms of an obligation to forward expressions of interest to clients.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecruitment Industry definition:\r\nOrganisations concerned with attracting, screening, and selecting qualified people for a job.",
