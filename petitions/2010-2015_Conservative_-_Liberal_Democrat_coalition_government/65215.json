        "additional_details": "A skate park was built around 8 years ago after consultation with only a small number of bmx cyclists. As a result the design and materials are completely wrong and dangerous for the safe use by skate boarders. For example the main ramp is dangerously steep. Children therefore do not use it as much as other local skate parks. We would like the local council to review it and improve it.",
