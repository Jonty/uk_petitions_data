BOTH parents should have to agree to it, not just the primary carer.\r\nThe individual who is home educating should not receive benefits, they should get a job and allow the child to benefit from the education system that we're already paying for.\r\nTaxpayers are paying for an education system AND paying for every local authority to maintain an Elective Home Education department to monitor these people. Plus the benefits for the home 'educator' - it makes no sense.",
