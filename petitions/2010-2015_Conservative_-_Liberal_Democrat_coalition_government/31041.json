        "additional_details": "Joseph Kony is the most wanted war criminal across the world and this year we are raising the awareness in order for him to be arrested and bought to justice. He abducts children in their sleep from their homes in countries such as Uganda and forces the boys to fight for him as child soldiers and the girls are used as sex slaves. This petition is to try and make our government aware of this despicable man and encourage them to help in the fight to bring him to justice.",
