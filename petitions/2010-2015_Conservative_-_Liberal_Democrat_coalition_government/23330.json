        "additional_details": "The majority of UK citizens struggle hard to afford a mortgage, and if they are unable to buy a house, pay a lot of money in rent. This is while holding down a job, sometimes more than one, and not receiving a single penny in benefits.\r\nMeanwhile, people in subsidised housing, however much they deserve it, are now being offered a 50% discount on real estate.\r\nThis is unfair to ALL of those struggling to make mortgage and rent payments in the private sector. The 50% discount should be extended to ALL those who cannot afford their own place to live - and should start with first time buyers.",
