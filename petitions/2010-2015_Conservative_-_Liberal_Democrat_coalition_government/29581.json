        "additional_details": "A rapist serving time in a UK prison has been granted legal aid to ask a court for him to have access to his children by way of prison visits - even though his victim is his ex-wife, the mother of his children. He maintains that this is his human right. One of his children walked into the room whilst he was attacking the child's mother.\r\n\r\nIt is fundamentally wrong in a moral sense that this man should be allowed to pursue his victims in this way. The child that witnessed the offence may well be asked to recall and recount his experience in evidence, albeit by video-link in a distant location.\r\n\r\nI urge all to sign this petition in an effort to put an end to this abuse of victims and the public purse in funding cases where victims can be further traumatised by the perpetrator and the public - you and me - pay for the abuser to mount his campaign.\r\n",
