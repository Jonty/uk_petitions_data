        "additional_details": "It is not right that convicted, violent sex offenders are granted public funding to fight for access to their victim's children where these offenders are doing so to continue their cruel manipulation of their victims from their prison cells. These violent sex offenders often have a long history of horrendous domestic violence that has demonstrated scant regard for the children's welfare or safety. The government should deny access to public funds and should ensure the welfare and wellbeing of the children and the victim before any so called rights of the offender. They should also reprimand solicitors who submit applications that are not truthful. ",
