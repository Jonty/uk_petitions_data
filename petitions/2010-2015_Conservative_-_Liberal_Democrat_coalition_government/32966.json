        "additional_details": "In order to avoid future and otherwise inevitable water shortages in the South of England and all the consequential economic and social damages they might otherwise cause, a national grid of water pipes, where practical underground, should be created covering the whole of England and preferably the whole of the UK mainland. Such an infrastructure project should be started immediately as it may take years to complete. It would have a far greater positive cost/benefit impact nationwide than any other major infrastructural project currently being planned so one of those could be abandoned instead. ",
