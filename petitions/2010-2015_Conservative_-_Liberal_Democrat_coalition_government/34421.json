        "additional_details": "The UK Government abandoned British-Chinese Soldiers loyal to this Country & HM the Queen when it handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997.  Prior to doing so, a so-called 'Lottery for Passports' was carried out by the UK Government, which shamelessly granted ONLY 500 British-Chinese Soldiers with passports.\r\n\r\nThe remaining soldiers were refused the same rights.  As a result more than 1500 soldiers and their dependants have been forgotten, stranded in Hong Kong and controlled by a communist regime.  The UK Government originally refused Gurkha Soldiers similar rights, reversing their decision due to public outrage.\r\n\r\nWe believe the UK Government should make amends for this shameful act and issue them with UK passports.  The British-Chinese soldiers deserve the respect of our nation, which they helped to defend.\r\n",
