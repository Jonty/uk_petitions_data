        "additional_details": "At present anybody with or without any basic knowledge of how the public highway should be used can do a one day CBT (Compulsory Basic Training) course from the age of 16 and be allowed to ride a 50cc motorcycle or scooter on the public highway, 125cc if 17 years or over. To be able to do a further test to be able to ride a motorcycle with a bigger engine they have to first do a simple theory and hazard perception test which tests the basic knowledge of an individuals understanding of the public highways rules and regulations aswell as some general knowledge on the motorcycle, and also tests the individuals ability to spot a hazard. We believe that the theory test should have to be passed BEFORE anybody can attempt the CBT. If a theory cannot be passed the individual should not be allowed on the road as they clearly don't understand the basic rules of the highway and therefore would be a danger to themselves and others.
