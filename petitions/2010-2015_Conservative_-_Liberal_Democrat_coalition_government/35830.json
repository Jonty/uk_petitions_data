        "additional_details": "I think the sales of \"Pre-Sale\" and \"Priority\" Tickets for concerts and gigs should be abandoned with. Mainly because why should other dedicated fans have more of a priority other the rest of us? What makes them so much better than us? We are all the same, and in terms of equality no one should get \"special treatment\". If you agree with me and would like to see these stopped then sign this petition.",
