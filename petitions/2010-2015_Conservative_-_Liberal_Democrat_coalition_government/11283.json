        "additional_details": "Following the recently published \"London rioters to lose all benefits\" e-petition. The department for work and pensions has announced that upon conviction the offenders lose the right to social benefits.\r\nWhat is little known is that the onus is placed on the offenders to notify the DWP that they are in prison and to stop the benefit payments. Inevitably, this rarely happens and many offenders continue to receive benefits whilst inside prison.\r\nThis petition is a call for the courts, upon conviction, to inform the DWP of the conviction and then automatically remove any benefits from the offender.\r\nThe onus would then be placed onto the offender, upon release from prison, to reapply for any benefits.",
