        "additional_details": "Too many elderly people are dying or being badly injured through crime or anti-social behaviour. Some are living in fear.\r\nI want a caring community. I`m sure everybody does. Individuals that cause harm or fear to the elderly, should be placed on a register, just like sex offenders. If a child is the offender, the parent should be held responsible for not educating their child about respect.\r\nThis country has a terrible reputation for not caring about our elders. it`s about time the `Government` started to do something about it.\r\nShame these cowards for `life`. Put them on a register for life. I wouldn`t want a friend that is on the register, or be romantically involved with an `Elder Abuser` no more than I would a sex offender.\r\nPlease sign. Think of your own future and your family.",
