        "additional_details": "The coalition government has made a mission to balance the books on the UK economy, which considering its current state, needs  a complete overhaul.\r\nHowever, the reduction in services has been justified by a reliance on community or voluntary groups. The individuals involved in these groups give up a tremendous amount of free time, not just in running community activities but planning them. There are also individuals that give care to loved ones that the local authority should be the provider, these are often took for granted.\r\nIn the context of the cost savings made by this alternative provision of services, the government should offer tax relief in income tax or a community rebate to those involved in voluntary or charity provision on an official basis. If you give up your free time and feel unrewarded for your hard work, please sign below.",
