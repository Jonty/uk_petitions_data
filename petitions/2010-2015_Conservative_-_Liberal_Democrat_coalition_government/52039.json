        "additional_details": "I would like a new law to come in place for people that private rent to be able to have pets without having to ask the landlord.\r\nIn most cases you pay a deposit that is kept in a government scheme that you get back if there is no damages.\r\nSo therefore, if your animal damages the property then you should be made to pay for it.\r\nI just think it's so unfair that my children and a lot of children out there are growing up without pets.\r\nI help out in an animal rescue centre and it makes me me mad that we have a lovely 3 bed house with a lovely garden and we cannot give one of them a home.\r\nWhy can council tenants have pets and pay less and us that private rent ( because nobody can afford the deposit to buy!) Can not.\r\nI'm not talking a house full of pets, just 1 pet.\r\nPlease can this be looked into.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nMiss Francis",
