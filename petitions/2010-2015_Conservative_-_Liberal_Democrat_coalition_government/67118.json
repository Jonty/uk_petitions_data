        "additional_details": "Rolf Harris has just been sentenced to 5 years and 9 months after being convicted of 12 sex offences, the youngest being 8.  Half of the sentence will be out on licence. I petition that he should spend a minimum of 10 years in jail, as if the offence on the 8 year old occurred to day he would be looking at 14 years, that is without the remaining 11 charges.  I have no problem with him being 84, if he committed the crime then he should be sentenced at today's tariffs.",

If you believe a sentence given in a Crown Court appears to be very low, or unduly lenient, anyone can contact the Attorney General's office asking for the sentence to be reviewed as long as it is within 28 days of sentencing. It also only takes one person to make such a request.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Rolf Harris the Attorney General\u2019s Office has already requested the papers from the Crown Prosecution so one of the Law Officers can decide whether or not to refer the sentences to Court of Appeal as being unduly lenient."
