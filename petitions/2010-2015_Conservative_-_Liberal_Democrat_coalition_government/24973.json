        "additional_details": "We call upon the Coalition Government through the Department for Transport to look again at the provisions of the Blue Badge Reform Scheme. Many thousands of genuine Blue Badge existing holders with breathing problems like Asthma and COPD are being refused renewal if they are not Registered Disabled. This obviously discriminates against people who are not disabled per say but are physically impaired non the less. We call upon the DFT to issue more flexible guidelines to Local Authorities.",
