        "additional_details": "Joseph Kony is the world\u2019s worst war criminal. In 1987 he took over leadership of an existing rebel group and renamed it the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA). While the LRA is no longer active in Northern Uganda (where it originated), it continues it campaign of violence in Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan.\r\n\r\nIn response to the efforts of www.invisiblechildren.com,  the US Government has sent 100 military advisors to help train local forces \u2013 advisors that could be pulled at any time.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to aid those efforts by requesting that the UK send 50 British troops to support the search effort.\r\n\r\nWorking globally, working together, we can make a difference. Make this year count.\r\n",
