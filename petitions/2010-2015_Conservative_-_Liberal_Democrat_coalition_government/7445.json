        "additional_details": "Protect your community!!! Proud community members should be able to join a community based riot-police force, to assist the police force during riots such as in early August 2011 in London. This would allow people to protect their community when the police force is stretched. It would also show the rioters and looters just how much of a minority they really are.\r\n\r\nThese PROUD community members would train in their spare time and operate when necessary. They  would operate alongside each other while being led by full time police officers.",
