        "additional_details": "I call on HM Government to take action to enable legislation to be passed that guarantees an interview to any applicant defined as long term unemployed who meets the essential selection criteria for an advertised job.\r\n\r\nI propose that an independent body be established to police the legislation and address issues arising from employers and their agents who do not comply. The independent body shall have powers to impose financial penalties on employers and their agents who fail to comply.\r\n\r\nIndeed, long term unemployed people come from many diverse backgrounds ranging from university graduates, disabled, people who have been carers, people of young and mature age groups, people who have been made redundant, and those who have recovered from long term illness. Many are excellent professionals who are suffering from the stigma of long term unemployment.\r\n\r\nFor detailed information please visit:\r\nwww.gjisltu.co.uk",
