In order to increase this percentage we need to  first of all make the system fair, why should the remaining 61% of the population be eligible to receive a donor organ if they are not willing to donate their own? I want the Government to introduce a law which will insure only over 18's signed up to the Organ Register will be eligible to receive donations.",
