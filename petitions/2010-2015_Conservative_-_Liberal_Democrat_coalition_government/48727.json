Are people from China still called yellow people? Are Arabs and Mediterranean people called beige or brown? And Sri Lankans black people? When did you last hear a Native American called a red Indian? Inconsistent \u2013 all other races are described by heritage;we are described in the way animals and inanimate objects are.Why? We believe history,lack of respect,laziness and casual racism have alot to do with it. \u201cBlack\u201d has had its time and its purpose in the 1960s and 70s and belongs to the 20th century.Skin-deep terminology does not respect us as human beings.Regain our dignity and insist on description by heritage -\u2018people of African descent\u2019  in conversation,official language,broadcasts and by institutions.British Africans,British African-Caribbeans,African-American,etc can be used when being more specific.Tell the Office of National Statistics - STOP using \"black\".",
