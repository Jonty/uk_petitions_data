(Yep, pointless as you've already paid for insurance remember?)\r\n\r\nAs a recent campaign by Labour\u2019s shadow transport minister John Woodcock has highlighted, blameless motorists can still face premium increases simply because they\u2019ve been involved in an accident.\r\n\r\nBut even if your car is damaged by another motorist, you can still lose out by making a claim against them \u2013 even if they admit liability and allow your insurer to claw back any repair costs from their policy.\r\n\r\nI've spoken to loads of people who are scared to use their insurance because prices are astronomical\r\n\r\nLet's get it sorted ONE PRICE UPFRONT to ACTUALLY USE YOUR INSURANCE WHEN WE NEED IT MOST.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
