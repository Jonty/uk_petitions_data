This being on the grounds of applicants that fled in fear of life, There circumstances have changed and alot of the people that was in fear, no longer have that fear as leaders and gangs have dispersed ie: Saddam Hussain, Bin larden ect.\r\nThis in turn would help stabilize they economy, money, jobs and houses. All new applicants should go through a more vigorous review process and limit the number of successful applicants each year and review this cases annually.",
