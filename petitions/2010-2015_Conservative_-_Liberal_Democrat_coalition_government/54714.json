        "additional_details": "fox hunting has been going on too long and is just barbaric and yet 90% of the time farmers who claim to be losers are employing hooray henrys to go and kill them so they will stop killing their livestock i disagree with this, farmers are murderers too taking their source of income to the slaughterhouse which makes them guilty many times over. leave the foxes alone it's just so barbaric and murderous i don't know how the people who do this can sleep at night but let's face it they don't have a conscience either. sign the petition and get this out of society once and for all the government must ban this bloodsport i mean when does it become a sport isn't the other participant meant to have a chance?",
