The proposal is simply to voluntarily increase National Insurance contributions in line with individuals current salaries which then go to a Government backed and guaranteed fund. An annual statement is produced for each individual showing what they would get should they choose to retire at 50, 55, 60, 65 or whatever. The individual then gets the incentive to save for a retirement of their making.",
