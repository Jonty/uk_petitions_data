The set criteria at the moment is far to high therefore very few cancer patients can be given funding by NHS in N Ireland.\r\n\r\nAs N Ireland dosn't have a cancer fund like other parts of the United kingdom this treatment needs to become more\r\naccessible to cancer patients in N Ireland.\r\nIn order for this treatment to be more available to patients who would benefit from it, the criteria needs to be set lower, as it is now, only a very small percentage of patients can benefit from Cetuximab.",
