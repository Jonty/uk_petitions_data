The \u00a318,600 a year financial requirement is ridiculously high for working class British citizens, especially for the younger people who just want to be together as a family. Change the laws so that they can come to England and work providing they are sponsored by someone in the family, but just cannot claim benefits off of the state. Please sign!",
