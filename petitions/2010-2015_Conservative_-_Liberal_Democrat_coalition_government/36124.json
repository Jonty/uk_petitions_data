        "additional_details": "I would like a ban on cyclists using 60mph roads.\r\nThey present a significant to themselves and motorists.Today for example I saw a family on a narrow 60mph limit section of the A487. The parents were each towing young children in bike buggies. On a section where the road bends left I saw four cars and one lorry having to brake hard to avoid colliding with them from the rear. Many others cycle 2 abreast causing obstruction on narrow sections. Many are simply unaware of the speed limits in force locally.",
