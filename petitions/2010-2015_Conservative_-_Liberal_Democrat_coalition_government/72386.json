        "additional_details": "On 27th October Shenayah Broome age 6 weeks was refused by GRO the right to have her father's name on her Birth Certificate as her Father David Broome had died on 22nd October.  His family do not contest him to be the father and he was present at all maternity appointments and is named in the Hospital Records.\r\nThis petition is to ask the government to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953 Section 10A adding that in circumstances where the father is deceased before the registration of the birth, his name can be added by the swearing of an Affidavit and production of a death certificate.  In cases where this is contested by a third party then DNA may be requested. ",
