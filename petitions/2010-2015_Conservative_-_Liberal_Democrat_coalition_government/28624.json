        "additional_details": "Since RBS is owned by the taxpayer then it is the taxpayer who should be allowed to exercise his or her legal right to vote on what goes on in RBS.  The government has repeatedly demonstrated that it does not have the interests of the taxpayer in mind in its dealings with the company.  And NOBODY has asked me if I wish to appoint the Prime Minister as my proxy vote at the AGM.  Many of us have shares in companies and many of us exercise our right to vote.  Why are we not allowed a vote in a company in which we have shares - RBS?",
