Food is the one thing we all have to have, it is the one thing no one can go without. from the Queen down to the tramp walking the streets we all must eat. Surely in this day and age we are capable of such an act as to abolish tax on food. It is the one single thing that will touch all who live and visit this country, and would send the message to the world that we the British hold life very dear indeed, and our government are doing all it can to support the people it governs..
