This should change to being charged to each individual person, whether it applies to that person, rather than the house as a whole.\r\n\r\nIf one person in that house is belligerent and selfish enough to avoid paying that tax then it falls upon the shoulders of any other residents registered to that house.\r\nGood people are being forced by the council to pay the debts of the morons they unwittingly find themselves living with.\r\n\r\nTo state it simply, council tax should be charged to a person living within a town or borough, or the councils should provide a system in which on entering shared accommodation they are registered separately so that everyone is equally responsible for the tax on that house.",
