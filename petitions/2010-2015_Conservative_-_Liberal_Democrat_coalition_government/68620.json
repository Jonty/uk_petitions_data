        "additional_details": "The government is intending to tighten internet surveillance, by blocking certain websites using key phrases.  New internet users will be forced not just to opt in specially to view pornagraphic content and to access gamblig sites, but also in orders to use social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this e-petition to stop these proposed increase of social surveillance which will make a number of perfectly legal sites (non-pornographic) blocked because they contain too many sexual phrases. People will have to opt in for social networking sites (non just porn). These proposals are one more step towards totalitarianism and take media censorship to a new level, this is against our rights in a supposedly fair democratic society with freedom of speech and association!\r\n\r\nI therefore call on the government to abandon these unnecessary measures which over-protect the public.",
