        "additional_details": "Regarding the recent MET investigation into missing Madeleine McCann\r\nWe the people demand answers to the following questions.\r\n1.Why are they only considering Abduction?\r\n2.Why are they dismissing the evidence of blood and cadaver found by the specialist dogs?\r\n3.Why is the statement of the Smiths who saw Gerry McCann carrying Madeleine being ignored?\r\n4.Have Scotland Yard managed to clarify all the discrepancies in the groups statements, if not why not?\r\n5.Will the McCann's now face serious neglect charges ? if not why not?\r\n6.Is it not true there is evidence of the twins being drugged on the evening in question and that they also both failed to respond to any stimulation and in fact mother Kate McCann would \"wander\" in and check for signs of life so convinced was she ( despite not calling for medical assistance)?\r\n7.The Abductor had mere mins to break and enter drug and kidnap Madeleine why is Abduction most likely?",
