I often wonder why I was able to go through 5 years of secondary eduction without knowing simple facts like the difference between the Home Secretary and the Foreign Secretary.\r\n\r\nSince children are not being taught such important issues, i believe that we are creating a society ignorant of politics and current affairs.\r\n\r\nI believe that this is one of the major factors why the country's percentage of voters is so low. The last general election only saw a turnout of 65% and this could be higher if more people have a knowledge of the system.\r\n\r\nI also think that the more uneducated and ignorant people are to the political system, the easier we are to govern as a country and this is bad for democracy.\r\n\r\nPlease sign, thank you.",
