        "additional_details": "To get Askern station re-opened for residents of the surrounding areas to travel to either Doncaster and beyond or Pontefract/Wakefield. It would be incredibly beneficial for people to use as the buses are always packed full of people to the point where they don't stop. I think trains would play a vital role in the community of the future.",
