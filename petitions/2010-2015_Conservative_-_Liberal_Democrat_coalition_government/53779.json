        "additional_details": "The East Midlands Ambulance Service have decided that Wellingborough and Rushden Ambulance stations will close. This is without any proper consultation with members of the public and despite staff raising their concerns for public safety. East Northamptonshire will have no major Ambulance facility. Wellingborough, Rushden, Higham Ferrers, Irchester, Gt Doddington, Finedon, Wollaston, Bozeat and all other surrounding towns and villages will have to wait for Emergency Ambulances from further a field and potentially this could be the difference between life and death. Despite the fact that they are facing a parliamentary review on plans, they are going ahead with all proposed changes before anything can be done. We need to stop them and have an urgent review on all aspects of their Being The Best plans before its too late. As a local resident, I feel passionate about the fact that my family and friends will undoubtedly suffer as a result of these closures.",
