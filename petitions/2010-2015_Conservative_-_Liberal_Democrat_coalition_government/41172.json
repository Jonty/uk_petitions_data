So even if you haven't typed in underage, incest or Lolita. Those key words are stored on your computer and the authorities would simply assume that you had intended to view illegal content.\r\n\r\nDid you know that websites which operate pop-ups tend to use these keywords? So if you come across just one of these websites, due to the number of pop-ups that are activated. It may look like you have actually submitted numerous searches for illegal content.\r\n\r\nOne way to stop people falling for this trap is to remove these websites from the internet for good.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to make the government do something about this growing problem, to force erotic entertainment providers to join the trusted erotic entertainment providers\u2019 alliance and sign an agreement not to operate in an illegal manner.\r\n",

            "details": "The vast majority of the UK ISP industry takes a responsible approach to what content it hosts, both of its own volition and in co-operation with law enforcement and Government agencies.  Where the industry is advised that content they host contravenes legislation, they will readily remove it.  In addition, ISPs have contracts with their customers called good practice Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), which they have recently strengthened, about what may be hosted on their servers.\r\n\r\nComplaints about a particular website\u2019s content should first be directed to the site\u2019s manager.  Most AUPs already contain a general clause which allows ISPs to remove sites or content which contain offensive or objectionable material, even if it is not illegal.  Arrangements similar to AUPs apply to many websites, including social networking sites.  Those people, who find user content offensive or suspect, should therefore report their concerns to the appropriate social network site."
