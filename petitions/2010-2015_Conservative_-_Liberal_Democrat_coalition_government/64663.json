But for housing association residents, the scheme applies only to those with secure tenancies started before 1989. The maximum discount that housing associations can get is 16k, some as low as 9k.I think first time buyers keep the housing markets moving, also give tenants on low income a nest egg for the future when state pensions  as they will own a real tangible asset that could also have growth potential.\r\n\r\n",
