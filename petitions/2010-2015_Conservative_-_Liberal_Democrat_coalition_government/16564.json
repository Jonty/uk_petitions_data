We have people who harm themselves with drugs and alcohol and are rewarded at the taxpayers expense with free money.The system is abused too much and it needs to change. Alcoholics aren't disabled. A blind person receives less money than an alcoholic or drug abuser. This is shocking and disturbing. Please sign this petition so something can be done about the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.disabledgo.com/blog/2010/08/alcoholics-not-disabled-people-says-equality-act-guidance/\r\n",
