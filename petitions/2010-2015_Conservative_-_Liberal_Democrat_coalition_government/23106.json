        "additional_details": "The British Association of Social Workers want the government to scrap plans to make social workers in England pay twice to keep their place on the social work register when responsibility moves from the General Social Care Council to the Health Professions Council.\r\n\r\nSocial workers are already seeing registration fees doubling because of the move to the HPC, and now they face paying twice to undergo the same administrative process. In addition, social workers will have to pay also a one off non-refundable scrutiny fee of \u00a353 to be paid at the time of first registration.\r\n\r\nSocial workers do not get a choice to refuse to pay this fee, it is compulsory.\r\n\r\nThe government must act to synchronise the different renewal date systems between the two organisations and not penalise hard working and under paid social workers.\r\n",
