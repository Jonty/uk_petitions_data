My view is 5 years.\r\n\r\nMany people who commmit crime are on benefits. This as a law would reduce crime and also reduce the high cost of benefits for DWP.\r\n\r\nUp for discussion could be the type of crime (inditable) or the length of time of the benefit banning.\r\n\r\nPeople committing crime should not be adding to the cost of welfare for Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAppeals could be considered in certain circumstances.",
