This video is blatantly mocking the Noah's Ark story.\r\n\r\nThis video needs to be banned everywhere!\r\n\r\nIf this was directed to another religion they'll most likely see a very aggressive response forcing them to remove the content. We need to make a stand, to prevent companies doing this in the future. We should also boycott their products until they completely get rid of the video and make an official apology. ",
