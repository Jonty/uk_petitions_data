This is driven by a need to fill air time and 'entertain', rather than inform the viewing public.\r\n\r\nIt is also clear that the coverage of these channels contributed to the spread of unrest across the UK recently by endlessly showing footage of the earlier disturbances.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, during periods of genuine crisis, these channels with their constant re-hashing of the same incidents every 15 minutes for days at a time only serve to distort the severity or seriousness of these events in the eyes of the viewer, and instil unnecessary fear in UK citizens.\r\n",
