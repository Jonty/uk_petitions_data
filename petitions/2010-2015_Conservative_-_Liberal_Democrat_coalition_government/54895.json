        "additional_details": "Pay Finnan Boonnak DLA. He was born with an incurable genetic disease which means he cannot walk. He was awarded highest level disability allowance when he was one, but now you have taken it off him, saying he has been out of the country for too long to claim, and that he must wait for two years until he can claim again. He was born in the UK, he is a British citizen, he is 3 years old. You promised that austerity cuts would not hurt children, but Finnan has been denied access to a better standard of living. I have paid National Insurance contributions all the time  we were living in Thailand. We went there because I was seconded as a teacher to a position in my sister school and always intended to return to the UK, our home, after the two years had finished. And here we are. You stopped Finnan's original claim in April 2013. Why? This was three months before he returned. Pay Finnan DLA and allow him access to the facilities and services a severely disabled three year old needs.    ",
