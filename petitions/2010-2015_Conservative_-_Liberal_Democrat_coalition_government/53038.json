        "additional_details": "Many patients call for an ambulance if they need a taxi to the hospital. Some are not in need of emergency care and it costs the government a large amount of tax payers money every time an ambulance is called out. I suggest that the government impose a fine on those who are not in need of emergency care in order to defer people from calling unless there is a real emergency. We need to start saving real money in the NHS in order to save it.",
