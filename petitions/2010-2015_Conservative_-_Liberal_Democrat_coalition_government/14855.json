        "additional_details": "The Liberal Democrats pledged prior to the election to protect youth services by making them statutory and, now they are in government, they should keep this pledge.  The past year's government policies and the impact on young people have demonstrated how vital this pledge is, and yet it has been buried and forgotten.  For the future of our young people we need a commitment to professional youth services that are accessible to all young people and encourage cross community engagement, support and preparation for adulthood, delivered by well trained, professional youth workers.  It is a false economy to cut services that give young people hope, vital informal education and a sense of belonging in their communities.  The government must now act and protect youth services from further cuts by making their provision a statutory requirement of all local authorities.",
