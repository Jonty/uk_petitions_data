        "additional_details": "In a news story today a UN Special Rapporteur is reported as saying that the UK has 'sexist culture'. Her preliminary report says that she has serious concerns around the portrayal of women and girls in the British media. In an age where the sexualisation of our children is becoming more and more of an issue isn't it time that we looked again at what we consider to be acceptable here?\r\n\r\nThere are no doubt worse culprits than Page 3 but it can't be right that such easily accessible material portrays women as blatant sexual objects (unless you really believe that people value Suzie from Kidderminster's opinions on world news). My concern with Page 3 is mainly around how prolific it is and the fact that it helps to set the unconscious norm around the role that women play in society.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges the government to consider taking steps to ban Page 3 from our newspapers.
