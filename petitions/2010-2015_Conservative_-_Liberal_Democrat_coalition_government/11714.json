NO OPT OUTS.\r\nCourse to comprise subjects such as respect, self confidence and job training with a view to offering full employment on completion. Run on military lines (by redundant military personnel?) the course should instill some discipline without seeming like conscription. Emphasis on team activities and sports. It must be a government run activity and be a natural follow-on from schooling.\r\nObjective- to instill some respect and self confidence into our youth.",
