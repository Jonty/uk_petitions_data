        "additional_details": "Everyone deserves a second chance. The angry and misguided youth who recently committed criminal acts of violence, public disorder and looting should be subject to restorative justice and should also be given a second chance through probation and facilities that will help them to turn their lives round through developing skills and competences that will give them a fighting chance of making good in society. To this end, the government should invest in 'second chance' youth facilities and restorative justice services and issue sentencing guidelines accordingly.",
