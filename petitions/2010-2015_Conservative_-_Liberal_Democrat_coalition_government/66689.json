The last 'improvement' has simply made the crossing on Pellens Corner more confusing than safe, and I cannot see what advantage it has had, if any at all.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a safer improvement done to the crossing, as it is so close to the port lorries and larger vehicles are common, and we have seen a number of incidents including them.\r\n\r\nSuggestions include a lower speed limit, making the A120 into a dual carriageway, or a roundabout. Anything to prevent the speed of vehicles at the crossing and possibly make visibility better also, as it is difficult to see sometimes.\r\n\r\nToo many people have died here, lives need to be considered.
