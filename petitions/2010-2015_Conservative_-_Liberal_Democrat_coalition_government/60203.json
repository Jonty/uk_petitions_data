Some animals do not come within the definition of animal within the Road Traffic Act 1988 so you are not required to report it to the police. However, it may be worth contacting the police to inform them of the incident. Also the local authority will need to be contacted to remove the remains of the animal.See the website/ phone book in related information to find your local authority. A dog (as more rights) does come within the remit of the Road Traffic Act and is a reportable accident so you are required by law to report it to the police. theirs is law about a dog but not for a cats which it might as have people that love it could be your son or daughter cat then what? we can change the law on cats I would like to see the government enforce in the law that the welfare of cats is protected better by making it a legal requirement to stop and report it if you hit a cat whilst driving\r\n",
