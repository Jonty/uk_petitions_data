However, even a blind man can see the duplicity of him saying it protects us from climate change and Cameron saying it protects us from crime and terrorism.  It simply CANNOT be doing both, so which is it Prime a Minister.  We know the truth is that it does neither because foreign aid is done by you against the wishes of your people BECAUSE YOU THINK IT MAKES YOU LOOK GOOD.  Sorry, you are WAY, WAY beyond looking good at anything - except for giving OUR money away to foreigners!",
