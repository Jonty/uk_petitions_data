This is adding to the overall disenfranchisement people feel towards the political system.  If we want a representative democracy then it should at least start with votes being represented by legally binding promises upon which politicians are elected.\r\nThis would, undoubtedly, be in the public interest which the Attorney General should oversee as obligated by tenure of position as guardian of the public interest.",
