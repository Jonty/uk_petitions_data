        "additional_details": "The content of television licence letters is often intimidatory and harassing to those on the receiving end. Often such letters imply that legal action has already been commenced and that the recipient faces imminent prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe government should introduce new guidelines to prevent the television licensing authorities from using language which causes harassment, alarm or distress.\r\n\r\nA provision should be included in the Protection From Harassment Act 1997 to make it unlawful for regulatory bodies to intentionally cause harassment, alarm or distress. It is not in the best interests of the British public to allow them to escape prosecution under the existing provisions.",
