        "additional_details": "Parents are charged when they take their children out of school early due to sky high prices for holidays during school holidays.  This is a way of parents saving money by taking children during term time.\r\n\r\nTeachers are striking over pay and conditions as well as pensions and other money related issues.\r\n\r\nSurely the rules should apply to teachers and schools with regards to interrupting a childs education.  If parents are fined for removing their child from education during term time, then schools should have to pay parents when they strike and force children out of education.\r\n\r\nWhat happens to parents who break the rules?\r\nParents who do not have the school's permission for their child's absence face a maximum fine of \u00a360 per pupil, per parent. That rises to \u00a3120 if not paid within seven days.\r\n\r\nThe charges should be reversed to cover the childcare cost that parents have to pay or to cover the loss of wages during strike. ",
