I believe this would abolish / drastically reduce these crimes and improve society significantly, by removing / reducing the sexual drive of these offenders.\r\n\r\nThe offenders must also undergo psychotherapy to treat the illness.\r\n\r\nAlternatively - incarceration until the end of the offender's life would keep our loved ones safe.\r\n\r\nThese penalties would not only act as a deterrent, but also treat the sickness so that society can flourish.\r\n",
