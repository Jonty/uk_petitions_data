        "additional_details": "I believe that Tony Blair should get locked up for war crimes. He sent the British into Iraq to a war they couldn't win. He caused 179 British deaths, and thousands of innocent people to die, and the blood is on his hands. The war was illegal, and Blair knows it was illegal. This man should be in prison, as he has committed a crime against war. ",
