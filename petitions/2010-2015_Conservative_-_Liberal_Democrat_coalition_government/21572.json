        "additional_details": "The Americanism of Santa/Santa Claus has grown in use over the past few years in the British media to the point at which now you hardly ever hear the British media using the name Father Christmas (which is the proper English name for this traditional figure).  The undersigned believe that this little part of our English culture should be protected against an americanism which is now being used by a growing number of English children because of the influence the British media has over them.  The undersigned believes that to protect the name Father Christmas from disappearing the British media should be banned from using the names Santa/Santa Claus.",
