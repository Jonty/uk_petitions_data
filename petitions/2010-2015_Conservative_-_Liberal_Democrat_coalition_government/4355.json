        "additional_details": "The Climate Change Act will cripple the UK economy (to the tune of hundreds of billions of pounds) by imposing legally binding restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions that are more stringent than those of any other country on Earth. It is based on a totally false premise \u2013 the science of anthropogenic global warming was completely discredited by the \u201cclimategate\u201d scandal \u2013 and the policy is being pursued solely for financial gain by academics (grants), government (\u201cgreen\u201d taxes) and vested interests such as investors in subsidised \u201cgreen\u201d technologies and \u201cEnron-like\u201d carbon trading scams. The Act must be repealed before it is too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
