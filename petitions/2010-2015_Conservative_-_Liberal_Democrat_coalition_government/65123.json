Stephen Sutton has managed to turn his own personal tragedy into triumph, and raised the awareness to such a horrific illness more than many have managed over years in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis young man allowed the world to share in his final moments and has put the 'FUN' back into fundraising by generating more than \u00a33 Million to help fight this horrific disease.\r\n\r\nLet's do what Britain does well and honour such a terrific, brave and inspirational member of Great Britian.\r\n",
