It's a modern school set in the middle of the community which has had everything else taken away from them. The closure would literally rip the heart from the community. There are no spaces in the proposed new schools for our children and there for they would be taught in portocabins which are not an acceptable environment for our children to learn in. Please support the fight to save our school!",
