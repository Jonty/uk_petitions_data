        "additional_details": "I am 15 and was the victim of a crime when the guilty party was an elderly pensioner who was sentenced to 3 1/2 year sentence. In the judge's closing speech when delivering sentence he advised that the guideline stated that the usual sentence for these crimes was actually 7 1/2 years, but in the judges opinion the age of the offender should be taken into consideration and so the sentence passed was significantly lower than that of the guidelines.\r\n\r\nGiven recent events involving high profile sex offenders again, the issue of unduly lenient sentencing has arisen where age has been a deciding factor on the length of sentencing handed down. This is discriminatory and gives the impression that certain criminals can escape full justice due to age. Fairer sentencing for all must start now.",
