        "additional_details": "Facebook has made it incredibly difficult for creative parties to gain exposure due to the new facility through which page administrators have to pay to post to those who ALREADY \"like\" or \"follow\" pages.\r\n\r\nFacebook claims the following:\r\n\r\n\u201cFacebook\u2019s mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case. Charging a fee for advertisements to those who are unaware of the creative party's work is legitimate (in the form of \"Facebook advertising\"). However to try and gain capital through charging a fee for promoting to those who have already subscribed to various pages is highly unjustified and contradicts the above statement; quoted directly from the Facebook website.\r\n\r\nIt is hard enough for musicians, artists, film makers, designers and any other creative entity to gain exposure, let's not make it any more of a challenge. Sign this petition and support the creative talent in this world.",
