        "additional_details": "At the current time, bus services across Dartmoor National Park are non-existent, with only a minimal service over the short summer months. To prevent people using more cars, a comprehensive service comprising at least one year round, cross park route needs to be put in place to ensure accessibility for everyone, to especially help both the young and old, and tourists alike, and those without cars. In a society of declining health, access to all of the UKs National Parks should be a right.",
