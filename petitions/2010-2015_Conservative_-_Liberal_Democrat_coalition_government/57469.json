        "additional_details": "Currently you have to go through 3 miscarriages to be eligible for testing on the NHS.  These losses also have to be recurrent. I would personally like to see testing offered to any woman who has been through pregnancy loss twice.  It is insensitive to expect Women to keep going through pregnancy loss without any investigations. I hope women who have experienced loss will sign this petition as well as Health Care Professionals who are also against current legislation. ",
