        "additional_details": "We want genetically modified crops to cease being grown and a ban on all future genetically modified crops from being grown on United Kingdom land.\r\nGenetically Modified crops have been altered by humans by forcing non-food genes \u2013 from other species \u2013 into the DNA of plants, changing the very nature of the food itself.\r\nGM can cross-pollinate and spread their altered genes to other plants, and make it into non-GM crops and foods. This process will contaminate organic farms, home-growers, allotment growers and commercial farm land. The Organic certification from UK organic farming will be affected.\r\nMany countries around the world have banned, are banning or are moving towards a ban of GM farming and/or GM crops. The adverse effects that GM farming will have on the health of the land, wildlife and the people of the UK are, at best, unknown.\r\n\r\nWe want a ban on genetically modified farming in the UK. We want the UK to be GM FREE!",
