By the government's own admission, this is being ignored due to cultural sensitivity.\r\nhttp://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/columnists/111769/confront-charedi-taliban\r\n\r\nThe plight of a child cannot be ignored regardless of their cultural background. The government must introduce a programme that will ensure that every child is accounted for regardless of their cultural background.\r\n",
