        "additional_details": "       On Wednesday, 4th March 2015 at 10.00 PM BBC4 broadcasted a documentary titled as 'India's Daughter' which tells the story of brutal gang rape of a young woman in Delhi in December 2012. India's Delhi high court banned its broadcast in India as this documentary gives an opportunity to the rapist and defence lawyer to blame the victim for the rape. It is not acceptable that  BBC aired this documentary in UK earlier than planned by urgently rescheduling its programme list and facilitated the rapist and defence lawyer to appear infront of millions of viewers and justify the brutal gand rape without any regret.\r\n      Surrendering the moral values of media culture to get more viewership is not a good practise. As BBC is a public service broadcaster funded by the licence fee paid by the UK house holds, punish the responsible people for defaming the victim by broadcasting the documentary 'India's Daughter' in UK.
