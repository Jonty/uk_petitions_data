        "additional_details": "When the government introduce laws and policies they do not consider well enough the cumulative effect of these on different parts of society.\r\n\r\nFor example, young people nowadays cannot afford to buy a home, are paid a lower minimum wage, get less benefit entitlement, are forced into very high car insurance premiums and so on. Jobs are difficult to find and often it is impossible for young people to survive and lead a decent life if they have no parental support.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to examine the circumstances of every generation once a year to determine whether it is actually possible for someone to get a job and pay all their required living expenses without breaking the law and without having family help. The results of this should guide government policies for the forthcoming year.",
