        "additional_details": "Children at risk are being failed by Government agencies and their inability/failure to deal with abusive/life-threatening situations.  Daniel Pelka, Baby P and Victoria Climbie are three high profile examples where inaction lead to suffering and death.\r\n\r\n1. The Government needs to have a clear policy that obliges agencies to implement swift measures where danger is suspected.\r\n2. Schools need to have a nominated individual who is responsible for liaising with social services and police and who is obliged to act on the concerns of staff/parents so that no report goes un-investigated.\r\n3. Children can't just vanish from the horizon - GPs, social workers and schools need to have a means of identifying children who fit a profile - in the case of Daniel - excessive loss of weight, stealing food, suspicious behaviour by parent. EG a totting up system could create alerts that would require investigaion.",
