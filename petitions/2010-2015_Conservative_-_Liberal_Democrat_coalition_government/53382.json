        "additional_details": "Yet again a child suffers abominable treatment by his so called carers. Instead of loving and protecting him they carried out a wicked campaign of abuse which ultimately resulted in his death. Yet again we have another Serious Case Review which will once again look into what went wrong. BUT WILL IT? This little soul was completely ignored. A child that is scavenging for food with umpteen injuries is clearly on the radar. It is time that as a society we take a look at our moral compass. I request the Government set up a Public Enquiry to look at the wider problems that may exist in our system and society. It could look at how a child can disappear before our eyes and how professionals are easily duped by these wicked people. It can investigate why the general public bury their heads in the sand and ignore what is going on under their noses. This Serious Case Review will result in a local answer to what went wrong in this little boy\u2019s life. It will then be forgotten until THE NEXT TIME.",
