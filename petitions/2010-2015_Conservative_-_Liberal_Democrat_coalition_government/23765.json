        "additional_details": "Cap the UK CEO top level wages by removing the tax benefit after a certain level. In the US Charity CEO's are often paid over 1 million dollars a year often 2 or 3 million dollars.. Although you may well have to pay to get the best people it is when that pay becomes above the normal amount. In the the UK it has not reached those levels the most being around \u00a3269000. Altough you will need to pay a cetain amount to attract a calibre, the whole point of a charity is a degree of altruism. If the only reason the CEO was working there was because of the pay level they are there out of greed not out of any sense of charity. A cap of  around \u00a3150 000 would attract good quality people but because it is lower than business levels thye can say they out of a sense of charity not driven just by money.",
