        "additional_details": "Please ask UK Border Agency to return urgent documents back to the requester immediately. They should provide a guaranteed date before which UKBA will send the post.\r\n\r\nOn a humanitarian basis, UKBA should stop holding the documents for indefinite period after a request is made for return. Nobody will request documents back if it is not urgent. It will take 5 minutes effort for UKBA to send a post. But, it will be a life saver for the requester. Royal mail will deliver it within 2 working days.\r\n\r\nBackground: If an application sent to UKBA is withdrawn by the sender, there is no guaranteed timeline for the documents to be returned. After 20 working days, they will raise another request and no  updates for another 20 working days. This process will keep on going and can take indefinite time. UKBA will not tell us when the documents will be returned.\r\n\r\nA taxpayer does not have any rights to know when he will see his passport and critical documents back. But, UKBA has all the rights.",
