        "additional_details": "We believe that Parliament no longer serves the interests of the People of the UK. Enough is enough, while many face not being able to to feed, keep warm and house their families this year many MP's want a pay rise of over 30%! Those living on \u00a371 per week won't get a rise in line with inflation, in spite of soaring food and fuel prises, so how can we justify the expense of a parliament when the Queen, Prince Charles and the two Princes, along with the Civil Service, could run the Country? We ask that Parliament and the House of Lords be disbanded for a period of five years while the country recovers from this recession. During this period we ask that an academic study should be done as to a better and fairer system of government. The People of the UK should then be allowed to vote as to which of the new proposals they prefer in a referendum at the end of the proposed five year period.\r\n",
