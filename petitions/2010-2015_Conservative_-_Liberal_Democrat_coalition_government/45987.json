        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to seriously examine the benefits of applying rent caps on the rents that landlords can charge to tenants in their properties.  The news that some London Borough Councils are looking to relocate some people out of London is absolutely disgraceful in this day and age.  I completely agree that there has to be a limit to the amount of support that the taxpayer can supply to support people in housing, but there needs to be a balance.  I believe that the government has only looked at one side of the coin when they looked at the housing benefit cap, and have not examined why people are charged these rents in the first place.   Property speculation in the UK and the clamber to acquire property within the UK has created several house price bubbles which have tended to co-incide with a subsequent recession.  Housing is not just about markets, but about people, and also about value for money for the taxpayer.",
