The replacement of rotting, badly designed or poorly insulated windows one such action.\r\nThis is bad law because:\r\no\tMost people it applies to don\u2019t know about it and go ahead in good faith, unknowingly breaking this law;\r\no\tCouncils know there is a large amount of \u201cunauthorised development\u201d in this respect and act only when they receive a complaint;\r\no\tEnforcement is therefore capricious, so unfair;\r\no\tSo far as windows are concerned, these restrictions act directly against the current push to have homes as well insulated as possible to reduce energy bills and environmental impact.\r\n\r\nIt needs to be changed.\r\n",
