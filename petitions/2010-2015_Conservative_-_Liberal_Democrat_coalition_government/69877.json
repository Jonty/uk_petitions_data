Free full time child care should be offered to full time working parents / working single parents or to those parents looking to get back to work full time.\r\n\r\nThis will free money for better way of life as the current 15 hours free is just simply not enough.\r\n\r\nThis will encourage parents who wish to go back to work to be able to do so or allow currently full time working parents continue work if they so wish without the stress of more financial issues of childcare.",
