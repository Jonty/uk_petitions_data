        "additional_details": "Following the government's recent moves to put legislation in place to prevent smoking in cars where children are present, we would also like legislation be extended to include a ban on smoking in cars where animals are present.\r\n\r\nSmoking in the presence of animals can increase the chances of them developing serious health issues including various forms of cancer. Similarly to children they don't have a choice whether to inhale passive smoke.\r\n\r\nWe would like any fines/penalties for drivers smoking with children present to also be extended to cases where animals are occupants.
