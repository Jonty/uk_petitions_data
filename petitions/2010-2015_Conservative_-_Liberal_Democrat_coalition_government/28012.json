        "additional_details": "This petition calls for an outlaw on ticket touting for all cultural and sporting events.\r\n\r\nThis issue is a great source of anger and frustration for huge numbers of real fans and supporters who are prevented from attending events due to the profiteering of certain individuals and companies. These people purchase large numbers of tickets for events and resell them at prices that can be absurd. Within minutes of tickets going on sale, they can be found on the internet advertised and five or ten times their original price. This has to be prevented.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has already been outlawed for Football events, and there is no justifiable reason not to extend this legislation to cover all other events. It is grossly unfair, especially at a time of economic hardship, that real fans and supporters are prevented from going to concerts, festivals, matches etc, by the extortionate resale of tickets.",
