        "action": "petition to make paracetamol tablets prescription only",
        "additional_details": "This petition is to make the painkiller drug, paracetamol available on prescription only. Currently it is available as an over the counter medicine and is widely available. Thus, the dangers of the drug is easily overlooked. Just a slight increase in the dosage over a period of time can have adverse affects on the liver, which in turn can harm other vital organs. Another danger of the drug is to take it in combination with other medicines that already contain small amounts of paracetamol. The accumulative affect of paracetamol as a result of this can be fatal.\r\n\r\nShow you support in this campaign by signing up to this petition.",
