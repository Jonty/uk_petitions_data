        "additional_details": "Ignorance of the Law is not a defence in Law .\r\nWe should teach all the children of the state those laws the state says they all must follow as citizens .\r\nYet children , adults  need to know these laws in order to know NOT to breach them. As it stands there exists a systematic dumbing down of all children as evidenced by the continued lack of an education in state laws.\r\n\r\nExample - Children are criminally liable at age 12, yet what criminal laws have we taught them, that they, must not breach ?  NOTHING !! Ditto Human Rights Declarations.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition so we can teach all our children the laws they must not break, as a matter or normality.\r\n\r\nThis will also help create lawful communities and societies, as individuals are likely to have a better understanding and appreciation of the law, and so be more engaged to uphold it and interact in a more civilised manner.\r\n\r\nPlease help create a lawful society by signing this petition.\r\n\r\n",
