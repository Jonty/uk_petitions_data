        "additional_details": "This is to enforce the police and ambulance vehicles to use their sirens sensibly in the residential areas.\r\nThe unnecessary use of sirens during quiet morning hours or after 11 pm doesn\u2019t contribute to the general decline in trust and respect of the police forces and doesn\u2019t do much more than annoy people.\r\n\r\nLiving near Shepherds Bush roundabout area, for example, is like living at a warzone with sirens screaming mad every 10-20 minutes.  It appears they go to lunch with their sirens on.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to make them start considering the taxpayers well-being and use the sirens according to the regulations of use in the residential areas.\r\n",
