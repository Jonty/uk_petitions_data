So should stop living off the City's great name. Trafford is a metropolitan borough of Greater Manchester, including towns of Altrincham, Partington, Sale, Stretford, and Urmston. The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 as a merger of the municipal boroughs of Altrincham, Sale, and Stretford, the urban districts of Bowdon, Hale, and Urmston and part of Bucklow Rural District. Previously in Cheshire or Lancashire. The River Mersey flows through Trafford. Historically the Mersey also acted as the boundary between the historic counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.
