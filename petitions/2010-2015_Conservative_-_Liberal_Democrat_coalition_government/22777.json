        "additional_details": "A lot of eastern european children don't speak fluenent english and have it as a second language. Now this causes the problem of extra teaching assistents being brought into school to deal with this and it also takes up the teachers time when they should be dealing with the rest of the class.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that children who are aged 13 cannot learn english in space of such a sort time. it takes years of practise and you have to start teaching them to read from the very beginning. Whereas the ta's/teachers job should be to teach the subject at a substancial level.\r\n\r\nOverall something should be propersed to stop teaching resources being used up in this innapropiate way. It takes time, lots of effort and it ruins other peoples edecation aswell.",
