        "additional_details": "We the citizens resident in England and Wales while having no voice in the Scottish referendum (especially one where we do not know the terms we will be voting for) will still be affected by its outcome once the two parliaments have negotiated a separation agreement.  Because the outcome of these negotiations could have a serious and detrimental effect on every one of us, we insist on the right to a referendum to approve the terms of that agreement before it is finally decided. This is every bit as important to every one of us as a referendum on our position in Europe.",
