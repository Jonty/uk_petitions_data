        "additional_details": "In the event that Scotland votes for independence in 2014 the Scottish government has clearly signalled its intention to cherry pick what it wants from the Union. Meanwhile there is no English Parliament to negotiate terms on behalf of the English.. This petition therefore asks that the UK government now gives a firm public commitment  that independence negotiations will not be undertaken by any civil servant, MP., or Minister of Scottish parentage and that there will be:\r\n\r\nNo currency union or Scottish representation in the sterling central bank.\r\n\r\nNo subsidies of Scottish wind farms by taxpayers or consumers:\r\n\r\nNo further warship contracts for Scottish yards or forces left in Scotland:\r\n\r\nNo shared state broadcaster;\r\n\r\nNo shared embassies;\r\n\r\nNo shared Post Office (so no English subsidy for Scottish deliveries);\r\n\r\nNo open border or common travel area;\r\n\r\nNo dual nationality option;\r\n\r\nNo UK government employment or elected office for those opting for Scottish nationality .\r\n",
