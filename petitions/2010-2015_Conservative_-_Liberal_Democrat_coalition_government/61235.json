Atleast certain breeds. Unless you have a licence to be a breeder. This will prevent thousands of unwanted animal births and also decrease the amount of dangerous dogs being brought into the world as it is normally the result of poor breeding and ownership.\r\n\r\nKittens and Puppies should not be allowed to be sold in a pet shop or online as you can't see behind the scenes conditions that the animals come from.\r\n",
