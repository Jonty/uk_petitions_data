        "additional_details": "In the past years companies have tried to prevent piracy by employing these DRM software fixes.\r\n\r\nThe only people this actually effects are the people who legitimatly purchase software.\r\n\r\nNow companies are demanding that Single player \"offline\" games be required to log into a permanent \"online\" server. In effect forcing the legitimate buyer into a situation where they are unable to play their games if the servers are down or they have network failiure.\r\n\r\nRecent game releases (diablo 3 / sim city 2013) have been beset by failiures by companies at providing enough server facility to manage the number of sales.\r\n\r\nTherefore i think a games company which wants to force its user base down this line of activation should also provide an Offline alternative for when their servers fail or in the future possibly turned off.",
