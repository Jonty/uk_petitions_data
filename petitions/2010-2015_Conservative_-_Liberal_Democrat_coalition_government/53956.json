My bank sent me a new one with new digits.\r\n\r\nWithin days the credit check company sent me 2 mails saying that they were 'struggling to take payment\r\nfor your C.E Membership.'\r\n\r\nI did nothing as I didn't wanted their services anymore.\r\n\r\nA couple of days later I see that my bank account has been debited with the \u00a314.99 monthly fee.\r\n\r\nThey somehow managed to get my new card details, without letting me know ! HOW LEGAL IS THAT ??\r\n\r\nWhere did I agree to have my bank details passed from A to B ??\r\n\r\nI therefore ask this government to enforce new rules protecting the people against these companies intruding our bank accounts with complete impunity.\r\n\r\nThank you",
