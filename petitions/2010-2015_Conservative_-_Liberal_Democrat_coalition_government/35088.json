Why should Blood siblings be allowed to walk away with more than the childless spouse receives.\r\nA childless spouse should be seen as a key member of the family,not an interloper as this Law implies.\r\nSince 1990 there have been various proposals & each has had the same recommendations (word for word).\r\n.1. Where a person dies intestate survived by a spouse or civil partner but not by issue the spouse or civil partner should inherit the whole of the net intestate estate.\r\n(Draft Bill, section 2(2))\r\nWhy do the Government continually ignore our rights as a childless surviving spouse. It's not in keeping with the way we live our lives in the 21st Century and should be given the attention it & we deserve.as Tax Payers of this country. ",
