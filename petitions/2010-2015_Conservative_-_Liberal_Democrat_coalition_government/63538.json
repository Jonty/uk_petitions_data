Behaviour of the MP's at this time is very suspect and does look like corruption.\r\nIf this petition is passed I would hope that it would cause the government into reviewing Mrs Miller's expenses misconduct while keeping in mind that 100,000 members of the public would like to see her leave her position as MP and pay back \u00a345,000 from the profit she made on the second house she claimed expenses for against rule agreed by her when she became a MP.",
