Whatever sentence is given, holds - no 1/3 of the time if you behave yourself.  Prison means prison, not home from home.  A return to hard time, with a facility to educate and train in order to prepare that individual with skills to integrate back into society, but not a place where individuals, can just work-out and kick-back. Finally, a criminal who infringes on the human rights of others, automatically forfeits their own human rights (other than to expect not to be abused or mistreated during incarceration).\r\n",
