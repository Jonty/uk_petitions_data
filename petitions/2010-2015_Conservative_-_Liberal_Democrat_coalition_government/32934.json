        "additional_details": "The undersigned would like to see the urgent and compulsory installation of domestic and business water metering.\r\n\r\nThe current situation in which some households and businesses are allowed to waste unlimited drinking water while metred customers must make economies is unfair and is damaging to the environment.\r\n\r\nCompulsory metering would encourage rainwater harvesting and other water-saving measures. It would also highlight the environmental damage being caused by excessive water abstraction.",
