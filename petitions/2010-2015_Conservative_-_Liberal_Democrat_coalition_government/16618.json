As revealed in the article featured in 'The Register'\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/09/committee_cannot_debate_epetitions_without_more_time/\r\n\r\nAs part of 'The Big Society' I find it disgraceful the government asks for our opinion, says they will debate it if it meets criteria then refuses to even look it them when the criteria are hit.\r\n\r\nAs a result the two current largest e-petitions currently have no chance of being debated.\r\n\r\nThe Backbench Business Committee of MPs who is responsible for looking at these are so overstretched they have not had a chance to even discuses the issues raised.\r\n\r\nIf the government is serious about improving this country I suggest it urgently starts by showing it can organise it own initiative to a level where it at least works.",
