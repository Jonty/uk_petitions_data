These clouds often stretch the whole sky and remain there for hours, unlike condensation or contrails, which dissipate quickly as is usual for aircraft emmisions.\r\n\r\nThere are various patents (which could not be included due the terms and conditions) which show the clear intention of aircraft companies to spray the world's skies with harmful amounts of substances such as aluminium oxide for financial gain, under the guise of \"reducing global warming\".\r\n\r\nThis appears to be happening without the knowledge and approval of the general public, and without honestly tackling the source of the issue, which is the emmision of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.",
