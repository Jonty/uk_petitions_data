        "additional_details": "Currently some students still receive EMA but those who were receiving \u00a320 or \u00a310 a week were cut from this and not only that the students who were receiving \u00a330 a week still get it but reduced to \u00a320.\r\n\r\nBecause of this some of the students who were cut off EMA cannot afford to travel to college any more, pay for meals or equipment.\r\nWe need a system where college students have help (like student finance for university) in place to help those who are having to quit there college course or give up their education because of the cuts. Not even the ALG is in place anymore.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the government want you not to be able to afford education and be on benefits for the rest of your life, as of now many do not have the skills to get a job.",
