        "additional_details": "Recently the UK government abstained from the vote on the setting up of a Palestine state, and the appeasement of the brutal apartheid state of Israel.\r\nThis was despite the UK parliament urging support of recognition of Palestine as a free nation.\r\n\r\nMr Phillip Hammond was instrumental in this abstention, and as further retribution the Israeli state is now illegally witholding the taxes due to Palestinians to support schools, hospitals and infrastucture.\r\n\r\nIn our abstention we were in step with Rwanda and Nicaragua - such great company we keep now!\r\n\r\nThe appeasement of the clearly far right Israeli government and the further subjection of the Palestinains, is a blight upon the nation of the UK and its citizens.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the immediate sacking of Phillip Hammond as head of the foreign office. Please support this epetition so that the UK government can be held to account.",
