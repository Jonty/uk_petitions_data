        "additional_details": "The Church Housing Association in Gravesend, Elizabeth Huggins Trust along with the Ministry of Defence support are planning to demolish existing cottages that stand as a memorial to Captain Colyer-Fergusson VC of the Northamptonshire Regiment, killed in action in 1917.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to remove elderly residents, some of whom are approaching 90, demolish the cottages and build flats for ex-servicemen & families. Existing residents do not know where they are going and these proposals have induced stress, worry and anxiety on these residents, all of whom have medical and health conditions, some serious in nature.\r\n\r\nThey will be forced to move to flats, with the gardens they once enjoyed, gone! 11 out of 17 cannot negotiate stairs, yet their are only two bungalows on their return.\r\n\r\nThis is an abuse of residents, some of whom are widows of World War II veterans.\r\nThis wouldn't happen in Germany to veterans of the Third Reich, so it should not happen here. Please Sign The Petition.",
