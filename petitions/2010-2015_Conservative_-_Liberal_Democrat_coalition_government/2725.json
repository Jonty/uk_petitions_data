        "additional_details": "In the last two bad winters, many drivers in rural areas have relied on 4 wheel drive vehicles to get to work in the snow.  However, the perception of these vehicles as 'Chelsea tractors' has led to them being levied with punitive road taxes if registered after 2001.\r\n\r\nSince it is now getting very difficult to find a second hand 4 wheel drive which does not attract this high rate of tax I ask that the government reduces road tax for 4 wheel drive vehicles - either only for those in rural areas or for vehicles over 4 years old - otherwise many of us won't be able to afford to run a vehicle capable of getting us to work.",
