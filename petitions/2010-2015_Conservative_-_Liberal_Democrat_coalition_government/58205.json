        "additional_details": "The Government should re-trunk the portion of the A595 from Barrow-in-Furness to Sellafield and make it fit for the traffic it carries.\r\nCurrently there are sections through Askam in Furness, Kirkby in Furness and Grizebeck that are not wide enough for two cars to pass and have tight bends, yet is considered fit for HGVs!\r\nSerious consideration should be given to a bridge across the Duddon Estuary and help make the the area fit for the farming and tourist industry it supports. It would also give safe and speedier access to and from the Nuclear facility at Sellafield.\r\nEven with the bridge, the original road will need upgrading just to serve the local community, especially with ambulance and other emergency vehicles. Any incident on the road can close it for extended periods of time, sometime up to a week!\r\nThe community should not have to endure this and deserves better.\r\nCumbria County Council has done nothing, have failed to plan to do anything, the Government must do something!",
