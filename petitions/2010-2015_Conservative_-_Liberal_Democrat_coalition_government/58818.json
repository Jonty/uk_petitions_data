        "additional_details": "Our childrens education is paramount for the future of our country. Part of their education is to experience other cultures and to learn new skills during their half term holidays. Yet holiday companies continue to inflate prices during these times without justification, as the demand is still there....the kids are still on holiday and us parents still want to take our kids on holiday. So it is blatant market abuse.\r\n\r\nYet, if we decide to take our kids out of school during term time, we will be fined.\r\n\r\nThe government should find a way to stop the blatant market abuse of holiday companies and give families (us the tax payer) the opportunity to expand their childrens horizons rather than just rely on reading about other cultures/experiences from books, the internet and third hand experiences.",
