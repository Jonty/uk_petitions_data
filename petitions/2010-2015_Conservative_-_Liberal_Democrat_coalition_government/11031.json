If people choose to live in this country they must abide by the laws of the land.\r\nDeporting all foreign criminals will provide space in our prisons for UK nationals, thus eliminating the need to free prisoners early. If we have proportionate punishment for crimes it might actually act as a deterrant and therefore reduce crime rates.",
