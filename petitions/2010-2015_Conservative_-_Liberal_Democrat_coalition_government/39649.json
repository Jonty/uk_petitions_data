        "additional_details": "Every skilled profession in the UK must be backed by formal qualifications to show that the person proclaiming to be skilled has undertaken an education in that subject eg. Bricklaying, plumbing, osteopathy, bus driver, and the list goes on and on. But we allow people with no formal education in the subject of tattooing to mark a persons body for life. There should be a formal qualification for tattooists. So they can prove they can draw to a very high standard, how to correctly operate a tattoo gun, know hygene, disposal of human waste, sterilisation of equipment etc...no licence no tattooing! This will help irridicate those people who incompetent and should never pick up a tattoo gun!",
