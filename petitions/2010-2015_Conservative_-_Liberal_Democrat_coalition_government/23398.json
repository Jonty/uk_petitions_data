        "additional_details": "To reinstate St Edmund a venerable Anglo-Saxon king who represents and extols everything positive about England and the English people as Englands patron saint.\r\n\r\nHe stood up for his people, his realm and his faith against invasion, intimidation and tyranny and was martyred for his couragious and laudable actions.\r\n\r\nHe is venerated in all the major Christian denominations and would not only be respected by all faiths as a symbol of courage and personal sacrifice but as a steadfast struggle for freedom, fairness and fraternity.\r\n\r\nSaint Edmund was not only born in England, he fought and died in England for his beliefs and would be an exemplary example for our nation but also a fitting tribute for our original saint who was unfairly displaced and redress that grave injustice.\r\n\r\nFor Saint Edmund I do proudly say, The 20th November should be our national day!\r\n\r\nThankyou",
