Why can't we have a regualted system of high quality products, reducing the prison population and creating a huge revenue for the country and jobs. Why are people who take drugs criminals, but only certain drugs as you can get the same effects with any legal stuff yet the side effects are much more dangerous and untested leaving medical staff unsure on how to best treat you. Why was professor David Nutt sacked for his findings which the government requested and paid for, when they were highly accurate and he could prove.",
