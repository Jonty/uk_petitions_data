        "additional_details": "Following changes in 2012 universities in England can now charge up to \u00a39,000 a year for undergraduate courses; almost triple the previous amount of \u00a33,375 in 2011/12. The cost of university residence alone is on average between \u00a32,000- \u00a38,750. So, the question is: is that degree really worth the thousands of pounds of debt? In 2014 there was a 17% decrease in the number of undergraduates at UK universities, so clearly the answer to this question for many is no. Some countries (Germany) have already scrapped university fees \u2013 so why cant't we?This is an urgent call for action. We are calling for university fees to be scrapped \u2013 or at least lowered from \u00a39,000 to a maximum of \u00a34,500 and for more financial aid e.g. loans with lower interest rates & longer repayment times to be given to all British citizens studying at universities in England. We need your help so please sign and join our cause.",
