        "additional_details": "Too many young people carry knives as a form of protection, but they are more likely to get injured with their own weapon. Some young people carry weapons to impress their friends or because of peer-pressure and they dont realise the death threatening situation that they might get themselves into. Young people need to overcome the stereotype that they fall under, they need to prove people wrong instead of conforming. Young people need role models to look up that they can releate to instead through organised talks and workshops. Together we can abolish knife crime. ",
