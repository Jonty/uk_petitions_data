        "additional_details": "Spending money on so-called 'defence' leads to death and violence and is often counter-productive. The best way to protect Britain is to enhance its image in the world as a peaceful, tolerant place, while remaining vigilant against threats through the police and security services. Spending more money on education greatly benefits the economy and gives people from all backgrounds better chances in life. We call upon the government to spend more money on education for all and less on 'defence'.",
