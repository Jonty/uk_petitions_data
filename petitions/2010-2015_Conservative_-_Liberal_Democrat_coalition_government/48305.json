        "additional_details": "I am fighting to try and save Burnhope First Class Childcare, the only Childcare facility within the village of Burnhope which has been threatened with closure due to Government funding cuts. Burnhope has an almost non existent transport network (one bus per hour) making moving our children particularly hard. Our village has very little so to take this facility away from a growing population is ludicrous.  Not only will this closure affect our community but it will also result in further unemployment in the local area.The government should be supporting local services and facilities where there is nothing, not take them away.\r\nThe action I would like the government to take is re-instate government sustainability funding fully to allow this setting to carry on enabling our children and future generations to be looked after and schooled in OUR village, not someone elses.",
