        "additional_details": "Most University students get a maintenance grant - which does not need to be paid back. However, if a student does not apply for a maintenance loan - due to the reasons that a bigger debt will be created, the maintenance grant on it's own is simply not enough for those living away from home, and those who need to pay expensive costs to get to University via public transport.\r\n\r\nUniversities do not offer any kind of equipment which will allow students to work with - for example, a student studying Design are likely to need high costing software to complete their work. The maintenance grant is not enough to cover this cost.\r\n\r\nAlthough a maintenance loan may be the answer, this will get the student in even more debt which is obviously not a good thing. University students need free equipment such as software, computers, stationary etc to be able to successfully pass their course. ",
