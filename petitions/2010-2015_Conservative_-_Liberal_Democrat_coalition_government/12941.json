Registered disabled individuals would clearly be exempt from such a policy.\r\nSuch a policy should encourage our youngsters to actively seek gainful paid or community based employment in their most informative and productive years and contribute to society.\r\nSuch a policy should reduce the reliance upon the welfare state and install core \"work\" values at an early stage of adult-hood.\r\nThis policy should also reduce the public tax / payment burden and reduce the increase in unmarried mothers / fatherless families at such young ages.",
