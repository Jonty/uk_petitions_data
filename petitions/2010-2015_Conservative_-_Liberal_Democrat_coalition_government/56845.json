As Marine Sgt A had been doing for the duration of his tour until his terrible lapse of decency.\r\nLives had already been traded by that incident. He has voiced his remorse.\r\n\r\nFor what he was prepared to give up for his country can we at least show  some heart by extending clemency if there is any avenue by which it can be considered?\r\n\r\n",
