This can be a problem for people of the original culture who are \"stuck\" living in an area surrounded people they may have little in common with. It should not be offensive to any ethnic groups to consider cultural changes as part of town planning, so that the needs of everyone can be met effectively whilst minimising conflict and cultural isolation.
