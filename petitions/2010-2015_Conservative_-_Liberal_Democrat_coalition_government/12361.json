(ie: File the paper-work and stay in your country until you get permission)\r\n\r\n2) Asylum seekers should not have access to UK tax money for legal costs, or any legal claims made agenst the UK. (ie: if they want to come here, they pay for it)\r\n\r\n3) Understanding that some JOB roles in the UK do have a shortage of UK based persons(IE: a specialist role), a quick-process should be in place to help.\r\n",
