        "additional_details": "I agree that absent parents must pay child support. However, if their wages are so low that the government agrees that they do not have enough to live on; and offers tax credit assistance. How is it just to take this assistance into consideration. If the absent parent is on other benefits such as income support, tax credits are not taken into consideration, in fact a \u00a35 limit on child support is in place. Why are working parents treated unfairly? Working or not, the calculations should be done in the same way and families should be left with enough money to survive.",
