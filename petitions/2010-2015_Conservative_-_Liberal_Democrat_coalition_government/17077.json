        "additional_details": "I would like the government to add legislation banning companies that call themselves 'homesurvey' from repeatedly phoning to find out information e.g. gas/electricity supplier. They have phoned our home phone many, many times despite me asking for them to stop calling and despite asking for them to remover our details in accordance with the data protection act. We are registered with the TPS and I understand this issue affects many other people. They are often rude and unpleasent to talk to.",
