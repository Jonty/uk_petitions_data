Shareholders of Northern Rock and Taxpayers have lost out.\r\nWhy should Branson not be forced to give every person in the UK a shareholding of Northern Rock on potential future flotation, so that all people in the UK can share in the potential upside of the good bit of the Bank.\r\nGordon Brown sold UK Gold Holdings at the Bottom of market Now Osborne seems intend on selling Banks on the cheap at Bottom Market.\r\nI call on the Chancellor to strike a much better deal for all people in the UK ",
