        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that a state funeral for Baroness Margaret Thatcher would be inappropriate given her stated ideological objections, whilst Prime Minister of Great Britain and since, to the involvement in the personal affairs of individuals. Her political project, whilst Prime Minister, was to privatise as much of the British state as possible.  Baroness Thatcher's funeral is a private affair and should be paid for privately.\r\n    We also believe that as state funerals in Great Britain are usually reserved for heads of state, this necessarily excludes former Prime Ministers like Baroness Thatcher.\r\n   Therefore, we call on you to reconsider plans to accord Baroness Thatcher the privilege of a state funeral.\r\n\r\n",
