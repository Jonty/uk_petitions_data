        "additional_details": "There should be a hotline dedicated to report illegal suspected illegal migrants (like encountered in streets, parks, betting shops, massage parlours, farms, factory, takeaways, corner shops, college, etc) to the border agency officers and police. Such tipoffs should be given enough resources to be taken seriously. It is has been estimated that around 3% of all failed asylum seekers were removed, according to Channel 5 news. Her Majesty\u2019s Government should leave no stone unturned in tracing, giving adequate surveillance and deporting all illegal immigrants, failed asylum seekers and those with invalid or expired work permits. Immigration begets more immigration. Immigrant bosses tend to employ migrant workers (with or without work permits) from the country they originally came from; as it may suit the bosses in cultural or familial terms and having to pay less wages.",
