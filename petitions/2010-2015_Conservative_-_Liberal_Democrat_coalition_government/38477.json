This is all our planet earth we all live here, it is all our home. I do feel we need army's but why can we not be as one. Why argue? Why can't we share all are resources between countries and all work together? Why so much conflict !! Can we not fix it before its too late ? Genuinely. If we get an attack tomorrow, our army defence isn't here? Theyre fighting in another country. So it then relies on us to pick up the pieces. Instead of going into everybody else's country and stayed at the border to protect the country rather than invade another. Maybe if we protected our country and others did then we would have a right to fight but untill then let's not stick our nose in every other countries problems",
