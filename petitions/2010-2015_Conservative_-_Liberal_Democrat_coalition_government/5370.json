To see a car chasing you that may have lights inside and anybody can do that, it is not illegal, it can be extremely disturbing and dangerous through communities, it must be that in any so called chase circumstance the vehicle must be well marked.\r\n For any unmarked police car to do 80MPH thru a 30 MPH limit is frankly extremely dangerous, it is bad enough for a marked vehicle.",
