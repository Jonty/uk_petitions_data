Compulsory learning of Welsh in English medium schools is unnecessary and diverts resources from more deserving subjects.  The separation of education into Welsh and English is tantamount to apartheid with the minority Welsh medium schools receiving higher staff to pupil ratios and dispensation given during assessment. Stop this wasteful and divisive policy.  ",
