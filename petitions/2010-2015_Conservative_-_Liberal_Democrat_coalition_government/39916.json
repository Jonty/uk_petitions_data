We, as parents, no longer feel our children are safe in their own communities. Known paedophiles and sex offenders, deemed a danger to the public,  should be tagged when re-entering a community so their whereabouts are always known. Re-offenders should be chemically castrated since it is a well known fact there is no cure for this disease apart from this. It is time the government acted, our children have the 'human right' to be safe whilst playing outside!",
