This works out at \u00a31.86 per hour.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the number of hours required to fulfil the work experience be reduced so that it is relative to the national minimum wage, for example for 18-20 year olds the minimum wage is \u00a34.98 so that the number of hours would be 11 hours.
