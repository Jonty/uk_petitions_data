In the past three years using the data from independent monitors who looked at the accounts of A4E nearly 40% of the invoices total were suspect in that it wasn\u2019t clear cut whether the claimant had found work or had been placed into reskill or retraining program.\r\nThe contract with the DWP is worth \u00a3186 Million a year; so as a rough estimate \u00a3216 Million has been overpaid over three years as the contract was never properly fulfilled. Independent monitors stated that at the very least 20% of the placements they investigated and invoiced for by A4E were suspicious and probably fraudulent involving a staggering\u00a3 108Million pounds.\r\n Ex- employees including a senior auditor revealed that it was routine practise to falsify documents and submit invoices for payment knowing that they were not entitled to them.\r\n",
