The Watchdog should refer Judges with a poor record and or a disproportionate level of complaints against them to the Home Secretary for disciplinary action, or dismissal.  The victim of a crime should have the right of appeal against the sentance given to the perpetrator. The watchdog should have the ability to instruct the Judge to review the sentance.",
