        "additional_details": "For the past thousands of years a Gravestone has been placed each time a person dies to remember their lives and the person themselves. I propose that instead of placing a Gravestone we plant a tree instead.\r\n\r\nThey're are many advantages to planting trees instead of placing a Gravestone. It would help the environment as well as allowing us to commemorate old life with new. In addition a forest of trees would be a much more beautiful sight, bringing with it a sense of peace.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to allow the plating of a tree on top of a Grave instead of requiring a Gravestone to be placed in a cemetery. Or to create consecrated ground in which allows this to happen.",
