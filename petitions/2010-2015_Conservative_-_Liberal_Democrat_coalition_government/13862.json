        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, are of the opinion that the plans for the High Speed 2 rail network are flawed and should be replaced by a new \"Supertrain\" system.\r\n\r\nThe current plans involve building a standard-gauge link initially between London and Birmingham using trains which would be expected to run at a maximum of 225mph. These would be - by and large - ordinary express trains.\r\n\r\nHowever, we propose that HS2 is replaced by broad-gauge track and a single two-storey atom-powered steam turbine \"Supertrain\". This which travel at an average speed of around 78mph and provide luxurious travel along the lines of a cruise ship. Features would include luxury cabins, dining car, hair salon, parlour bar, disco, swimming pool and gift shop.\r\n\r\nThe United States have had the luxury of Supertrain since 1979 (36 hours from New York to Los Angeles) and we feel it is time the UK embraced a new standard of travel.",
