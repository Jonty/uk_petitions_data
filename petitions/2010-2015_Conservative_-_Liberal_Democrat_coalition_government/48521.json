        "additional_details": "I've found myself sitting for at least 5-10 minutes at various traffic lights. My motorcycle just doesn't produce enough magnetic energy to trigger the signals.\r\n\r\nThis law would allow motorcyclists to cross red lights  in all areas of the UK once a traffic light cycle has been completed without changing, and if no other traffic is present on the motorcyclists side. This will be done without fear of getting a fine and/or points on a licence.\r\n\r\nAlso, when a junction is blocked with heavy traffic from another direction during rush hour periods, the lights turn green and traffic on the motorcyclists side cannot move.\r\n\r\nIt would allow motorcyclists to pass the red and turn left to filter through the flow of vehicles, if the rider needs to go straight or right they will stay put at the red light. This includes blocked roundabouts.\r\n\r\nThe city of New York has a similar law with turning right, and it works well.\r\n",
