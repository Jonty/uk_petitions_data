        "additional_details": "Passport fees are too high and a burden on ordinary people. Children used to be put on parents passports but now must have their own passport.\r\n\r\nThe fees charged are now very high and are particularly expensive for families.\r\n\r\nI propose a fee of \u00a310 per adult passport (the fee fixed for 10 years) and child passports to be issued free until the age of 16.\r\n\r\nGovernment has stated this increased cost is because of the increased security costs involved. Who cares? It is a tool for me to use to take my family on holiday and should be cheaply priced. We pay taxes to cover costs of things like this, so the renewal costs should be token.",
