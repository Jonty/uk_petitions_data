        "additional_details": "It seems like torture that after finishing exams GCSE students and A level students have to wait at least two months to receive exam results they have worked years to obtain. It seems as if the time given is excessive, it causes stress and also ruins in part the point of the summer holiday, a break. Also with A levels determining a apprenticeship, university place etc. it seems, as i said before torture that a student should have to wait so long to know what will become of their future, after already doing the hard part in studying and taking these exams. In particular it does not give a huge amount of time for students to react to results they have received, and decide where there future lies. Therefore i request that this system be reformed, in anyway possible that will end the time between students completing exams and students receiving there results.",
