        "additional_details": "There is no place in a civilised world for capital punishment. The UK proudly occupies moral high ground that displays ethical courage far exceeding that of many other countries - including some whom we count as friends and allies.\r\n\r\nThe taking of life does not restore life already taken. Countries that retain a death penalty and a high incidence of violent crime, such as the USA, do not stand as evidence of deterrent.\r\n\r\nThe death of a single innocent person is too high a risk to take and too high a price to pay for the savage luxury of vengeance.\r\n\r\nPremeditated killing by individual or state should never be legitimised in law.\r\n\r\nGovernment must not allow rabid, reactionary, populist ravings by tabloid readers who cannot tell the difference between a paediatrician and a paedophile to threaten proper, civilised, democratic process.
