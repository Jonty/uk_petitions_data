It does not appear to have a function in today's society, rather a nostalgic memory for the older generations who remember Imperialism during its last days. This petition calls upon the Government to introduce legislation to wind-up the institution of the British Commonwealth, and for the Sovereign to publicly apologise to the people of the former colonies, protectorates, protected states, dependencies, Dominions etc, for the injustices suffered as a result.
