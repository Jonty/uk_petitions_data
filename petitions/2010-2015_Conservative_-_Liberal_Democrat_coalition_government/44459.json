        "additional_details": "We believe the proposals the government announced in January 2013 to merge the basic state pension and the state second pension into a single state pension for all new retirees from April 2017 is unfair.\r\n\r\nAbolishing the right of employers to opt out of the state second pension and to invest the savings into a scheme which is best suited to the needs of their workforce is a massive transfer of responsibility from the individual to the state.\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that there has been a reduction in the number of pension schemes opting out in recent years, but abolishing this right will not allow people to benefit from future rises in the value of the stock market.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to think again.
