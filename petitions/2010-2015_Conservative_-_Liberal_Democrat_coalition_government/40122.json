It's about time our government stop dishing out sentences for online \"trolls\" and start concentrating on crimes like rape and murder. The average sentence for rape is around 5-8 years, this is disgusting! Our justice system is a joke. Online trolls can be blocked and removed there is no need for jail, if someone is effected by these trolls there is plenty of report abuse buttons. Also, someone can simply turn OFF their computer! Let us as a nation focus on real crimes! ",
