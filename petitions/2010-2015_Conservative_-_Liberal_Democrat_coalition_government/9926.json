        "additional_details": "I propose the immediate abolition of Inheritance Tax for all UK citizens.  We pay enough taxes already every time we move money from one place to another or buy anything so I don't see any justification for why HM Revenue and Customs should be automatic beneficiaries at death.  This is legalised theft at the most distressing time for any family and I believe that after a lifetime of contributing money towards taxes a person should be allowed to pass on their estate for free.\r\n",
