Their engines of typically up to only 5-600cc are modern efficient units.\r\n\r\nEven just the fact that they give roughly 70mpg for petrol and 90+mpg for diesel types means way lower pollution than the standard band they are lumped into.\r\n\r\nThat \"catch all\" band is itself too coarse because it is for everything up to three times their typical cc. There should at least be a new \"catch all\" band for - say sub 750cc vehicles.",
