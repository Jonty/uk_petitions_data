        "additional_details": "The DfT should retract its plans for the HS2 rail line as it will be a catastrophic waste of money and resources that could be better spent in other government departments or on the roads themselves. This is failing to take into account the numerous people and properties that will be affected by such a mammoth engineering project.\r\n\r\nIn this we should be looking to spend the \u00a333bn on road infrastructure and layout, this could include the removal of bus lanes the simplification of road layout to benefit road users of all types.\r\n\r\nThere is no hiding that there are more road users than ever and the number is still increasing. This is not a bad thing however if roads are re-imagined to be more efficient and more durable to reduce the need for repairs and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading",
