Any turnout that does not meet the required minimum gives up that seat and therefore reduces the cost of Government. To protect this, the voting process must be mandatory, ensuring a high voting turnout.\r\n\r\n50% is the minimum votes required to take a seat at Westminster. Any less than that, the voters have declared that constituency seat surplus.",
