        "additional_details": "Local communities are suffering from local radio stations being taken over by large broadcasting companies such as Heart & Capital. Local radio was  successful in informing communities with local news and brought specialised music such as country & jazz. There are numerous community stations doing that job at present with hundreds of volunteers but restricted to low power transmission by OFCOM. To survive these stations must be given power to get out to the larger community. Radio stations such as Heart & Capital who have gone national by the back door should be given a national FM waveband to free up the airwaves for the reintroduction of truly local radio. ",
