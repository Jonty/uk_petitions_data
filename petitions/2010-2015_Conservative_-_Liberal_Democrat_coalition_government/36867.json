It's not just about school sport. Many of GB\u2019s Olympic wins have come from sports like cycling, rowing, tennis & sailing.\r\nThe chance for kids who show passion & talent for a sport to become Olympic heroes of the future should not be affected by whether their families can afford to pay expensive club fees.\r\nFirst News is calling for free membership for all Under 16s at a sports centre of their choice.",
