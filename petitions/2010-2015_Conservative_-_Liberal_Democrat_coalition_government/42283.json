        "additional_details": "We need >100k signatures and we all want the same result - the government to stop the trials affecting our area, be it Barnes, Windlesham, East London, South London etc.\r\n\r\nIf you have noticed an increase of planes and frequency over the past year, it's likely that you are affected by the trials, e.g. by planes not having to follow the regular NPRs (i.e. \"flight path\" to you and me), or the suspension of runway alternation.\r\n\r\nSo when Heathrow noise complaints say \"there is no increase in planes\" and \"flight paths haven't changed\", although technically true, it is (deliberately?) misleading the general public.\r\n\r\nSee figure 14 and 15 in http://www.heathrowoperationaldata.com/images/pdfreports/Operational%20freedoms%20August%20monthly%20report.pdf\r\n\r\nand compare with e.g. 2008 (before trials) http://www.heathrowairport.com/noise/noise-in-your-area/aircraft-tracking-maps\r\n\r\n",
