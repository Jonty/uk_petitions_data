It is time for foreign governments to step up and look after their people.  It is time for the UK people who feel enough is enough our Government is NOT listening  when it comes to this issue.  Our young people need jobs and housing NOW before we start losing them to countries with better economies.     Our government should not be borrowing, they need to start repaying the countries debts.
