However the discounts do not cover travel to airports such as gatwick.\r\n\r\nNo explaination is given on line for this exception. Many elderly travel abroad and the cost of actually getting to the airport heavily increases the overall costs of the holiday expense.\r\n\r\nAn end is needed to the continual exemption culture that penalises the ageing process in society and fails to honour their contribution by providing token allowances.\r\n  ",
