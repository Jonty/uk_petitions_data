        "additional_details": "We the undersigned demand the withdrawal of any apology on behalf of the British people for the slave trade as we deny responsibility for it.\r\nThis is due to the fact that although we regret the existence of this trade, it is historically documented which companies, families and individuals profited out of this trade and still live comfortably on the proceeds today.\r\nTo date, no apology has been offered from these persons involved and their descendents and so we demand that these people are obliged to apologise on their own behalf for the behaviour of their predecessors and that any reparation monies should be paid by them and not the British taxpayer.",
