        "additional_details": "People that receive EMA should receive the same amount of funding as people on job seekers allowance.It is very tempting to drop out of college when your friend is on a decent wage in a full time job and your receiving \u00a330 a week . Those on jobseekers allowance that are not getting out there and actually searching for jobs are earning around \u00a3100 every two weeks ( I recieve \u00a360 every 2 weeks). It's us young people who need to buy our own equipment and travel fares.  I believe that by increasing the amount of EMA there will be more young people wanting to better themselves which in the long term will provide a better economy.",
