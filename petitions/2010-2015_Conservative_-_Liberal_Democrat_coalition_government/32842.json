Breeding designer dogs that are not physiologically viable & cause sufferings in dogs (e.g. when they breathe, move, eat, etc) should be regulated & banned. New appearance (like shorter legs, flatter face) perceived as the new desirable characteristics but not conform to ancestral characteristics of pure breed pedigree dogs are sometimes specially bred for dog shows & ownership. However selective breeding, GM & cloning of pets & livestock do sometimes confer desirable characteristics. Selective breeding of new pets from wild cats can be useful in developing desirable viable characteristics, like longer & stronger limbs, subtle colourful fur. GM livestock producing useful metabolites in milk, bacteria, etc (like pharmaceuticals, hormones, strong fibres, biofuels), high meat content, hardy in certain niche, resistant to certain diseases can also be useful.",
