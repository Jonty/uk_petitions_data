This is actually worse than a middle lane 'hogger' travelling at 70mph - which carries a 3 point penalty. HGV's should be disallowed from performing these slow manoeuvres at peak times.\r\n\r\nTV advertisements to educate people on the proper way to drive on a motorway should be publicly funded as well, as there are too many people that simply don't know the rules of the motorway",
