        "additional_details": "Guinea pigs - we all know them as the perfect childrens starter pet. But what most people don't know, is that the breeding of guinea pigs can result in their death. 20% (1 in 5) sows die giving birth, and sometimes their pups do too.\r\nThere are hundreds of unwanted guinea pigs in rescue centres across the country, desperate for homes, and sadly, thanks to household breeding, they often don't get one.\r\nOne gene (roan allele) can even produce 'lethal' pups, baby guinea pigs that will likely not make it even a few months, are usually blind and/or deaf, and have deformed molars, making them unable to eat.\r\nHousehold breeders are ignorant to these facts and continue to condemn multiple sows to death, and hundreds of rescue centre pigs to a life without a home.\r\nThis petition is aiming to make the household breeding of guinea pigs illegal, punishable by a fine",
