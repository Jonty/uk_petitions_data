By comparison in Victorian times it was as low as 6%.\r\n\r\nSuch spending is out of control because there is nobody in power with the incentive to stop taxing us that we, the taxpayers, have.\r\n\r\nParliament should debate whether the people have a right to set a limit.\r\n\r\nWe propose a mandatory, multi-option referendum to set the maximum propotion\r\n\r\nIf government spending is above the legal limit no new spending Bill or Cabinet instruction to increase spending would have any legal validity and the UK Supreme Court have the right to order specific cuts until spending is legalised.\r\n\r\nThere should be further referendums not more often than every 2nd year nor less often than at each General Election with the same spread offered of from 5% above to 5% below the then current limit.
