        "additional_details": "False accusations of sexual offences completely destroy the life of the victim of the accusation (i.e. \"the accused\"). Their marriage, home, career is destroyed, they lose all access to their children, or their children are irreversiblty taken away from them into care. People have committed suicide even after acquittal because of the life-long effects of what the ordeal has done to them.\r\n\r\nAnyone found beyond all doubt, with absolutely irrefutable evidence, of having invented such an accusation, should face a long prison sentence for the lives that they have destroyed. Any second offence of a false accusation should be punished with life imprisonment. This should ONLY apply where the evidence is absolutely irrefutable, NOT in cases where the alleged offence simply cannot be proven.",
