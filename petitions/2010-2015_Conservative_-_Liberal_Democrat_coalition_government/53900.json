        "additional_details": "We believe that the regulation for the supply of glasses for children should be amended so that all children receive the same level of financial help regardless of how they access the NHS service.\r\n\r\nChildren can obtain glasses either from a voucher issued from a Hospital (HES) or from an Optician (GOS)\r\n\r\nAn inequality exists with an NHS \u201cspecial facial characteristics\u201d voucher. This is when a basic spectacle frame will not fit correctly and a specially-made frame is required. There is financial help available within HES but not from GOS.\r\n\r\nThis means that patients with the same clinical need receive a different level of service.\r\n\r\nGOS regulation should be amended to correct this inequality.\r\n\r\nExamples of when this voucher is issued may include:\r\n\r\nChildren with Down\u2019s syndrome\r\n(The facial features of a small, flat nose mean that standard glasses tend to slide down constantly. Specialist frames can mean a better fit, fewer repairs and better quality of vision.)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
