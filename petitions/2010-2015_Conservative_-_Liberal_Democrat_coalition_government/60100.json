        "additional_details": " Since we joined the EEC in 1973, we have been in surplus with every continent in the world except Europe. Over those 27 years, we have run a trade deficit with the other member states that averages out at \u00a330 million per day.\r\n\r\n2. In 2010 our gross contribution to the EU budget will be \u00a314 billion. To put this figure in context, all the reductions announced by George Osborne at the Conservative Party Conference would, collectively, save \u00a37 billion a year across the whole of government spending.\r\n\r\n3. On the European Commission\u2019s own figures, the annual costs of EU regulation outweigh the advantages of the single market by \u20ac600 to \u20ac180 billion.\r\n\r\n4. The Common Agricultural Policy costs every family \u00a31200 a year in higher food bills.\r\n\r\n5. Outside the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain could reassert control over its waters out to 200 miles or the median line, which would take in around 65 per cent of North Sea stocks.\r\n\r\n",
