There are several benefits which include -\r\n1) Instill young people with a sense of service, social responsibility and increase their self esteem by teaching them respect for others, self-reliance, team-work and other 'life' skills.\r\n2) Provide additional man-power to meet the UK's military and peace-keeping commitments across the globe.\r\n3) Provide a tangible benefit to the UK economy - we will be improving the quality of the labour pool.\r\n",
