        "additional_details": "Narcolepsy and Cataplexy needs to be recognised as a disability, so that employers can stop discriminating and give people with these conditions a fair chance in the work place. Narcolepsy is a relatively rare sleep disorder and it a disease that affects less than 5 per 10,000 people within a community. It affects the brains' ability to regulate the normal sleep-wake cycle. This leads to disturbed night-time sleep and excessive sleepiness throughout the day. This can bring on Cataplexy which is the most specific symptom in narcolepsy patients. Cataplexy attacks involves temporary involuntary muscle weakness.  This is in response to emotions or the anticipation of emotion.The severity of a cataplexy attack can vary from mild facial weakness to the buckling of the knees and collapse whilst still remaining conscious. Cataplexy attacks can last for seconds or up to two minutes and can occur repeatedly for up to 20 - 60 minutes. ",
