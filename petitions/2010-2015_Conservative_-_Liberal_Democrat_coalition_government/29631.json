        "additional_details": "Utilising replacement stem cells are likely to be more cost effective and produce a better quality of life for patients than treatment utilising non-stem cell techniques, as it is much more likely to affect a complete cure without immune rejection problems. In the UK, diabetes affects around 2.3 million people and treatments with medication, insulin injections as well as treating the complications of high blood sugar (like retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) can costs the NHS several \u00a3bns every year. Insulin producing beta cells of Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas can be destroyed by auto immune diseases, alcohol, genetic effects, etc. Diabetes is a common side effect of chronic pancreatitis, which is overwhelmingly caused by heavy drinking.",
