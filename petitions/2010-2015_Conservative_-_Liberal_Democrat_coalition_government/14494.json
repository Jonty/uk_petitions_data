        "additional_details": "The Yasuni National Park in Ecuador is arguably the most important nature reserve in the world.  A massive oil field has been discovered underneath the park and plans have been drawn up to begin drilling.\r\nThe government of Ecuador have offered to forego the revenue expected from the oil fields if the International Community compensate them half of the money over the next ten years.   This money would then be put into a trust to fund environmental and social development programs in Ecuador.  If an initial payment of $100 million is not received by December, a license will be granted to begin drilling within months.  Britain has refused to pledge any money whatsoever.\r\nWe urge the UK government to discuss a plan with the Government of Ecuador and the International Community to prevent this catastrophe from occurring, and to contribute a share to preserving this place for future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
