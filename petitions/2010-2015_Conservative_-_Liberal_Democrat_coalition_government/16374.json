        "additional_details": "My proposal is to break up Knowsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and share it with surrounding councils. This in my view would save government money, and area's such as Prescot, Whiston, Halewood, Cronton and parts of Huyton, would not go ignored, like they are by the current council.\r\n\r\nPrescot, Whiston and Cronton would join St Helens.\r\n\r\nKirkby and Knowsley Village would join Sefton.\r\n\r\nHuyton, Tarbock, Page Moss, Stockbridge and Halewood would join Liverpool.\r\n\r\nIf you think this would work, as I do, please sign the petition.",
