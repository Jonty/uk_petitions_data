        "additional_details": "We are aiming for the eventual legalisation of cannabis through public vote, also of how it should be taxed/regulated.\r\n\r\nThe government should investigate the drug through medical analysis of the proposed \"risk\" but also its benefits on the user. This should be done by numerous independent medical professionals to remove the myths of the harm cannabis does.\r\n\r\nWe, the general public and our goverment would benefit from the legalisation of cannabis. As done in America, and elsewhere around the world, the legalisation of cannabis has helped overall statistics of crime reductions, drug usage, etc. The public should have the right to a general vote on legalisation then the same for how it would be regulated and taxed.",
