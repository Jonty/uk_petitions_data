We seek urgent answers as to why HMRC were not paid tax from employee wages and also if the takeover in May 2011 was legal and if there is any evidence of criminal activity.  This is more than a football club, it is a British institution and a way of life for thousands of people and we want clarity and answers before our club is liquidated.",
