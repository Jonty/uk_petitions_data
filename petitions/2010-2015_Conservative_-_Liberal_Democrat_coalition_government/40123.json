We feel cats should be included thus meaning cat owners can be held responcible for their pets actions.\r\n\r\nWe do not believe the law of nuicance where there has to be \"material\" discomfort or annoyance to people is enough to deter owners from letting their cats cause problems throughout neighbourhoods.\r\n\r\nWe believe the act of fouling on peoples property, attacks on humans/local wildlife and destruction of property merit owners having to face those penalties that a dog owner would suffer in these circumstances.\r\n\r\n",
