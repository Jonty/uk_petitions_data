What used to be a family tradition has turned into a over priced event that only the 'well off' can seriously afford.  At some clubs a family of four can end up paying anything between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300 to attend one game including tickets, food and travel.  This is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI am asking for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to force the Premier League to ask it's members to reduce the cost of ticketing to enable the true fans to return to the game.  We should be looking to use the same system as the Bundesliga in Germany.",
