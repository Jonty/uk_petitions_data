        "additional_details": "Until Parliament ultimately established effective legislation, including that for compulsory full time education, children in the UK died, were injured or otherwise had their lives irredeemably ruined by wholly inappropriate work with extraordinarily long hours. In view of the fact that children continue to be employed in many countries around the world today with the same detrimental effect on their lives and well-being, we request our Government to establish a UK Child Labourers' Memorial in Central London whereby our child labourer ancestors may be duly and sympathetically commemorated and which will  also constitute a reminder to visitors to the UK from countries where child labour is practised that it is the responsibility of wise and responsible Government to bring an end to end this evil practice.",
