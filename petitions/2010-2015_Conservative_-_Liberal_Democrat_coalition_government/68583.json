        "additional_details": "There have been many petitions set up in a bid to lower the age for cervical screening. However this petition is slightly different. So many women below the age of 25 are going to the doctors with symptoms and are being refused smear tests because of their age. After many visits to the doctors when they are finally granted a smear test but sadly its to late and they are losing their lives. Its happening more and more these days and I propose that something is put in place to say no matter your age if you have symptoms you should be allowed a smear test. This could help save lives. Something needs to be done.",
