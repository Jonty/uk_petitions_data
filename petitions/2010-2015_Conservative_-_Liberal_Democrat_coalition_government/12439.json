        "additional_details": "Women in their late fifties are bearing the brunt of massive social changes to the tune of approx \u00a315,000 and up to 6 years of our lives in a time of high unemployment.  I started work at 15.  Equal rights were not so good in the 19'70's.  I remember men being paid more than me for the same work.  Maternity allowance was not available to all women.  I am weary.  66 is too old for many women.  Should our mothers, grandmothers, daughters, sisters and wives be forced to bear this burden?  We must respect the elderly and help us to enjoy our later years in peace and security.",
