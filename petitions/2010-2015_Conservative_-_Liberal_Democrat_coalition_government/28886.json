        "additional_details": "We would like tougher sentencing on people that cause trauma to animals, such as dog fighting, beatings etc. The owner should be punished, you wouldn't expect a child to go through this sort of abuse and stay with the parents etc, they would be taken away but with animals they have to keep going through trauma and be treat badly because there aren't tougher sentencing. If someone has abused an animal in any way they should be banned for life not for a year or two for LIFE. ",
