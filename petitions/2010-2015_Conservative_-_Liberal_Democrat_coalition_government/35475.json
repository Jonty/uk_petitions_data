This is an insult to a man who has always given his best to his country, no matter where he has lived or played.  Also as an ambassador for sport in this country and all over the world, his inclusion should have been a foregone conclusion.\r\nDavid Beckham should be included in the Team and the Government should ensure that this is the case by liaising with the FA and LOCOG.
