The restricted budget of pensioners, as well as those 'low paid workers', make such offers great benefits in this ever increasing price rising environment. The bottle of wine effectively a treat.  These people arn't alcoholics or Anti-Social individuals.\r\nStand up to proposals by government, contact your minister, & vote to curtail the idiotic proposals which penalise the majority because of the irresponsible minority.\r\nCharge those abusers for their medical treatments.  (likewise smokers & illegal substance abusers)",
