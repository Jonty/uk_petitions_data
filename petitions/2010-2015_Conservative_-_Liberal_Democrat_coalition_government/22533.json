        "additional_details": "Have adult cyclists pay a form of road tax, and use it to create a well designed system of cycle routes, with routes designed by and for cyclists. The currant system of cycle routes especially in rural areas seem poorly designed, often taking you miles out of the way, often over ill maintained roads and gravel tracks which are unsuitable for most types of bicycle. I would happily pay a tax towards improved routes, which would benefit motorists by removing cyclists from the road, and help reduce CO2 by encouraging more people to use there bicycles.",
