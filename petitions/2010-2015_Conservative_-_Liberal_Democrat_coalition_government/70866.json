These people are learning a trade on less than the minimum wage and are barely surviving on it, with rent to pay, council tax, gas, electricity and water bills, there is virtually only pennies left for the food bills. Single tenant apprentices receive a 50% discount plus 25% single persons rate,  yet the PROPERTY requires 25% council tax bill to be paid. Supposing the property was empty, it wouldn't be paid at all! Help our apprentices who are only trying to do the right thing by the book, they need feeding and not the financial worries which will in effect, affect their whole life as they struggle to make ends meet.
