        "additional_details": "All police officers begin as constables and are recruited to fulfill that role. Within this pool it is hoped that the leadership talent exists to provide for a cadre of Inspectors, Superintendents and Chief Officers.\r\n\r\nNo wonder there is such a dearth of leadership talent in the service based on this 'hit-or-miss' system.\r\n\r\nThat the HMG consider creating an 'Officer corps' for the police so that talented and educated graduates can enter the service at the rank of Inspector after a 2 year cadetship.\r\n\r\n Also that highly skilled leaders from business can be appointed as Chief Officers to shake up this institution that is 20-30 years behind the times.",
