Civil servants generally accepted lower pay than those in the private sector as our \"perks\"  made up for the shortfall. These \"perks\" (pensions) have now been all but erroded.\r\nWill the chancellor when considering abolishing the national pay rate lead by example and insist that MP's are paid based on the consituency they represent??\r\nRemember we are all in it together!!",
