        "additional_details": "Private security guards seem to be effective in protecting merchant vessels passing through high risk areas such as the waters off East Africa. Could the Royal Navy not provide this service by transferring a highly trained unit to any British vessel entering a high risk area? Appropriate accommodation and other facilties would need to be available on the merchant ship and the unit could be transferred back to the Royal Navy when the danger had passed. This would overcome the questionable legality of ships carrying armed civilians and the requirement to carry them for the whole voyage. It would seem preferable for a professional and legitimately armed force to carry out this function rather than a mercenary force. If this protection is not currently the Royal Navy\u2019s responsibility a charge could be made.",
