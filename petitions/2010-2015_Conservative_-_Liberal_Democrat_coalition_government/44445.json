This is what most companies look for within the people they hire.\r\nDoesn't that mean that it is now extremely difficult for someone who hasn't worked in that particular industry to get a job within it?\r\n\r\nGovernment should do more in order to aid young people looking for work into employment, and if experience or training is required, government should provide funding for training of the unemployed going into employment.\r\nMore pressure should be applied upon employers to give young people a chance.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
