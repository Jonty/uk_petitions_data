The media responds by calling diabetics \"fatties and tubbies\" I want to make people aware of the causes of diabetes, the impact the abuse of diabetics from  the media and public have on diabetcs and make it illegal to bully/discriminate others on their weight/diabetes. People need to be aware that there are lots of different types of diabetes. It's unacceptable to be bullied by anyone for their diabetes.",
