        "additional_details": "The Horse Racing Industry needs government legislation to protect and save what the BHA are doing their best to destroy. The first recorded UK horse race meeting was over 800 years ago and is a part of this countries heritage. Why is one of the UK's largest employers, which employs over 100,000 people, allowed to get into such a state of failure. The Government has shown no interest in helping the industry and the way the TOTE was sold was a clear sign that they do not care about it. There seems to be no problem in handing out billions of pounds to save other industries but the Horse Racing Industry is ignored while everyone watches it fail. UK bookmakers were given licences nearly 50 years ago to work hand in hand with racing in the form of the Levy. They have now turned their backs on the industry that made them, going offshore to avoid paying tax. Why is this loophole not closed immediately. Government legislation is the only way the industry will be saved.",
