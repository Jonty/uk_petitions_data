        "additional_details": "To my understanding, no other religion feels the need to bother people in their own place of residence. The Jehovah's Witnesses visit my doorstep a minimum of two times a month, which I consider tantamount to harassment. I have repeatedly and clearly stated my disinterest, yet this invasion of my privacy persists. Please sign this petition if you think the government should stop Jehovah's Witnesses bothering people in their own homes. Alternatively, can we have a blacklist register distributed throughout their organisation which clearly states which homes NOT to visit, making it illegal to do otherwise.   ",
