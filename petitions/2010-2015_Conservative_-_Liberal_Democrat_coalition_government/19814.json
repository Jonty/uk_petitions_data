        "additional_details": "The extended parking bay charges in Manchester City centre that now apply seven days a week up to 8 pm, including Sundays, will have a negative effect in the economy recovery of the city damaging all businesses as people will steer towards out of town alternatives. Some small bussinesses might strugle  to keep the doors open, specialy the ones that offer the community sport and arts which tend to be night trading. This will also place a burden for some families and individuals that will like to come to Manchester but can't afford the extra cost of the extended parking fees.\r\nThis action by the council seems to be false economy!!!",
