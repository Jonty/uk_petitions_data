If a cat fouls on someone's property then the cat owner should be liable to foot any bill for the removal/cleaning of the waste and any deterrent.\r\n\r\nIf a cat damages any other property then its owner should be liable for those damages.\r\n\r\nIn addition cat owners who allow their cats to roam should provide by law a place for their cat to litter on their own property, not only indoors but in their own garden if they have one, a littering area.\r\n\r\nProperty owners should be allowed to take preventative action on their own property to be decided by government.\r\n\r\nCat owners who persistently fail to control their animals should be punished with worsening levels of severity, persistent repeat offenders should not be allowed to own a cat.\r\n\r\n",
