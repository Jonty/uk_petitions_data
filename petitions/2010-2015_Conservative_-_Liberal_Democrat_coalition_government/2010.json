This rule should apply to MP's when travelling to and from their constituency (or second home). If this was the case the cost of fuel and road travel would finally impact the people who can influence it's cost the most. Once MP's have to pay the same as the rest of us for travel you would soon find the cost of petrol duty being cut to a few pence and rail travel falling by more than half.",
