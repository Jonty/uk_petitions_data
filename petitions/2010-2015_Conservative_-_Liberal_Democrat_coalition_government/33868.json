We understand the need for reform but feel it must be balanced & unbiased, protecting both Police Officers and the public, this report will have devaststing effects on working conditions, pensions & salaries. The risks associated with their role leave them susceptable to injuries, stress, disabilities and illnesses including mental health issues, protected recovery time is therefore of paramount importance to the Officer, their families & the service.\r\nWe call on the Government to support our dedicated Police Service and to protect it from the unfairness & harshness of Winsor Part 2.\r\nI sign this petition in support of every Police Officer serving in this Country.",
