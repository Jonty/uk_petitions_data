For the islands ferry service providers to change there \"day return\" travel tickets to be valid for 24hours from time/date of purchase, not within same day travel.\r\n\r\nA day is 24 hours rite ? So we are paying for a day return ?\r\n\r\nTravelling out for short trips and returning early the following day sees a huge price difference from their period - day return prices.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share this petition and get them to change there policies.\r\n\r\nAs I said before a day is 24 hours so lets have our tickets valid for just that.
