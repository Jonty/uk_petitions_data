The law is here to protect us and we always have the right to defend ourseves, This is not always the case sanctions should be used to make Creditors do this connrectly and should be used. The County Court should realise that Allot of creditors dont spply them which the right infomation and that a Debtor or anyone for that matteer should not hange the right to take that away from them. an examble not being informed about court action via post at the moment isnt an excuse it should be when they dont use recorded delivery. the system isnt allowing the coorect timeframe to respond. id the court cant  see both sides of the situation then a CCJ should NOT be issued by default. We need more Protection from these Creditors!",
