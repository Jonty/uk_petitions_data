        "additional_details": "Many motorists and Businesses are under increasing economic pressures and struggle to pay Vehicle Excise Duty (VED). Motoring is so expensive that it is COSTING the Government money, as fewer people can now afford to drive.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to:\r\nSCRAP the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) based on vehicle class, in favour of a VED element funded via fuel usage\r\n\r\nChanging to fuel based VED, would have the following advantages:-\r\n(i) Bigger engine vehicles would pay more;\r\n(ii) Lower mileage vehicles would pay less;\r\n(iii) Eliminate tax avoidance;\r\n(iv) Reduce administrative burdens / costs for the Government & Police;\r\n(v) Eliminate VED / VAT duplication - as exempt vehicle classes (i.e. Ambulances / Disabled) could benefit from the provision of VAT exemption on fuel;\r\n(vi) Ensure foreign vehicles automatically contribute through fuel usage.",
