        "additional_details": "This Conservative led coalition should respect the free market values that Baroness Thatcher believed in, and hand the organisation and payment of her funeral over to the the private sector. I believe many in the business classes will have made their fortunes after the Thatcher policies of disembowling industry and the dergulation of the workplace. I believe they would be overjoyed to pay from their own pockets as a fitting tribute to the architect of so much change. ",
