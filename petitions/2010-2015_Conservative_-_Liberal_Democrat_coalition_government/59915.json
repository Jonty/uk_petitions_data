        "additional_details": "The Highways Agency is introducing 'Smart Motorways' as a means of increasing capacity during busy times of the day. Vehicles are allowed to use the hard shoulder as an additional lane.\r\n\r\n'Refuge Areas' are provided at intervals so that vehicles can escape the carriageway in case of a breakdown or emergency. However the Highways Agency admits that in 50% of cases vehicles cannot reach the refuge and are forced to stop in a live traffic lane.\r\n\r\nThe Highways Agency says that it manages the risks monitoring and management of the carriageway, but experience road users are concerned that the risk of vehicles ploughing into stationary vehicles at night, in rain, of fog (say) is too great.\r\n\r\nThis petition is asking for an independent review, e.g. by the Health and Safety Executive, to decide whether the additional risks to road safety arising from Smart Motorways are disproportionate to the benefits.",
