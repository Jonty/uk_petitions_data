        "additional_details": "Not all school children are entitled to tuition of a musical instrument free of charge.  Children whose parents work and are not in receipt of free school meals are required to pay a fee of \u00a3160 a year for their tuition, whilst children who are in receipt of free school meals get the tuition free of charge.  For many working parents the fee is not affordable and many children who come from working families are missing out whilst children from families who don't work are getting the service free. This is unfair to the children as they should all be given the same chance to learn how to play a musical instrument of their choice.\r\n\r\nAll children should be given the same opportunities regardless of whether their parent works or not.  Many single parent families and families on low incomes cannot afford this expense.\r\n\r\n",
