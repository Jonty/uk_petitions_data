        "additional_details": "The government should implement a system for mandatory psychological testing/profiling of prospective members of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThose who govern should possess common human faculties such as empathy, compassion, integrity, and so on. There is a manifest danger to the public if someone in an executive office does not possess the capacity for empathy, for example; or if they suffer from a personality disorder making them a psychopath, sociopath, extreme narcissist, pathological liar, etc.\r\n\r\nThe public should have confidence that their rulers do not fall into such categories. To ensure this: the government should inititate a system whereby prospective members of the Cabinet are subjected to psychological tests and profiling, administered by independent experts, before they can assume executive office.
