As such many businesses feel they have a right to burn it regardless of the toxic smoke that is prejudicial to health and as such should not be permitted also I feel this is not a suitable or safe way to handle our confidential details.\r\nThere are excellent ways to recycle and many company's across the UK offer this service at a small charge which is then recycled into toilet and tissue paper.\r\nAs such I would like a law introduced to forbid the burning of all confidential data and get the country even more green. Reduce the carbon footprint now! ",
