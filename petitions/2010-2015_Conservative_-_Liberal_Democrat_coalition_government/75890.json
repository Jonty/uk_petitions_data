At present not all health providers allow CGM access to T1Diabetics. It should be an optional method of treatment and support to all T1 diabetics without the postcode lottery issue. (CGMs) offer T1 diabetics the opportunity to monitor diabetes efficiently & crucially learn trends of blood glucose levels.This allows insulin treatment to be more effective thus CGMs provide stricter BG control, improving patient outlook long term, and short term. CGMs additionally reduce hypoglycaemia,providing alerts for high/low bloods and thus stricter BG control reduced fear of hypo and improved mental well being,giving more independence and freedom as well as better control,reducing health risks.",
