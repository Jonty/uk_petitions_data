        "additional_details": "We want the government to prevent the culling of wild boar in the Forest of Dean, and anywhere else in the UK.\r\n\r\nA small number of residents living in the areas around the Forest of Dean have complained about damage to lawns, but they are trying to avoid the obvious solution of  putting up fences, and expect the taxpayer to pay for a cull! We would rather our taxes were spent productively; not destructively, for the sake of pleasing a minority whose first resort is violence!\r\n\r\nThis minority fail to see past an insignificant issue, to the rare opportunity these animals present as an attraction which could generate income for the region.\r\n\r\nWe've already hunted them to extinction in the UK once; why can't we learn to leave nature alone, and stop presuming responsibility for the life or death of other species. Especially as we ourselves are so unsustainably over-populated.",
