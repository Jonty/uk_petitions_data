        "additional_details": "My Mother's Life was ended prematurly in 2006 by the local hospital she had been addmited to with a broken neck of femur. She was not operated on for eight days, left without food for four days. Not cared for in general then discharged against the families wishes, dehydrated with a grade four bedsore that was untreated, from a ward that was on infection control due to an outbreak of a sickness and diarrhoea bug, which she had contracted. And last but not least discharged her in this condition against the hospitals own criteria put in place only days before to prevent mum from being discharged. Finally withholding vital treatment days later when she was re-admitted after collapsing through dehydration and an infection from the bedsore. I have long suspected that my mother was discharged along with many others to keep the high mortality figures lower than they were at that time I would like the staff and the management held accountable for their actions that led to her death.",
