        "additional_details": "This petition is to create a debate and change the rules governing organ donation. I am one of the 88 UK Altruistic organ donors. I gave my kidney to a child in 2010. The current system does not work and the transplant list, although being reduced, is not working. People are dying waiting for a transplant. It is cheaper to transplant than to keep someone on dialysis,\u00a329,000 a year, or \u00a3290,000 over 10 years. The cost of a kidney transplant over 10 years is \u00a3102,000, which includes the cost of the operation, the cost of follow-up appointments and the cost of drugs that the patient has to take to stop the body rejecting the organ. Saving over \u00a3200,000. An OPT OUT system would create a fairer system without the added pressure of having to make a difficult decision to take an organ from a deceased loved one would not have to be made. If religious beliefs prevent donation, thats fine; OPT OUT. If you feel you can't consent for whatever personal reason, OPT OUT. It's that simple. ",
