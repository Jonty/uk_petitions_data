        "additional_details": "So this is something that I'm sure is bothering the majority of train-using English teens. Up until the age of sixteen, we are required to pay for child tickets only: however once we have reached this age, from then onwards we're forced to pay adult fares. Yet we are not officially adults: we have no reliable, easy-to-access  income except from our parents who, at that age, may deem it appropriate that we find our own money. Yet with train prices rising, how is our money ever going to cover the adult costs we're supposed to pay? We do not have the right to vote, nor the right to marry without our parents' permission, nor the right to buy certain produts: all of these things come at, or after, the age of 18. So I am asking the government to raise the limit of 'child tickets' to the age of eighteen: we don't have the same rights as official adults, so why should we be made to pay the prices of official adults?",
