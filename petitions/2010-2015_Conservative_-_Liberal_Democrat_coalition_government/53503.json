        "additional_details": "We the undersigned propose that upon any sale of the Taxpayer owned bank of Lloyds the government shall put 50% of the sale back into the economy through a payout via check to all individual UK taxpayers otherwise known as employees. (Based on coordination with HMRC to verify whom has paid tax within the last 10 years to account for anyone that may have contributed but due to recession lost job.)\r\n\r\nThe taxpayer would receive a payout based on the how much they had contributed into the system. This would help reduce personal debt and therefore encourage confidence spending.\r\n\r\nAs the banks would have failed without the taxpayer then it is only fair that the taxpayer should reap some benefit of any sale.
