        "additional_details": "Yasuni has inspired the planet's most creative and ambitious approach to biodiversity conservation, social development and climate change. Ecuador \u2013 which is also home to the Galapagos Islands \u2013 is the only country in the world to have recognised the rights of nature in its constitution. After the discovery of a $7.2bn oil reserve inside a pristine corner of the Yasuni national park, the government has proposed leaving the fossil fuel in the ground if the international community will give them half that amount.\r\n\r\nA plan to preserve the most biodiverse region on Earth from oil exploitation has put Yasuni national park at the frontline of a global battle between living systems and fossil fuels. But enthusiasm is cooling and this bold project may now be at as much at risk as the wildlife itself.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government should back this project with large cash donations as part of its responsibility to try to prevent climate change as one of the world's biggest historical CO2 emitters.",
