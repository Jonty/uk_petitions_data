        "additional_details": "There are a number of head editors who still write articles for their papers are the ones that get to judge if the articles are up to standards. These editors also work for the PCC judging on if articles meet up to code. How they can be expected not to be biased i do not know. A key example of this is Paul Dacre the head editor of the Daily Mail and auther of \"One cannabis joint can cause Schitzophrenia\" this article won awards for having the most scientific errors in and also for having a very clear agenda. Now when this article was complained about the PCC said there were no errors and it would not amend it. This needs to end, journalist have a very important job which over the years has been ruined, we need a non biased independent board to examine if an article is meeting up to code. Not the writers",
