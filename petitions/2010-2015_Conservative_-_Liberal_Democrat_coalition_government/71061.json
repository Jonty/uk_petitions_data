And address whether the current Trust and Company are actually up to the job of keeping this important ship safe for the nation.\r\n\r\nThe 2007 fire was a tragedy. The most recent fire in 2014 smacks of carelessness. Especially if the initial reports of it being due to a vaccum cleaner being left on continuously for 2 days are accurate.",
