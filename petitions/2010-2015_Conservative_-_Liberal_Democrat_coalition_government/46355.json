        "additional_details": "For years now various celebrities have been used by companies to sell financial products. These include loans and life insurances. The use of celebrities gives the product a disguise of respectability and sends out the message that these products are good and 'friendly'.\r\nFor some who are persuaded this can result in financial loss to those who can least afford it. End of life insurance can result in less money being realised upon death than the total amount of premiums paid in. Loans cause indebtedness.\r\nThere seems to be no accountability upon those who are paid large sums to promote these products. This, as far as I am concerned, is wrong. This petition seeks to restrict, if not stop altogether the use of celebrities to advertise financial products.",
