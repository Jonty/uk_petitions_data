        "additional_details": "Although she is widely acknowledged to be one of England's greatest leaders, no bronze statues of Elizabeth I stand in London, even though many other lesser monarchs have been commemorated in such a way. I propose that the government funds the casting of a statue of the Tudor Queen. Not only will this commemorate the significant achievements of her reign but it would also increase the number statues that depict women in the capital \u2013 of which there are much less than men.\r\n\r\nIt would also prove to be popular with today\u2019s tourists as she is arguably one of the most recognizable people from world history, and therefore of interest to everyone that visits.\r\n\r\nMany may argue that casting new statues is a waste of taxpayer\u2019s money, however I would say it\u2019s a small price to pay for a statue that will stand in the capital for centuries to come, commemorating a woman who achieved so much in her lifetime, and more importantly reinforcing the role that women have played within our rich history.
