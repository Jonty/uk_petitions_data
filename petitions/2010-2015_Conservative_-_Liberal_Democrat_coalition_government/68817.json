We want the government to take action and make it an illegal act to promote such organisations related to terrorism, and anyone openly promoting such organisations will be arrested and if not a UK citizen be sent back to their respective country.\r\nAny British Citizen whom conducts any form of terrorist activities, including supporting radical organisations will be banned from entering back into the UK. We as a country want the government to stand up and take action. A march of UK veterans will be taking place on the 18th October in London and will end outside 10 Downing street. We will be marching peacefully to raise awareness of these issues within the UK.",
