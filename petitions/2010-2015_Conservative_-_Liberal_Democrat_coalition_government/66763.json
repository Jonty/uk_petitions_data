        "additional_details": "Luis Suarez has proven time and time again to be the worst type of football player. The FA has indicted him on racism charges and for biting an opposing team's player. He has just been caught on camera doing the latter again in the World Cup where his dishonourable conduct has seen a team bow out of the competition for the second time (following a goal line handball against Ghana in 2010). It's time to get this guy out of English football and out of the UK. He is no kind of example to our kids and Britain is better off without him.",
