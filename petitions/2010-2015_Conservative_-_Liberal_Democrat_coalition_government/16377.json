        "additional_details": "I was appalled at the scenes of rioting that We all witnessed during August. Many have debated and the Prime Minister has signalled a review of our 'sick' nation. Sadly, over the years we have seen Christianity somewhat eroded somehow quite perniciously and I (as many others) believe that this is due to Britain having lost her Christian heritage. Simply, God has been sidestepped as the centre of our faith. Faith itself has become confused due to 'political correctness' which i feel in some instances has been used inappropriately to mask cover a system bent on fulfilling selfish desires that do not justify collective suffering at all. I petition the department of culture to put the Church at the heart of all social reforms that are so desperately needed in order to prevent scenes such as was witnessed in August. ",
