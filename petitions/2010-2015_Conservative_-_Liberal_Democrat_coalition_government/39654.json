        "additional_details": "Blood analysis machines are expensive, cheap biosensors for blood and mineral analysis would :-\r\na) Reduce the manpower in the NHS required to take and analyse blood samples. Immediate results, less bureaucratic\r\nb) Patients could have there own machine at home, to determine if  a medicine needs to be taken , currently they have to take certain medications even if not need rquired. A diabetes suffer can use his/her glucose meter (glucose biosensor) costing approx \u00a320 to determine if his/her blood sugar level is high or low and act on results, the same flexibility is required by persons who suffer from high blood pressure, liver and kidney disease etc.\r\nc) Cheap biosenser could be incorporated into dialysis machines to determine treatment prior and after dialysis.\r\nd)Allow medics in warships and frontline units to undertake blood analysis when needed.\r\nRequest Ministry of Defence and Dept of health, sponsor the design and manufacture of cheap bio-sensors for blood and mineral analysis",
