        "additional_details": "After a road accident the police have discretionary powers to close a road for accident investigation. Often this can be for periods of five or more hours which causes considerable problems to road users, particularly where there is no obvious alternative route available.  This petition requests a statutory limit for discretionary road closures by the involved officers for 3 hours without the express agreement in writing of the Chief Constable. This must be based on the balance of benefit to the investigation compared with the inconvenience to the public and the reasons and those reasons made available to public scrutiny.",
