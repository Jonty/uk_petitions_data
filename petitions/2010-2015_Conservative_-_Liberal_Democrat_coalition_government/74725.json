The devastated parent now find they are at the mercy of a system which goes against human rights.\r\nThis cannot be right nor should be justified. In my case my child was returned to state care because of medical reasons and medical reasons only. I support a no blame approach by the courts in situations such as medical or other grounds so the parent can be protected.\r\nTherefore there must be an additional box for the current Care Order Act would include a box for medical grounds/other grounds. Those grounds could be listed separately. The Adoptive Parent could then go on to successfully adopt again in the future should they wish.\r\n",
