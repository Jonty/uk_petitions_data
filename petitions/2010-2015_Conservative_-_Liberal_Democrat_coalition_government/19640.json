        "additional_details": "When many people took out a private pension it was on the understanding that it would give us all extra income. But after having it robbed by Gordon Brown when Chancellor, with extra taxes etc making them virtually worthless; plus the fact that for every pound recieved in private pension it is also deducted from one's benefits and  taxed when tax has already been paid on money put in. This needs reversing no tax should be paid or loss of benefits if private pension recieved is less than \u00a35000 per annum. It is alright for those on Gold plated pensions like MP's themselves how about letting the ordinary person enjoy a little of what we have saved for.",
