        "additional_details": "East Hampshire District Council have proposed plans for a development on the grounds of a former Hospital. Part of the grounds lies on fields and grassland which is home to a diverse range of birds and also bats which roost in the old buildings and trees. The birds present are Blackbirds, Magpie, Nightingale, Song Thrush, Robin  and I have also spotted swallow and blue tit. At night bats come out of the old buildings and also owls can be heard. There is also natural flowers and grasses which attracts butterflies, moths and bees to the area.  I want the government to prevent damage to roost/nest sites and to prevent the loss of Birds and Insects. ",
