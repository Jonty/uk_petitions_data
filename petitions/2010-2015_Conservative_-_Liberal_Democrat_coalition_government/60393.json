        "additional_details": "The Director of the 'Year of Code', Lottie Dexter, does not know how to code and has little grasp as to why it is so important for the UK electronics and IT industry.  This was exposed to devastating effect by Jeremy Paxman on the BBC Newsnight programme on Wednesday 5th February.  Any selection process that resulted in the appointment of Lottie to this role is clearly flawed and the person or people responsible for her appointment should consider tendering their resignation - failing that they should be sacked.  Lottie herself should be moved to another role and the selection process should be rerun with essential candidate skills including the ability to code in at least one programming language and a deep understanding of why teaching the next generation to code is so important for the UK economy.",
