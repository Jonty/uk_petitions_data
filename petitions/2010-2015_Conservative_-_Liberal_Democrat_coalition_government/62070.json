        "additional_details": "Judo club at Kidbrooke Community Centre has been running for 20 years for children & adults to learn a sport that is good exercise, teaches disapline, respect, etique, self control & dedication.\r\nWe do a good service for the community by keeping youngsters off the streets & helping to keep them safe, healthy & interested in sport rather than being glued to games systems.\r\nWe have a good diverse group of parents & children with people of many different ethnic backgrounds, religions & disabilities.\r\nThe council has given us until the end of May 2014 to close the club because they want to lease the hall.  The community hall that they have not told the community about, how can this be allowed.  We would like people to sign this petition to stop this from being allowed & preventing these youngsters from the only regular exercise some may get. ",
