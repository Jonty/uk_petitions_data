        "additional_details": "NICE guidelines for eligibility for Cochlear Implants are standardized relying heavily on hearing tests conducted in sterile conditions which are not representative of everyday situations.\r\nThis means many profoundly deaf people are denied funding for a Cochlear Implant because they do not meet the harsh criteria set and cannot afford the surgery privately.\r\nA Cochlear Implant can improve a deaf person\u2019s life immeasurably and should not be based on tests with no significance to real life.\r\nRefusal to grant funding for a Cochlear Implant can be heartbreaking to a deaf person who is struggling to deal with everyday life, communicating with loved ones and feeling useless in the workplace. A Cochlear Implant would mean that they can regain their independence and rebuild relationships that would otherwise suffer.\r\nNICE guidelines need to be relaxed. Cases should be reviewed as a whole taking into account the individual\u2019s situation and needs and not based on circumstantial evidence.\r\n\r\n",
