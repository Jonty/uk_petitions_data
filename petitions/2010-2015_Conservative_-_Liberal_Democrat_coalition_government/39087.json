        "additional_details": "There have been a spate of anti - freeze poisonings against cats within the Harwich/Dovercourt areas over the past few months. Anti - freeze is enticing to cats as it has a sweet taste which they like. This petition is to get the Govt to pass a Bill in Parliment urging all manufacturers of anti - freeze to add a bittering agent to its products, so that it is not attractive to cats and other small animals. Please help support this cause by signing this petition and getting your friends and family to do the same. As someone who has lost a cat in this way, I would hate for anyone else to have to go through the heartache of losing a pet.",
