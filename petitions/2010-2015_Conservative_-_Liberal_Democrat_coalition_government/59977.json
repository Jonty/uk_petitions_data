        "additional_details": "  I would like to propose the Introduction of a cap on the maximum rent Landlords can charge tenants, based on a number of criteria, including re-evaluation of council tax, facilities provided and location to calculate the amounts.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a Government controlled scheme by which all Landlords are to register their properties and rental incomes are to be paid into by the tenant. This would help reduce tax evasion and benefit the public purse.  Any failure to register or hide income resulting in fines against the value of the property.\r\n\r\n  Introducing caps and forcing landlords to pay tax on incomes not only reduces the public outlay on housing benefits and brings in taxes, but also puts more money into the real economy through increased spending by those who would not be so hard pressed to meet rental costs. This policy would have several benefits and help to alleviate the cost of living crisis this government is so detached from.",
