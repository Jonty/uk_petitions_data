At present Higher Education establishments can fail students on the grounds of academic judgement and a student is unable to see their paper to check where they may have gone wrong and the fairness of this decision.  The OIAHE who look into Higher education complaints do not come under the scrutiny of the freedom of information act so they also do not have to give a reason for their decisions and are not answerable to the public.
