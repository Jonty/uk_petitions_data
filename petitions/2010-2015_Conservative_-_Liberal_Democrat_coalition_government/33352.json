        "additional_details": "There are 650 MP's who earn a basic of \u00a365700, this is before expenses, minister extras of \u00a320k etc. This is a MINIMUM of \u00a342.7m before expenses. With expenses it will break the \u00a365m.\r\nWhy can't we go to something similar as the USA and have ONE MP for ONE County or region.\r\nAS an example, why do we need 75 MPs for London, 14 for South Yorkshire and 23 for West Yorkshire. We could lose over half if not two thirds of the MP's and they could be replaced with lower paid aides/assistants who would aid the county or regional MP. Thank you for reading.",
