        "additional_details": "Delay the introduction of new specs & bring back January sittings, one spec for AS and A level. Making A levels harder is beneficial, but these changes are being rushed through, they will be impractical to deliver and Important topics have been scrapped. Having  separate AS and A Level specifications is unwieldy and confusing. I know from experience that students often wish to drop subjects after AS as they have changed their plans for degree/career ,Students will not be able to make changes once committed to AS or A level, this will disadvantage them. It also means that in 2015 teachers will delivering 3 specifications, 2 of those new ( old A level and new AS and A level)\r\nTeacher consultation is needed.",
