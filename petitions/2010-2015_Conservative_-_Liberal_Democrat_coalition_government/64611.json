        "additional_details": "I am a single person, with no children, live alone and have worked since I left school. I have paid all my taxes from leaving school. Single people get nothing other than a 25% discount of council tax.That's it!! Single people are constantly hammered financially, from supermarket offers to insurance deals orienatted around couples or families. Single people still have to heat a room and cook a meal and use same utilities as a family. A single person who wishes to go on holiday alone is required to pay a single person's supplement and NOW are further discriminated by National Rail whereby couples travelling together are entitled to 1/3 off their rail fare with the new \"two together\" railcard. Can the Government address these issues to give some incentives to single people in this country? ",
