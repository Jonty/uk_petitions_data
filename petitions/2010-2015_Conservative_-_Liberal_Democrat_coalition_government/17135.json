Airmiles has recently been encouraging collectors to purchase extra Airmiles for cash but did not inform purchasers that they planned to reduce the value of them. The government should intervene to ensure that people who have been collecting Airmiles in good faith for many years and who have parted with cash to top up their Airmiles should be compensated with an extra 35% of points when they are converted into Avios, which are worth 20% less travel and which require cash payments on top when they are redeemed for flights.",
