        "additional_details": "At present England has no Parliament to represent it; the House of Lords is not democratically elected and largely irrelevant; and the electoral system is biased in favour of the two main parties. I therefore propose the following solution to these problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n1) The House of Commons should be turned into an English Parliament, with similar powers to the Scottish Parliament and the same STV (Single Transferable Vote) election system.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) The House of Lords should be turned into a UK Senate that has all the powers of the current Westminster Parliament, except those devolved to the English Parliament. Its main function will be to make decision that affect the UK (taxes, defence, etc) and the Senators will be elected using PR (Proportional Representation).\r\n",
