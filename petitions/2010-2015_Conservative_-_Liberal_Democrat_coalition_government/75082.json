        "additional_details": "The situation in Ukraine is exactly the same as that in Europe during the late 1930's. A fascist dictator is using the argument that speakers of Russian are under attack and Putin is providing advanced weaponry to the rebels as well as Russian soldiers. They will totally bankrupt Ukraine as the East holds much of the industrial heartland of the country. The UK and US should provide weapons to stop Putin from causing trouble in Eastern Europe - fascist dictators only understand power. ",
