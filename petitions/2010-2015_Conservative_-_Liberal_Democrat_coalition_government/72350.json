        "additional_details": "any Press is good press, as all the celebrities know. News, in the papers on the radio, tv, internet about Paedophilia is positive publicity for those who are thinking about abusing children, or for those who are over the last big sexual thrill and looking for the next. Telling the world that a sex ring in slough has being put in prison is still encouraging those dirty minded perverts, telling them that although they may well get caught in 5 months or more but they will get away with it for a while. Keep it out the news out of the mind. test it.",
