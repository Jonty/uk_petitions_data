        "additional_details": "Politicians are supposed to represent their constituents. Thus we need engineers, scientists, shop keepers, teachers, road sweepers, plumbers, electricians, airline pilots and every trade and profession represented in parliament. It is not possible for a career politician who, like a graduate teacher who goes straight back to school, to know enough of life or skills or experience in the real world and he simply cannot represent you, or me. I propose that a parliamentary candidate must demonstrate a minimum of 20 years practical work experience, of any sort, before being allowed to stand. We all need qualifications for a job \u2013 make it true for politicians as well. ",
