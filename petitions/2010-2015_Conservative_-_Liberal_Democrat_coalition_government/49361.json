        "action": "Abolish the British Parking Association and return control of parking to local councils",
        "additional_details": "The British Parking Association is a disgrace set up purely to extort money from the great British public by confusing unsuspecting motorists in places such as free car parks, super market premises and other areas. The British Parking Association should not be able to obtain personal information on British citizens from the DVLA. Powers over car parking should be returned to local council control in an open, reasonable and lawful manner.\r\n\r\nIn short please sign the petition to lobby for the abolition of the British Parking Association.",
