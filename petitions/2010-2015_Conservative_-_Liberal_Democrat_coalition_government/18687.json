        "additional_details": "Treating health related issues caused by obesity is incredibly expensive.Life today is exceptionally sedentary for young people in particular due to the internet, television and computers, so I feel it is extremely important to encourage youths to become more active.It would establish good habits in teenagers whilst they are young by being proactive and preventing future health problems instead of treating them when they do arise. The gym has recently become a sociable place where youths feel comfortable to exercise. Many young people are put off going to the gym purely because of the cost. I had to pay \u00a35 for one session at my local council run gym only 2 weeks ago which has definitely put me off going regularly even though I did enjoy the experience. I believe that making gym memberships free for teenagers will be very cost-effective and a worthy investment.",
