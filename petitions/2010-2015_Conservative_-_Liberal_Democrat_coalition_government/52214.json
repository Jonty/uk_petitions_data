        "additional_details": "This is really sad that terrorism is operating from the British soil and not only Mr. Altaf Hussain threats peaceful people of Karachi in private but also public & on live TV. His gangsters are killing dozens of people on daily basis in our city. The links are open and clear. This terrorist network is operating from London, with branches in South Africa and targeting innocent people of Karachi. It is a responsibility of British Police to stop this network from operating directly from their head office in London.\r\n\r\n     Please take notice of his consistent terrorism against Pakistan from British soil and bring this international terrorism to an end.\r\n\r\nThanking in anticipation",
