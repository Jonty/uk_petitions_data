        "additional_details": "The petitions purpose is to not only create an awareness of Puppy Farming and Parvo Virus, but to campaign to get the law changed so that ALL breeders have to register with the RSPCA and be discoverable by an online search and show evidence to potential new owners that they have been checked, agreed and registered by professionals, which in turn, will then make the breeder liable if a puppy from them falls ill with a sickness that they have picked up from their home, including the deadly Parvo Virus.\r\n Failing to do so would mean a lifetime ban from owning any animal and a custodial sentence.\r\n  This will help to prevent Puppy Farmers from making their disgusting and dishonest income and help to put a stop to families across the country going through the heartbreak of losing their new family member and also losing thousands of pounds trying to save them from dying.",
