        "additional_details": "I started this petition after driving to work this morning and seeing a mother smoking whilst pushing a pram, and I watched the smoke go over her very young baby, paticularly over it's face. It's disgusting that babies have to breathe in this filth, which could lead them to develop all sorts of conditions such as asthma and leave them more susceptable to cancer. They have no choice in the matter but the parents do and it's plain wrong and selfish.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to protect children from the toxic fumes inflicted on them by their thoughtless parents.",
