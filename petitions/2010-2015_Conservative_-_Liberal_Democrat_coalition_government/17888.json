        "additional_details": " All Bats, in the UK, are protected under the above act to preserve the species, which is understandable, but there does`nt seem to be a provision for the following true situation :- Bats have taken to nesting in the eaves of St Hilda church, Ryedale, N Yorkshire, their droppings, which are acidic, are ruining the interior, the church is a health risk & will become unuseable. It is hoped a common sense solution will be reached, but there are no guide lines.  It is propossed that the Government amend the Act to resolve such problems with Bats & other protected species. so that people caught up in these situations (Bats in the attic), have a lawful procedure to take.  Your votes would be greatly appreciated.",
