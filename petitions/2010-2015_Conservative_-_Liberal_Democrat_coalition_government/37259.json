        "additional_details": "I'll be brief,\r\na foetus is said to be viable, if premature labour should start, at 24 weeks, an abortion can be carried out up to 24 weeks. This is not a termination of just a pregnancy, when left this long. This is Killing a baby that could very well thrive if born at this gestational stage.\r\n\r\nEven at 20 weeks a foetus can be given an identity, even if its only a gender\r\n\r\nI am pro choice, but, when a life is viable, it should be given a chance. At 24 weeks that is a baby, and not just a ball of cells.\r\nAs i said, I am not against abortion, but i ask that you sign this to change the gestational age from 24 weeks (viable) to 16-18 weeks as a cap age for an abortion to be carried out.\r\n\r\nThankyou",
