        "additional_details": "Creditors & Banks should write-off all their customers\u2019 debts up to the value of \u00a315,000 & reclaim the costs from the Government. It was the banks & creditors that offered the loans, credit cards & increased overdraft facilities to people without considering if they were treating them fairly or looking at the affordability of the individual. The banks & creditors charge extortionate charges for missed or late payments as well as high interest rates on the money borrowed, so not allowing the individual to get out of debt & sending them into a downward spiral of debt plus charges. The Government is bailing out the banks. The banks are not passing the money on to the people. If the Government bailed out the people with debts up to the value of \u00a315,000, this will enable people to rebalance their books & start off with a clean slate, lessening anxiety, stress & improving general well-being & the health of the nation, as well as freeing up more money to start to spend & re-start the economy.",
