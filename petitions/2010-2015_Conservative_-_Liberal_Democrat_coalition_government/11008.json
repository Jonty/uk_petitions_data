        "additional_details": "The Armed Forces including the Army, Navy and Air Force should not have to bare the burden of Spending Cuts while being engaged in conflicts and hostility is present Worldwide.  Terrorism, rising Military Nations, and aggression all pose a risk to Britain and its Overseas Territories.  It is therefore not justified to impose such extreme cuts and it may be necessary to set out minimum Force Requirements for all Services i.e Troop Numbers, (Army), Surface Ship Numbers, (Navy) etc. This will prevent the situation we now face where Britain does not have an effective Aircraft Carrier.",
