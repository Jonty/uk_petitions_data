If somebody can take the innocence from a child then they do not deserve to live. Why should tax payers fund their safety in prisons. How can it be justice that these sick people carry on living their lives while they have destroyed the lives of others. Somebody in power please grow a spine and help solve this problem, we need to have the ultimate deterant to help stop this crime. Peadophiles need to be terminated so the crime can eventually be wiped out of existance. Protecting our children should be a priority. Please consider bringing back the death penalty for peadophiles.",
