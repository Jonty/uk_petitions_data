        "action": "Why does parking ticket cost more than a penalty ticket given to a shoplifter?",
        "additional_details": "A parking ticket costs a motorist who appeals and loses \u00a3120. A shoplifter or a theif can get a penalty notice disorder \u00a360 fine from the police. If you break the speed limit you get \u00a360 ticket. So are we saying that theft and speeding is a less serious crime than someone who parks in the wrong place?That is so unfair.We have more parking wardens than street cleaners the council are making money out of motorist, There more interested in generating income than having out streets cleaned. I ask the goverment to make parking ticket a fixed price of \u00a350 across the board no more confusion or unfairness or any money that is generated from parking goes to the treasury and not the council. That way they can spend less time putting up cameras in location where they think they can make money.Please add your name to this petition and lets have this debated in parliment.\r\n",
