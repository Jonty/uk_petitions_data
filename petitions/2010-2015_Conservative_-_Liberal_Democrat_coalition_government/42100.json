        "additional_details": "There has been a great public outcry about the rate at which foreign and UK based companies pay corporation tax in the UK.\r\n\r\nIf it wasn't for a parliamentary questions we would not know about Amazon etc.\r\n\r\nA new public website should be created so that the consumer, council, nhs etc can look at a company and check to see what is the effective level of corporation tax that a company pays.\r\n\r\nThis information should be free to be viewed by everyone and not rely on parliamentary question in order for this information to be revealed.\r\n\r\nThe consumer can then make an informed choice about whether to say buy films from love-film ( an Amazon company)  to shop at Tesco etc.\r\n\r\nCorporation Tax is a fair part of the British tax system. It is a pity that some companies are not playing fair, and this website would help the consumer etc make an informed choice as to where spend there money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
