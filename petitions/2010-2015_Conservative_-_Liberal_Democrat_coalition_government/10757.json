        "additional_details": "To give additional support to community projects and giving worth to both young and old people, those who are on benefits must be able to give back to community. Working 20 hours per week on community projects gives people the self worth that they deserve, reduce the need for additional funding of projects due to an abundance of community workers, and gets people back into the working habit. This will get the big society back on track and will prevent people from claiming benefits when they are able to work but cannot find it.\r\nNo community service no benefits.\r\nBuild the community, build cultural understandings and build confidence. People may also be able to bring skills to the community projects.",
