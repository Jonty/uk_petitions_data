These vouchers should only be redeemable against essential food items, not alcohol, cigarettes, branded clothing and holidays abroad. Bus passes should also be issued so people can commute to shops and interviews and caps should be placed on housing benefits to prevent people living in expensive houses at state expense. These new benefits should replace all monetary payments in order to help reduce expenditure on state support. ",
