        "additional_details": "As a graduate, part qualified accountant & scholar of Marxism with over 17 years of experience under the tutelage of the British government, I found something very significant that unless licenses are given, contracts are awarded or position are bidded for, to become few operators of over 84 diverse sectors talkless of the numerous products in these sectors which could serve as few operators in the medium term of over 3-4 years. Morning session which is the most daunting period of the day for any individual in Britain could better exercised with the \"abnormal profits\" by providing the same work placement in other sectors with stipends pay. The employment opportunities could be better viewed from biblical difference that destiny is given back to the hands of people instead of people chasing after money infact wasting their day without no avail for employment opportunities. A better perspective and the success I found from my indepth research. More Info.",
