Preferably ban them altogether as they serve no useful crime prevention purpose or at least restrict their volume and cut the permitted duration to a maximum of five minutes; ban the use of motion sensors that mean alarms can be set off if, for example, a window is left open. Do not allow them to be set off by a power interruption.   ",
