        "additional_details": "In 2011 Nasa cancelled the Space shuttle program and now has no manned space programs. leaving the Russians with the only capability to get people into orbit, using rockets from the time of Sputnik.\r\n\r\nIt is at this time everyone looks to nasa and says when is the next program coming? Why don't we start a manned space program?\r\n\r\nBritain has launch capabilities, experienced British astronauts from missions with NASA and an already existing space agency but has not launched anything for nearly 50 years. We keep relying on others to make all the technological advancements for us whilst complaining that Britain doesn't make a good contribution any more.\r\n\r\na lot of you will say, but Britain cant support such a budget like NASA's.... But here is a little fact. in 2008 funding for NASA by the US Government was only 0.5% most of their budget came from private citizens and research grants from external sources. So it is indeed possible for Britain to run manned flights. ",
