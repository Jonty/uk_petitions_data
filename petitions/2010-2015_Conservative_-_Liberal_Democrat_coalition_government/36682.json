        "additional_details": "In July 2012 Wem town council BARRED the children of Stables Daycare, Wem, Shropshire from attending their allotment at Love Lane, Wem after 2 years of peaceful and educational gardening. This was done in the usual catch-all name of 'Health and Safety'. The government claim that they want kids to understand about food and live a healthy lifestyle and yet local councils make these ridiculous decisions.  Please sign this e-petition and make the government overturn this idiotic ruling.",
