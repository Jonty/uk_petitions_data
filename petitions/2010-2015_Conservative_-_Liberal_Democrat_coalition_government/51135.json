        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that there should be women represented on our banknotes.\r\nWith the introduction of Churchill, there will be no female representation on our money. This is a travesty given the contribution of women to our society over the centuries.\r\n Where are the Pankhurst's or Bronte sisters? Why is Octavia Hill, without whom there would be no national trust, not on a note? From Virginia Woolf to Boudica, there are countless women who have made us who and what we are. It is beyond reason that half the population isn't represented on what amounts to a social document for us as well as being mere money.",
