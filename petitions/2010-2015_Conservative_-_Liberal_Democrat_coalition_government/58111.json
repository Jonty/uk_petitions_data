We call on the Department of Health to ensure that  health and social care professionals help people living with pain by asking about  their pain, measuring it, recording it, treating it  and managing  it at every opportunity.\r\nPeople in pain may find it difficult to talk about it when they are with a health or care professional. Patients should be asked whether they are in pain, and how it affects their daily living.  Pain should be measured and the results recorded  and included in a pain management plan which would include self management.\r\nIf asking about pain was as routine as taking a temperature or blood pressure people living with chronic pain could be helped routinely and regularly to manage  their pain and have it treated effectively.\r\n",
