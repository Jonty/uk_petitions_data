Many GPs have ended their contract and now only work as locums because they know they can demand more and more money for less work than they would have to do on an employment contract.  The current situation in medical services in the UK demands urgent, drastic action.  Anything less than conscription and deployment under military control will do nothing to remedy the situation.",
