        "additional_details": "A full-time student with the Open University is not eligible under current rules, for a maintenance grant, unlike other 'traditional' unversities that are.\r\n\r\nJust one example of this is a 3 year Mathematics degree (BSc) course with the OU is classed as part-time, whereas the same course with a 'traditional university' is classed as full-time. Both courses are full-time and over 3 years.\r\n\r\nNow pardon me but if this is not discrimination then I don't know what is. This kind of behaviour would (quite rightly) be unacceptable in other walks of life so why should it be OK within education circles?\r\n\r\nNow here comes the paradox - if one is not in work but is in full time education one gets a Maintenance grant and not JSA unless one is doing a full-time OU course where one gets neither!\r\n\r\n",
