There is no point voting someone when nothing promised is implemented or worst, completely opposite to what was promised (like in a coalition).\r\n\r\nThe law (if passed) should have provisions for\r\n\u2022\u201cmandatory\u201d points in the manifesto which should be implemented unaltered if the party rules as a majority\r\n\u2022some \u201cnon-mandatory points\u201d as a rough percentage possibility on challenging ones\r\n\u2022\u201cothers\u201d which can be compromised in a coalition.\r\n\r\nWhere mandatory points are not implemented (details should be worked out), or ruling party makes a U-turn on key ones, then the party members should resign and new elections should be called for.\r\n",
