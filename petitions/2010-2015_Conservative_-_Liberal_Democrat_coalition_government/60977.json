        "additional_details": "The failure of the insurers to provide cover on affordable terms is creating distress and imposing financial burdens on individuals and communities at a time when they are at their most vulnerable. A proper investigation and debate between the insurers, government and representatives of the consumers should be held in public and lead the way to a comprehensive debate as to the fair distribution of  risk-of- last- resort and the prevention of insurance ostracism.\r\n\r\nA parliamentary commission of enquiry should be set up to seek the best way to deal with the wide insurance implications of climate change to ensure no one  feels isolated by red-lining of areas of the country who are at risk from inundation.\r\nOne objective of the commission could be  create an independent body, made up of all parties, to arbitrate on individual and class concerns and issues, as they arise.\r\n",
