        "additional_details": "Leap years fall every 4 years. There are no bank holidays between New Year's Day and Good Friday. Therefore, it seems only just and fair that an additional bank holiday is included in our calendars every 4 years.\r\n\r\n29th February bank holiday would boost moral and provide an invaluable opportunity for retailers to exploit this bank holiday with special offers acting as an extension of the January sales, further boosting a recovering economy.\r\n\r\nThe Government stated in 2008 that it had no plans to change the current pattern of bank holidays but that it would consider all suggestions carefully. As we enter a leap year, surely there is no more appropriate time to consider this issue.",
