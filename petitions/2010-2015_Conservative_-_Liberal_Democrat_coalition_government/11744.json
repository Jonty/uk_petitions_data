        "additional_details": "In the United Kingdom their is currently very little policy to protect Transgendered people in the Work Place from being fired etc. hence the policy of the NHS placing transgendered people under the mental health section in order to give them equal rights and thus protecting them in the work place along with outside of work.\r\n\r\nTherefore this petition is for increased rights for the transgendered community as a whole including better education for doctors in the NHS in order for them to aid transgendered people more effectively and correctly.",
