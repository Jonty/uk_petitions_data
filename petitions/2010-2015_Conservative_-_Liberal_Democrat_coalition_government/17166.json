However in reality  export funding has been cut, and yet Governments intention is to still improve SME exports from one in five, to one in 4 companies, with this reduced assistance, how!  There are a massive amount of small SME's in the UK that could get into export markets given just a little help to make the first steps, and some joined up thinking from industry experts withing the relevant market sectors to help qualify potential successful new to export business's.  There is no immediate fix to gaining exports, it takes time, and there is no better time for Government to start helping than now.  Currencies are still on our side, and market conditions are to a degree irrelevant as any new exporter has 100% of the export market to go for.",
