        "additional_details": "Many people, including myself feel the baby pool is open to abuse from outsiders in the car park by not having the 'one way' tinted glass. The general response in the past from the leisure centre was that they would do nothing to rectify this.  An incident the other week, where I witnessed an older man being asked to leave the premises after staring through the glass at a baby and toddler lesson (whether innocent or not) after parents complained, once again heightened my awareness of this issue.\r\nReports have been made from other parents that they have seen 'odd men' staring in to the pool on more than one occasion.  The pool itself is only a couple of metres from the glass window at road level and anyone who wishes to abuse this openess can park their car and look freely in a descrete manner.  As a mother and previously qualified social worker, I am passionate about enforcing child protection measures.  Shouldn't we aim to protect these children, no matter what the cost?\r\n",
