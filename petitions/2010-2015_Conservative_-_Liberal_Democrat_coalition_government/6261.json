        "additional_details": "Too many Free-loaders are given free council housing and never work. If the points system was changed so that working people got more points then the Council would get an income from Rent money paid by these people when it housed them. This income could be then used to build more social housing.\r\n\r\nAlso people with Mortgages who have ended up in difficulty should be given more points when applying for Council Housing.\r\n\r\nSingle Mums should all be housed in Hostels with facilities to look after their children so they can then work.",
