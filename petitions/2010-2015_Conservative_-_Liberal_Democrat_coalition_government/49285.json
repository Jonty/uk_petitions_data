        "additional_details": "The proposed route for the High Speed rail link (HS2) between London and the North has been published. It shows the rail line passing very close to Leigh.\r\nTransport for Leigh (www.transportforleigh.org.uk), a community interest group, believe this provides an excellent opportunity for the re-instatement of a rail link serving the North West region by way of a new interchange located in our area.\r\nThis new station proposal will bring considerable investment, jobs, economic growth and increased mobility.\r\nThe closure of the four stations serving Leigh (Lancs) in the 1950s and 60s has left the town, the site of one of the first passenger railways (Leigh - Bolton C.1831), without a rail link.\r\nWe urge the government to consider the reinstatement of a rail link for the town as soon as possible to allow it's future integration with HS2 as a regional hub for the North West of England.",
