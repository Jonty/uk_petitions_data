The money would be voluntarily raised and, I would suggest, the lottery would be guaranteed to be successful.\r\nThe people simply could not lose as everyone becomes a winner, the taxpayer by not having to separately fund the entire care program, and the people taking part by the chance of winning the jackpot, as is the case today, and knowing that if they do not, they would benefit in later life if unlucky enough to require long term care without the unacceptable need to sell their well earned assets.\r\nEverybody wins.\r\nThe people should be given the opportunity to decide whether they would rather feather the nests of vested interests or subscribe to a no lose \"insurance policy\" to provide for their future.
