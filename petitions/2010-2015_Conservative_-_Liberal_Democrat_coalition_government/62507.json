        "additional_details": "Rather than provide HS2 which only the wealthy will be able to afford, we need to upgrade the existing train network, so that the benefits are more evenly spread around the UK.  HS2 isn't just not good value for money, it won't carry freight, will damage much of our greenbelt and the towns and villages it passes through will be 60 miles from a station.  The time saving doesn't justify the cost and video conferencing and moving jobs out of London to other provincial cities would be more viable option.",
