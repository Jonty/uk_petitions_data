        "action": "Abolish Fuel Duty, Recoup via Alcohol and Tobacco",
        "additional_details": "This is a call to abolish fuel duty, double profits for the fuel retailer and recoup costs by increasing the cost of alcohol and tobacco.\r\n\r\nAllowing for varying fuel prices, fuel is currently around 60p a litre, retailers make around 5p which we believe should be doubled.  We already pay VAT, there should be no further taxation.\r\n\r\nFuel is a necessity for this country to keep running, not just the casual motorist but the haulage firms delivering our everyday products that have to hike up prices to supplement the rise in delivery costs.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and Tobacco are not necessities, people would be happier spending for example, 50p per unit more for alcohol and \u00a31 more for a packet of cigarettes if it means the price of fuel dramatically drops, and stays there.\r\n\r\nIn short we are suggesting the scrapping of fuel duty allowing fuel prices to rise and fall with oil prices and increasing the prices of alcohol and tobacco to compensate even to levels around those suggested above.",
