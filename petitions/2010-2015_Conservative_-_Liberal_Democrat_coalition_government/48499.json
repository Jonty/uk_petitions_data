        "additional_details": "I object to Mrs Thatcher having a ceremonial funeral paid for in part by the state. A ceremonial funeral is a matter of public interest and thus makes this lady's death into a symbolic public event rather than a matter of private grief for her family. As such I feel it is appropriate to register that in these times of austerity it is inappropriate to spend what may prove to be millions of pounds of public money in this way. Politicians are representatives of particular political points of view which are not shared by everyone in the nation by any means and are therefore inappropriate recipients of this sort of ceremonial funeral.",
