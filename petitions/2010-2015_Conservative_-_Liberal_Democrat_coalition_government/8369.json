        "additional_details": "Given the recent event of unrest amoungst youths who seem to have no ambition other than release a rage upon their own communities, I propose that National Service be re-introduced to our nation to educate and give purpose to these young people.  I propose that youths between the ages of 17 to 20 who are not in higher education or further education should be placed in a National Service Scheme to educate these young people to respect the land we live in, to be proud of the land we live in and to protect the land we live in.  Their energies, anger, rage and unrest can be chanelled into something more productive and helpfull to our country.",
