        "additional_details": "I propose we force all HGV's at Dover with destinations of Wales, Ireland and Scotland to be transferred to Rail in transporters similar in design to the Chunnel Freight cars.  The HGV would be unloaded at rail terminals near destinations and charges relative to fuel charges.\r\n\r\nThis is proposed to remove thousands of HGV's from English roads and reduce CO2 usage on slow moving haulage.  The alternative benefit of Drivers would have at least 3 hours rest in the UK,\r\n\r\nThe Government would be asked to setup teh scheme with Private investment and enforce compliance of the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
