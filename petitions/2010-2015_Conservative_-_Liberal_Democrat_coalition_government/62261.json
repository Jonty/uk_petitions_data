        "additional_details": "I believe that a Young Lord Mayor would be an advocate for young people, it would be a positive representation for young people and encourage young adults to participate in the democratic process. In the media today youths are constantly being demonised and being targeted for inadequate reasons. I want a Young Lord Mayor to combat the perception of young adults as irresponsible and not interested in politics. I believe in a democracy, no matter what age you are, you should have something valuable to contribute to society.",
