A \u00a3963,000 bonus in shares awarded to Royal Bank of Scotland boss Stephen Hester is the icing on the cake. RBS is effectively a public owed company and therefore that is nearly one million pound of tax payers money going to line his pocket. Please just ask yourself how many families living in poverty that sum would help.",
