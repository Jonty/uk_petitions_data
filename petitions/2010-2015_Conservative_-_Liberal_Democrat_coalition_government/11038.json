        "additional_details": "In order that all convicted rioters are treated equally irrespective of race, religion, class and wealth those who are accommodated privately will lose access to public environmental services such as bin removal.\r\n\r\nMany of the convicted rioters have been shown not to be on benefits but employed and relatively wealthy. It would seem that these people are only being punished once compared to those who are on benefits, who are sentenced and then might also have benefits removed. This petition requests that ALL rioters are punished\r\nequally by withdrawing public environmental services, such as bin removal etc, from those convicted of rioting, irrespective of their socio-economic status.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that government withdraws environmental services, such as bin removal, from the addresses of ALL convicted rioters.\r\n",
