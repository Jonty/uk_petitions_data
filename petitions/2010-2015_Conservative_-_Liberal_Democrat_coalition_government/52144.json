This nightmare could come true if we don't stop the governments reform plans concerning the NHS. By the time the next generation are old, we might not have our treasured NHS to lean on.\r\n\r\nThe value of the NHS is immense and cannot be mirrored by the private sector. It must be kept in public hands, serving the interests of all patients and the broader public, not the private healthcare industry.\r\n\r\nIllness should never be exploited for money.\r\n\r\nKEEP OUR NHS PUBLIC.",
