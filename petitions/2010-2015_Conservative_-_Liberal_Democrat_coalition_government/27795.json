        "additional_details": "Since 1998, former Latvian SS have every year on the 16 March been marching in the capital city of Riga to commemorate their fallen colleagues who they perceive as war heroes.   The marches have over the years increased in alarming numbers and are now even condoned by Latvian officials. On March 16, 2011 in the heart of Nato in Riga, more than 2,500 people, amongst them Latvian politicians, paid tribute  to Latvians who fought on the side of Nazi Germany in Waffen SS detachments during World War II. Latvian Prime Minister told local media he did not think March 16 had \u201ca special significance.\u201d Legionnaires\u2019 Day is used by radicals on both sides \u201cto confront each other\u201d. However, this petition believes Latvia, the international community, the UK government, the European Union and Nato should condemn the Nazi event in clearer terms as Waffen SS veterans are not seen as legitimate \u201cheroes\u201d in any EU member state which Latvia has been granted status since 2004.
