        "additional_details": "Please consider following changes for car insurance:\r\n\r\n1. You need to declare last 3 years fault/non-fault accident claims while buying car insurance. Insurance companies say that as per some stats, a person is more likely to be involved in an accident if they have had any accidents in the past and in many accidents, there is a fault ratio involved.\r\n\r\nWe believe that such stats cannot be applied to every accident. Ex: If someone has been hit on the back of their car while they were stationary/moving in traffic or parked in parking bay, how they could become more prone to accidents in future?\r\n\r\nCurrently, they are still penalized by increased premium for next 3 years due to non-fault accident claim.\r\n\r\nTo avoid such situations, either non-fault claim declaration should not be mandatory while buying car insurance or a process should be defined to calculate fault ratio.\r\n\r\n2. Insurance companies should be required to provide a breakdown of premium calculation in insurance quote.",
