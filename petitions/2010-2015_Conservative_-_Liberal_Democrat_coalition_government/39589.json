        "additional_details": "Not to Cap Immigration but to stop illegal immigration all together, by using stronger more powerful ways to not allow illegal immigration in the UK. Firstly stopping other EU country's letting them slip through their border checks into the UK. Secondly getting our RAF to also work abroad with the other country's border patrol to insure that no one gets in to the UK illegally, making the Royal Navy Guard our seas and to insure that no illegal immigrants manage to get through buy legal/illegal passage, finally getting our Army to get and send back illegal immigrants that have fallen through the net into the UK. Also to get more powers back to the UK form the EU in dealing with Illegal immigrants.  ",
