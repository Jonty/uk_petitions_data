        "additional_details": "In 2011, over 1 million cars checked by HPI had a mileage discrepancy. The Office of Fair Trading\u2019s report into the used car market believes this could mean consumers are overpaying on vehicles by \u00a3580 million per year.\r\nContributing to the problem are \u2018mileage correction\u2019 companies, offering their services to \u2018correct\u2019 \u2013 or alter \u2013 a vehicle\u2019s mileage.  Whilst altering a car\u2019s mileage is not illegal, it is illegal not to declare a mileage change to a potential buyer, sadly a common practice used by unscrupulous sellers.\r\nThe OFT\u2019s investigation into the practices of mileage correction firms, found there were very few legitimate reasons to alter a vehicle\u2019s mileage and called for such companies to be regulated or even banned. However, there are still more than 50 active companies of this type in the UK. In support of the OFT\u2019s recommendations HPI is calling for the Government to bring in legislation to outlaw mileage correction businesses and better protect the used car buying public.",
