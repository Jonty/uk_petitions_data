        "additional_details": "We all know someone who has a violent ex. Did you know if they have a joint tenancy and leave with out signing their half over, they can legally gain access to the property at any time. You can get a court order and solicitor which is costly, and the council can agree to end the joint tenancy, but in most cases this doesn't happen because of expenses. Which leaves many valuable women, men and children living in fear of the violent ex. This petition is for all that have suffered domestic abuse. If a violent ex has not been living in the property for 6 months or more and there is proof of this and the violence then surely there name should be automatically taken off.",
