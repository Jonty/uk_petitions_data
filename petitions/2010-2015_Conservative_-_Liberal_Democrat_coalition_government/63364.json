        "additional_details": "I do not support a blanket ban on electronic cigarette\u2019s in night clubs or pubs which do not admit children / families and especially places of work where children are not present because I feel this will push e-cigarette smokers outside with the smokers of conventional cigarettes where they are more likely to be seen by passing children / youngsters.\r\n\r\nI do however support a ban of the use of e-cigarettes inside shopping centres, cafe\u2019s and public houses where children may be present and also on all public transport systems and it is my hope that the government approach legislating on the use of electronic cigarettes differently to the approach used on the ban on conventional cigarettes as the two are distinctly different.",
