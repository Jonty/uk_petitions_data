        "additional_details": "The Woodhead rail route was a state-of-the-art 20th century electrified line with modern tunnels crossing the Pennines. It provided a much faster link between South Yorkshire and the Manchester area than the current inadequate Hope Valley line, which usually only has fairly crowded slow commuter trains. It was a mistake to close the line, and its reopening should relieve traffic pressure, especially in view of the frequent congestion in the Hollingworth area where there is a campaign to construct a bypass, since the railway could carry both passenger and freight traffic.
