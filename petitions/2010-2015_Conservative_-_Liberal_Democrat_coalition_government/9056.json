        "additional_details": "One simple step to deter potential criminals would be to ban the wearing of hoodies altogether. There are other ways of practically shielding our heads against rain and cold, and when not receiving hugs the garments can be used as both a form of intimidation and as a way of retaining anonymity by a portion of their users. As demonstrated again in the disgraceful scenes witnessed this week youths in particular have exploited this liberty, or indeed been turned to crime because they were already wearing the means to protect their identities. Banning them is one simple measure to prevent this happening again and to make our streets a more pleasant place to be.",
