        "additional_details": "The Electric Guitar has been in decline for the last 10 years and as a way to increase the interest in Electric Guitars a minimum of a 10 second guitar solo in all pop songs will help to raise the awareness of the electric guitar.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, with the introduction of reality TV music shows towards singers, the BAND is being left behind.\r\n\r\nThere has been an upsurge in sales of acoustic guitars due to the recent singer song writers being shown on the above mentioned reality shows.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a minimum of a 10 second guitar solo will bring people of all ages back to an interest in musical instruments and show people how music is made.\r\n\r\nA huge number of songs already produced in the 80's and 90's have the solo, from Michael Jackson to Take That and bands like Supergrass, Pulp, Oasis and Blur created huge sales of singles and albums, more so than the current singers that are being pushed to the top of the charts by producers like Simon Cowel.",
