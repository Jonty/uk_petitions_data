We believe it is a violation of the most elementary democratic principles for the UK government to reallocate the sovereignty which we have devolved to it without first obtaining our unambiguous permission to do so.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, do not recognise the legitimacy of successive governments\u2019 gradual reallocation of our sovereignty from the UK parliament to the European Union, precisely because we have never granted any such unambiguous permission.\r\n\r\nTherefore we, the undersigned, demand a referendum to determine the democratic legitimacy of the UK\u2019s present relationship with the EU. Further, we pledge to continue to lobby the government until this referendum is granted.",
