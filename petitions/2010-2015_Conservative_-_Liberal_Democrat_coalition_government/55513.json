        "additional_details": "The recent Serious Case Reviews into child deaths highlights that a high number of cases involve adults who are of child bearing age.  Whereas some cases involve long term prison sentences depending on the case, some carry sentences for manslaughter for the persons found responsible for the child's death.  These sentences mean that subject to suitability for parole conditions, some offenders may be released at an age where they could go on to mother or father another child.  The likelihood of this event is the child being taken into care from birth.  This places extreme burden on the state, and is completely unfair on the child.  Stopping these persons from procreating is a both fair and humane to themselves and society as a whole.",
