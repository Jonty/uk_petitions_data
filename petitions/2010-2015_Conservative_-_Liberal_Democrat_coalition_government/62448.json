These British \u2018Holy Innocents\u2019, loves their family and hate to see them suffer. They cannot believe what the Home Office/the Government/Britain is doing to them and their love ones. They are fast becoming teenagers and hating Britain \u2013 their own country. They are inadvertently being radicalised. Strict Immigration Rules have failed them. Britain has failed them. They are homeless. They have no money.  Although their family cannot be removed from the UK, yet majorities of them still have their immigration application pending at the Home Office year in year out.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned urge the Home Office henceforth to consider their applications in the same way as EEA-Nationals.",
