The following two types of petition must be ignored as they are wholly biased.\r\n\r\nThe first method being when someone stops you in the street. If you disagree with their petition statement then you are ignored. This is entirely undemocratic but at least this method is asking a relatively random sample of people and a minor tweak to include positive and negative responses would see a fairer petition.\r\n\r\nThe second method is this e-petition. This relies on people searching for something they believe should happen and signing it. This is even worse than the first method. Someone who wants to bring back capital punishment is far more likely to search for a petition to sign than someone wanting to keep the status quo. Why would someone look for a petition to keep things as they are?\r\n\r\nI am aware of the irony of this petition.",
