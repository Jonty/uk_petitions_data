        "additional_details": "In 2013 new EU regulations will come into force requiring all disabled people to give at least 36 hours notice of intention to travel on public transport (buses).  See the following press release: http://www.alliedmobility.com/disability_news/news.cfm/disabled-vehicles-transport-rights-eu.\r\n\r\nUK regulations already require drivers of accessible buses to operate the ramp and otherwise assist disabled passengers.  There is no requirement for disabled passengers to give any advance notice.  It is likely that many bus companies will simply refuse access to anyone who has not booked 36 hours ahead.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to persuade the Government to ensure that disabled people are not treated less favourably than we are now and to explain how the new regulations will be implemented.\r\n\r\n",
