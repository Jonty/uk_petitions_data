        "additional_details": "I am British but totally ashamed of my government's foreign policy in helping and even arming fascist terrorists in Syria. I am ashamed that my taxes are being used to fund these terrorist whose attrocities are beyond compehension. The UK government blames the legitimate Syrian government for attrocities which are time and time again proved to be the work of the foreign army of jihadists. Why is the UK government trying to further their fascist agenda? For example, the Houla massacre, initially blamed on the Syrians was in truth later proved to be the work of the foreign islamist terrorists.\r\n\r\nThere's no excuse for these attrocities funded by the UK in a foreign country. If this happened in London these attrocities would be rightly condemned!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
