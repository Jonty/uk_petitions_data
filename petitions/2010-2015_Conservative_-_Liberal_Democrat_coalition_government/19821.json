        "additional_details": "Government to investigate price Fixing.\r\nOn 20th October, 2011, The Football League (chaired by Greg Clarke) decided to go ahead with the implementation of EPPP (Elite Player Performance Plan).\r\nThis will mean in principal a selling club will be paid \u00a33,000 per year for every year of a player's development between the ages of nine and 11. The fee per year from 12 to 16 will depend on the selling club's academy status but ranges between \u00a312,500 and \u00a340,000.\r\nThe Premier League had threatened to withhold their current funding to the Football League's youth programme which equates to more than \u00a35million per season. \"\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe this is not in the interest of the majority of Football clubs and their fans. Nor, despite it's initial promise, will it be to the betterment of the National game. The result will be richer clubs pooling the best talent at the expense of poorer, smaller clubs.",
