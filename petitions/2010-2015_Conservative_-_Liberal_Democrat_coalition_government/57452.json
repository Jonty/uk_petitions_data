        "additional_details": "This petition is NOT fighting for rape videos to be legal. Please read this petition carefully.\r\n\r\nIn January possession of all simulated \u201crape\u201d porn will be punishable by 3 years in jail. Simulation means between two consensually agreeing adults, not actual rape itself.\r\n\r\nThis will have damaging implications; to say what people can and cannot fantasize about, to say what is right and wrong about a person's sexual preferences is not something we should expect in the world we live in today. It could even make people believe they are abnormal for having very normal fantasies. And if they are not carried out, safely at home online, then what could that lead to with low self-worth after believing they think 'criminal' thoughts?\r\n\r\nIf this goes ahead, what next? A ban on particular adult toys, all films and books with violent rape scenes in? This is an unnecessary intrusion into our most private area of life and must be stopped to preserve free will and thought in society.",
