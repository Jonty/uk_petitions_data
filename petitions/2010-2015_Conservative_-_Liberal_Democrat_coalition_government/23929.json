The human population explosion over the last 200 years has lead to more inequality and poverty and decimated other species  for our short-sighted personal gain. We urgently need drastic population control measures in the UK and worldwide. Widespread education about our individual impact on the world by our consumer and lifestyle choices is essential. Please also consider these suggestions ; vasectomy for males with 1 or more children, state benefit/credits given for first child only and to receive any benefits a rolling 5 year contraception implant required, IVF no longer on NHS, financial incentives for childless individuals. Yes, a couple of generations of the population would have to live with these harsh decisions to allow a reduction in population to a sustainable level. However, by making these difficult choices now, we will allow future generations to enjoy Life on Earth.",
