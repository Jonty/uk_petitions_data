        "additional_details": "In light of the reaction of a single YouTube video made by Anti-Islamists in California, such as protests and riots in Egypt, Pakistan and Libya, with several Middle Eastern US embassies being subjected to attack, I believe it's only reasonable for Anti-Islamist material, especially 'the Innocence of Muslims', be banned in the UK. If hateful, racist materials such like this can be produced, then it can only serve to worsen relations between Western and Middle-Eastern countries. No one extremist deserves to be able to have such a devastating effect on the global stage.",
