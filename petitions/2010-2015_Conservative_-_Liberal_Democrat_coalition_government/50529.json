They have committed a crime, could be a Terrorist,  Rapist or a Murderer but still here and we the Tax Payer pay for their comfort.\r\n\r\nReally in this day and age do we not have the technology to confirm they are guilty!\r\n\r\nIf they are then save the tax payer and give justice to those left behind.\r\n\r\nDeath not a Life sentence should be the answer and maybe, just maybe we can rest in our beds knowing they wont be let out in a few years time on Good Behavior to re offend, which has never really made sense to me, you can take a life, rape a baby but you can behave in prison and it's all forgotten, a pat on the back sent out and repeat offend - I thought we were an intelligent country A LIFE FOR A LIFE!!  Death to them too! Let's bring back the Death Penalty or at least let us the people Vote on it!",
