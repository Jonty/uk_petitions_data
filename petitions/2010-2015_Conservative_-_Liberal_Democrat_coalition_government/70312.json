        "additional_details": "I call upon Her Majesty's Government to issue members of parliament with pre-paid cards, loaded with a weekly amount not exceeding \u00a371.00. Members would use these to pay for their subsistence, stationery, public transport fares, and all other expenses incurred in the execution of their public duty.\r\nThe House of Commons restaurants and bars would no longer accept cash/credit cards. Any meals or drinks purchased in the House would be paid for using the card.\r\nThe card would not be credited while the House is in recess, or while the member in question is not available for debates and votes.\r\nThis measure would reduce a considerable amount of administration, and minimise the abuse of the expenses system.",
