Information including voters\u2019 driving licences, criminal records, energy use and even whether they use a bus pass could be shared under a radical blueprint to link up thousands of state databases used by schools, councils, police and civil servants.The proposals are likely to ignite privacy concerns if officials are granted unprecedented access to citizens\u2019 private data. It will also trigger fears that data could be lost, in the wake of a notorious error in 2007 that saw CDs carrying the child benefit records of 25 million people go missing in the post.\r\n",
