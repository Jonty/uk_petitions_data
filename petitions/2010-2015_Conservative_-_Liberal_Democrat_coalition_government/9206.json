        "additional_details": "It is time to bring in armed response. Police need to make use of plastic bullets and open fire on those who do not obey authority figures and on those engaging in criminal activities. Some people have lost their only source of income. Some people have had their home broken into. Some people are frightened for their lives. And some people have lost their loved ones. Harsh action needs to be taken against the people who choose to engage in criminal acts in order to protect our people, and our country! Police should be given permission to fire plastic bullets at looters if they fail to obey orders/warnings given police officers. One warning should be all these looters need to stop engaging in criminal acts, and if they choose to carry on, shots should be fired by the police.",
