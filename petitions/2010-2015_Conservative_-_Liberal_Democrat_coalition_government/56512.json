It should have 50 per cent of the legislative power.\r\nFurthermore the seats in House of Lords should be reduced to 100. These seats should be given to the elected parties in the general Elections by the percentage they have gained. They should have gained at least  0,7 per cent.\r\nE.g. the last general election: Conservatives would have 38 seats, LibDems 24 seats, Labour 30 seats and Others 8 seats.\r\n\r\nThe Government should reform the House of Lords now!",
