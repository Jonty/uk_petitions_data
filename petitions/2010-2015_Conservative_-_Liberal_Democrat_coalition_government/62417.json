        "additional_details": "The crime of animal abuse, dog fighting/baiting & cruelty doesn't receive enough justifiable punishment to the perpetrators. Today, 4 Northern Irish men were given only a 6 months jail sentence, suspended for 2 years, which makes no sense especially considering the crimes took place 2 years ago. Although during this time half of the criminals were under 18 they still pleaded guilty & police found video evidence of these extreme crimes. They are only banned from keeping animals for just 10 years. This is no deterrent or real justice. This is not enough punishment to mirror the severity of their crime. We need harsher punishments for animal abusers, especially with training dogs for blood sports. These people are evil criminals torturing innocent animals for their own vile twisted 'entertainment' and are literally getting away with murder. I'm shocked at Britain's so called 'justice' for these serious criminal acts.",
