        "additional_details": "On Thursday 28th June 2012, David Beckham revealed that he was not selected for TeamGB in the London 2012 Olympics, despite being an ambassador for the games and continuing to be a favourite amongst the public.\r\n\r\nInstead a player was chosen in front of David Beckham to represent TeamGB who has shown a lack of pride behind his nationality already by declining to participate in the recent Euro 2012 tournament.\r\n\r\nI support David Beckham's cause and would like to see him playing and possibly even captaining TeamGB at the Olympics. Beckham is a great player and man, shows respect, supports our team, is honourable, will work wonders on and off the pitch and should be included in Stuart Pearce's squad.\r\n\r\n",
