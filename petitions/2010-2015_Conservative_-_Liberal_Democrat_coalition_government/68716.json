In many situations, commuters are required to pay large sums of money for their journey of which is often delayed or disrupted, as well as the fact they may be forced to stand throughout the duration of their trip.\r\nIt is therefore proposed that government action is taken in order to prevent commuters paying ludicrous amounts of money for a generally poor rail service throughout the country. Not only should the most recent proposals for increasing rail fares be abolished, it should also be recognized that current users of the rail network within the country are forced to pay too much for the current service and therefore negotiation should be made to decrease current rail fares.\r\n\r\nTake a stand against over priced public transport.",
