        "additional_details": " Ofsted found that Stoke-on-Trent Children's Services were using Care Orders as \"a first,rather than a last resort\" to break up families,contrary to the Children Act.\r\n The department was put into Special Measures for several years,but removed prematurely by the council on cost grounds.\r\n No attempt has been made to identify the wronged families,no explanation or apology has ever been issued.In some cases children were removed for years on the grounds that their mums and dads \"might at some future time show a lack of deference to Stoke social services\".It's to be feared that pubescent and pre-pubescent children were being targeted by the department for abuse.\r\n Some disabled children were still in institutions post-18,the council working through the Court of Protection to try to retain them in units for life.\r\n It is time for an accounting,not least to deter those who would seek to carry out these policies today.
