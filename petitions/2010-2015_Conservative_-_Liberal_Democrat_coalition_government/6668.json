        "additional_details": "Currently, the UK's drugs laws are managed by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 which primarily concerns the use, and selling of, what are considered controlled substances as per the Act. This petition proposes the repeal of this Act and in its place a total rethinking on drugs.\r\n\r\nThe recreational use drugs is a choice made by an individual person. It is true that these drugs are dangerous and are addictive to varying degrees.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no convincing evidence to suggest that the illegality of these drugs reduces the usage, yet there is a convincing argument to be made that the illegality would actually prevent some individuals from seeking rehabilitative help for their addictions.\r\n\r\nThose who sign this petition favour the criminalising of the drug dealers, and not the users.",
