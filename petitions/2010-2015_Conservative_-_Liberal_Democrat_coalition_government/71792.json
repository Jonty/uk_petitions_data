        "additional_details": "This year has been worse than ever before for the letting off of fireworks. It is now 9 November and firework \"parties\" have been held every night since 29 October in my area! There seems to be a competition for who can have the loudest fireworks. Animals are terrified as well as many children and adults.\r\n\r\nCan there not be:\r\n\r\n1) a restriction on the sale of these very loud fireworks? Only to permit holders such as councils and responsible organisations? Some other countries ban the private use of fireworks altogether.\r\n\r\n2) Heath and Safety legislation to guard against misuse of fireworks. Each year they are becoming bigger and more powerful. The explosions themselves must cause a risk to hearing\r\n\r\n3) a time limit to the use of fireworks around specific dates? Bonfire Night now stretches to at least 10 days. Can this not be reduced?\r\n\r\nPlease consider legislation concerning the type and use of fireworks, as well as strict time frames for their use\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
