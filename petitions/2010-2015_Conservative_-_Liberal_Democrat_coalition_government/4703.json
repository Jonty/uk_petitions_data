        "additional_details": "I want the government to stop, aid we give to other countries, most of these countries, either spend the money on their armed forces, or this money is lost to corruption.\r\n\r\nOnly part of the money goes where it is meant to go. Governments who rely on our money, are effectively mooching of us, relying on our money to feed their economy and not making an effort to grow since, they get lots of aid. One example of corruption is Pakistan, where most of the aid goes to the corrupt officials.  The 7.8 billion budget for Aid, could be used to bolster projects within our OWN country. One example, is the amount of children, living in poverty in the UK. Help our country grow strong before making other countries better.\r\n\r\nMinisters and the PM were elected to make this country better, why not start by stopping aid and using that money to help our own country?\r\n",
