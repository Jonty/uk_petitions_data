        "additional_details": "During the past 24 months Finding the Forgotten have been responsible for gaining the commemorations for 12 servicemen whose deaths were caused due to there service for their country in the Great War. They will now receive the recognition they deserve and will be listed among the dead with the CWGC.\r\nFrom our research we are currently working on a further 60 cases and estimate that for every town in the country 5 to 10 service personnel who gave their lives in the conflict remain forgotten.\r\nWhile our culture, arts and heritage are funded and millions of pounds are available in grants, nothing is available for the forgotten.\r\n\r\nDuring the next four years of the centenary of the Great War it would be a fitting time to commemorate the forgotten. The cost is far less that many projects and museum galleries that are funded at present.\r\nPlease sign this petition to ask the government to commemorate the forgotten, it is a shame they have been forgotten for so long.\r\n\r\n",
