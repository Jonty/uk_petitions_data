        "action": "No to free schools",
        "additional_details": "Michael Gove is wanting to introduce the 'free school' idea whereby anyone can run a school including, parents, businesses, religious groups etc. Within these free schools there is no requirement for fully qualified teaching staff. He also promises that free schools will scrap the traditional school year and even teach on Saturdays. There is no real evidence that this will raise attainment of pupils. This proposterous proposal sends a message to all university students, graduates, teachers, support staff and headteachers that have trained or are training to work in the education sector - you're training and hard work is of no importance to this government thus allowing un-qualified people to run schools. This then is contradicted by the stiff changes in performance management within schools. So I ask this Mr Gove, do you want highly skilled, motivated teachers and staff or are you willing to let any Tom, Dick or Harry teach our future generations?",
