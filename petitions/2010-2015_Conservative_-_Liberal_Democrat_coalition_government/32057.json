        "additional_details": "We urge The Department for Transport and The Highways Agency to downgrade dangerous lay-bys to \"Emergency Stopping Only,\" on the A14 and on similar dual carriage-ways nationwide.\r\n\r\nThese shallow, unprotected lay-bys built in the 60s and 70s do no meet current safety standards. Restricting their use will prevent HGVs parking over night, dangerous parking and save lives.\r\n\r\nSafe road design will cut road deaths by one third. 10,000  deaths and serious injuries cost \u00a36 billion a year.\r\n\r\nThe number one priority for The Department for Transport and The Highways Agency should be to public safety on our roads.\r\n",
