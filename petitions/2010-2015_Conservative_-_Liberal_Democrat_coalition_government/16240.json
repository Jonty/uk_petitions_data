It is very possible in the heat of the moment if someone breaks into your home you panic, as you realise \"what can I actually do to defend myself that won't make me a criminal\" I say these thoughts should not be going through the mind of someone who could have themselves or their families harmed by this person.\r\n\r\nI would like to know, 100%, what can I do to ensure my safety, and the safety of others within my home, if I take a knife out of my cutlery draw and defend myself with it, the police could turn round and say \"you used that as a weapon, it was not self defence, you are guilty of GBH\". This will potentially destroy peoples lives, any hope of a career with a criminal record and destroy peoples faith in the justice system within this country. ",
