We would like the Government to support application 483656 to English Heritage for \u2018Listed\u2019 status to be given to the existing Quay Street set and thus protect it from demolition. Sign this petition to help create a platform within the House of Commons for this to be discussed, and to help the Government understand the true importance this set has for Manchester and The North of England and the whole world.\r\n\r\nThe set is currently unprotected as a historical and cultural asset to both the city and the country. Within 12 various masterplans currently proposed for the site, there has been NO attempt to incorporate the old Coronation Street set in ANY of the submissions, thus implying an intent to demolish. The fa\u00e7ade is of international importance and it is arguably the most recognisable street in the world. Too much of Manchester's heritage has already been lost over the last few decades.\r\n\r\n#savethestreet",
