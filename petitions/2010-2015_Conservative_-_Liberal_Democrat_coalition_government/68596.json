        "additional_details": "To show the UK Cycle Industry, that recording Cycle Serial numbers at Point of Sale and allowing a record to be searched for by Police would be an Added Value benefit for the UK Consumer. It would be able to enhance the customer service and reduce the frustration of un-registered stolen recovered bikes lying unclaimed in their thousands in Police property stores. Two major High Street Retailers do not record these details on any system. The situation of the amount that Insurance companies are having to pay out on these claims is quite ridiculous and could be massively reduced with a pro active approach to this under reported crime. There is the opportunity to reduce the Financial incentive of Cycle crime by making this property have an Identity or Registration.",
