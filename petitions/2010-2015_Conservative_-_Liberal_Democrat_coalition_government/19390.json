        "additional_details": "Both the Sri Lankan government and the opposition Tamil Tigers reportedly committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights abuses during the war in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan government has a poor record of effectively investigating violations by its forces, as documented by Amnesty International. An international investigation into the crimes and abuses committed by both sides during the war is needed if the victims are to receive justice. The U.K. government should publicly support such an international investigation as a first step toward achieving accountability in Sri Lanka for these crimes and abuses.",
