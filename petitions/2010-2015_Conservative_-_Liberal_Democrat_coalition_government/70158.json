        "additional_details": "Children and young people with the lifelong disability of autism and co-morbid mental health issues often benefit massively in terms of life quality and development of independence, when they receive one-to-one help of a canine buddy.  The charities who provide these dogs have very limited resources.  Waiting lists are \"closed\" due to numbers required or age restrictions mean many fail to \"qualify\". This has led to private companies setting up unregistered organisations at vast expense to families who consider buying an assistance dog that is NOT registered with any of the UK recognised bodies.\r\n\r\nI am petitioning for Autism Pet Helper dog training, registration & recognition ALLOWING access to public places.  An owned pet, assessed/trained by a recognised body & registered.  There is little point in training any pet to assist, if it must be tethered outside a building and not be able to attend the disabled owner.  ",
