        "additional_details": "We need a cycle path next to the A2. If there is no room for it then there could be one what is going to the same destinations. It is not safe at all, too many lorrys, too many cars pulling out of drives without looking. Pedestrians get in the way if you cycle slow on the pavement. There is just so much to it. To us cyclists we call it death road. Would you like someone to die on your main route into and out of Sittingbourne? ",
