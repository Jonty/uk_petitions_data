        "additional_details": "In order to improve the poor service that national rail is providing I suggests two measures:\r\n\r\n- Pass a law where nobody or a very small percentage of passengers can be stand up, so the train companies have to estimate the number of passengers and increase the number of coaches in the overcrowded trains. The regulator should send secret inspectors and fine companies with the equivalent to a quarter of their profits or after several warnings, cancel the contract with that company\r\n\r\n- The trains should have a machine where you validate your ticket when you get into the train and at your final station. If your train has been delayed (rules should be established depending on the length of the journey), you could claim your money back. That would stop the constant \"apologies\" from the companies and they would have finally to improve their services. Rules for rail works should be also established to reduce the ticket price for your journey. ",
