The trains would be built by British workers who made the steel themselves. NO CONTRACTING TO FOREIGN COMPANIES. Make it 100% British built. We have the manpower, the knowledge, the systems in place. Dust them off and get Britain building again. A national works prgramme which trains people gives them something to work together towards. Puts pride back in being British.",
