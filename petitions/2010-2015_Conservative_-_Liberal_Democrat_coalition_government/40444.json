We have just seen yet another programme where the driver of a BMW gets fined \u00a3100 for driving without insurance!! I would love to pay \u00a3100 for  insurance. Hows this  for an idea? Anyone caught driving  without insurance gets their details entered into three insurance comparison websites, take the average of all three and multiply by ten? doesn`t sound unreasonable does it??........lets get this idea going to the government and save honest insurance payers some cash!!!",
