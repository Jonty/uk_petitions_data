        "additional_details": "Films are certified and often restricted for appropriate audiences, however music with strong or explicit content only have to contain warning labels and they can be sold to anyone.  This is not right especially as live comedy stand up shows can not be sold to people under 18 if it a video or DVD however ANYONE can buy an audio version of the same thing.  There is also a lot of explicit music with strong language, sexual references, drug references, violence, etc and they can be freely sold just because it is not visual however it can still be harmful and a very bad influence.  By restricting audiences this can be kerbed and discouraged.  ",
