As a politically active young person, I believe the law that restricts young people in having their say in politics and how our country is run, is not only outdated, but stifles our freedom of choice in who runs the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe are the generation of tomorrow and the youth of today. We are the one's who shape our future, not the privileged politicians of Westminster. Let us have a say before the 2015 General Election.",
