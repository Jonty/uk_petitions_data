        "additional_details": "The Criminal Justice Act (CJA) 2003 introduced the sentence of Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). Under the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012 the IPP was abolished. The government confirmed the situation as unsatisfactory and more recently Mr. David Blunkett stated that the Labour Government \u201cgot the implementation wrong\u201d. However, to date nothing has been implemented for those prisoners who are already serving this sentence. If changes are not made it will take 9 years to clear the backlog of those already beyond their minimum term. We demand an effective system in place that works. We are hereby requesting that the Secretary of State for Justice to  exercise their power to change the release test under  Section 128 of the LASPO Act. ",
