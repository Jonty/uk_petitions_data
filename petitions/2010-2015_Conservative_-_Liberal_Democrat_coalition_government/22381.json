        "additional_details": "Why does this Gov't, the FSA, the BOE and Banks ignore the Liars Loans fraud, the largest financial fraud in UK history? Conservative estimate is 70 Billion pounds worth of fraud.\r\n\r\nThey appear complicit in helping fraudsters benefit from low interest rates whilst screwing the much larger group of Savers who outnumber borrowers 6-1.\r\n\r\nCoalition has reneged on it's election promise to help Savers.\r\n\r\nThe FSA, BOE and Gov't have already been informed of these issues on numerous occasions.\r\n\r\nThe Gov't must investigate this fraud, and punish those lenders, their agents and the applicants and return applicants' saved interest to Savers.",
