        "additional_details": "What I propose is a very simple change to the rate at which Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is to be applied from a national to a regional rate that would would allow for the cost to be lower thus helping people to buy a house.\r\n\r\nI believe the SDLT or dreaded Stamp Duty rate should reflect the local housing prices in a region, leading to a fairer system.\r\n\r\nAn example of this would be a one house in Leicestershire worth \u00a3255,000 would be subject to a 2% SDLT, this same house in a different region e.g. London might be worth \u00a3755,000 thus attracting a 4% fee even though it is the same size and footprint. In my model this should not be the case and really should be 2% both in Leicestershire and London.\r\n\r\nWhilst I am not suggesting we play with market economics I am suggesting the government reflects the change in the regional price and balances the tax rate to help buyers.\r\n\r\nSO to sum up \u2013 no more national tax rates, change to a regional applied tax for SDLT\r\n\r\n",
