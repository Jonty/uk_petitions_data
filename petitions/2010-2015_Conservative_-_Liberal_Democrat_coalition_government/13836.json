        "additional_details": "If we took away the entitlement of EU nationals to all our available benefits, including the entitlement to Council housing we could save billions every year. I know many eastern europeans who now only come here for all the free money available to them, who wouldnt? If you are not a UK citizen you loose all these entitlments, only basic income support would be available to you. At the moment they are entitled to everything UK citizens are, Tax Credits, Working Tax Credit, Child Benefit, in these tough times I'm sure we would all agree we should be helping our own people in hardship not the whole of Europe as well.",
