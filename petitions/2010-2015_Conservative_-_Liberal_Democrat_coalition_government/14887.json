        "additional_details": "Stop all CRB checks where the job does not involve working with children/vulnerable people and others sensitive roles. Currently if you wish to work in a call centre selling clothes you can be asked for a CRB. This excludes people who are trying to rebuild law abiding lives from our society and is costly in terms of benefits. A Criminal Record should always be assumed to be a matter of a persons private life under Article 8. The employer must demonstrate a distinct and over riding requirment to carry out such checks. In that case the CRB check should only be able to enquire regarding relevent information. E.G. A bank could CRB check for fraud/theft but not asault.\r\n\r\nThis should be enshrined fully ion law and not left to the courts to determine each case on it's own merits. ",
