        "additional_details": "I believe that homophobia is a massive issue in the UK, children are brought up in a society that teaches gay or any of its variations as an insult, one that makes attacking people for their sexuality okay and one who's mentality must change and schools are the place to start. We have succeeded in the past by tackling major issues such as racism and sexism, it's time for another victory for social equality.\r\n\r\nthe only current laws on homophobia in schools is that the school has to \"deal\" with it. This may mean sever punishments or just talking to the perpetrator or victim.\r\nI suggest we add a mark in records for homophobic perpetrators, make it a necessity for the police to be involved, keep a record of names, work with the police and most importantly show those who commit these acts it's not acceptable by issuing them with severe punishments. 2 out of every 5 children who suffer homophobic bullying contemplate in suicide. We have proved it can be done and that it must be done.",
