        "additional_details": "Any person who's stepped in to Leading Pet Company shop has seen reason enough why the company should be shut down. Poor living conditions for the animals is speaking generously. This company does not treat their animals properly, sick puppies may sit in a kennel for days before having their illness taken seriously or even noticed and even longer until seen by a vet.\r\nThere has been numerous complaints yet nothing has been done:\r\n''This is an awful shop selling puppies bred in puppy farms as well as all sorts of other animals without any thought for their welfare. Please do not shop here. Every penny you spend keeps them open and enables them to continue abusing animals for profit.''\r\n''they had a adult boxer in a small cage that he couldnt turn around, and the mice had babies and it really stunk like not been cleaned out in ages. Dont think they care about animal welfare but rather make money dont understand why they are kept open?''",
