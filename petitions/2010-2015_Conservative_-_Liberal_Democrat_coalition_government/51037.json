Equally the working parents need the assistance of the tax credit system to be able to work and afford child care.This way the children would be looked after by adults who loved them and cherished them, and were genuinely interested in their welfare and development. The children,their parents and the grandparents would be more content, less stressed and guilt -free and the jobs the grandparent previously held would be freed up for the unemployed.\r\nA course on childcare could be taken if deemed necessary",
