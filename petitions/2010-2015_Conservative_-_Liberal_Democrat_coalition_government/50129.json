I propose we start re-foresting our land. This may even have a knock on effect for other countries to join us.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the planning laws are too tough. If a man or woman wants to put solar panels on his house it should be his or her right to do so. What is uglier? A solar panel or the floods and hurricanes caused by global warming. The government must relax the planning system dramatically to allow everyone from small homes to large energy companies to administer energy saving devices.\r\n\r\nIt's not too late, we can still stop global warming. We just have to act now.",
