Currently, the police have no powers to prosecute dog owners if their dog attacks somebody on private property, we want that changed as well as regulating breeding so they have a license and all dogs are registered and micro chipped. This would give police the power to intervene when dogs are badly trained and/or  unlicensed.  This will hopefully prevent further dog attacks as it is the dog owner, not the breed that is dangerous.
