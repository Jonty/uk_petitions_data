This is both unacceptable, unethical and grossly unfair on the people who watch and love Formula 1 and who do not have SkyTV.  Why should we have to pay a subscription to watch a sport which is sponsored by companies and when we already pay a license fee. Sign this petition and make your feelings heard with the Uk government.",
