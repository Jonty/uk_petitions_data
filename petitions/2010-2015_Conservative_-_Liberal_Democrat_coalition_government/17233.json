        "additional_details": "I believe the Government of the UK should take the necessary steps to complete the building of all half built houses and 'ghost' estates across the country. This would provide jobs for builders, plumbers, electricians etc and also provide affordable housing for first time buyers. It would move the housing sector forward and provide a huge boost to the economy as well as creating jobs.",
