        "action": "Ban Alcohol Advertising before at least 9pm",
        "additional_details": "I am shocked when i go to the cinema or are watching prime time television and alcohol advertising is happening. I do not think that in this day and age alchohol should be advertised before 9pm, especially when young children are watching the television. It does not teach children the health issues of eccessive alchohol consumption and should therefore at least be limited to only when adults are viewing television and not children, in perhaps the same way that swear words and nudity is shown: only after 9pm.\r\n\r\nplease sign this petition for the MPs to discuss and hopefully pass this motion.\r\n\r\nThankyou",
