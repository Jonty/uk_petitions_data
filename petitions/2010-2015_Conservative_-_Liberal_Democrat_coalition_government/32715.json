        "additional_details": "In the 2012 Budget the Chancellor proposed to cap the amount of personal tax reliefs. We simply ask George Osborne to remove charitable donations from this cap.\r\n\r\nIf the Budget proposal goes ahead it will be disastrous for many charities, whether large or small. Many rely for a significant proportion of their income on the generosity of a few large donors. Many donors have indicated that they will severely curtail their giving until the government comes to its senses. They are not trying to avoid tax, they are trying to assist the Big Society, and get no personal benefit from their generosity.\r\n\r\nThis misguided proposal has united the charity and philanthropic sectors as never before in condemnation. Their combined campaign has more details at www.GiveItBackGeorge.org.\r\n\r\nWith significantly fewer resources available, charities will have to cut back severely. The people who will suffer are some of the most disadvantaged in the UK. ",
