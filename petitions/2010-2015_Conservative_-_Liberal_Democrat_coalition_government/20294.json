        "additional_details": "If trained can a person aged 21 work more effectively than a person aged 18?\r\nNO\r\n\r\nCan you prove that a person aged 21 has more financial responsibilty than a person aged 18?\r\nNO\r\n\r\nDo you think it's fair that younger people get less money?\r\nNO\r\n\r\nIf you answered NO to all the above questions then do something about it. Sign this petition and show the Goverment we are willing to make a stand.\r\n\r\nThe National Minimum Wage should be the same for everyone over 18, the Government should change this.\r\n\r\nIt's giving teenagers fuel to recieve benefits. Jobseekers allowance states it is given to people who are seeking work. Seeking work?? Would you for \u00a34.98 an hour??\r\n\r\nThe main reason is because 18-20 year olds have less experience and more training needed. If two people got taken on with the same experience one was aged 20 and one aged 21. The elder of the two would recieve \u00a31.16 more an hour for doing the same job and have had the same training. Whats fair about that?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
