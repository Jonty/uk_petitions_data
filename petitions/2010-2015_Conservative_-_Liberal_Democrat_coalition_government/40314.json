        "additional_details": "As of the academic year 2009-2010, the rules on student funding for degree courses changed.\r\n\r\n\"You can\u2019t get a Tuition Fee Loan, Maintenance Loan or grant to study towards a qualification that is lower than one you\r\nalready hold. For instance, if you already have an honours degree but wish to return to college to study a Higher National\r\nDiploma (HND), you wouldn\u2019t get any financial support towards your tuition fees and living costs.\"\r\n\r\nMeaning that re-training via university if you already hold a degree is not an option unless you are prepared to pay the same rates as non-EU students do to study here!\r\n\r\nThis policy needs to be reversed as it closes options for people to train in developing sectors, and furthermore, is unfair to those who are not wealthy enough to afford to study again.",
