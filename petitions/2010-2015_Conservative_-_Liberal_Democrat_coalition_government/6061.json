        "additional_details": "Go to any supermarket and it\u2019s amazing just how many disabled parking spaces are being used up, but go in and try to find all these disabled people and you will be lucky to find one of them, that\u2019s because they are at home and someone else is using their blue badge and worst of all they genuinely believe they are entitled to do so, because they are confusing the rules about using a mobility car and the rules of where they can park it i.e. you can use the car for anything that benefits the badge holder but you can only park it in a disabled space if the badge holder is being picked up dropped off or both. I\u2019m not asking for big fines to be imposed on people or anything like that I just want the powers that be to make them more aware of these rules (a Government add campaign perhaps)\r\nPS   these parking spaces are to give disabled people more space to get in and out of the car not to get closer to the door. Please support the father of a disabled child. Thanks\r\n",
