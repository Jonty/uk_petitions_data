        "additional_details": "Over the past two years, we have seen the true crimes of  a man who we thought was doing good. Now, we know him as one of the most vile human beings to ever walk this earth. We find ourselves trying to make things right, after discovering that Savile's fundraising was done out of evil, rather than compassion.\r\n\r\nYes, compensations are being paid out to victims, and we are certainly on the right path to justice, but there is still one untouched pool of  money that must be sourced and redistributed; Savile's donations to the Tory party.\r\n\r\nThis money was undeserved, and should be given to the victims who have suffered at the hands of this monster. I call upon the Conservative's to declare all and any donations made by Jimmy Savile, and for that money to be donated to the NSPCC or where appropriate, to compensate for what has happened.",
