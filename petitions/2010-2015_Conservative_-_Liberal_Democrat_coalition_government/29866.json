Compliance with this requirement is likely to be enforced by fines for late or inaccurate returns.\r\n\r\nDue to the massively increased filing burden there should be a de-minimis level before any penalties are imposed.  This will allow employers to take a 7 day holiday, for instance and take account of the vagaries of internet connections across the country.\r\n\r\nA de-minimis level should be extremely generous until this new and stressful obligation has been tried and tested.",
