        "additional_details": "The government have decided to change the GCSE curriculum making our first entry to GCSE examinations count in our Schools performance table, which could potentially affect which college we get into if we get into one, and also university.Students will also not be able to re-sit individual modules, they must re-sit the full GCSE. Also because of the 3 year course change we are no longer able to take more subjects in which we would have liked to.In the long run it is a lot of pressure on us and its not fair. I would like the recipient to keep the GCSE curriculum the same as it was.",
