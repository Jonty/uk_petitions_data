        "additional_details": "Tag Along is campaigning to provide the city of Birmingham with designated areas for people to express their creativity through graffiti. We believe graffiti walls not only provide the city with large scale art, but also help to minimise vandalism within the area. We are targeting the area of Newtown as vandalism is a big problem there, however with your support we maybe be able to further our camping to other local councils. We at Tag Along want a clean but colourful city, so sign our e-petition to show your support.\r\n\r\nFollow us on Instagram and Twitter for more information: @tagalong_sys\r\nUse our hashtag #sprayyoursupport to connect with us.",
