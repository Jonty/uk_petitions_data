This is unashamedly a copy of a US epetition.\r\n\r\nIt has been presented to Google and TED.com. Videos below.\r\n\r\nLiquid-Fluoride Thorium Reactor (LFTR) has been proven by previous US research and operated for nearly 5 years (1965-1969).\r\n\r\nLFTR is PASSIVELY safe. During a loss of power or overheating, nuclear fuel is separated (passively) into non-critical holding tanks. It runs at low pressure compared to existing reactors.\r\n\r\nLFTR is CHEAP, proliferation adverse, and domestic.\r\n\r\nThorium has proven reserves of well over 1000 years of current world usage.\r\n\r\nThorium could produce power for the entire world at levels far beyond current production.\r\n\r\nImagine a world with nearly infinite power.\r\n\r\nwww.energyfromthorium.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://flibe-energy.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWUeBSoEnRk\r\n",
