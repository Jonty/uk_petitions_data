        "additional_details": "The Liberty Stadium park and ride is being occupied by travellers and as a result is closed to members of the public. The area is regularly covered in human excrement which they are discarding. Swansea council recently had to clear 54 tonnes of waste - more than four tonnes of recycled material and 106 tyres. The clean-up cost \u00a36,100. Also, Swansea council is being forced to pay \u00a390,000 for a toilet block next to their caravans, plus an additional \u00a330,000-a-year for a traveller liaison officer. They are illegally residing in the park and ride, they are stopping Swansea's tax payer's from utilising the facility and are increasingly costing Swansea Council thousands of pounds which should spent in other areas of the city.
