        "additional_details": "I'm asking you to sign this e-petition to try and reverse the funding cuts that are forcing hundreds of elderly people suffering from dementia out of their care homes,in total 18 out of 20 homes in Devon are being forced to close over the next 18 months.Through no  fault of their own these pensioners are to be uprooted from the place they feel safe and happy,continuity is all important to a dementia sufferer.This is an abuse of their human rights,many of these poor souls have no family to fight for them so we must help.By 2025 the numbers suffering from dementia are predicted to double so why are they closing the very places we need to care for them.This affects your family and mine so please sign this petition and try and get these cuts reversed before its to late.Thank you.",
