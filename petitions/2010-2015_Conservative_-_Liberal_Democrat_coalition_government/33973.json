        "additional_details": "We the undersigned agree that no local or national government body, or any organisation acting with the approval of any government body, should carry out, fund, or allow, any lethal measures to control Red Foxes (Vulpes vulpes) which live in urban areas.  They are not pests and should not be treated as such. They are entitled to live alongside us.  Local and national government has a duty to protect our treasured urban wildlife,  and all councils must rule out any kind of a cull immediately.\r\nThe Red Fox is a native species, which is harmless to humans and, as a predator, helps maintain a healthy food chain. Any effort to cull them would not only deprive us of the sight of a beautiful wild animal, but may have very damaging and unforseen ecological impacts.\r\nSay no to killing Red Foxes.",
