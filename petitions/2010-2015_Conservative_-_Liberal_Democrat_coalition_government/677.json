        "additional_details": "We want the government to prosecute those responsible for the despicable beatings and abuse of pigs at an abbattoir, which was filmed by an animal activist group.  To say the video is inadmissable due to contravening trepass laws is riduculous - such video evidence has brought about convictions in the past.  What if a child was filmed being beaten by a trespasser - would you prosecute then?  The message  your inaction is sending out to would-be animal abusers is that they will not be punished -  put this right.",
