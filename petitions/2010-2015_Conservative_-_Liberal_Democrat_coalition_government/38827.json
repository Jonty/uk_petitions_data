These systems fulfil these objectives with the clear exception of the Council Tax System.  The administers of this system are independent? they are not! Their Tribunal, does not take evidence on oath, nor produce a verbatim report. It is free to be cavalier with the facts that no court would countenance. It appoints a Chairman who acts as a prosecutor, judge and jury; and who manipulates the system to provide a verdict, careless of any reasoned assessment of the facts. The solution to this problem is Political. Clearly the solution is to abolish  this Tribunal system and to revise the Council Tax System to fulfil the above criteria",
