The Dealth Pentalty was removed in 1965 and since then the ultimate punishment has been a life sentence. However, a life sentence no longer means life; and many dangerous crimnals are being allowed back on the streets after a certain amount of years. We are campaigning for the life sentence to be changed so it actually means life and justice is served to those affected by horrendous crimes.\r\n\r\n",
