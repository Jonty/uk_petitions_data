We propose that the government ensures people are housed comfortable.\r\n\r\nAll factors, or excuses, such as money, law or policy, are no longer excusable as relevant reasons for malnutrition, poor diet and homelessness.\r\n\r\nLet us move towards a system that abolishes unnecessary suffering. It's possible, right now.\r\n\r\n",
