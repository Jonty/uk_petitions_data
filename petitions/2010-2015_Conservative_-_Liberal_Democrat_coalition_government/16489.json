Instead use this money to build, run, protect and maintain a London based communal living \u201ccourt of residence\u201d which is owned by the tax payer.\r\nEach MP who has a constituency outside of London is given a \u201ccomfortable\u201d apartment/flat which has exactly the same square footage as one another for each MP to reside in while attending parliament.\r\nThis space can be decorated and furnished to their tastes as long as the cost is justifiable, approved before purchase and that the flat/apartment is returned to its original state once their residency is no longer required. This allows a transparent and publicly viewable usage of the tax payer\u2019s money and should no longer allow flipping of homes, lavish expenditure on luxury items and a blatant waste of such a tight national budget.\r\nHaving the tax payers as the landlords might remind the MPs who they actually  serve.\r\n",
