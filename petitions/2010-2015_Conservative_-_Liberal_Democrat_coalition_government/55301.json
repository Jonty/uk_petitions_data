The software is the same as the US version, including non-English spellings (e.g. color).\r\n\r\nCreative Cloud full subscription is US$49.99 or \u00a346.88 (which is roughly US$75.60 or about 50% higher).\r\n\r\nThe Australian government successfully forced Adobe to price their downloadable products the same as they are the US, a drop from AU$74.99 to AU$49.99.\r\n\r\nHere is one article: http://cnet.co/Y9RHyK\r\n\r\nAdobe's original answer to the Australians was \"If you want cheaper software, fly to the US\". This isn't an option with downloadable software.",
