        "additional_details": "Halogen spotlamps, notably those in MR16 and GU10 fitting are incredibly inefficient in terms of energy consumption in operation and their life expectancy. LED technology has now advanced to the point where a drop in replacement lamp can provide equivalent lighting output in terms of lumen output, beam angle and desired colour temperature while consuming a tenth of the energy.\r\nHalogen spotlamps need to go the same way as the more traditional incandescent globes, it's time they were phased out.",
