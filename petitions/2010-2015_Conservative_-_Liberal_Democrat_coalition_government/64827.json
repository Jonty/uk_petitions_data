        "additional_details": "Mcdonalds monopoly is quite possibly one of the greatest events in the British calendar. The short period in which Mcdonalds give away free items from their menu allows us to celebrate such British 'classics' as the 'Big Mac' or the 'Quarter Pounder with Cheese'. I am suggesting that because of the cultural importance of these staples, Mcdonalds monopoly should be operational all year round and subsidised by the government. With added incentives to earn free Big Macs or Mcdonalds classic style Hash Browns, The British public would prolong their love affair with Mcdonalds and preserve the heritage of such an important cuisine.
