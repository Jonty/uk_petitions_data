        "additional_details": "Many people say that we should pull out of Eurovision. Why?\r\n Yes we put millions of pounds into the show and that is why we should stay! Eurovision is an excellent opportunity for the UK to show how great of a nation we are. It is not like it used to be. Eurovision is serious contest that demands a serious entry. 1 in every 6 album sold in France and Germany is from the UK, but yet why does the BBC pick songs for Eurovision that cannot win?\r\n\r\nThe BBC needs to open the song selection public voting or have some way of scrutinising which song will be the best for the UK.\r\n\r\nEven though the Prime Minister is having a referendum with European Leaders. Why should we pull out of this amazing cultural show. We should be celebrating our culture, not hiding it away because our leader is having a tiff with Europe.",
