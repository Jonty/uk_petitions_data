They advised me if i would like a little top up on my prepayment meters, i would need to walk 15 miles to the only local housing centre that do this.\r\n\r\nHow are people meant to find work when theres people suffering extreme hardship and using the time to find ways to put food on the table in the short-term when they should be looking for work in the long-term.\r\n\r\nPeople will never understand until they have been in the situation themselves. I for one, know that.",
