(http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15198789) accessed on 14/11/2011. To stimulate growth within the United Kingdom I would like to raise a petition. The main objective of this petition is to give one months tax free to every working person in the United Kingdom, this extra money would generate growth and stimulate spending within the United Kingdom and you'd also be putting money back into the treasury through the VAT on items brought if this is how individuals would choose to spend their money. It would appear in this economic climate that its the working class individuals that are being hit the hardest. Surely the working person deserve a reward?",
