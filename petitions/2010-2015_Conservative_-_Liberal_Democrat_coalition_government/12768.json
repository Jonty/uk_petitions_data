We had worked hard on it and even used spell check - it deserves to be put to the public!\r\n\r\nBriefly - we want the sound back - ok our reasons are nostalgic (you could bring the pools news back as well while you are about it) but does that make them any less worthy?\r\n\r\nSo come on big government \u2013 give the people a say and let football fan power rise!",
