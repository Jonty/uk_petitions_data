This year  such bonuses will benefit the Treasury to @ \u00a310 billion pounds which can be used to  repair cuts to  the armed forces and invest in new businesses and technology. It will also help to lift the country out of the debt caused by the loans to the banks much quicker than if we wait for the banks to pay back out of declared profit.\r\nIf they all threaten to leave the country there are plenty of people willing to take their jobs,  who could hardly do worse.",
