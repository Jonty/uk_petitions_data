So with 3000 more people unemployed which could also create a chain reaction, how is the country ever going to get out of this recession?\r\nMy dad, works for BAE, he deserves to live comfortably and enjoy his life, he's given a huge part of his life to his children, now is his time to live his life, and it's going to be taken away from him.\r\nWhat are these men going to do? Some of them are of an age where it's difficult to find a new job, and who will fund their training? Don't let these men go, sign the petition now :)",
