        "additional_details": "We, at the Church of The Flying Spaghetti Monster, would like to have Pastafarianism recognised as a legitimate religion, and receive government funding for the building of churches with the purpose of worshipping His Noodliness. Pastafarianism is amongst the more peaceful religions, not once fighting a war in the name of His Noodliness, unlike some major religions (Christianity, Islam). After the recent recognition of Jedi as a religion, it only seems fair that Pastafarianism is also recognised as it has just as much credibility as any other religion. We would also like our Holy Day (Friday) to be recognised as our Sabbath and get the day off, whether it be work or school. We would like to be able to celebrate this Holiest of Holy Days in any way we please, within reason of course. If we cannot have Friday off, then at least allow the option to wear Pirate regalia\r\n",
