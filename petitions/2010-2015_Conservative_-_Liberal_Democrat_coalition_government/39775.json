        "action": "Postpone Norman Bettison's retirement",
        "additional_details": "On 4th September 2012, Sir Norman Bettison announced his decision to retire from  his position as Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police. He took this decision just days after he was referred to the IPCC for an investigation into his conduct in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster.\r\n\r\nThe Hillsborough Independent Panel's report into the disaster finally laid bare the truth about the events of 15th April 1989 and vindicated the families who have been fighting 23 years for justice. Allowing Mr Bettison to retire on full pension before a full investigation into his actions is completed and before any disciplinary proceedings can be considered would undermine the Government's public commitment to secure the justice that the victim's deserve.\r\n\r\nTherefore we call on the Home Secretary to use whatever powers she has at her disposal to postpone the retirement of Mr Bettison until the outcome of the IPCC investigation and any subsequent disciplinary proceedings.",

We have already said that we will ensure that the IPCC has both the resource and powers that it requires to undertake the investigations necessary. We now need to let the IPCC undertake the investigation and must await their findings\r\n\r\n\u2028This e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
