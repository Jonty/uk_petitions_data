        "action": "Petition to retain Coastguard Control Centre (MRCC) in Great Yarmouth",
        "additional_details": "The Government has granted Local Enterprise Partnership zones to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft specifically to the harbour areas. This should increase marine related industry along the East of England coast and therefore increase marine traffic. Recent permission has been granted for the transfer of oil from ship to ship off this coastline. The number of deaths on the Norfolk Broads already this year numbers four. The Government intends to close the Maritime Rescue Co-ordination Centre (MRCC) run by the Marine Coastguard Agency (MCA) at Great Yarmouth. The MRCC is staffed by MCA Coastguards who know both the coastal waters and the Broads intimately.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned believe that local knowledge saves lives and call upon this Government to reconsider this decision and to retain some form of MRCC capability in Great Yarmouth.\r\n\r\n",
