        "additional_details": "Slowly but surely television coverage for much of the UK's sport is moving away from free to air providers and torward subsciption services. Formula One has today announced that half of the BBC's excellent coverage will move to Sky. Test Cricket, Premiership and Champion's League football along with some England matches are now the preserve of a fee paying minority.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for legislation to enable live free to air access to all mass sports in the UK and not just a few selected 'crown jewels'.",
