Its time the government took notice of how the Great British public think. Too long have the politicians been allowed to run rampant with our money. WE bailed out the banks and WE are the ones being punished for others mistakes.\r\n\r\nI want the government to let the people who don't vote have a box to tick as well as the people that do vote. Lets try and get the whole country in the polling stations so the government can see what we really think.",
