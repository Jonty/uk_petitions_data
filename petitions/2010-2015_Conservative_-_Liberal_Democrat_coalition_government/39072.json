All families of the Hillsborough victims have all requests met in order to seek truth and justice.\r\n\r\n2. All Liverpool supporters who attended on 15/04/1989 are apologised to officially for the unacceptable lies and slander.\r\n\r\n3. Investigations into the reason why something as simple as the truth has taken so long to be revealed.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable that the families of the 96 were never given the full facts about their loved ones, and even more unforgivable attempts to enquire about the circumstances were blocked.\r\n\r\nTRUTH for the 96 established, time for JUSTICE....",
