        "additional_details": "Following recent events in Syria and other Muslim countries, with brainwashed Muslims from the United Kingdom being recruited to join Islamic State terrorist groups, who are carrying out merciless executions on not only British citizens, but innocent people from around the world, is now not the time to introduce identity cards to root out the fundamentalists who are brainwashing british citizens to go out of the UK to fight.\r\n\r\nThis matter of ID Cards is NOT an affront of people's civil liberties.\r\n\r\nThis is not a witch hunt, or a racist attack on Muslims ... This is Great Britain, and any people who are living here illegally could be rooted out and moved back to countries where their religious beliefs mean so much to them.\r\n\r\nI would like people to sign this petition so it can be discussed in the Houses of Parliament and to try and stop the British armed forces being sent into a ground war abroad.",
