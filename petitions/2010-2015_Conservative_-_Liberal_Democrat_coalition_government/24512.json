        "additional_details": "Up to eight million working people aged between 42 and 51 have, in good faith, paid into the state system which promised a pension from the age of 60. There are millions more contributing who are younger than 42. We have not voted for the increase to 67 years. We have not voted for a system which has effectively stolen 7 years of our basic pension, currently \u00a337182.60 at todays rate. That figure will rise when we eventually reach retirement. When there is no growth, there are no extra jobs. Making us work longer means fewer jobs for the new generation. Most, if not all of our stolen pension money is paying for the jobless being created by this policy. Reverse the policy now. Let people retire at 60, on the pension they have paid for and give the next generation a better chance of employment. Stop the theft of our state pension.",
