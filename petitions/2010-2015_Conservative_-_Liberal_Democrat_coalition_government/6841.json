        "additional_details": "Disallow the flying of all flags if they used to intimidate other members of the community or to mark out territory. Everyone in Northern Ireland experiences intimidation from 'the other side' when they drive past or under flags promoting the other side's culture. Due to the trauma suffered by everyone during 'the troubles' the sight of these flags (both protestant and catholic flags) reminds everyone of the fear and prejudice that still exists and is still represented by these flags. Would Northern Ireland not be a better place if all intimidating flags were forbidden?",
