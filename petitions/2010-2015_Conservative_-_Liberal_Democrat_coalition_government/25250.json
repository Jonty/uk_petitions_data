His programmes such as Planet Earth and Frozen Planet are worth the license fee alone.\r\n\r\nIf we can be granted a National Holiday for a Royal Wedding, then why not be granted a National Holiday in honour of a man who has contributed more to our understanding of the natural world than anyone else, perhaps since Darwin wrote the Origin of Species.\r\n\r\nDavid Attenborough is a National Treasure and should be honoured as such. Whilst he is still alive and going strong, the BBC to dedicate that entire day of programming to him and his shows. When he dies, a day of mourning should be declared, and then on a date to be agreed, his birthday for example, we should all have the day off as a Bank Holiday in his honour.\r\n\r\nIf we can have it for a wedding, why not to honour someone so much more important in terms of their contributions to this country?
