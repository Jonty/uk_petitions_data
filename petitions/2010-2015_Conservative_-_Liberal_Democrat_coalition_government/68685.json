        "additional_details": "The UK's motorways are constantly being improved - that's great.  However, on some roads drivers are limited to 50mph for far too long.  This is unsafe in terms of drivers losing concentration and drivers subsequently driving faster after the roadworks to try to make up lost time.  When there is mile after mile of a lower speed limit for no reason (work has not yet started, or has finished), this could encourage drivers to have less respect for speed restrictions.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, what is the cost to businesses which use these roads?  To what extent are the emergency services delayed leading to a loss of life due to these lengthy roadworks?\r\n\r\nWe are asking for legislation to limit the length of roadworks to 8 miles in a single stretch, and remove the restrictions as soon as possible once work is finished.",
