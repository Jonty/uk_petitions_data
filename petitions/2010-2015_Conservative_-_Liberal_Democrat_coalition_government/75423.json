Id like a show of hands to present to the new owner(s) to keep Smiths as is (with a few aesthetic & technical changes of course). What I can tell you - a complete refurbishment will be taking place after Smiths' closure this or next week! This is potentially very exciting! I can promise you I'll fight for this cause, just PLEASE sign bellow.\r\n\r\nAll my love DJ Steffy xxx",
