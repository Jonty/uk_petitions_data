        "additional_details": "The Union Flag is a symbol of unity of 4 parts of the United Kingdom as well as those citizens from British Overseas territories.\r\n\r\nOver recent years Britain seems to have lost its pride in being British and has lacked an identity and symbol which will unite the whole nation. This has been used by seperatists to their advantage, as in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn nations such as United States, France and Australia the national flag is flown with pride by all, no matter what part of the country they are from.\r\n\r\nTherefore we ask the government to pass a law to make it compulsory for all taxpayer funded organisations and government buildings, such as schools, hospitals, jobcentres, colleges and universities to fly the Union Flag all year round in all 4 parts of the United Kingdom. Especially at a time when we face the single biggest threat from Scottish Nationalists, who wish to break up our nation.",
