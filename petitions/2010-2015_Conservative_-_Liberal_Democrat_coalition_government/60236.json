Much more than people before them and infinitely more than the people currently coming up behind them.  This is because they were of the generation when what people did was work and pay your way.  Unlike today's working age population who see being on benefits as a badge of honour.  Welfare benefit top out is GBP26000pa (though HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS STILL GET MORE THAN THAT) so any decision to reduce the gross incomes of the biggest contributors to the system, to less than that being handed out to today's welfare sucking parasites REALLY ought to be taken to the European Court of a Justice.  And it should NEVER be forgotten that pensioners still pay taxes, welfare sucking  parasites NEVER have and NEVER will pay taxes.",
