The people that need this for a job that have passed there S.I.A Course shouldn't have to pay for there badge because it cost to much just for the course. Some people are on J.S.A and get the course for free when they do a other course. It cost \u00a3220 for the badge this should be payed for by the government. When pay for other courses and this is why I think the government should pay the founds so that people that have passed there S.I.A course can get it for free\r\nThanks",
