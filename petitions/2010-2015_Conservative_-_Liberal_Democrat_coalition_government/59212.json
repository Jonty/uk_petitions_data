        "additional_details": "Let's use an exciting new bank note to make Britain even more creative!\r\n\r\nBritish Startups need support. We hereby propose a new currency denomination be issued, on limited edition. The \u00a3100.00 note, with the father of the web on its face.\r\n\r\nWe petition that a percentage of each fee for \"first edition\" purchases builds a new non-government administered startup fund. Run by a jury service-style Enterprise council - to be chaired by independent business leaders and regulated by the Dept. of Business, Innovation and Skills.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tim Berners-Lee\" note would be a creative competition, an inspiring opportunity and the fund council represent a vocational bridge for seasoned entrepreneurs and younger, eager business people.\r\n\r\nSign up and support now!",
