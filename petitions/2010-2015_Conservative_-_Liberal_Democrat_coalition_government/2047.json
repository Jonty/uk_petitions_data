        "additional_details": "As many have noticed, the tax credit system for help with Childcare costs is being greatly reduced. We still heavily rely on childcare for under 5s while parents are working. It is believed that childcare costs have rocketed in the past ten years, due to the tax credit system supplementing the fee costs, this has actually resulted in price hikes. Many large cities in the UK charge between \u00a3800-1500 a month for 1 child's full time nursery fees. This is a racket, the government nor parents cannot afford to supplement nursery owners large profits, when their staff are actually on minimum wage.  Save the government and parents money by signing this petition and stop this price fixing nursery care racket. ",
