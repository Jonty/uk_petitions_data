How is that going to teach them right from wrong when they clearly do not deserve to use the tax contributed, by those they caused to lose their jobs, businesses and homes.\r\n1) Would prefer my tax contributions to be used to rebuild businesses.\r\n2) Would prefer my tax contributions to be used to provide homes for those who have no where else to go.\r\n3) Would prefer my tax contributions to be used to provide for those who have lost their jobs and their employees are unable to continue paying them.\r\n4) Would prefer my tax contributions to be used to rebuild communities.\r\n",
