However the Typhoon has served exceptionally in Afghanistan and Libya but is suffering from chronic underdevelopment, leading to parts shortage, long timescales for repairs and the cannibalisation of some aircraft to keep others flying.\r\nCancel the procurement of 138 American-built F-35C's and continue working with our European allies to maintain the 100,000 jobs across Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy that are essential to our national defence. Keep the jobs and investment in Britain and Europe!",
