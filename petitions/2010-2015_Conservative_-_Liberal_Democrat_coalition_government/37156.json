        "additional_details": "Mo Farah created history during the 2012 London Olympic games winning two gold medals that will be his forever. As a tribute to this great feat, Royal Mail have painted two post boxes gold. We propose that as he has won these medals and they will be forever his, that the tributes to the local area should remain permanent and these post boxes should remain gold. This olympics has been subtitled \"inspire a generation\" and therefore the tribute should remain long enough to do just that to every person that walks past it. It's great for local businesses and residents, creates a sense of community and could become a permanent talking point. We want the government to pass a bill ensuring that this tribute remains in place permanently.",
