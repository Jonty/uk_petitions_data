        "additional_details": "The A10 between Cambridge and Ely cannot cope with the weight of traffic which is currently using the road. A journey can Easily take 45 minutes to over an hour at peak times which not only annoys road users, it is severely impacting businesses up and down the A10, even as far as Kings Lynn.\r\n\r\nIf a duel carriageway was built it would help ease the severe congestion allowing commuters to get to work quicker and easier, saving time and money.\r\n\r\nIn addition, with a possible bypass round villages it would be a positive impact for the locals who reside on the A10.\r\n\r\nI feel that there could be a substantial growth in businesses up and down the A10 as it will be easier for traffic to get to places on time, and this will then benefit the local economy even further.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, please sign so that we can help the local infrastructure of Cambridgeshire!",
