        "additional_details": "We want to stop unfair child labor occurring anywhere in the world as we seem that many transnational corporations and other companies are just taking advantage of innocent children.\r\n\r\nWe would like the Government to make laws about not buying products from companies and places that still use unfair child labor as a source of manufacturing of products.\r\n\r\nWe understand that child labor should not be completely abolished as in some less economically developed countries, children need to work to help provide money for their families so they can buy necessities like food and water. In these extreme cases we think that companies should offer education, training or other ways that will help children develop skills for their future. We think that the UK government should enforce this idea. ",
