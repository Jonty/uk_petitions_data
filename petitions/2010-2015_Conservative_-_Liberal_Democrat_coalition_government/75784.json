        "additional_details": "With fracking  becoming a more realistic possibility, with a lot of possible investment from many national and international company's, I propose that all investment made in UK fracking should be equalled, by the investor, with investment in renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThis would help bring down electricity costs, and sustain our long term grid production and hopefully make Fracking a Carbon neutral event.\r\n\r\nIt would also help to meet EU targets on renewable energies.",
