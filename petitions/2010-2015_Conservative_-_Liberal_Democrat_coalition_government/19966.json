        "additional_details": "The selling of gold and silver should be in a free market. Banks are naked short selling gold and silver (selling it when they don`t own it to sell) and also are selling it on paper with ious, thereby making the price of these metals artificially low. How can you sell something that you don`t even own? This needs to be stopped and therby allow these metals to attain their true value, which in todays economic climate is much higher than their spot prices.",
