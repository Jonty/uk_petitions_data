        "additional_details": "After the riots a few weeks ago, feral children/people took pleasure in hurting other people, it has proven that society has lost its way with no respect of other people or their property.  Murders/rapists/terriosts/bullies/thugs/drug dealers have no fear of the law and do not care who gets hurt.  We need to bring back discipline in both the home and schools, parents/schools/society should have the right to discipline those who push to boundries to far.  We now have 5 year olds telling their parents that they will contact social services if they are told off or smacked, this is mad.  I do not condone beating that is a totaly different thing,  but I do believe that the cane should be used as a last resort in schools and parents should be able to discipline including a smack without the threat of social workers/court etc.  The government must start to control this by giving parents/teachers/police the right to discipline and the education of children and adults to respect others.
