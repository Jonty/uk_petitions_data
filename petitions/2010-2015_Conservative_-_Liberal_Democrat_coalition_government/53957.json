        "additional_details": "Communications have been seriously compromised between one user group (boaters) and the recently formed Charity Canal and River Trust. Following recent amicable mediation between the two groups to find common ground in revising conditions to licenses and mooring, The Trust have suddenly and with immediate effect decided they no longer wish to hold dialogue with boaters' groups as they do not feel the ( basic) 30% the boaters pay of the     whole financial contribution to the Trust is  significant enough to warrant the effort . The Trust are now preparing to run roughshod over boaters by implementing changes to license terms and conditions without consultation, and as tax payers as well as license holders and   contributors to the local economies we would like  to request the government takes the step of  withholding its grant to The Trust until such times that The Trust recognise boaters as significant stakeholders and treat us as such.",
