        "additional_details": "The noise created by high powered in car audio systems is causing nuiscance and disturbance at all times of day or night.\r\nIn car audio systems are becoming more and more powerful and the increased use of subwoofer speakers that create high energy sound waves makes it more difficult to contain the sound within the vehicle.\r\nMany users of these audio systems seem oblivious to the disturbance that they create both day and night.\r\nThe outdoor concert and festival industry has to abide strict guidelines. I think greater noise problems are created by 'in car audio systems' and it is time this problem was tackled.\r\nNoise created by vehicle music systems can be tackled in a number of ways. The sound created by the vehicles can be measured and drivers creating noise above a certain level can be issued points, fines, etc, much like mobile phone offences.\r\nHigher fines for offences commited late at night, etc.\r\n",
