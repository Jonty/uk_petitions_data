The data is owned by the company.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we do not make personal decisions at work, our buying decisions are directed by the company.\r\n\r\nThe new EU Data Regulation (EUDR) will force executives to opt-in to receiving information on new/better products and services (the current method is opt-out).\r\n\r\nWe believe this will dramatically reduce the flow of information to UK business and reduce their competitive advantage on a world stage.\r\n\r\nTherefore we ask the Government to exclude work contact data and purchasing data from the new EU Data Regulation.",
