It is offensive to see the new 'British' police group showing a training video featuring an Audi, 3 BMW 4x4s and a Lexus. We have Range Rover and Jaguar - they may not be owned here but they invest and employ here.\r\nWhy should 35k of my money be spent on an Audi when 25k would buy a BRITISH made Jaguar? The people that make the Jaguar would not be on benefit and would be paying tax!!!! Common sense MUST prevail - buy BRITISH",
