        "additional_details": "The European Commission has proposed a shake-up of the MOT which could cost thousands of jobs and cripple the industry that deals with modifying cars INCLUDING Historic and Classic cars.\r\n\r\nUnder its plans, all vehicles would have to remain identical to the specification they were in when they left the factory - which would mean classic cars could not even be updated with safer equipment.\r\n\r\nThe proposed new rules would mean any modifications - from different windscreen wipers to newer brake lights - would mean the car would automatically fail its MOT test.\r\n\r\nThis is clearly aimed at clearing the road of older cars to promote sales of newer cars, but at a stroke will wipe out a century of heritage and a multi-million pound industry.\r\n",
