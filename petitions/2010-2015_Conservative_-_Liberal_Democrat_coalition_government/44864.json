        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a targeted response to grit pedestrian pavements with two schemes:-\r\n\r\n1. Provide dedicated manual gritting teams to grit the pavements in essential and semi-essential areas; to target particular residential areas and areas considered for support, such as shop walkways, and other areas often required for public access.\r\n\r\n2. Where such teams cannot be provided or areas considered as low priority, or areas that might otherwise be inaccessible during adverse weather conditions, provide local communities with the facilities to grit their own pavements.\r\n\r\nWhile it is recognised that not every pavement can be gritted, a measured, targeted approach to gritting particular pavements, that currently are left untouched, must be implemented.\r\n\r\nHence, this petition urges an overhaul of the gritting process in the UK as too much emphasis is placed upon motorist roadways and not enough on pedestrians walkways.",
