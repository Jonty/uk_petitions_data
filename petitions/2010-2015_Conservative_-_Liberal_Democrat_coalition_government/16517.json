The customer should still try and make affordable monthly payments even if it's only between \u00a35 per month.\r\n\r\nStopping all automated calls and letters would give people a breathing space to find work at a very vulnerable time mentally and emotionally.\r\n\r\nWhen a job is found (a time limit of e.g. 6-12 months could be imposed for a customer to secure work) their financial position could then be reviewed and a suitable payment plan put in place for the customer to pay the arrears back.\r\n\r\n",
