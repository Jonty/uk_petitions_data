        "additional_details": "According to the BBC, the Department for Education has been looking at proposals to privatise child protection services, by allowing local authorities to contract out provision to private firms.\r\n\r\nThe signatories of this petition believe that it is the duty of the State to protect children and that this duty is not transferable because a private company's primary duty is to make profits for its shareholders. This conflict of interest is not appropriate when the wellbeing of children is at stake.\r\n\r\nThe signatories therefore call on the Department for Education to immediately abandon their plan to allow local authorities to contract out child protection services.",
