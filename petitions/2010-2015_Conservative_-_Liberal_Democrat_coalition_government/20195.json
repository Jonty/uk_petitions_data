Information about access is often not obvious on accommodation websites or is non-existent.\r\n\r\nThere are good examples of Access Statement templates offered for example by VisitEngland, but these are not used effectively by all accommodation providers.\r\n\r\nI would like all tourism accommodation providers to provide sufficient details and to use key search words to give disabled people the opportunity to make informed decisions about which places meet their needs. This should include images for disabled visitors who do not use or understand the English language.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to consider how all accommodation providers could be encouraged to provide information.\r\n\r\nIf you agree with me, please support this campaign and share with others. Thank you.",
