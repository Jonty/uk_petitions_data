Court could legally define a race by factors like genetics, language, appearance, geographical area, etc. Sikhs/Jews an ethnic race, cult or religion? In Mandla v Dowell Lee (1983) House of Lords found that Sikhs constituted a RACIAL group when a Sikh boy was refused a place at a school because he wore a turban. This judgement was based on Sikhs long shared history & collective consciousness distinguishing them from other groups in customs, geographical origin, language, being recognised as a separate group in the surrounding community. Jews regard a Jew as born of Jewish mother. A person can be a Jew even if not practising Judaism. Likewise can a person be converted to Sikhism by believing in karma & reincarnation unless BORN a Sikh? Belief in reincarnation does not require a believer to start wearing turbans, bangles, etc.",
