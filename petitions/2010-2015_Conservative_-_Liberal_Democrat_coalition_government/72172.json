        "additional_details": "Since the decision to switch off street lights in many areas there are increasing reports of burglaries, car thefts and muggings/attacks on people.\r\n The streets are no longer safe now criminals can act under cover of darkness. We ask that Basildon Council reviews the policy and either turns the lights back on or at least fits Passive Infra Red (PIR) sensors so street lights come on for a set period when they are needed.\r\n The violence used in the last few attacks in the Laindon area was excessive and it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed.\r\n",
