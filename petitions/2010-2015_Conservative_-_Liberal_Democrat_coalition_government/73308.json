        "additional_details": "Fox hunting is a savage and cruel pursuit and is not necessary to control foxes. Humane alternatives are available that are quick and clean. I don't mind hunting if you eat your kill but to allow an animal to be torn apart whilst alive by a pack of dogs is primitive and inhumane. It is a relic of the 19th century and has no place in educated civilised society.",
