        "additional_details": "For years now passionate theatre, music and events fans have had to put up with ticket touts buying up large quantities of an events ticket allocation and then immediately listing them on second hand ticket sites and over double the face value. With fans having no choice but to pay these ridiculous prices, such is their passion for the event.\r\n\r\nWorse still is the relationship that promoters and venues have with these sites, a recent \"Dispatches\" documentary uncovered the fact that promoters are giving these \"fan to fan\" sites actual first-hand ticket allocations which are then immediately listed on their sites.\r\n\r\nThe government has long since put a stop to this on football events and it's high time the same was done for all public events. A cap of 10% profit on every event should be introduced, and a tighter watch should be put on these so called \"fan to fan\" ticket sites, with the same punishments as those who violate the legislations against football events applicable.\r\n",
