        "additional_details": "It is our desire that our government reverses its present course of policies which are designed to put pressure upon the Israeli government and people to give up Israeli land in exchange for peace.\r\nThe very action of forcing Israel to give up land is in itself contrary to international law. The borders of the state of Israel were agreed in 1948. They extend from the Medeteranian to the river Jordan and should remain so. In fact the origional allocation for the Jewish homeland stretched accross the Jordan to the border of Iraq. It was illegaly anexed by Winston Churchill.",
