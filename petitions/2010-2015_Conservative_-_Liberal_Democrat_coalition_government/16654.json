The latest one i have seen is called \"Congratulations you have a beautiful baby boy! LOL jk it's a still born...\" now this has been reported a number of times and yet its still to be deleted.\r\n\r\nAnd its not just about that one page its about the thousands of other sick pages on there, its about time some sort of proper moderation was set up on these pages, maybe some sort of vetting process before they go live.\r\n\r\nplease lets get something done about it.",
