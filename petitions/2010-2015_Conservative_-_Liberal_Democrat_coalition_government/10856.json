        "action": "Reform Banks to make them accountable for the recession",
        "additional_details": "The Banking industry should be reformed to limit Bankers' bonuses and contribute more to economic recovery. Bankers around the world caused the economic recession and should therefore contribute more to encouraging economic growth.\r\n\r\nBanks in the UK should divide and separate their services into savings and everyday banking on the one hand, and investment banking on the other. The investment banking economy should be restructured to minimise its impact upon the wider economy, therefore limiting the severity of recessions.\r\n\r\nBankers' bonuses and bank profits should be pooled into a fund to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.",
