        "additional_details": "Allow taxpayers to opt out of paying for the Royal Family and receive this payment off their tax bill. The petition would allow taxpayers to simply tick a box on their tax returns sheet to receive the reimbursement. If the box is ticked they would receive a deduction from their tax (approximately 66 pence). In order to conform to the royal charter that says that the Royal Family cannot receive less than the last financial year, the tax of those who do not opt out will have to increase to compensate for this. The argument that this petition is proposing is simple: if you do not want there to be a royal family, then you do not have to pay for them. It is totally unfair to make people pay for something that is unnecessary in the 21st century\r\n",
