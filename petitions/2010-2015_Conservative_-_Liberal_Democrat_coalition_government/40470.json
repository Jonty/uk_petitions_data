        "additional_details": "I claim \u00a358.45 for looking after a Daughter that suffers from Cystic Fibrosis. I also have a Son that suffers from the same condition but because my Husband works we would not be entitled to claim it for him. I have to be showing that I care for my Daughter for a minimum of 35hrs a week which I clearly do more of. For this I am being paid, like I said earlier \u00a358.45, which equates to approx \u00a31.67. Again I care for 2 children in which I theoretically care for a minimum of 70hrs a week and which equates to 83.5p per hour. The demands and commitments of this condition means I cannot return to work to get any other finances and I cannot claim any benefits. I also have to declare this amount to tax credits as a taxable income so some of it is taken away for their purposes. This is far from justified...!!! ",
