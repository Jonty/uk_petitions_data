        "additional_details": "During WW2 110,000 flew,56,000 died.Bomber Command Aircrew was the most dangerous branch of any service.Life expectantcy was 5 missions,less than 2 weeks! And yet they are the ONLY branch of the Services to be denied a Campaign Medal.Even typists that travelled from Calais to Normandy for 21 days got a Campaign Medal.Well one of those brave men survived the war and hid the fact of being in Bomber Command.One of his night time missions had been to bomb an industrial town in south Germany.In 1947,whilst he was attending the cinema,a Pathe news film was showing.This film showed footage at Auschwitz.As he watched the footage,one thing stood out more than any other..cast into the oven door was the name of the manufacturer of the ovens and the name of the small town he had bombed some 3 years before.From that day on he felt vindicated.To date these men,who were by mathematics indeed the Bravest of all,deserve what is long overdue,a Campaign Medal.",
