I FULLY ACCEPT THAT THIS WOULD FORCE RENTS DOWN IN SOME AREAS BUT THIS MUST BE BALANCED AGAINST EMPLOYMENT AND PEOPLE HAVING SOMEWHERE TO LIVE.\r\n\r\nTHIS MAY NOT BE POPULAR BUT THE PROPOSAL WOULD ONLY AFFECT THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. THE OTHER ADVANTAGE IS THAT NO MASSIVE LAW CHANGES ARE REQUIRED.\r\n",
