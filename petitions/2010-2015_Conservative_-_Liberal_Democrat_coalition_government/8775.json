        "additional_details": "We need to remove cheap Alcohol as part of a weekly shop. It needs to be seen as a special item for people to drink with a meal or social event. Having it for sale in a supermarket below cost with massive promotions undermines the damage it does to people\u2019s heath and our social fabric in the UK.\r\nParents of underage drinking are just as responsible as the drinker themselves.  As they cannot take responsibility themselves we have to remove the easy access to the product.\r\nAs tax payers, we all pay the bill for the damage this is doing to our lives and generations to come.\r\nWe never had this issue until supermarkets stocked the items.  Stacked it high and sold it cheap below cost.\r\nOr if the supermarket continues to sell the product they need to have a separate manned location in the store to prevent theft.\r\n",
