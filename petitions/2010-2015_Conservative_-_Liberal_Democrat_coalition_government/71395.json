What can you do now . They can't do a thing because I can't afford justice. I will need to pay over \u00a31000 before I Evan get to court . If you don't win you will have to pay your ex employers costs that can be 1000s . So walk away with your tail between you legs . So justice only if you can afford it . 20 yrs for a new young management team to end my life.",
