        "additional_details": "From October 2012, anyone who has had their Employment and Support Allowance stopped following a Work Capability Assessment must ask for a mandatory re-consideration before being allowed to appeal to the tribunals service.\r\n\r\nThe DWP cannot give any timescales for the re-consideration and whilst this is being done, claimants will not receive any benefit.  (More information below)\r\n\r\nWhilst the re-consideration is being done, claimants will not receive the assessment rate (Currently \u00a371.71 per week) of benefit and must either go without until the new decision has been made, or they must claim Job Seekers Allowance.\r\n\r\nAnyone claiming Job Seekers Allowance must be fit to work immediately, therefore anyone who has been claiming ESA fails this criteria straight away as they aren't entitled to the benefit due to their current health status.",
