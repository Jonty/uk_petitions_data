        "action": "Include Rex Warneford VC in war memorial",
        "additional_details": "Reginald Alexander John Warneford was born in India - at the time a Commonwealth dependancy - to British parents and was brought up and educated in Britain, where he joined the Royal Naval Air Service, winning his VC aged 23. By every definition he is the epitome of the British war hero, but petty bureaucracy has deemed that his name - and those of other non-British born VC  winners - will be omitted from the memorials to Victoria Cross winners as part of the 100th anniversary of the First World War.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges the British government to reverse their decision and to include not only Warneford, but also other non-British born VC winners. To deny them the honour they deserve because of an accident of geography is to betray everything they fought for.\r\n\r\nThey are worthy of inclusion because they *were VC winners*.",
