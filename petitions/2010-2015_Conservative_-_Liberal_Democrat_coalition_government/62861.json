        "additional_details": "Songs are increasingly full of sexualised content. There is a clear link between how young girls allow themselves to be abused to the songs they are listening to. Radio stations need to implement a 9:30pm watershed where young people are not being played such songs during school runs, afternoons etc. It is time to play only what is appropriate for the audience. Playlists must be age appropriate for people of ALL ages in the daytime. ",
