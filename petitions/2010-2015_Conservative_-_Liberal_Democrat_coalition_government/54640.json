        "additional_details": "We the undersigned require the Government to show where this additional 52 million pound is coming from to aid Syrians. As the UK continues to be subject to cuts and wage freezes additional aid to a foreign country is unjustified. If this money is available it should be used within failing public sector operations such as the NHS and Education Establishments. We require this additional money to be utilised within the UK as it is our taxes and money you represent.",
