The judicial decree that someone be punished in this manner is a death sentence, while the actual process of killing the person is an execution. Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as capital crimes or capital offences. The term capital originates from the Latin capitalis, literally \"regarding the head\" (referring to execution by beheading)\r\n\r\nHelp stop death penalty!!!!",
