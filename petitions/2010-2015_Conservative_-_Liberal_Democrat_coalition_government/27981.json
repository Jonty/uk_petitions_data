        "additional_details": "A new charity tax should be adopted, \u00a35 a month from working peoples pay check getting over a certain amount per year. \u00a35 a month which is all were asking is a meal, a pack of ciggarettes, four cans of alcholic drink or a magazine. At 20'000'000 ( a low estimate) giving \u00a35 a month for 12 month's would generate \u00a312'000'000'000. This would then be sharred out between charities & appeals based on who & where it's desperatley needed. I hope something this simple could be adopted in the UK and othe countries generating billions for charitable causes across the world. If you would like this debated in the House of Commons, then please sign. Thank you.",
