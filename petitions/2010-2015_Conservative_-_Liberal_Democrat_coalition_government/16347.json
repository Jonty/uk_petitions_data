This would also reduced prison population\r\nIt costs nearly \u00a31000 to keep a prisoner in prison for a week. We should give the prisoners a choice of doing voluntary charity work in third world countries so that the costs to the UK government are greatly reduced.\r\nTo keep a person for a week in a third world country would be around \u00a3100 per week. Therefore saving the country would be around \u00a345000 per year for every prisoner sent abroad to do charity work. Reoffending would be greatly reduced because the prisoner would learn values of charity / giving and sharing.",
