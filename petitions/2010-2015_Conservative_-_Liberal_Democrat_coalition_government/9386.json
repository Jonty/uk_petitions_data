        "additional_details": "The proposal is for the establishment of National Service Battalions within the Britsh army.  This would be for all UK males to complete.  On reaching 18 all would serve serve 2 years, university students can defer until after graduating, but would not be exempt.  These units would be staffed by Officers and NCO's from the field army.  The National Servicemen would recieve half the pay of thier regular counterparts and would still serve on operations.  These units would also administer a harsher form of discipline (similar to that of the 1950's) in order to ensure that core values are instilled along with a sense of personal responsibility which youths, in general lack or do not recieve within their families.",
