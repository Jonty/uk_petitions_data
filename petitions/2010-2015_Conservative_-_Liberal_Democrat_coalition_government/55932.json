        "additional_details": "HMS PLYMOUTH is the last surviving Royal Navy Warship which took part in the Falklands War. The surrender of Argentine forces at South Georgia was signed in her wardroom. She is the last of her kind, a proud ship, with a distinguished history. We call on the British Government to step in and halt the proposed scrapping of this magnificent ship and save her for the nation as a fitting tribute to all those soldiers, sailors & airmen who gave their lives in that and other conflicts.",
