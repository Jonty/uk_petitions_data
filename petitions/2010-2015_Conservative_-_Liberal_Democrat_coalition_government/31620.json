        "action": "Reduce fuel duty on goods vehicles so that rising fuel costs do not affect the cost of essential goods",
        "additional_details": "Fuel duty is at a record high and we face the possibility that it may rise again in the forthcoming budget. Rising fuel prices by themselves mean an unavoidable increase in the cost of living for nearly all of us but as we live in a country where everything is delivered by road they also guarantee a rise in the cost of nearly everything else including such necessities as groceries. There are many calls for the government to cut the duty on fuel and we would all love for this to happen but the truth of the matter seems to be that in this time of economic hardship the government simply cannot afford to lose this valuable source of revenue. What I propose is that the government reduce the duty on fuel for goods vehicles so that a rise in fuel duty does not mean an increase in the cost of living elsewhere.",
