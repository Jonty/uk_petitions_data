        "additional_details": "Currently the greatest hurdle for students wishing to progress to postgraduate study is funding. There are currently no government loans or grants for postgraduate study as there is with undergraduate study. Instead a person must either fund it using savings, a scholarship from a company, or funding from a charity or trust, which can all prove very difficult. Certain career paths require a person to enter postgraduate study, such as Architecture, in order to fully qualify. However with the current situation it is very difficult.\r\nThis petition is for the government to consider providing affordable loans for tuition and living costs to people wishing to further their education with postgraduate study.
