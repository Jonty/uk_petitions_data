Why on earth should hard working people accept a below inflation pay rise when benefits will increase at above inflation.\r\nBeing on benefits should not be a way of life and it should be the bare minimum to live on. It should not extend to affording new kitchens, cars, phones and pretty much anything else people want. I am fed up with working hard and having nothing when it seems people who do nothing have everything!!!",
