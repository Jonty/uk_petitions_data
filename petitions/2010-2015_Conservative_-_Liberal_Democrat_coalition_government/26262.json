        "additional_details": "Recently i had to undergo a humiliating experience of being arrested , charged , body searched, finger printed , DNA tested  and a mug shot taken, not only that but incarcerated in a prison cell, my gun seized from my house by four armed police, ( seven officers in total) , the stress to my wife and  family was unforgivable, i felt humiliated and violated .  Essex  police admitted it was wrongful arrest and a mistake.  But that is not good enough, the desk sergeant pointed out that as a gun owner i did not have the same rights as every other citizen in the UK, he stated that the gun and ammunition would not be returned because i may go back and shoot the complainant .\r\nI want the be treated that same as every other citizen in the UK , not treated as a criminal just because i own a shotgun.\r\nDennis Webb\r\n",
