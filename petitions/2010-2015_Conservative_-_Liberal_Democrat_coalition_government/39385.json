        "additional_details": "A national 'engineers day' is held in 15+ other countries all over the world. Including India and the USA.\r\n\r\nCelebrations have included the remembrance of engineering heroes or simply a chance to raise awareness of the industry to the public, and celebrate in our successes. Engineering's past great practitioners and its future ambassadors are sadly, mostly unheard of. Let us take a step towards making a positive change.\r\n\r\nWe propose that a day each year is set aside by the government in the UK to 'Engineers Day'. The aim is to inspire children, engineering students, engineering graduates, & engineering professionals to vent ideas, and to collaborate to make this a significant date in all our diaries.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that there is an annual National Science & Engineering Week already held in ours and other countries [incl the US]. The aforementioned proposed engineers day is solely aimed at engineers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
