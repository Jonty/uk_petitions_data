We want the Government to help us all they can and not keep fobbing us off with \"we have no jurisdiction in their country\".  French police can come here and conduct investigations into murder but we can't go to France and do it.  My brother an ex Royal Marine who fought for his country and is now being let down by his country.  A beautiful man who's life was ended by brutal murder and we his family are being denied the right to grieve due to us having to fight his corner all because he was murdered abroad and we get No help by our government.  To top it off we have to pay for answers out of our own pockets, this is wrong on every level.  JUSTICE FOR CARL DAVIES",
