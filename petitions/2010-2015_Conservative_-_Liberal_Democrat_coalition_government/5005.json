        "additional_details": "We call for the introduction of Lillian's Law, named after 14-year-old Lillian Groves, who was knocked down and killed by a speeding driver who had taken cannabis. Her killer will serve half of an eight month sentence. We call on the Government to introduce roadside drugs testing devices, equivalent to breathalysers; to make driving under influence of drugs illegal and to impose tougher sentences on those found guilty of drug-driving. The Government must take drug-driving as seriously as drink-driving.\r\n\r\nFor more see: http://www.thisiscroydontoday.co.uk/Advertiser-launches-drug-driving-campaign/story-13078573-detail/story.html",
