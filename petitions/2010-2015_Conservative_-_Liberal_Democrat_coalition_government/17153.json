        "additional_details": "Government should introduce a voluntary code for a 'National Pay Ratio'. All employers who sign up are requested to implement a pay structure policy that limits the salary of the highest paid individual(including profits) to 10 times the salary of the lowest paid individual in their organisation or business, Pro-Rata of course. Organisations and busniesses who sign up to the code should then qualify for a reduction in their corporation tax, this would be offset by the amount of money that the treasury would save in reduced Family and Working tax credits paid out due the rise in salaries of lowest paid workers.",
