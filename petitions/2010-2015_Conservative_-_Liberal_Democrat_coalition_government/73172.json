        "additional_details": "The road safety campaign group B.R.A.K.E. are now campaigning for the drink drive limit to be lowered by nearly half to 50mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood in line with Scotland and most of Europe. They claim this 'could save 65 lives per year' (there is no proof of this), but do not take into account the many hundreds of lives that will be ruined every year as a consequence of a lost driving licence, followed by financial hardship, lost jobs, broken marriages, social stigma.\r\n\r\nEuropean countries use a sliding scale of punishment that does not begin with a lost licence. Unlike Europe, UK authorities zealously enforce by spot checking drivers in the morning, as well as in the evening. Soon we will have to take the day off work if we drink more than a couple of pints the night before.\r\n\r\nThis is yet another assault on our freedoms by the health and safety community that would have us all living in a padded box.\r\n\r\nThe government should keep the limit at 80mg.\r\n",
