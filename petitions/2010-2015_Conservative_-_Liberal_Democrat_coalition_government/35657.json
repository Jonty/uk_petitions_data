        "additional_details": "Despite advertising, housing benefit fraud is rarely investigated, because of costs involved. This just means that millions of scroungers take advantage of tax payers. I have personally twice reported housing benefit fraud going on in a premier street in London's West End 1999 & the council have twice rejected any investigation on grounds of cost. The police actually want to investigate this incident but themselves are not allowed without a housing council officer's referral.",
