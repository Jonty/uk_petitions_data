In these financially troubled times, when everyone else has to tighten their belts, the country can not afford this luxury and it is morally wrong.\r\n\r\nMy petition is to stop payment of accommodation expenses to MP's and provide state owned accommodation (council housing). This would reduce the national debt and be more acceptable to the general public.\r\n",
