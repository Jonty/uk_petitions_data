Whilst this has been successful for the populations concerned there is a glaring inequality in the fact that England, the most populous country in the UK has no specific representation for its people and their views. If devolved power is good enough for the rest of the UK it is good enough for England.\r\nWe call on the Government to bring forth legislation to form a parliament that consists of English parlaimentarians and will focus on English matters.
