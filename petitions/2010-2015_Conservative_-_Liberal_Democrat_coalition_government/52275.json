        "additional_details": "I want the government to bring in a bill to make future pay rises for MPs dependant on the average rise or fall of the wages of public sector workers.\r\n\r\nMPs are public servants - valuable to the country just like other public servants.\r\n\r\nBeing an MP is an important job. They should be paid well, and they are. However they are different in an important respect: as a group they have control over the wages of millions of public sector workers, and they act as the overall manager of the public sector.\r\n\r\nTherefore they should be linked so that public sector success is their success, and raising, cutting or freezing the salaries of public sector workers has the same effect on MPs salaries.\r\n\r\nWe're all in this together after all.",
