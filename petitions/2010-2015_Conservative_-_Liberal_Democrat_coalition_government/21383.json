        "additional_details": "In my honest opinion, I believe that our government isn't putting in enough effort to put a stop to most or all knife crimes across the UK. The sentence given to those who commit knife crimes is five years, but most of the time these criminals are let out on 'good behaviour' after only a couple of years at the most. The government should extend the sentences given to these people and make sure that they serve the time given, also the police should be tighter and more alert on these crimes. ",
