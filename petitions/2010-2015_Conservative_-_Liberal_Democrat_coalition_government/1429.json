        "additional_details": "There is something fundamentally wrong with the justice system and how the people of the UK perceive it. Too many times we hear of people who are convicted of serious crimes getting \u201clet off\u201d as it were. The persistent offenders see the weaknesses in our justice system and exploit them, constantly making a mockery of the system and the law abiding citizens of the UK. We need to be able to trust the justice system and have faith that it will serve us right and do what it should for the VICTIMS, not the convicts.\r\n\r\nI propose that persistent offenders (eg, 3 strikes and you\u2019re out) should serve the remainder of their days in a large prison facility CONTRIBUTING to society through some means of work, as they clearly do not have the capacity to learn from their mistakes. This should apply to all serious crimes.",
