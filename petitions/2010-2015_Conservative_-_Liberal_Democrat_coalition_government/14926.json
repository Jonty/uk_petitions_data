        "additional_details": "As the pretext for intervention in Libya was humanitarian grounds and to aid the Libyan people, british companies should not now be allowed to exploit the situation. Therefore, any involvement in the country should be to assist the Libyan people to rebuild the infrastructure and create a stabilised country and should be on a non-profit basis. The UK government must issue a temporary moratorium on UK companies from deriving profits from investment in Libya.",
