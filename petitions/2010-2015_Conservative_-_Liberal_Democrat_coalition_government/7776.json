        "additional_details": "I would like to see a period of compulsary National Service brought back to the UK for all school leavers with no further plans of education or training, similar to European models. This will give opportunities of jobs and training to young people who are otherwise at a loss, help to combat youth obesity and most importantly instill a sense of respect, perspective and discipline back into our young communities.",
