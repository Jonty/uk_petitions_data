        "additional_details": "There are numerous new housing developments that offer the benefits of Secure by Design standards during the planning stages in order to secure planning permission. Unfortunately, the standard is not mandatory or enforceable and developers can drop these elements during the build without permission.\r\nThis results in many new developments having the privacy and security of their residents compromised severely which is contrary to their human rights. This applies particularly to residents in flats and more so on ground floors.\r\nMany peoples quality of life is being seriously compromised by profiteering developers who drop critical life affecting construction benefits such as this in the name of profit.",
