        "additional_details": "We are against Gravesham Borough Council's Greenbelt and Greenfield Development Plans. In particular we are against any development of land to the south of Astra Drive, and to the East of Thong lane both of which appear as Tier 1 sites in their\r\nassessment documents. They are currently unable to present a sufficiently robust assessment with which to demonstrate the 'exceptional circumstances' required in order to release Green Belt land for development in Astra Drive.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned, call upon HM Government to review the development of Greenbelt land, which would have a catastrophic effect on the local\r\ncommunity by causing blight on existing housing. The existing road network, schools, GP surgeries, road\r\ninfrastructure and local wildlife. The grade 1 and 2 high quality agricultural land would be lost. The purpose of the green belt to safeguard the countryside from encroachment would be eroded.",
