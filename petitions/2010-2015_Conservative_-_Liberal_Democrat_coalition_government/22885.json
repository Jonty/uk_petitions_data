        "additional_details": "We would like this petition to instigate a full investigation into the abuse sufferedby Hollie Greig. Highlight the failings of the justice system to proceed with a criminal case despite testimony from several organisations and expert witnesses and Hollie herself, an investigation into the down syndrome association who supported Hollies claim but backed out for no apparent reason and finally why Hollie was paid victims compensation despite there being no conviction. WE demand justice for this young lady.",
