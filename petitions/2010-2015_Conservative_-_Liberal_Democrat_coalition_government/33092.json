        "additional_details": "In many areas public transport (buses) ceases after 6  or 7 pm so unless they have a car, which is difficult for anyone in this day & age,pensioners are stuck indoors till the following day. I believe taxis & private hire vehicles should be funded by local or central government to carry pensioners free of charge for reasonable distances when there is no other public transport available.It would not be difficult to fit taxis with bus pass readers.",
