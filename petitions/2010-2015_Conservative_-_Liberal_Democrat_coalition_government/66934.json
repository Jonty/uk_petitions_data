        "additional_details": "This petition is to inform the public, and bring to the front page of the newspapers, the brutal killing of Muslim woman Nahid Almanea in Colchester. The media love to print headlines of Muslims as fanatics and extremists, yet fail to say that this is just a minority of such a peaceful religion. We want the public to know how many Muslims have been violently attacked and killed for being Muslim and this is because of the media. We want the government to step in and to become the voice of Muslims, by raising awareness of our religion and to control what the media prints about Islam, as it is religious discrimination.",
