All of this 'Fathers rights' what about the MOTHERS RIGHTS to keep there child safe and protected. Fathers are now being helped by the courts to see these children: drug takers, stalkers,  fathers with mental health problems and aggressive men are now able to see there children in contact centres and the mothers are pushed to send there children week after week to these awful places. I have come across so many women who are too scared to protect there children from these men as if they do they will be punished by the court.Children as young as a few weeks are left with these men and voluntry workers?\r\n\r\nI want to goverment to be more aware of what they are putting these young children through and to stop this from happening. NO drug user, domestic abuser should be able to see there child in a voluntry child contact centre! WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN! ",
