        "additional_details": "We request the Government to acknowledge that no person is too young to have cancer.  GPs mis-diagnose patients because often they believe a patient is 'too young' to have specific type of cancer.  For example ..... under 60 years old is considered too young to have bowel cancer.    This is age profiling. It happens - a lot!! This is costing young cancer patients their lives.  GPs need to have clear guidelines from the Department of Health that say no person is considered too young to have cancer. ",
