        "additional_details": "Whilst a petition has been offered for the saving of the headstocks, a balanced view should offered for the demolition of the same. The site would yield ideal placing of housing, retail and community facilities. The area could provide access to the wider green areas to the rear of the site and stimulate economic growth through tourism etc. The options are endless and the removal of the headstocks would provide an ideal site for future development. Retention of the headstocks may impact upon the viability of development which in turn would leave the area with a derelict building that requires continued maintaining from the public purse.",
