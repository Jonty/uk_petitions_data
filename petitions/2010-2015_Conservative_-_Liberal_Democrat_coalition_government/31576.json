        "additional_details": "As we are all aware, the benefits payments in this country are incredibly generous.\r\n\r\nI believe that all monies that people are claiming should be paid onto a Benefit Card and that the card can only be used for buying clothes and food at all major retailers and at paypoint shops. Claimants will no longer receive monies paid into their bank to be spent on anything they want.\r\n\r\nThis will stop the abuse of our money and prevent claimants from buying cigarettes, drugs or alcohol. Attempting to buy drink or cigarettes will result in the card being declined.\r\n\r\nThis will also make the thousands of irresponsible parents who have many children and expect the state to pay for them think again.\r\n\r\nI have met with Michael Gove who is keen on the idea but I want to push it to get action now.\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition so we can get the Government to act with more determination to prevent the abuse of OUR hard earned money that we pay in tax.",
