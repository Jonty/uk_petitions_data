        "additional_details": "The Armenian Genocide was carried out during and after World War I by the Ottoman Turks under the command of the 'Three Pashaas', who de facto ruled Ottoman Turkey. It resulted in the death of approximately 1.5 million people; no one was spared the barbarity that took place  and the Armenian people still suffer cultural losses as a result of the horrors that occurred.\r\n\r\nToday, approximately 21 countries including France, The Netherlands, Cyprus, Lithuania, Germany and more, recognise the genocide that destroyed the lives of over a million people. Now is the time for the UK to follow in their footsteps.\r\n\r\nApril 24th 2015 will mark the 100 year anniversary of the sufferance of the Armenian people. Let's officially recognise this barbarity and vow to never turn a blind eye to the sufferance of a people who remain scarred from the horrors their ancestors faced.\r\n\r\nRecognise the Armenian Genocide; we must never forget.",
