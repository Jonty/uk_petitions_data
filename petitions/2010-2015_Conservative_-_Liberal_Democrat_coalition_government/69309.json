Have something like  4 week get out clause from when an offer has been made then after that it is binding, unless there are extreme circumstances to cancel the offer.   House selling can take months and months, only to find one of the parties pulls out right at the last moment and there is nothing the other party can do.  There needs to be something in law to ensure both parties are serious about the sell of the house.  Getting all the relevant checks etc shouldn't take longer then 4 weeks.",
