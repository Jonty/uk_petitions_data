        "additional_details": "The BT Openreach 21CN roll out has failed to take into account service accommodation and many MoD sites.  Therefore most servicepersons and their families have access to 2Mbps or below broadband speeds.\r\nMany of these bases lie in rural areas that were specifically targeted for Government funding so that 'Superfast Broadband' could be provided to those who need it most.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to establish FTTC cabinet upgrades to all military bases as a priority so that Service personnel living in Service Family Quarters and Single Living Accommodation can be afforded facilities commensurate with their civilian counterparts.",
