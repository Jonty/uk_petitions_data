        "additional_details": "France, Belgium, Canada and America all have a Bank holiday to commemorate Armistice Day\u2026why doesn't the UK? Schools play an important part in remembering the fallen, teaching young people about the sacrifices that were made are important and should never be forgotten. Making November the 11th a Bank holiday would insure this happens. I would like government to act upon my request. I would aim to collect over one million signatures during my campaign.",
