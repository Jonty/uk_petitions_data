        "additional_details": "I wish the government to make it compulsory that car hire companies to supply legal car seats when renting out cars.\r\n\r\nI recently found it costs more to hire the child seat for 3 days than it does to hire the car.  if you need more than one the large majority of your cost becomes the child seats.  Considering the cost of the car you are hiring vs the cost of child seats the hire charge is totally disproportionate.\r\n\r\nIt seems that car hire companies are taking advantage of the law requiring the use of child seats.\r\nAlso the is currently no requirement to keep enough child seats available.  So if they run out of child seats a parent can be stuck not being legally allowed to drive the car away.\r\n\r\nSo I feel that car hire companies should be required to have enough car seats available to parents that need them and they should be supplied free of charge.\r\n\r\nIf this could be implemented European wide all the better",
