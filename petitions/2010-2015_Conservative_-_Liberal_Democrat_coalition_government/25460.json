        "additional_details": "Currently councils are telling tenants who have not paid rent or are at the end of their lease to not vacate a property until they are evicted in order for the council to rehouse them.\r\n\r\nThe local councils will not rehome until the people are physically evicted costing the landlord \u00a31,000's in legal fee's and unpaid rent. In the meantime they will give the squaters/ex tenants housing benefit without it being paid to the landlord, in effect encouraging benefit fraud by the tenant.\r\n\r\nAs it stands the council will not pursue the issue but just rehome the tenant on eviction by baliffs. This petition is for all home owners, landlords and anyone who pays taxes to the local council for them to be mis-used in this shocking way.\r\n\r\n",
