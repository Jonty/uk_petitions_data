        "additional_details": "Currently the IPCC only have limited powers when cases are referred to them. Mainly their power consists of recommendation which local police forces DO NOT have to act upon.\r\nLocal Police Force Professional Standards are departments of Officer's investigating their colleagues. They decide whether or not to act upon \"recommendations\" from the IPCC. Many complaints against Police get buried, and many Officer's resign to keep their pension as their Professional Standards colleagues close the investigation when they've resigned.  Cleveland Police is a prime example and the case of Chief Inspector Williams & DC Eastwood.",
