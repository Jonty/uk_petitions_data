Furthermore, the decision to deploy the use of water cannons on the streets of Britain should be entirely in the hands of the leading police sergeant in charge of operations, rather than the jurisdiction of the Home Office. Given this accountability, the Metropolitan Police will be able to deploy the use of water cannons with immediate effect if they deem necessary, and so prevent violence from escalating.",
