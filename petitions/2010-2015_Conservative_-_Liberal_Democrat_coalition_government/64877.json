        "additional_details": "Sign this petition to call for an end to all CCTV parking enforcement in England.\r\n\r\nCouncils are using CCTV to bring in massive revenues every year, which is completely unjustified.\r\n\r\nNot only that, all fines issued by CCTV are posted and very often are not received, councils then sell these small debts of \u00a330, \u00a360 to debt collection companies. These bailiffs add extortionate amount of fees to the original debt, ultimately forcing motorists to fork out up to 60 times the original fine!\r\n\r\nCouncils must be forced to use only Parking Enforcement Officers!",
