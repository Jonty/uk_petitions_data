        "additional_details": "This petition proposes the taxation of caravans and mobile homes, both static and touring. This would help ensure that travellers that avoid paying income tax or council tax - yet expect the benefits -  make a contribution. It would also ensure that the estimated 500,000 touring caravans that clog up our roads also pay a contribution towards the economic disruption they cause. ",
