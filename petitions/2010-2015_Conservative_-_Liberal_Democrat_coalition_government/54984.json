Unfortunately, it's affairs are managed by an unelected body the Peak District National Park Authority.\r\nTheir management of the Park is not carried out with the welfare of long-time Park residents in mind, rather with the requirements of new residents and non-residents who wish to turn the area into their perceived idyll.\r\nI would like to see the Authority abolished and replaced with a body that is accountable to local people.",
