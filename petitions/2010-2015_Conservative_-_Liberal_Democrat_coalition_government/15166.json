        "additional_details": "Sign this petition if your village currently has unacceptable network speeds. In small villages, especially in places like North Yorkshire, the availability of a fast network connection is non-existent with speeds averaging around 5mb which is unacceptable in this day and age where more and more applications are accessed in the cloud (e.g. Youtube, Spotify, Google Doc's, Xbox Cloud, etc.)\r\n\r\nFor businesses and individual users who require fast speeds and are willing to pay for the improved speeds, this is a major inconvenience.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that the small villages not be forgotten when it comes to rolling out new technologies as we are always the last to receive the latest upgrades. How are we able to move on with technology and use it effectively if we don't have sufficient speeds to do so. If nothing is done soon, how can we be expected to grow as an active online community?",
