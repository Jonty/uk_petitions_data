        "additional_details": "I would like to raise the debate for the removal of Alex Mcleish as the Manager of Aston Villa Football Club.\r\nI , like thousands of other fellow supporters, have grown tired of spending a large proportion of our income watching our club run into the ground by our current less than competent manager.\r\nOur chief executive officer is also clueless, and along with the current owner and chairman refuse to relieve him of his duties.\r\nIn the interests of saving our once great club before it is too late , I urge the secretary of state for culture media and sport to Intervene in this matter.\r\nWhilst this is strictly speaking not the responsibility of the government thousands of your midlands based constituents would be very gratefully if you could apply some gentle pressure.",
