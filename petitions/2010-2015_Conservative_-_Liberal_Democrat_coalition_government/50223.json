        "additional_details": "Passenger numbers on the Barking - Gospel Oak line have greatly increased over recent years. Electrification will ease overcrowding on this popular route.\r\n\r\nElectrification will also improve air quality in an area that suffers from pollution, and improve freight access for the new London Gateway port to promote economic growth. The upgrade has widespread support including that of London's Mayor, Transport for London, the rail industry and passenger groups. Delaying the work beyond the completion of Crossrail in 2018 will increase costs and disruption.\r\n\r\nFunding should be made available to allow electrification to proceed on the Barking - Gospel Oak rail line as soon as possible.
