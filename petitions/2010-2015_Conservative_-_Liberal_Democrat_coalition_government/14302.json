Resident Parents (usually the mother) are frustrating the family Court process in order to wrack up substantial legal fees for the Non Resident Parent. This practise should be stopped immediately. The introduction of automatic legal aid in Family Courts, especially for the Applicant,  will remove the motive for frustrating the process. Consideration should also be given to awarding costs against the Respondent parent when cases are stalled and frustrated.",
