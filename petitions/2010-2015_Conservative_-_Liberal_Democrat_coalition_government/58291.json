        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to reduce the level of fees that they can charge UK and European undergraduate students, as clearly these universities see women as second class citizens, and encourage views that are against the social, moral and cultural traditions of the UK. Its interesting to note that many of these universities would not allow the BNP or IRA to address an audience.",
