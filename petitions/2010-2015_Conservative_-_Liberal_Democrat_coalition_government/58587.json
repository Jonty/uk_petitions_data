I press Rt. Hon Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt MP to implement the following:\r\n\r\nAll medical staff who come into contact with a woman during pregnancy must be fully trained in advising of appropriate vaccinations for contagious diseases which can cause sudden infant mortality.\r\n\r\nAll staff must be fully trained in appropriate cooling off periods, maximum dosages in one administration of vaccines and minimum length of term before vaccinations can be administered.\r\n\r\nAt first check up GPs must provide literature detailing the dangers of failing to be vaccinated.\r\n\r\nAll branches of the NHS as well as community midwives must press and review vaccinations and ensure medical records are updated and that all documentation is centralised",
