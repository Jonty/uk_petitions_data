        "additional_details": "The UK has seen a significant rise in heart disease, diabetes and obesity. A well researched and documented contributing factor is unhealthy food consumption.\r\n\r\nThe 'quick glance' information on food and drink packaging is an essential indicator of the nutritional information on foods, displaying fat and sugar content in an easy, consistent fashion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is inconsistency in this information between providing nutritional information per-100g and per \"portion\". This can then be misleading, as the portion size is subjective.\r\n\r\nIt is a legal requirement to provide nutritional information per-100g on the packaging of food and drink. I want the government to enforce this standard for the 'quick glance' nutritional information as well, to make it easy to compare different products that may have different suggested portion sizes.",
