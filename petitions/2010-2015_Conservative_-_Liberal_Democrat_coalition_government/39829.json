        "additional_details": "The Government should invest in developing previously used land and derelict properties in towns rather than build in the countryside or on the Green Belt. Road-building should not increase, often destroying areas of outstanding natural beauty, and rather investment in the existing rail service should increase, ensuring a cheaper, better alternative to driving. This Government should protect what is left of our natural heritage for our benefit and that of future generations.",
