        "additional_details": "The Russian bear, U.S. eagle and cuddly Chinese panda are animals chosen for characteristics representative of their peoples. Our emblem is of a bandy legged, inbred  mastiff and this has been usurped by tv. insurance ads. Better the beloved  badger whose personality informed our childhood fiction in characters like Potter's Tommy Brock, Rupert's mate Bill etc. It is emblem for St Johns Ambulance, Fulham F.C. and the Wildlife trust. In nature it is social,playful and harmless, bravely defending family and home and like us  has no natural enemies but evil, greedy, ignorant humans.",
