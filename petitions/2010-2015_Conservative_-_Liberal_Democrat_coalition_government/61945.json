Patients who attended long term to help in managing their pain can no longer access acupuncture.  This is yet another cost cutting excercise to the detriment of patients. It is also rumoured that the pain clinics locally will soon be run by a private company.  Is this the governments way of slowly privatising the NHS.   I want the Government to look at funding the pain clinics and acupuncture properly so that they can continue to offer relief from the daily pain of a chronic condition.  ",
