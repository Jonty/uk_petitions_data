In the eventuality that these abstentions achieve a majority of the vote, parties should be legally obliged to find a replacement candidate or withdraw entirely. In other words, nominations should be re-opened. The public should be allowed to voice their disallusionment with party politics in a formal manor, while exercising their right to vote and not having to resort to \"protest votes\".",
