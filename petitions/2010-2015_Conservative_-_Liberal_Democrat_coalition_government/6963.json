        "additional_details": "The current cost of commuting is a major deterrent for many entering low paid work, especially as in many situations the loss of benefits plus the cost of fuel reduces the net pay to less than would be received by not working. As such the government should provide a subsidised lower cost fuel to aid these people back to work. This could be accomplished in a number of ways E.G. a pre-paid card, a monthy refund based on commuted mileage.",
