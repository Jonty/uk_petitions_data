        "additional_details": "I'm creating this petition as a I want the government to address the way in which pregnancy loss is managed in the NHS.\r\n\r\nIt is morally wrong and unacceptable that a woman suffering a miscarriage should be placed on a ward alongside women that are pregnant, receiving an abortion, or receiving postnatal care.\r\n\r\nIt is also distressing for women to be placed in the same ultrasound waiting room alongside women receiving normal scans.\r\n\r\nThe NHS should provide compassionate care across all hospitals in England, and a minimum standard of care should be set.\r\n\r\nMiscarriage is a life changing event! Lets make it more compassionate for women not harder. ",
