        "additional_details": "When e-petition debates are taking place, political parties should be banned from imposing \"whips\". The EU Referendum debate of 24/10/11 is a good of example of why this should be the case. Even though the petition got enough signatures to be debated, all three of the main parties imposed whips on their members to vote against the referendum which made the debate itself pointless: most MPs just voted the way they were told. All they really did was talk about it for 5 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen whips are allowed to be imposed on these debates there is no point in having them as normally the Government can control the majority of MPs' votes. If the Government doesn't want something to happen it won't and if they did want it to happen they'd be no point of having an e-petition as they could just propose it themselves in the House of Commons.",
