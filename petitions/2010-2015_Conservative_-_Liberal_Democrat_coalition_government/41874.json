        "additional_details": "This petition aims to get enough signatures to force a debate in parliament on the UK's foreign policy on nations introducing laws that outlaw homosexuality. Uganda and Nigeria are both in the process of these laws and commonwealth countries like Jamaica have had them in place for years. This petition proposes a strong foreign policy of completely cutting all aid/partnerships with nations introducing such prejudice and oppressive laws and re-channelling the funds to fighting these laws and cater for the socio-political refugees such laws will create.",
