        "additional_details": "This petition has been created because Pontypridd High Schools Anti-Bullying Policy and the way it is administered is clearly not a deterrent.  Pupils at the school that suffer from cases of bullying deserve more from the school, the teachers and other school staff members.\r\nI suggest a change in Pontypridd High Schools Anti-Bullying Policy to reflect the following\r\nRaise awareness of bullying on the grounds of protected characteristics with pupils, parents, staff, and governors and take a more proactive approach to preventing and mitigating its effects\r\nConsult pupils, parents, and others, to identify the extent and nature of bullying in the school and to agree the contents of strategic equality plans\r\nEnsure staff have a clear understanding of the extent and nature of bullying that may take place in the school, including cyberbullying\r\nMake sure all policies and procedures meet the requirements of the Equality Act 2010.\r\n\r\n",
