Except for the odd dip, cannabis use has grown year on year, especially the amount of regular users.\r\nI would propose that cannabis is decriminalised and that a home growers licensing scheme is put in place, once they have the required and passed the criteria to receive a license, they will be able to grow it in the privacy of their own home.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only will this generate revenue for the economy, it will eliminate the criminal element overnight and give choice to millions of productive and valuable members of our society.\r\n",
