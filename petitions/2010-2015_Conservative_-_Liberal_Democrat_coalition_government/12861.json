        "additional_details": "I believe cycle lanes do help to prevent cyclists coming into contact with motor vehicles.\r\n   .\r\nThis benefit however is lost and worse, becomes a danger, when these cycle lanes are blocked by parked vehicles.\r\n     .\r\nParked cars and other vehicles stationary in the cycle lanes require cyclists to leave their designated lanes and move into the road and hence into the path of other vehicles.\r\n.\r\nThis deviation into the road itself requires both types of road-user to predict what the other is going to do and act according to that prediction. A prediction that if wrong could cause injury to the cyclist or the veering motor vehicle to enter the path of on-coming traffic.\r\n   .\r\nIn my opinion, fines should be imposed upon vehicles found to be clearly parking on cycle lanes for any length of time.",
