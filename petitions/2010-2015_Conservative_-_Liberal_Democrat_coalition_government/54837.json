If imposed it will deter people from improving their homes and will impact building industry businesses.\r\n\r\nAnybody with a home just below the threshold or above the threshold will be reluctant to make improvements to their property as this will increase their liability to the tax.\r\n\r\nBringing in a mansion tax to raise a few billion is counterproductive. Is it not obvious that the Governent treasury dept will lose out far more in tax revenues from the building industry as homeowners cut back home improvement projects. This will be significantly negative for employment in the building industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
