Where there is a father in the background \u2013 that father should take full responsibility. With DNA testing, this should not prove difficult. Otherwise this should be entirely the responsibility of the single mum or deserted wife\u2019s  immediate family. It is far too easy for Dads to walk away from girlfriends and wives, and far too many do so with the knowledge that the state will provide. Children ideally require a decent upbringing with both a mother and father figure to provide role models and instill values.
