I met with my local housing officer to discuss the number of dogs on the property. It was agreed that I would have a trial period and that \"we will see how things go\". This, however was NOT given to me in writing. I have been the victim of a 'hate campaign' for three years by one set of neighbours who have FIVE dogs on their property. After a period of 7 months with NO complaints regarding the dogs' behaviour, the council received a complaint regarding an accidental litter. Based on this ONE complaint I now can only have two dogs. My son and I have on going health issues and our dogs are a source of providing pleasure and comfort. I believe this decision to be wrong and discriminatory against someone who rents their home and someone who own their home.",
