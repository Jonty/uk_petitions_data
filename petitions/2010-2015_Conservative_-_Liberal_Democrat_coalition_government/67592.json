We need laws to state that the marketing of animals in pet stores is prohibited, as well as exhibition and display to the public for commercial purposes, thus banning the sale of these dogs and cats from pet shops. I believe that insufficient emphasis is placed upon the welfare of the animals being sold and there is an absence of statutory duty on vendors to ensure that those purchasing animals have the \u00acknowledge, experience and facilities to care for them properly. Puppies should only be sold where purchasers are able to see the puppy interacting with the mother and assess her temperament and to see the \u00acconditions in which the puppy was bred and not behind a shop window.\r\nCurrently pet shops are not monitored and the health and welfare of the animals are not checked.\r\n\r\n",
