        "additional_details": "Terrorism is the use of fear and intimidation to achieve political aims. The EDL ostensibly aims to fight Islamic extremism, but is indiscriminate in it's targeting with many members espousing racist, islamophobic and xenophobic views. A recent survey shows that 61% believe EDL activity makes terrorist attacks more likely.\r\n\r\nEDL tactics involve marches into areas known to be hostile to their presence due to the views they espouse - not dissimilar to those similar tactics of the Nazi SA (Brownshirts). Indeed, at a recent march outside Whitehall, EDL activists were observed to perform Nazi salutes near the war memorial.\r\n\r\nTheir activities are anti-British, have instilled palpable fear into the ethnic populations of the UK (stoking racial tensions and increasing the likelihood of radicalisation of vulnerable marginalised groups), and have intimidated those who oppose extremism in all forms. We call on the Government to acknowledge the EDL as a terrorist group",
