We do not know what the state of the economy will be in 30 years' time and we may be giving the taxpayers of that time an unbearable burden. The politicians of today who have made that\r\npromise will not be around in many decades time to deliver that promise. Simply, promises of this kind should not be made. Students should be told they will have to pay back their loans in full no matter how long it takes. It should be up to the politicians who will be in power in many decades time to decide if student loans should be written off. ",
