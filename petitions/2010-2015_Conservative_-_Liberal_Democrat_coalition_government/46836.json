        "additional_details": "We petition the government to ban the practice of awarding attendance certificates in Primary Schools in the UK.  We believe that to do so punishes children who are absent due to ill health.  It is an unrealistic goal for both pupils and the parents/guardians of unwell children. There is no evidence base to support the practice and we question the efficacy of attendance as a success measure in schools.",
