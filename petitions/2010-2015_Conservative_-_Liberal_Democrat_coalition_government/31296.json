It is feared that this aid may encourage the financial exploitation of the Ugandan Oil fields. This petition aims to persuade the UK government to...\r\n\r\n-Send UK diplomats and regulating bodies into Uganda to ensure that oil trade in Uganda gains high levels of 'transparency' and accountability.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that this will enable the Ugandan state to minimize the chance of internal and external oil trade corruption. In turn, it is thought that the Ugandan state will be able to develop more prosperously.\r\n",
