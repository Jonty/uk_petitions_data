Whilst protecting the wealthy with a tax cut of 5%, those in the middle, and at the bottom continue to suffer as the cost of living continues to rise inexorably, as workers face pay freezes/cuts, and those most vulnerable and desperate to work are being hit the hardest thus driving many more millions into fuel poverty.  This winter alone has seen an estimated 11000 extra, and wholly needless deaths due to the cold weather, how many more must die whilst under the 'watch' of this ineffectual Chancellor?\r\n\r\n",
