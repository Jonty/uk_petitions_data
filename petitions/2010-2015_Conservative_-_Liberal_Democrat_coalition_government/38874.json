        "additional_details": "The English Baccalaureate Certificate (EBacc) is an outrageous overhaul of the current GCSE system.\r\n\r\nGCSEs are not perfect, but there needs to be cross-party collaboration on the issue. Reform must be timely and well thought out.\r\n\r\nEach and every student should receive a qualification that accurately reflects their ability. A qualification that doesn't discriminate against one portion of students and in favour of another.\r\n\r\nThe EBacc is a clear attempt to return to an O-level type qualification, without the tainted name. A previous Conservative government made the reforms that brought us out of the dark days of mass educational divide. Let us convince the Secretary of State to do the same.\r\n\r\nStop the EBacc. We must return to GCSEs and one day move past them to a fair, reasonable, skill-based qualification set for our students.\r\n\r\nBritain must remain a hub, renowned throughout the world, for education at all levels.",
