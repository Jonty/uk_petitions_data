        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask the Goverment to commit to a rolling programme of electrification on Britains Railways. Diesel powered trains are unsustainable in the long run, slower and less reliable than their electric counterparts. They are also costlier to maintain and with peak oil the price of fuel will keep on going up. We appreciate that the initial costs are high, but electrification will reduce the running costs of local lines and improve efficiency to the extent that over a period of time they will again become profitable, and a lot of the diesel units in use on these lines will be life expired in 15years or so. It would be foolish to build more diesels with a 30year lifespan and electric or interim bi-mode is the only way forward. The time to plan is now.",
