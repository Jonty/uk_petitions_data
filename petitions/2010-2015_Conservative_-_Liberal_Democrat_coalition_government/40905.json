        "additional_details": "Hydralic fracturing / fracking is highly controversial and is a real danger to our already devastated natural environment. In the U.S.A where fracking is legal, local residents of fracking sites, experience the devastation of their land and  water. Their once clean drinking water, becomes poisonous and high flamable. The UK  government should be looking to invest in green/free energy, rather then contaminating our land and water. Make hydralic fracturing / fracking illegal in the UK.",
