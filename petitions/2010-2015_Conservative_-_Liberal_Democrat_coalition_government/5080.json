This includes the cost to the police, any court costs, the cost of the crime itself e.g. vandalism to a bus shelter or damage to a stolen car, as well as more serious crimes such as investigation into murder, rape and drug offences!  What ever the cost of the crime committed from it being reported to its closure, the person should pay for it.  The cost will be deducted at a 25% rate of their total income, be it a wage, JSA, ESA or any other form of income!",
