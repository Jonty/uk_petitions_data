        "additional_details": "On Saturday 10 May 2014 a group who call themselves \"Britain First\" invaded (to use their terminology) several mosques in Bradford.\r\n\r\nThey entered the mosques with their shoes on and were handing out military bibles and anti-grooming leaflets. They were dressed in a qausi-SAS style and intimated those people who were present, some of whom were worshippers.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no laws which explicitly makes it a criminal offence to enter any place of worship to disrespect people of those faith or with intent to do so.\r\n\r\nWe demand the government takes action on this inadequacy in the law and introduces new laws which make it a criminal offence for anyone to behave the way members of Britian First did inside or in the immediate vicinity of any place of worship.\r\n\r\nThe actions of Britain First were unacceptable and we must ensure they are not repeated.\r\n\r\nWorshippers have the right to feel safe from actions like this when inside a place of worship and the law must reflect this.",
