Many of our young people do not have the money to go to sport facilities, gyms, recreational activities where they live, all of these fun and healthy activities are too expensive. Lets invest in our next adult generation and help them rather than condemn them. A fee-free (non means tested) sports club pass, for 11-21 year olds would help.",
