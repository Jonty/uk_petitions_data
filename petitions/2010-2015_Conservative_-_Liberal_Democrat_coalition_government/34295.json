        "additional_details": "I have a rural background.\r\nI am not against game shooting per se.\r\nI am against destruction of birds of prey. Their numbers have increased in recent years, especially Buzzards and Red Kites. This is good news for everyone except gamekeepers. Maintenance of game numbers should not resort to culling of birds of prey. I consider the predation of game birds to be a risk that the gamekeepers should accept. It is not acceptable to cull a wild population to maintain an unnecessary artificial one. I am also concerned about the side-effects from doing culling birds of prey, e.g. increased vermin population.",
