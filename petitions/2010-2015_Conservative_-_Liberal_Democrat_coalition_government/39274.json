        "additional_details": "Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and scientists are more than 90% certain most of it is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels. Despite the broad international scientific consensus, allegations have been made that these researchers and institutions are part of a global scientific conspiracy. There have been investigations into some alleged malpractice, most notably the Climatic Research Unit email controversy. The Muir Russell report stated, however, \"We do find that there has been a consistent pattern of failing to display the proper degree of openness, both on the part of CRU scientists and on the part of the UEA.\"The scientific consensus that global warming is occurring as a result of human activity remained unchanged at the end of the investigations. We want the government to release the truth on global warming.",
