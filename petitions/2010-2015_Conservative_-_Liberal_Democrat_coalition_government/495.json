Formula one is part of our national heritage, it was born here. If this is allowed to go ahead this sport will go the way of the rest of our sports heritage tv coverage. Please keep Formula 1 as a free to air sport. Formula 1 must not be allowed to go the way of Test Cricket, Football and Boxing.",
