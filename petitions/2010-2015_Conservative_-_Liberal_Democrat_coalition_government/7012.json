        "action": "Let magistrates' courts be legal courts of law.",
        "additional_details": "\"The magistrates' court is not a court of record and therefore there are no [official] reports of your appearances in court.\" This is from a signed letter to me from Court Manager Graham Rutherford @ the Manchester branch of Her Majesty's Court Service; dated 9th September 2008 & referenced GR/YOE. It means that evidence is entirely irrelevant, everything depending on the JP's whim, helped by a legal expert.  This denies due process of law, in which evidence is basicly important. It cannot please JPs, nor criminal lawyers, nor judges. Defeated parties must appeal to a higher court, where evidence is vital; with a salaried judge &, perhaps, a jury. This is much more costly, delays due process, and causes deep distress.\r\n  Please let all evidence given in a magistrate's court be officially recorded. Thank you.\r\n",
