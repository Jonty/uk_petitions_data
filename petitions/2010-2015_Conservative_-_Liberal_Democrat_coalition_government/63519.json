        "additional_details": "Maria Miller has not only broken rules she has also used her special advisors to try to bully public servants. She showed distain for the British government system as well as the electorate when she gave a  50 second non apology for her fraudulent claims which actually amounted, in cash terms, to more than many UK citizens earn in 2 years. She should no longer be considered to be a fit member of the cabinet. She should be sacked.",
