        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call upon the British Government to use all channels and powers available to them to prevent the wrongful execution of Troy Anthony Davis and an outrageous affront to justice.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday 21st September 2011 at 7PM EDT Troy Davis is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection in the State of Georgia, USA.\r\n\r\nConvicted in 1989 of the murder of off-duty police officer Mark MacPhail, of the 9 eyewitnesses, 7 have subsequently recanted while 2 others have changed their testimony to implicate another man.\r\n\r\nThis is Davis' 4th execution date, the previous 3 having been stayed shortly before the sentence was due to be carried out.\r\n\r\nDespite overwhelming popular support and a deeply flawed legal basis for conviction, on Tuesday morning Georgia's State Board of Pardons and Paroles rejected Davis' final clemency petition.\r\n\r\nGeorgia Department of Corrections and the USA are hours away from committing an act of murder and the execution of a potentially innocent man.",
