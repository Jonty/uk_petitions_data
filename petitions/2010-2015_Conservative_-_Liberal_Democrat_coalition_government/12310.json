We call upon the government to:\r\n- Make work pay by supporting a living wage of \u00a37.20 (\u00a38.30 London)\r\n- Tackle fuel poverty, as 24% of households will find it difficult to heat their homes this winter.\r\n- Use progressive taxation to address the culture of excessive corporate pay and bonuses.\r\n- Stop planned cuts to the EMA in England and support a comprehensive jobs fund for all areas of the country.\r\n\r\n",
