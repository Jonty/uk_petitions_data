        "additional_details": "Responsible department: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nDespite overwhelming negative public opinion on the sale and use of caged hen's eggs in the UK, this barbaric, cruel and unnecessary practice still continues to thrive in this country, casting animal welfare aside in view of increased profits for the producers and food retailers. Battery cages are due to be banned in the European Union from 2012 after a 10-year phaseout, being replaced by so called \"enriched\" cages. This new standard of cage has been criticised by many for providing no significant welfare benefits compared to the conventional battery cages they are supposed to be replacing. I believe therefore there should be a debate in parliament on a ban on the use and import of eggs from any caged animal.",
