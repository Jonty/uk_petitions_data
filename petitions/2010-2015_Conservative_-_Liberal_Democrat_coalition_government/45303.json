        "additional_details": "being a peadophile is not a mental health issue nor is it curable.\r\nthey should not be separated from other prisoners in prison and given a life of luxury. they should not be renamed when released back into the community as they should be disgraced for what theyve done. we should be able to know these people are within our communities so we can protect our future.OUR CHILDREN.. and i think the death penalty should be taken into account. every other country has severe punishments so why are we living in the past and letting these people ruin lives and our country. we are meant to be GREAT BRITAIN but our laws sadly make me disagree. we are a doormat of a country and have no proper control of these people. i say its time something was changed. and finally i dont agree that human rights laws should be implemented in these cases as they are sick and inhumane and didnt take into account the childs human rights when they commited theyre obsenities.",
