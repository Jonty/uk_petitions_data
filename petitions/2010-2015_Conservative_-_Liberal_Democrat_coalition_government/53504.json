        "additional_details": "My waste bin is crawling with maggots and is not due to be collected for another 8 days by Halton Borough Council, as we are part of the fortnightly collection trial.  We're in our hottest summer for years and need weekly waste bin collections.  I pay the same council tax as others across the town yet many of them still have weekly collections.  Having spoken to the council today the intention is to roll out fortnightly collections for everybody.  This will cause an unacceptable health hazard, as can be seen by the state of my bin today.  Weekly waste bin collections are a health NECESSITY, not a luxury!!  To add insult to injury we even pay to have the bin cleaned every time it is emptied!!!",
