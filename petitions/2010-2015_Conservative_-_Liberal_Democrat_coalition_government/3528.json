        "additional_details": "Everybody should have the right to be married in the UK.\r\n\r\nMarriage may be seen by some as a 'religious institution', however this is out-dated. Many people in our country see marriage as a part of life. It is seen through the people around us, in our entertainment and even endorsed by our own government. Yet there is still a section of the UK's society that is banned from marrying the person that they love and being forced into the unattractive category of a \"civil partnership\".\r\n\r\nLet everybody have the same opportunities. Sign this petition today.",
