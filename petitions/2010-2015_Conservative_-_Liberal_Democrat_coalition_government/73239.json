        "additional_details": "For too long the streets have been plagued by boy racers. These individuals buy cheap cars and modify them into unsafe racing vehicles. Multiple deaths and lifelong injuries have occurred due to the crashes and incompetent driving of these vehicles. Often drivers who have caused deaths or injuries walk away with light sentences and ignore the banned driving orders against them.\r\n\r\nIf a new ban is enforced to prevent these modifications, this will null the boy racer culture.\r\n\r\nTop performance cars should not be affected by this as they have been designed for top speeds and are safer and better insured. This ban will also create an increase in sales of performance vehicles that will contribute to the economy.\r\n\r\nThe ban need only be on the parts used in upgrading cheaper cars and not the cars themselves.\r\n ",
