Less money being spent on traffic incidents. Less deaths. Less crime. Green technology.\r\n\r\nIt would also restore some of the manufactoring industry in Britain and offer great job opportunities.\r\n\r\nMake them a realistic option to young drivers by offering attractive deals to own one instead of a manual car.\r\n\r\nAllow owners to charge their cars with excess electricity from solar panels or build charging stations. Or invest in the technology that allows cars to charge whilst driving.",
