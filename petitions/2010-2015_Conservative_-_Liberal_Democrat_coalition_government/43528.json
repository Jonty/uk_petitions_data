We disagree entirely with the Government's policy and want a policy which is in line with that practiced by Australia, New Zealand and Canada; they  will only accept people who have a job to go to and actually contribute skills which are in short supply.\r\n\r\nUK immigration policy should not open the floodgates for anybody who simply has a hard life where they currently live.  The benefits and healthcare systems are not the property of the Government to just give away freely, they are the property of we citizens who have contributed to them.\r\n\r\nGovernment should scrap all plans which allow unselective immigration and formulate new policy with view to conserving what remains of England.\r\n\r\n",
