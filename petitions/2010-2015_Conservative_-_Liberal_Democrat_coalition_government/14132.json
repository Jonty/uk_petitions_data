        "additional_details": "The media often represents the shapshot of a \"dead-beat\" dad and single mother to represent modern family breakdowns. However, the more sinister image lurking beneath is that often, women are using the Child Support Agency as a system to use their children as cash machines. Fathers can be subjected to crippling monthly payments to support their children, but denied access to see them. The government must take action to help fathers to see their children without going through the court system and spending large amounts of money on legal fees. Both parents should automatically be allowed joint access, and jointly responsible for the care of their children - having a child is a 50/50 experience, so why is it that men are being denied a fundamental right to see their children?
