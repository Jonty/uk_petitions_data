In order to earn that pay , we are on occasion required to pass random urine tests for drugs and alcohol, with which we have no problem.\r\nSome of our taxes are given to people claiming benefits, people less fortunate than ourselves and unable to work. Unfortunately some of these people have no intention of working and prefer to make a career out of claiming benefits and living a life on drugs and alcohol, at our expense.\r\nWe would like the government to introduce random/compulsory drug and alcohol testing for all benefit claimants. Genuine claimants should have no problems passing such tests.\r\nIf we have to be drug and alcohol free to pay taxes, then people receiving them should be too, in order that those that are capable are 'actively seeking work.'",
