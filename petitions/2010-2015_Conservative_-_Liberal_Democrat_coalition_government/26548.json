At the moment people under the age of 18 only have a passport to prove their age. Passports are not ideal for carrying to cinema's and buying age-restricted games. They are bulky, a target for thieves and when lost take time to replace. It would be better to have a form of identification (similar a driving licence in style and size) to prove your age (i.e. 15) so that you would be allowed into the cinema to view a film, no questions asked.",
