        "additional_details": "The undersigned petition the government to expand the medical conditions eligible to receive erectile dysfunction treatment on an NHS prescription, to include mental illness e.g. depression, anxiety, OCD, GAD, etc.\r\n\r\nMany commonly prescribed anti-depressants cause sexual dysfunction such as impotence. Some patients stop taking their medication to alleviate the sexual dysfunction however this invariably results in the return of the depression symptoms e.g. suicidal thoughts. As this ultimateley can be a life or death situatuation surely it must be reasonable for the NHS to fund medication to treat sexual dysfunction, e.g. Sildenafil (viagra), to prevent the risk of suicidal patients stopping their medication.",
