        "action": "HMG should repeal being signatory to treaties & human rights; observing ECHR & ECJ judgements; refugee conventions that harm UK\u2019s interests",
        "additional_details": "Constitutional Law stresses that Westminster Parliament is the supreme sovereign & highest legislative authority in UK & can legislate on any matter (including retrospective legislation) whatsoever. Any legislations allowing Scottish Parliament to leave the UK; enabling EU treaties to be enforced in UK; binding UK to observe ECHR & ECJ judgements; determining who is entitled to reside & work in UK; etc could be repealed by future Westminster Parliament. Likewise Human Rights Act can be repealed; as well as replacing EU Charter of Fundamental Rights & the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees with a British Bill of Rights. UK Parliament does not, under Scotland Act, provide Scottish Parliament legislative competence to legislate for an independent Scotland. UK Parliament should determine who is entitled to vote in the Scottish referendum & which single direct unambiguous (\u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019) question to ask at the referendum. Past HMG cannot bind future UK Parliament.",
