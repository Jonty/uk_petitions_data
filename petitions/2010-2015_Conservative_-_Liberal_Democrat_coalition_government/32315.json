        "additional_details": "I have just found out my grandaughter has yet another day off school due to TEACHER TRAINING. I also recently heard a report about the concern of the standard of the basic 3 R's ... surely the two go together ... Why are these days necessary ... why can they not have teacher training days in the 13 weeks (approx) of school holidays ... These days do not only have an inpact on the students, they also have an inpact on the parents, that need to take time off work, and the employers, who lose staff which could lead to a loss of production ... Are we allowed to take the children out of school when it suits us, for cheap holidays or even doctor appointments ... NO ... but the children can stay away from school when it suits them ... I think we need to work together to put a STOP to these days ...Please isign this petition and lets see if we can get a big enough group to get something done about changing this",
