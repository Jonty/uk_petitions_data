        "additional_details": "In light of the recent UK Social unrest National Service maybe the way forward. The Army will teach self respect, respect for others, discipline, guidance and a trade. I think however it shouldn't be used to teach the art of war but to offer value to the community, to reconnect those who are disconnected from the social fiber of tolerance and compromise. It could benefit the nation in so many ways. Less youth crime, less unemployment leading to vast social deprivation, a bolstered armed forces, easing of the prison overcrowding problem. I would like the Government to put this out to the Public Domain to obtain feeling. ",
