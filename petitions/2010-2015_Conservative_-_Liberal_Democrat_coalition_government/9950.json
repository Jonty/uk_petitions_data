        "additional_details": "Restrict Motabilty cars to base models or a very basic car. I understand that people may need to 'get about' but just because they happen to fit the criteria and eligibilty for a 'free' car, doesnt mean they can choose some top spec model and pay the peanuts in extra allowance for it. If people honestly need a car to get about, they will be more than happy with a nice new base model car to suit thier needs. Just take away this nonsense of having any model you like by topping up a pittance amount",
