        "additional_details": " Elemental mercury from dental fillings is contaminating\r\nthe environment----it is the main source of mercury.\r\nSome countries such as Sweden have banned mercury\r\namalgam fillings, mainly for this reason. They were banned in Russia and eastern bloc countries in 1960.\r\n Of course as this mercury is not safe in the environment it cannot be safe accumulating inside the\r\nhuman brain and body.\r\n The Mercury Amalgam Industry claims that if you\r\nhave mercury amalgam fillings, the average patient\r\nis exposed to no more mercury than from the food\r\nthat they eat.But the amount of mercury is actually 6\r\ntimes more than they claim.\r\n\r\nSome of the mercury in your food actually originates\r\nfrom dental amalgam anyway! Most of the mercury\r\nin food is ORGANIC and that from amalgam is\r\nELEMENTAL MERCURY VAPOR which is much more dangerous. The accumulation of elemental\r\nmercury in some parts of the brain is 27 years, for\r\norganic mercury 70 days.\r\nSo mercury amalgam must be banned asap.\r\n",
