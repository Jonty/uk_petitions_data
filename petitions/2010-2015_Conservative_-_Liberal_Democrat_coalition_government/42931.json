        "additional_details": "It is morally wrong for people nominated by politicians who are out of touch with reality to be the ones to choose where charitable donations from lottery ticket purchases should go.  The people currently doing this have no idea what is going on at grass roots level in this country and have no appreciation of the effect that targetting charitable donations to organisations at grass roots level would have.  Put that choice in the hands of the donator by putting tick boxes on lottery tickets so that the purchaser may decide where the money should go.  ",
