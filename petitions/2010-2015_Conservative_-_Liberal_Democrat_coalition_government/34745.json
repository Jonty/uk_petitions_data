        "additional_details": "This petition is to force Devon County Council to finish the link from Grenofen with the Route 27 Cycle Path in a safe manner. They have not persued the Compulsory Purchase that was discussed over 5 years ago, and now are forcing residents of Grenofen to cross the A386 at one of its fastest and most dangerous points. We want the government to ensure the process is not forgotten and is pushed as a priority before someone is killed. So far millions of tax payers money has been spent on this small section, and to cut off a link which has already cost tens of thousands and not be used is a disgrace and funds mismanaged. Small business has been made to suffer in this project so far and will be completely cut off due to this decision. ",
