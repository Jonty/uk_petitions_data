        "additional_details": "2000 people are killed every year on our roads, and another 20,000 are seriously injured.  This is a particularly common cause of death and serious disablement for younger people.  This petition therefore calls for safety hats to be made compulsory for all car drivers and passengers.  Cars are heavy-duty, high-speed machinery, and despite modern innovations such as seat belts and air bags, brain injuries are still a leading cause of death and injury.  A study by the University of Adelaide has even shown that a simple bicycle-style helmet would cut brain injuries by 50% and save 1 in 5 crash victims.  What are we waiting for?",
