        "additional_details": "Much of the rural housing stock in the UK is substandard.My local council has no money for renovation grants.I propose the government sets aside a sum of money to pay for the repairs to elderly people like myself, and puts a lien against the home. When the person dies or moves house and sells it, the lien gets paid back with interest.Such a scheme would eventually be self financing as the liens get paid back with interest, into the grant 'pot' as it were. As things stand, vulnerable older and disabled people live in houses that are unfit for human habitation which is a national scandal in a 1st world country!",
