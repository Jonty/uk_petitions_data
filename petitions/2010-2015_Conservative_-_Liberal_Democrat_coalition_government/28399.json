        "additional_details": "The devolved parliament of Scotland wishes to hold a referendum asking citizens living in Scotland if they wish to leave the union. If this referendum resulted in a \"Yes\" vote, it would result in the break up of the United Kingdoms of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a whole country. Citizens of the UK living anywhere else will have no say in this fracturing - even those of Scottish birth or ancestry.\r\n\r\nI call upon the UK Government to hold a legally binding referendum, open to all eligible voters in the entire UK, on whether we wish our country to be split up, or whether we wish it to stay as a single unified United Kingdom.",
