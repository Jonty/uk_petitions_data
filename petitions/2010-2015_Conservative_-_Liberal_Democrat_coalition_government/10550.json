We want law and order.  We want strong policing which upholds the law.  We want reduced crime rates and cleaner streets.  We want to feel safe to walk in ALL parts of our city.  Statistics show zero tolerance policing works:  in New York major crime has fallen by 39% and murder has fallen by 49% as a result.  Let's demand nothing less for London! ",
