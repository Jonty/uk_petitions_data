        "additional_details": "This e-petition is so that student finance can now cover every students accommodation. As student finance is means tested, students with higher earning families get less on their loans, meaning that their accommodation isn't covered. Student Finance assume that everyones parents can afford to help them out, when in fact they can't. How can it be 'fair' that some people get \u00a37000 on their loans and others get \u00a33610. ",
