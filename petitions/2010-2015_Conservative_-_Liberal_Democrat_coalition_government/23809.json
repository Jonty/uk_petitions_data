Who should have the right to say. To censor my voice.\r\nWhy is speaking about significant petitions raised on here in parliament optional? it should be mandatory! In my opinion E-petitions may as well be saying, your opinion means nothing unless politicians feel like it should.\r\nThat's not giving someone a voice, that's cleaver meaningless politics giving rise to good publicity.\r\nE-petitions should be saying if a significantly high number of people sign a petition, it forces a discussion in parliament.\r\nGive us real power, not false hope we may be heard.\r\nSign this petition for your support to giving your voice real power. Petitions signed on e-petitions by a great consensus should mandatorily be topics discussed before parliament. Parliament should be forced into discussion.\r\n",
