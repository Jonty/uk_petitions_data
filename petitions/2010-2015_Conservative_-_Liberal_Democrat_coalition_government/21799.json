        "additional_details": "Chinese Lanterns are very popular, however the public are not area of the potential damage they cause to the countryside and its related businesses.\r\n\r\nDuring the harvest period, lanterns can cause a great deal of damage through fire instigation. Hay and bedding for livestock can be destroyed in hours leaving farmers in a very perilous financial situation.\r\n\r\nThe metal part of the lantern does not biodegrade and can be incorporated into feed and fed to animals causing extensive gastrointestinal damage or death. Farm machinery can be subjected to excessive and unecessary mechanical wear as a result of the metal frame littering the countryside.\r\n\r\nWith regard to lanterns being released near the coast, a great deal of the RNLI's resources and time has been wasted responding to their resemblance as distress flares.",
