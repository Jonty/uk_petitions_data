        "additional_details": "I request that the government consider reducing the amount it spends on foreign aid during these time of austerity in the UK.\r\n\r\nProblems in foreign countries (i.e. Africa) are not significantly improving over time.  Too much of our money is going into the wrong hands ie. corrupt dictators.  Aid that we do send should not be in the form of payment.  Our aid should be tangible ie. British teams physically going to a particular country and completing a specific job ie. digging wells for water.\r\n\r\nVoters are tired of seeing their tax dollars wasted - ESPECIALLY now when we could use that money for so much in our own country.\r\n\r\nPLEASE LISTEN TO THE VOTERS AND REDUCE FOREIGN AID SPENDING IN LINE WITH OTHER DEVELOPED COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE US, FRANCE OR GERMANY.",
