Taxpayer funded employees do not have a job description which authorises them to commit criminal acts as part of their job on behalf of their employer so the taxpayer should not be held financially liable for taxpayer funded employee criminal acts.  The taxpayer must NOT continue to support criminals in the continuing conduct of their criminal activities.  Negligence is criminal, the NHS Positively encourages negligence by blocking legal action against individual employees by name.",
