        "additional_details": "This space sector is one of the fastest growing areas of the global economy, and whilst the UK is a player in non human space technology, we are yet to send our own citizens into space. When the next 'goldrush' is discovered in space, the UK is in danger of being at the bottom of the pile. Secondly, the British people are desperate for something to really be proud of, and to show we can still be pioneers of exploration. There is no doubt that a space programme costs money, particularly human space flight, and there will be those that argue that in a time of austerity, it is something we can ill afford. My answer to this however, would be, the economic rewards would be plentiful, both in terms of hi tech jobs, and future resources from space. Further to this, the restoration of national pride in a major project is priceless.",
