        "additional_details": "Family Courts are held in private and outcomes are usually based on reports from Cafcass (Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service). These reports may cite evidence from psychologists who act as expert witnesses. However, a closed system leads to lack of accountability and the abuse of power by those few individuals who have learnt how to bend the rules, either as a short cut or for more personal reasons.\r\n\r\nChecks and balances are necessary to prevent laxity or corruption in our legal services. This petition calls for private regulating bodies, such as the Health and Care Professions Council, to have an Ombudsman appointed so that complaints to those bodies can be properly upheld.",
