        "additional_details": "I would like the UK government to make a stand at an UN/EU gathering over violence towards gays in countries such as Russia/ Nigeria etc.\r\n\r\nRecent media attention on the subject has highlighted treatment that is unacceptable in today's society. In a world that is becoming more connected through globalisation, there is no place for un-tolerance to exist in any part of society. While people are free to have their own opinions, these opinions should not support un-tolerance and violence to any member of society, in such a disgusting way as recent attention has highlighted.\r\n\r\nI believe strongly that the International Community, led by the UK and other advanced nations should make their stance against this violence clear.\r\n\r\nThis petition is asking for tolerance and for violence to end, while each individual is entitled to their own opinion, these opinions should not be used to preach hate and violence.\r\n",
