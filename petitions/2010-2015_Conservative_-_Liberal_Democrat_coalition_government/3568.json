        "additional_details": "We call upon the Government to reconsider its implicit conception of education as nothing more than an instrument for the creation of economic growth.\r\n\r\nInstead of continuing with the monolithic focus on subjects which are practical in nature, we believe it is necessary to also use education to cultivate the minds of future generations, to ensure our citizenry continues to think critically about social issues.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we believe the subject devoted to engaging with arguments and questioning authority is essential to the democratic process. To thus sustain our system of government, and to ensure it continues to flourish, we call upon the introduction of Philosophy into the National Curriculum.",
