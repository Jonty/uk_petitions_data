        "additional_details": "Having several mobile phone networks in the UK, each with its own set of masts, is hugely inefficient, especially in low-density rural areas.  Foreign visitors can roam onto all UK networks, so get better coverage than natives.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT ACTION: Mandate roaming between UK networks so any user can connect via any network, but termination charges between networks would not be passed on to users.\r\n\r\nThere are benefits for everybody: - Users would get better coverage; - The environment would need fewer phone masts; - The rural economy would get better mobile and 3G coverage; - The nation would benefit from more efficient use of scarce spectrum; - Competition would benefit because networks have an immediate financial incentive (i.e termination charges) to improve their coverage.\r\n",
