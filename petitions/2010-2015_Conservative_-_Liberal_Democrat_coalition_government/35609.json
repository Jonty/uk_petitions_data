        "additional_details": "The UK government is currently consulting on plans to put all tobacco products in plain packaging. We all know that the government gets billions of pounds worth of duty from tobacco, and they must relish in this, at the same time as putting on a front that they want smoking to end in this country. If its so bad, then ban the sale of tobacco full stop. In damaging the tobacco industry they are also putting thousands of peoples jobs and livelihoods at risk. Putting people on the dole will not solve the economic crisis. Why kill of an industry which makes billions? if the government is serious about preventing smoking, then they should be serious about other industry which causes harm to consumers as well. Tobacco is not the only one. Stop the plans to kill off the tobacco industry.",
