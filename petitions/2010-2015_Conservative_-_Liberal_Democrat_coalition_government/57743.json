        "additional_details": "The current Ukrainian government has turned the country away from its path towards prosperity, liberty and justice and towards corruption with the imprisonment of Yulia Tymoshenko and most recently with the cessation of talks for closer association with the European Union.\r\n\r\nThe country faces serious challenges with its infrastructure and the need to raise the standards of living of people which are significantly below the European average, with many living in poverty.\r\n\r\nIn short, Yanukovych and his government are worsening Ukraine's future, the people have realised and we should welcome this.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the British government criticise the moves made by the Yanukovych government, praise those protesting for a better Ukraine, and make it clear to the Yanukovych government that building ties with the European Union is important and beneficial to a country such as Ukraine.",
