        "additional_details": "With government borrowing at record levels its time to limit the power of politicians to borrow money and stick the bill on taxpayers. A new body needs to be set up. People selected from all walks of life, just like a jury would sit and meet, along with expert advisors, once a month to decide how much the government is allowed to borrow. This would prevent politicians simply borrowing money to bribe voters which is the current disastrous policy",
