In order to get above M, the multiplier must be a max of 50\r\n(2) Research & Development\r\n(3) Local training provided\r\n(4) Involvement with local schools\r\n(5) Contribution to social funds\r\nCompanies are rated by an external auditor, in a similar way to the way that ISO qualifications are gained, and companies pay for their own rating. Ratings are reviewed regularly.\r\nCompanies will not be allowed to break the rules by splitting themselves into a company consisting only of directors, with the producers being in a separate company.",
