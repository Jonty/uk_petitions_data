At under 15's age group some boys are going to the gym at this age why would the FA allow this, and better still they may be increasing the age to under16's how is this right?\r\n\r\n1. Why would boys want to play in a girls team?\r\n2. Why would, or better still, why are the FA allowing this?\r\n\r\nAt this age all it takes is for a boy to touch a girl inappropriately on purpose or accident and there will be an 'uproar' within the parents of the girl, not to say there is not anyway.\r\n\r\nWhile a boy is playing on the pitch there is a girl waiting for her chance to play.\r\n\r\nI am sure many others will share the same type of opinion.\r\n",
