        "additional_details": "1) Amend the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to permit property owners and tenants to destroy and remove active nests belonging to feral pigeons and other pest species.\r\n\r\n2) Make it illegal to feed vermin bird species.\r\n\r\nThe damage and mess that they and their offspring can cause to a building is substantial. Therefore all humane means, such as restricting food supply and removing nests should be utilised and made available to the public. Some species (feral pigeons) breed all year round and up to 6 times per year. The abundance of nesting sites due to a lack of available controls and humans feeding them means that overpopulation, especially in urban areas, is a very real problem.\r\n\r\nThis call does not include the killing of birds or their young, just the removal of nests and eggs belonging to pigeons, roofing gulls, etc.",
