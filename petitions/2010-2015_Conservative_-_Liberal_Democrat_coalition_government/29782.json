        "additional_details": "Since 06/01/12, 58 Somali refugees, amongst them 11 women and 24 minors have been on hunger strike in Lutsk detention centre in Ukraine. They seek release from detention, an end to extortion and persecution by police. They have suffered repeated arbitrary abuse while in search of humanitarian protection. Recently they were attacked by armed police who beat them in order to force them to eat. These actions caused much physical and physiological harm. Asylum seekers can be detained for 12 months and can be re-detained immediately after release. Men and women, whole families including women, pregnant or with children and unaccompanied minors are all detained indiscriminately. It is very difficult for asylum seekers to get a lawyer. UNHCR, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, URC and some MEPs have intervened with little success. We would like the British government to advocate for the basic Human Rights of these people, and show solidarity with its Somali community here in the UK. ",
