No companies could operate in the UK without doing this already.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the tax account could be staged so that, as goverenment departments are ready to feed data to the accounts, the account would build towards a complete implementation.\r\n\r\nA major advantage would be that fines would also be posted to the account and collection would be automatic through altered tax codes, thereby avoiding the necessity of employing court bailiffs.",
