        "additional_details": "The current demand by the Health Secretary and NHS England, to reduce admissions to A&E risks patient safety. Paramedics are being incentivised to avoid admissions as are allied health professionals and doctors and nurses. The issue is critical as decisions are being made on cost-effectiveness rather than clinical need. Primary healthcare budgets are reducing and a GP workforce crisis looms. Stop focusing primarily on reducing A&E admissions. There is a difference between attendances and admissions.",
