        "additional_details": "The French president recently urged the UN Security Council to intervene in the Syrian civil war.\r\nThousands have died and the suffering continues. If the global community does not support the rebels looking to over throw their dictator, democracy may never be mainstream in the middle east. By intervening we could shorten the war, save lives and bring about peace and justice. Sign this petition to insist that our government commits to saving Syria.",
