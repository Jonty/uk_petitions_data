        "additional_details": "Oxfam is under investigation for making an 'overtly political' campaign which may contravene charity law. The law prohibits political campaigning within 12 months of an election.\r\n\r\nCharities have specialist knowledge and have a legitimate case for bringing issues to public awareness and political debate. Charities represent many vulnerable groups including disabled people, ex-military personnel, children, elderly people, conservation and many more areas. Many charities have wider public support than some political parties. It is undemocratic to silence charities and protect politicians from having their policies monitored and evaluated. We hear plenty from politicians. We want other voices to be heard as well.",
