        "additional_details": "Medway Council is trying to force the Harrisons to get rid of two of their four pet dogs. Trevor (age 49) was the breadwinner until he became suddenly seriously ill. Trevor\u2019s health problems could not have been predicted and their well-behaved rescue dogs were acquired responsibly. He has already had an amputation and is prone to more, and his sight is at risk, too. Their existing family home is unsafe and can\u2019t be adapted \u2013 Trevor is sleeping downstairs and has no access to a bathroom. The council has offered appropriate accommodation \u2013 but only if the Harrisons get rid of two of their dogs. All over Britain other people are facing similarly impossible choices. We call on the Government to recognise that existing pets, responsibly owned and acquired, are significant, loved family members and while councils may place future limits on the number of pets kept, owners should not be asked to choose between a safe place to live and their existing canine family.
