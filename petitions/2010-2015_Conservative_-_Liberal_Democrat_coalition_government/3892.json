It is a tried and tested system which has been supported by the main political parties for years, so you know it makes sense.\r\n\r\n   All jobs could be put out to tender, on a twelve month contract.The benefits would save the country billions of pounds per anum.\r\n\r\n   Westminster and Whitehall could be converted into posh hotels, transforming them from black holes which swallow up billions of pounds, to places which generate money to the UK.\r\n\r\n    Cameron could be Manager and have a company cycle to commute the short distance between the two hotels, he could jump off and hug a hoodie or two on his way. and Clegg could be concierge, until their elected term is over. They could then be replaced by competent people.\r\n",
