        "additional_details": "Currently around the country it costs students around the country obscene amounts of money in order to acces their education. Local transport companies are charging individuals fees of (in some cases) over \u00a370 a fortnight for a buss pass which will take them on a ten-minute journey to school. I think that companies providing public transport should think about the public more when drawing up their tariffs. A propose a special tariff for all public transport which would entitle sixth form and college students to subsidised transport.",
