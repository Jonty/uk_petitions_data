        "additional_details": "Cycling is becoming ever more popular, but with this comes novice cyclists who don't seem to understand that at night time they are virtually invisable to drivers - especially as these people tend to be young and prefer to wear dark clothing. They  are putting their safety and those of others at risk.\r\n\r\nThe petition proposes to pass a law that makes it compulsary for cyclists who are cycling on the roads at night to use front and rear cycling lights - and for on the spot fines to be levied against those that don't.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion could be for police to carry spare lights in their vehicles and make the cyclist fit them there and then or pay a fine.\r\n\r\nThis could save lives.\r\n",
