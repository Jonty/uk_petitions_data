        "additional_details": "This is a petition to government to abolish TV licencing in favour of the BBC collecting revenue on a revenue collection pay-per-view basis just like the encoded channels on SKY and Cable broadcasters.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should not dictate if a person with a TV set can't view other channels broadcast that are free and not subject to licensing.\r\n\r\nDigital TV broadcasts via a method that means that the TV's CI+ socket can take a decoder for channels that are protected from normal viewing.\r\n\r\nThe restrictive practice by the BBC needs to stop. People have the right to view NON-BBC media without fear of prosecution.\r\n\r\nI urge this issue to be debated in parliament and to change the way in which the BBC collects it revenues in a more fair way.",
