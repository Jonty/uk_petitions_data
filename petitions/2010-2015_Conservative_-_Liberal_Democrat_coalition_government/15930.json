We have been stripped of natural resources, our manufacturing industries have been taken away with no substitute and we are ridiculed by a London based Media.   We are a hinterland, unloved and dismissed by the Capital.  It is time to go it alone, or at least have a greater amount of Autonomy than at present.   We are no longer a United Kingdom.",
