        "action": "Ban import of meat from France",
        "additional_details": "In 1996 the EU banned the sale of British beef in the EU, lifting that ban in 2006. The French government continued the ban in contravention of European Union law for a further 3 years. This cost the British industry hundred of thousands of pounds a year.\r\nIn light of the damage that French import policy has done to the British beef industry it seems only fair they are expected to prove, beyond all doubt, that the meat exported into the UK through France is of an acceptable quality.\r\nWe believe that until this is the case the import of French meat into the UK is banned.",
