        "additional_details": "Crosscountry Trains operate some of the longest-distance inter-city journeys in the UK (Scotland - Devon etc) yet the trains used are, in the main, just four and five coaches long \"commuter\" trains with airline style seats and no buffet. Before 2001 these services were operated by trains of between 6 and 10 coaches long with a buffet/restaurant service.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call upon the government to insist that these trains meet the same standards of the inter-city operators in and out of London by adding extra carriages, using new trains if necessary, to eliminate overcrowding.",
