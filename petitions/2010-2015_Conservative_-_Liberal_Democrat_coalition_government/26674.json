        "additional_details": "AEP (Attenuating Energy Porjectile) has been accepted as a less lethal weapon than the batton rounds.  It is thought that using AEP will prevent deaths, as had occurred in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\n We are also informed that the firing of the AEP should be aimed at below the waist, but research,such as it is  (February 2007 re Northern Ireland) found that the majority of injuries presented at A & E were to the upper part of the body and head.  Does this mean that because it is seen as less lethal the airming is less discrimatory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we need is a debate in parliament on the use of AEP, the review of the critiera for use, the sort of training, who should be armed with AEP and research however small from Northern Ireland and other countries who use the AEP.\r\n\r\nI am therefor asking for support to have the whole area of use of AEP to be discussed  by our MPs in parliament.
