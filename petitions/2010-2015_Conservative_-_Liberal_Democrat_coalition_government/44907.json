        "additional_details": "If we live in a democracy we need our young voters to be much better educated about the politcal spectrum. We need our children to understand the difference between the Lib Dems and Labour and between the BNP and UKIP and so on.\r\n\r\nThe essentials must be taught, being;\r\n\r\n- The major parties and their differences\r\n- The political spectrum\r\n- How to vote\r\n- General citizenship\r\n- What it means to be a British Citizen\r\n- The EU (If we remain in it)\r\n- World politics\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is my firm belief that unless children are taught that their voices mean something from a young age that a modern democracy can't function correctly since they would learn all of the \"facts\" from pre-election promises and advertising campaigns, which judging off the term of the Conservatives-Liberal Democrats are rarely met.\r\n\r\nThe key point of this is that our children must be educated about their votes and what they mean in an unbiased way.\r\n\r\nThank-you for signing.",
