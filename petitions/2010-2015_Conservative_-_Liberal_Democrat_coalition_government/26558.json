        "action": "Abolish the television licence fee",
        "additional_details": "In view of the significant and growing number of Freeview television stations available, is it not time to abolish this outdated, unwanted and unnecessary tax?\r\nHistorically, there may have been a case to retain some level of licence fee had the standard of BBC programming been seen to improve or even maintained. However, it is obvious to all that with Sky producing fine news programmes plus their entertainment stations available for a premium, there is now no justification for this modern day poll tax.\r\nThe world of communications, including the internet has changed what and when we watch programmes and this petition suggests the abolishment of the TV Licence fee is overdue.",
