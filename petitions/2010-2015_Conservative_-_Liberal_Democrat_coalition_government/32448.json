However carried to its logical conclusion, this argument can be used to take away the privacy of all citizens, and to monitor the interests\r\nand political leanings of everybody who is online.\r\nWhile the proposal to allow GCHQ real-time access to everybody's online movements may be well-intentioned, it provides a tool which undermines\r\ndemocracy and which may be used at a future date to bring about an autocratic State.  Vote to tell the Government that this proposal is unacceptable to the British people.",
