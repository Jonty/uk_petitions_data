        "additional_details": "I urge the Government, in this time of austerity, to invest in vastly improving the treatment of mental health patients in this country. Patients have no say in their treatment, often denied visitors, or only allowed visitors to peer at them through windows, are often given nothing to do. Hospitals often do not have enough staff, and I am aware of cases where patients have not eaten for days as they haven't been able to cater for severe food allergies. This is not acceptable in 2011 Britain, no matter what the state of the economy is, this must change. Please sign, and encourage the government to take more interest in looking after people's mental health more at their most vulnerable.",
