This should rise to 1 pound per week for higher incomes.\r\nThis fund collected through taxation should be in  addition to the MODs current income.\r\nThis fund would be used to fund naval ship building programs as well as more ground based mechanised units.\r\nThis would ensure the security of our nation and that of our allies across the globe in todays unstable world.",
