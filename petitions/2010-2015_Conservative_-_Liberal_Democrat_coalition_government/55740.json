        "additional_details": "Michael Gove's radical and draconian reforms and views are going to destroy our education system and leave generations with absolutely no hope.\r\n\r\nThe facts are since this government came to power, teachers morale has plummeted. 71% do not feel trusted by the government, 84% are demoralised and 50% want to leave.\r\n\r\nBut the most damning verdict... FIVE percent feel the government has had a positive impact.\r\n\r\nMichael Gove needs to resign before he absolutely ruins any chance future generations have of succeeding. ",
