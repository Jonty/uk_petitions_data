K  and N.I.\r\nFishing is the most participated in pastimes in the country.  Producing a lot of revenue for the economy, and also about 28 million a year in licence fees for the Environment  Agency.\r\nThe theft and removal of fish in the country has mainly been carried out by Eastern Europeans.  In some parts of the country river systems have been destroyed by this.\r\nThe Environment Agency are ridiculously  understaffed and lack an real powers to tackle this. Even though they are warranted law officers.  The management in the E.A will not put more boots on the ground and to be fair don't have the stomach to hit this head on.  They are totally understaffed and unlike the police don't have any back up in the event of trouble.  ",
