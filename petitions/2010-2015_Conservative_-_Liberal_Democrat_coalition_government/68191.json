        "additional_details": "Phil Turner was performing his regular rounds on the 31st July, as a postman 'he has come across alot in his 17 years' however nothing could have prepared him for that particular day. He described a 'commotion' down the street but thought nothing of it, as he approached closer to the site of the disorder he noticed that there was an effort to help a family escape their burning house, Phil courageously 'booted down' the front door and continued to retrieve a mother and her two children.\r\nDue to the heroic actions that day no-one was killed and only minor injuries sustained, the rescuers there gave it their all especially Phil Turner, that is why we believe Phil Turner should be awarded the George Cross (the highest civilian commendation for bravery) for his acts of bravery in the face of adversity and as a message to the people that these acts to do not go un-noticed. It is moments like this that make us proud to be British and despite his modesty a commendation is in order.",
