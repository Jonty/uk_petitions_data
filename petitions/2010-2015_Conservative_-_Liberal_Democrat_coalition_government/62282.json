This inconsistency has no justification other than to allow people to feel superior to other people who don't know this obscure detail.\r\n\r\nThe flag should be redesigned, along the same basic principles as the current flag, to have two axes of symmetry (horizontal and vertical).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there should be standardisation on the union flag/jack naming convention, to avoid similar pedantry by people who are convinced that one or the other is correct for obscure and irrelevant historical reasons.",
