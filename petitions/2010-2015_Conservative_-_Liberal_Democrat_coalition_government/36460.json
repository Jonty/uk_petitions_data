This would form the basis of the Opening of Parliament Speeches for several sessions, thus avoiding the sneaky surprises which are slipped in at present for which the electorate have not had an opportunity to consider.   When the manifesto work has been completed the Parties should go to the country.\r\nEmergency legislation should be the only deviation.  If necessary, the electorate should have the opportunity of over riding contentious issues with Referendums.\r\nThus - less Presidential style Prime Ministers\r\nIt\u2019s time politicians kept to their word.",
