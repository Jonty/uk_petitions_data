        "additional_details": "This petition has been created to see how much interest we can gain in favour of extending Seaham SkatePark and fit suitable lights for night time use.\r\n\r\nSeaham Skate Park was built around a year ago and we've had quite a lot of new people starting to ride BMX, skate, it's a positive activity for youngsters of Seaham and with the growing numbers it is vital for the Skate Park to be extended. We have limited room for usage and collisions between skaters, scooter users and BMX riders are happening regularly. In the interest of safety we need this SkatePark extending.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN TO HELP OUR CAUSE!",
