They put out a message that there is no concern for the working people of UK and their Health and Safety. Employers and managers of companies and corporations already push the boundries of what is safe to increase production. We are a country that should be moving forward, adapting to the future not regressing and returning to medieval times. The proposed changes need looking at, leave the European 6 pack alone, make corporations look after the backbone of our country, the workers. Stop putting us in danger.",
