It should be at least the same overall proportion of their income as those in the lowest contributing band, & preferably at least that of the average.\r\n  Companies & corporations that take income from trading here should pay for that privelage in due taxation, so it's not a case of wealth being sucked out of us individually or as a nation.\r\n  I would like to see the goverment taking measures that would prevent profits & earnings being put out of reach of HMRC, so it is a level tax playing field for all & so the middle & lower earners do not pay a greater overall proprtion of their income than the richest.",
