        "additional_details": "There have been a number of difficulties concerning my right to contact with my 5 year old son \u2013 since the first instance of my attempting to secure contact I have been harassed through false allegations to the police, and I have now been charged with damaging criminal offences.  It is my belief that, despite my previous complaint to the IPCC, my ex-partner's familial connections with the police force, and the police's clear racial and cultural biases, are still holding an unfair influence over my case. I believe that these repeated accusations are a cynical manipulation of the legal process, and are being allowed to distract from the fact that my ex-partner is in breach of the court's contact order, and to prevent any form of enforcement in this regard. For the sake of my son's welfare I ask that the charges which have been placed against me be considered in the wider context of this ongoing harassment.",
