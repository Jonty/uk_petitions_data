        "additional_details": "The government continues to discriminate against disabled people. The UKs transport system fails to provide adequate \"access\" for people with disabilities. Disabled people have NO choice but to drive so they can simply get about.  It now takes twice as long to drive to your destination in congested areas like London compared to public transport. Disabled motorists now spend up to 4 hours a day in the car just to get to work impacting on their health. Able bodied people have a CHOICE about how they get to work disabled people don't. How is this fair? Why does the government fail to act and give disabled motorists a fair choice. Either reduce the number of able bodied motorists driving in congested areas or allow disabled motorists to drive in bus lanes.",
