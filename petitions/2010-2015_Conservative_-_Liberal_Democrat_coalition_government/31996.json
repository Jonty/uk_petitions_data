Giving extra time to candidates with learning difficulties is merely a surface solution to the problem. Exam boards must provide separate question papers for adult and children with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. The language must be carefully selected and mustn\u2019t contain multi-facet questions that would otherwise unfairly hinder the candidate.\r\n",
