        "action": "Scrap proposed limit of 1 year for contributary based  Employment and Support Allowance",
        "additional_details": "I urge the Government to scrap the proposed one year limit for people in receipt of contribution based Employment and Support Allowance. This penalises those who have previously worked and payed National Insurance and means that anyone who becomes too ill to work with an illness that  continues for over a year will have their benefit stopped. They will be unable to claim Job Seekers Allowance as they are unfit for work, and those who have a spouse or partner that works will be unable to claim Income Support. Therefore their whole income will be taken from them and plunge many into poverty as well as having to deal with their illness or disability. I urge the government to reconsider this drastic action which will destroy the lives of people who have previously worked and only crime is to become ill or disabled.\r\n\r\nPLEASE SUPPORT MY PETITION AS THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU OR YOUR FAMILY IN THE FUTURE.",
