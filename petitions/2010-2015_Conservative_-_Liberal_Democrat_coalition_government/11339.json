That could mean up to \u00a370million of British money going to the very people we are fighting.\r\n\r\nDespite billions being poured into  Afghanistan in aid, the country shows no signs of becoming politically stable or economically viable.\r\n\r\nShould we be wasting money that could be spent on strengthening the police, border patrols, immigration, hospital staff, and other essential services?\r\n\r\nSay no to more overseas aid.",
