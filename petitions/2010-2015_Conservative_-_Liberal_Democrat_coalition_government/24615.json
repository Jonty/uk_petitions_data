        "additional_details": "We the undersigned have launched this petition in opposition to proposed plans to close Park View Primary School, Huyton and merge students into Roby Park Primary, Huyton. Which will result in undue stress to all the children involved in both schools and the loss of employment to all staff at Park View.\r\nWe the undersigned strongly object and refuse to agree with the proposed plans and would prefer the children of Park View Primary to remain in Park View with the staff that look after their welfare now.\r\nIn particular this petition asks the DofE, local cabinet and Government to consult the wider community in as far reaching way as possible concerning the merger and to do this BEFORE they vote on any proposals.\r\nOne of our major concerns is the speed of the changes and the apparent lack of consultation and communication that is taking place with regards to the staff and students at Park View Primary School.If this decision does go ahead we will continue to fight.",
