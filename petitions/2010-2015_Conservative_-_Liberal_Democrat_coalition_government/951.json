        "additional_details": "The widespread use of anti-biotics on farm animals is increasing the development of resistant bacteria.  Resistance is already a known prolem.  The use of anti-biotics to increase the density of animals that can be maintained is understandable from a business point of view.  People should be informed of the long-term prognosis as organisms become increasingly resistant to treatment.  Cheaper meat is not a sensible price to pay for eventual inablilty to treat infections.  The government must ban the use of anti-biotics as a prophylaxis in animals.",
