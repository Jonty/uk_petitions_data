Is it right that the existence of pheasants is to serve our own recreational desires? It cannot be morally just to breed an animal for such a purpose, born into a world of suffering.\r\n\r\nWe wish the Government to act upon this moral injustice by implementing a ban on the hunting/shooting of pheasants through an act of law.
