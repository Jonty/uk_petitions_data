        "additional_details": "For a fairer, greener, user pays road tax system which also reduces the cost of administration and eliminates road tax avoidance, add a charge (e.g. 10p/litre)  to all fuel types at the pump.  Garages already collect VAT for the government so this would be simple to implement and fair to all road users.  E.g. a car that drives 20,000 miles per annum at 50mpg would use approx. 1,816 litres of fuel @ 10p tax/litre = \u00a3181.60 per annum road tax.  Alternatively, a car that drives 20,000 miles per annum at 20mpg would use approx. 4,540 litres of fuel @ 10p tax/litre = \u00a3454.00 per annum road tax.  Then, spend ALL the money raised on transport!",
