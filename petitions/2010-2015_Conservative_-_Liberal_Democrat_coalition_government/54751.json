        "additional_details": "Homework should be banned or seriously reduced because when we are in school, we worry about the homework and if we are doing that, are we doing any learning? No.\r\nWe come home, shattered from a long day at school, and have to do even more work at home. As if there isn't enough time to do it at school?\r\nAs various studies have shown, setting students too much homework can cause them to have a negative attitude towards learning and school in general. It can also lead to feelings like depression, anxiety, stress and even suicide in extreme cases.\r\nSo what I ask the Government to do, is to please set strict limits on how much homework a school is legally allowed to set per night, get rid of the guidelines for how much they should set, set strict maximum times as some schools are abusing this system by setting students holiday homework, when we should be able to chill, relax and do whatever \"we\" want to do, not what the school wants us to do.",
