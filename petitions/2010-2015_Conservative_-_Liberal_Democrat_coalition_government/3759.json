        "action": "Removing Sunday Trading Restrictions",
        "additional_details": "The petitioners believe that the current restrictions on Sunday trading hours are regressive, illiberal and stifle business, and that Sunday trading hours should not be restricted. By putting Sunday on an equal level with the rest of the week, the petitioners believe that the economy will benefit from increased sales, those who wish to work on a Sunday will be more able to do so, and those who wish to shop on a Sunday will have more opportunity to do so. The petitioners also believe that removing outdated Sunday trading legislation will not restrict peoples religious beliefs, and their ability to practice them, much like how Friday and Saturday trading does not restrict those religions who choose not to participate. The petitioners believe that those who wish to work or shop on a Sunday should be able to without restriction, and in a way which doesn't restrict the rights of others who choose not to, and that removing Sunday trading restrictions is the fairest solution and compromise.",
