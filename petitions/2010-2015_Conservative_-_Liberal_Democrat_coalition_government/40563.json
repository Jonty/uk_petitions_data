        "additional_details": "That HM government should end its policy of covertly and overtly waging, funding and seeking to profit from war and invest instead in peace, justice and better understanding with all nations.\r\n\r\nWar is immensely costly in human, environmental and economic terms and brings few benefits. Peace by contrast is priceless yet costs relatively very little and investment in it brings great dividends.\r\n\r\nWhen WW l and WW ll ended it was universally agreed that we should have no more wars but we had the Cold War and many others.\r\nThe Cold War ended and now we have the so called War on terror which involves many wars and HM govt is advocating Trident renewal.\r\nNone of these have brought any benefit only untold suffering and harm.\r\n\r\nIt is time that HM govt acted responsibly and divested of war and invested in peace and peacemaking, the alternative is certain destruction.",
