Collectively these Councils administer billions of pounds in public funds.\r\n\r\nThe UK banking sector & its unregulated activities has inflicted as much as \u00a31.5 trillion in private debt upon the UK economy, slashing jobs & public sector services.\r\n\r\nDespite this, many UK Councils still maintain accounts with major banks, providing public funds that support the excessive bonus culture & unethical investment practices.\r\n\r\nThe Move Your Money campaign http://moveyourmoney.org.uk/why-move-your-money challenges unethical investment by asking members of the public to close accounts with major banks & open accounts with an ethical bank or cooperative:\r\n\r\nSign this petition & demand all UK Councils follow suit & close their accounts with the major banks & Move Your Money to a cooperative or ethical bank.\r\n",
