        "additional_details": "Greedy energy companies are responsible for taking as much hard earned cash out of the average wage packet as they can.,leaving little spare income for general high street spending...which in turn has led to job losses, and general fuel poverty across the country.   The elderly get a littlf assistance, but with rising costs the benefit of this is getting smaller.  The GENERAL PUBLIC are also struggling too and this situation cannot continue unchallenged....especially when the suppliers are announcing increasing profits year on year.   Our heating is on less and less as we struggle to keep our homes warm and damp free....but we are powerless against these giants...who all follow suit when they feel as if they need more profits that year....and need government intervention to put a stop to this greed.....",
