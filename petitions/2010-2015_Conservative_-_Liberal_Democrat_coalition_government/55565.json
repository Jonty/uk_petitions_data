We love our park and as it's the only open natural space left in Camberley Surrey due to all the building that has happened in the last few years this area us now unique and very precious to us . It is constantly under threat from developers and we would like a preservation order put on it to save it for us and future generations . It is an old land fill site so is unsuitable for building on . But this doesn't seem to be stopping them . As this is a unique area we feel it should be preserved for public use forever . ",
