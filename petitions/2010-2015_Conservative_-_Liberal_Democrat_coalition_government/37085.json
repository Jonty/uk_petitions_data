        "additional_details": "With all the prisoners who have murdered people, living a life of comfort at the expense of the Taxpayer, would it not be prudent to bring back hanging, for those who are guilty by means of DNA and irrefutable evidence. It would make room in our prisons and save the Taxpayers money. I want the Government to hold a referendum on Hanging, to let the people decide. Prisoners have a life of luxury, with a lot of them re-offending to get back inside, whereas the majority of people in this country are struggling to exist. BRING BACK HANGING",
