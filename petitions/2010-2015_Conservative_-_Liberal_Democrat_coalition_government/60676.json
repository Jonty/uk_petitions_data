The number of smokers is higher than anyone cares to admit and are being used as a 'cash cow' under the guise of health. Using price as a big stick to reduce the number is just causing added hardship in troubled times and is driving people into the hands of organised crime through smuggling and counterfeiting.whose products.are even more harmful.",
