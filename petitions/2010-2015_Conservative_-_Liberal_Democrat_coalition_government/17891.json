        "additional_details": "Basildon Coucil have so far wasted \u00a318m on the Dale Farm eviction as a result of flagrant abuse of local planning regulations.   It has taken 10 years so far  to evict the travellers and clearly the current process is no deterrent to repeat offenders.\r\n\r\nTo provide a satisfactory deterrent I request the Government to enact appropriate legislation to:-\r\n\r\n1.  Criminalise flagrant abuse of planning regulations so offenders can be prosecuted and jailed where necessary.\r\n\r\n2. Criminalise illegally tapping into utilities from such sites.\r\n\r\n3. Provide satisfactory carve outs from Human Rights Act so utilities may be promptly terminated by local councils and that mobile jamming devices for non-SOS calls may be legally used without the need for eviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
