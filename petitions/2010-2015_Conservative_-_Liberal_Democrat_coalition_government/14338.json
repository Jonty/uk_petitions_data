        "additional_details": "The law pertaining to the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and the routes to recourse within such, are failing the individual consumer and the SME sector.\r\n\r\nThe reason why is that routes to recourse, such as Consumer Direct and the Trading Standards, will not take on individual cases, and independent legal representation is prohibitively expensive (with no prospect of claiming these costs back from the opposition).\r\n\r\nThis gives traders and retailers cart blanche to flaunt their legal obligations, and thus making the law impotent.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to alter this Act to provide accessible routes of recourse, with facility to claim any resulting expenses for proven cases, and give the law teeth that protect the consumer with greater effect.",
