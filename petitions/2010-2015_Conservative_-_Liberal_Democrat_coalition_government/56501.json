People need to be aware from childhood that if a freemason wants something of theirs they should give it to them or the result will be them not only taking what they want but also your lifetime savings, your property, your valuables, your income, your pension provisions, your mind and your life.\r\n\r\nPeople need to be aware from childhood that the Courts, solicitors, Local Councils, insurance companies and many more are run by these criminals and those MPs that are not members are frightened to do anything about them.\r\n\r\nThis type of crime is ignored in the education system and the result is the ruination of good people\u2019s lives. To live a life of abuse by these people is much worse than death. The suicides in the country could be all but eliminated for the sake of a bit of school education.\r\n",
