        "additional_details": "Currently monthly and annual First Great Western Season ticket holders cannot claim for individual delays and cancellations, but day and weekly ticket holder's can. The current compensation for Season ticket holde'rs is 5% reduction on renewal if punctuality target is not met and 5% reduction on renewal if reliability target is not met.\r\nWhether the monthly punctuality/ reliability is 40% or 88% we get no different level of financial compensation.\r\nOther TOC's offer their season ticket holder's 'Delay Repay', allowing them to claim for individual delays and cancellation's. We want the same method of Season Ticket compensation on the First Great Western line.",
