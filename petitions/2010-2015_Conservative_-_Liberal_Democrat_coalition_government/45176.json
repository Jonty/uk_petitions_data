        "additional_details": "I think that we should stop people who are non English nationals, having children in England then one lives back abroad and the other stays and works here, claiming child benefit and it goes abroad to where the children are being brought up. \u00a336.6m in child benefit is paid to children overseas as Osborne imposes cuts on UK families with anyone earning over \u00a350,000\r\nThis has to be stopped.! All children that recieve Child Tax Benefits should live and go to school in England.",
