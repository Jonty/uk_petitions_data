        "additional_details": "Join other EU countries such as Belgium, Italy & France in banning the burqa.\r\nIt is not a religious requirement.  As humans, part of our understanding & communicating is being able to 'read' the emotions of another persons facial features. Burqa's do not allow for this primitive need.\r\nBurqa's also allow for dishonesty from being photographed by a speed camera to robbery. They also cause massive queues at airports as the person has to go off with an official to a booth to have their identity cheated, leaving a massive queue behind them at border security.",
