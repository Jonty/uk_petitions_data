        "additional_details": "Under the 2003 US-UK Extradition Treaty, if the UK seeks to extradite a person from the US prima facie evidence that \"the person sought committed the offense for which extradition is requested\" must first be provided.    If the US wishes to extradite a preson from the UK no such evidence is required and UK courts are powerless to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThis is a wholly unjust and unfair situation which must be stopped, irrespective of any threats or objections raised from the US.\r\n\r\nA new treaty must be introduced imposing equivalent rights and responsibilities on both parties.",
