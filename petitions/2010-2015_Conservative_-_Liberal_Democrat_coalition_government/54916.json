        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call on HM Government to pass a new law that ensures that the Football Grounds used by Premiership, Championship, League 1 and League 2  Football Clubs must remain as part of the Football Club and receive \"Listed Professional Football Ground \" status similar to Grade 1 & 2 Listed Building status.\r\n\r\nThat these Listed Football Grounds cannot be sold or separated from these Professional Football Clubs without a 75% positive vote of \"Club members\", a member being a supporter who has held a season ticket with the club for at least five continuous years.    There are too many examples of Football Clubs that have been high jacked in order that owners profit from the development potential whilst leaving the Football Club in administration.  A minority are profiteering at the expense of our national game and listed status of football grounds will ensure that football supporters will benefit from being able to support their local club.",
