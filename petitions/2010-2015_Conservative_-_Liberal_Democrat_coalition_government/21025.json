        "additional_details": "The BBC has for at least the last two decades engaged in a permitted practice of reporting with undue bias in many areas. The regulating body is the BBC Trust, and therefore means the BBC is self-regulating and often \"sides with itself\".\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the BBC is biased in its reporting in the areas of The Middle East Conflict (anti-Isreal), Climate Change (anti-sceptic), the European Union (anti-sceptic), US politics (anti-republican) and religious doctrine (pro-Islam). It also maintains a distinctly liberal/left wing bias in all other reporting.\r\n\r\nThis petition request punishment against the BBC in terms of license-fee witholding until such time as the BBC can be trusted to report with due impartiality.\r\n\r\nRef: http://biased-bbc.blogspot.com and others.",
