In this slaughter the main participants are young teens.\r\n\r\nWHY?\r\nA celebration,  to show that they are adults\r\nIs it necessary to mention that the dolphin calderon, like all the other species of dolphins, it\u2019s near extinction.\r\nThey don\u2019t die instantly; they are cut 1, 2 or 3 times with thick hooks. And at that time the dolphins produce a grim cry like that of a new born child.\r\nBut he suffers and there\u2019s no compassion while this magnificent creature slowly dies in its own blood.\r\nIts enough!\r\n\r\nWe will send this mail until this email arrives in any association defending the animals, we won\u2019t only read. That would make us accomplices, viewers.\r\n",
