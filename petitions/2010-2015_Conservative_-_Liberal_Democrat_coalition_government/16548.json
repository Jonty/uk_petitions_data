        "additional_details": "In these times of austerity and having to make cuts to all aspects of British Society there is one area that should be considered. Every pensioner gets a free national concession bus pass in England and can travel free off peak or for reduced cost at some peak times depending on the area they live. For some pensioners this is an essential item as this allows them to get out and have a life, especially the more poorer of our pensioners. HOWEVER there is a large number of pensioners that can afford to pay for bus fares and do not require a concession card. I am calling on the Government to reconsider the National Concession Bus Pass and introduce a revised a means tested Pass for those pensioners who need a Bus Pass and remove it from the number of pensioners that have enough income / savings to afford bus fares normally and help reduce the national debt.
