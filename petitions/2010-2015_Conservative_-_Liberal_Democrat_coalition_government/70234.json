Very rarely are offenders, when found guilty, barred from keeping or being involved with animals.\r\n\r\nI ask that it becomes law that an Animal Abuse Register is brought into place and that all offenders are placed on this register. I also ask that offenders are barred from keeping or working with animals for a minimum period of 10 years if not lifelong.",
