        "additional_details": "In May 2011 the Armed Forces Covenant was published by government to help our ex-service men and women get the much needed support they need after serving our great nation. This is very commendable and I would like to see the men & women who bravely serve our country in the emergency services receive the same level of respect and care. If you agree please sign and share this petition.",
