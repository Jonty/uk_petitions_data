        "additional_details": "This is a petition to the government to abolish the TV licencing fee or make it optional\r\n\r\nCurrently the BBC charge \u00a3145.50 per household that is \u00a31,309,500 per 1000 homes, when you consider just how many homes are in the UK this is a huge amount.\r\n\r\nwhat exactly do we get for this amount of money? Repeats on TV and huge payouts for laid off BBC employees. Yet if you pay just \u00a35.99 a month for say Netflix you get more than you would from the BBC.\r\n\r\nThe BBC should not be allowed to dictate if a person with a TV can view other channels that are broadcast-ed from non BBC channels\r\n\r\nIf people do not wish to view BBC channels we should be allowed to chose not to and simply have the BBC channels scrambled in which this would help poorer families to survive in this economic recession\r\n\r\nThe restrictive practice by the BBC needs to stop. People have the right to view NON-BBC media without fear of prosecution.\r\n\r\nI urge this issue to be debated in parliament.",
