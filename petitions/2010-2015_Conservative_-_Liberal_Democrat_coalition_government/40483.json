        "additional_details": "Taxpayers vote for a Party or Leader in good faith on the understanding that the manifestos and campaigns represent the intended actions of the Party Leader. The Party Leaders gain position and gain financially at a personal level at the taxpayers\u2019 expense. The Party Leader & their Party enter into an agreement at the highest level with the voting taxpayers. Breach of the Core Policies therefore constitutes a breach of contract. Core Policies must be clearly defined as such during the election campaigns. This petition moves to introduce legislation under which Party Leaders become directly accountable for their actions and incur severe financial penalties when the Political Party or Alliance reneges on implementing its Core Policies.",
