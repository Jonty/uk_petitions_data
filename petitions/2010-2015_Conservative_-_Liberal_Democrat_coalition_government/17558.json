To the horror of the residents, this was subjected to serious vandalism in December last year. Since then it is rejuvenating very well, there are many new shoots growing. But for some reason there is plans to cut it down and plant a new Holy Thorn from 'Kew Gardens,' which has nothing to do with the story of the uncle of Christ Joesph of Ariamthea planting the tree 2000 years ago, to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee next year. WE WHAT TO KEEP OUR TREE.\r\n\r\n",
