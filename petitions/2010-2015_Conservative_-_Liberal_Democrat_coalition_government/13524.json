        "additional_details": "The Government must review the fairness of CSA legislation, particularly maintenance decisions that take a very narrow view of the children\u2019s and their parents\u2019 position. Then the legislation must be changed to remove the unfairness.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nA. One parent can end a relationship, take the children with them and enforce absence on the other parent solely to obtain money from them. No agreement between the parents on what is best for the children. The CSA will take maintenance from the so called \"absent parent\". Unfair - extortion.\r\n\r\nB. The full financial situation of both parents is not taken into account. The \"parent with care\" can walk away from all joint debt and receive maintenance from the \"absent\" parent. Maintenance calculations ignore facts like the absent parent has been left with all joint debts, particularly a mortgage. The \"absent\" parent would have to be homeless but pay for the other parent's mortgage to get credit for any mortgage. Unfair and lunacy\r\n",
