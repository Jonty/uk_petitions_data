We would create a parliament and a democratically elected leader. The team appointed will have to construct a manifesto that covers all major workings of the national such as education, transport, taxation policies...\r\n\r\nPassports, monies, and other such sundries would be dealt with by the newly elected 'gaffer' who will represent the 'Democratic Grand State of Yorkshire'\r\n\r\nFurther discussion will be required as regards boarder control and free trading of goods within the UK.\r\n\r\n",
