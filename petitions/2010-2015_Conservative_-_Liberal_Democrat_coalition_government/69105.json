There is a very sick little boy, alone in a foreign hospital, who is being deprived of loving, caring parents in his hour of need. Ashya's parents just want their son to receive the best treatment.  The people of Britain ask David Cameron to intervene and secure their release to allow both of them to be with Ashya at this very worrying time!",
