        "action": "to segregate fridge trailers from general haulage in truckstop and services",
        "additional_details": "Throughout the UK general haulage tramper drivers are forced to park for daily rest in designated areas. These areas also contain fridge and  temperature regulated goods vehicles.\r\n\r\nThese fridges can be noisy and very disturbing to drivers who don't do this line of work. The impact is it  effects their personal daily rest and sleep thus creating a tired and not alert driver.\r\n\r\nThis is dangerous. Imagine a tired driver setting off on the public highways... how can this be fair to other road users? Sadly most of the time  the driver is expected to do his job, regardless to how they may have rested.\r\n\r\nThis petition has been raised so as to try and show the number of people who feel it's about time services for trucks segregated these fridges in order to provide a better more fair rest period for everyone reducing the risk of tired drivers.\r\n\r\nSites like welcome break , moto, extra , and various truckstop\r\n\r\nPlease road users and truckers let's make this happen :D",
