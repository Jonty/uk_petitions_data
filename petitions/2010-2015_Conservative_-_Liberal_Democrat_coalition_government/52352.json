        "additional_details": "Banning Khat will most certainly increase the levels of antisocial behavior in England and Wales with tens of thousands of  khat users searching for alternative recreational activities. Some khat users will no doubt turn to other drugs, especially the young, who will be enticed to harder more harmful substances. Which will in turn create more serious problems in already social deprived areas? Thus exacerbating, already stretched police resources even further. It will also affect law abiding traders, who currently pay tax on the import and sale of khat to the government, to go underground reducing tax revenues and increase and attract criminality.  ",
