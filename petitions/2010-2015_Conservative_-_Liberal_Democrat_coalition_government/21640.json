        "additional_details": "Children in Wales are currently forced by law to take Welsh at GCSE level even if they have no interest or are not skilled at it. This also forces them to lose a GCSE that could be used for something that the student wants to learn but has to sacrifice to take Welsh. It is also non-beneficial to children it the south and east who are raised entirely in English and have no knowledge of welsh when they start school and simply do not have the time to speak fluent of even advanced welsh when they finish school.\r\nI believe that in a democratic society our children should not have to take a subject which isn't useful to them or they do not want to take.\r\nI understand taking Welsh at primary level but do not believe that it should take a promising ad useful GCSE.",
