        "additional_details": "Six foot gates have been installed in an area without the knowledge of Local Residents blocking a very busy high way. No Health and Safety concerns were taken into account. Planning Permission was given without knowledge of the Local Residents. The 6FT gates have divided 2 communities in Bradford and these gates need removing...Shortly after the gates had been put up local residents were informed via letter to say there is nothing that can be done.\r\n\r\nWe as a community would like the government to toughen laws on planning permission and make it a must for Public Consultation. We would like the gates to be removed and we need every vote as it all counts.\r\n\r\n",
