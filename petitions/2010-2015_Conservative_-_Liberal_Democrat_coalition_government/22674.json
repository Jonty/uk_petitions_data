        "additional_details": "Too much 'justice' in recent times, particularly given the dubious merits of the 'Human Rights Legislation', is weighted in favour of the perpetrator rather than the victim.  Where is the justice when the life of an innocent child is abused and ended by a pervert or when people fall victim to repeat-offender serial killers.  These criminals have shown scant disregard for the rights and lives of their innocent victims and in doing so they have surely forfeited the right to continuing their own lives at the expense of the state.  The MoJ should review the laws around capital punishment and  look to reintroduce it for the worst crimes where the evidence is indisputable.",
