        "action": "Make Fishing Licence exactly one year duration",
        "additional_details": "Currently if you buy a full fishing rod licence it will run out on the 31 March regardless of when it was purchased. Theoretically therefore if you wanted to go fishing legally on 1st March for example you would need to buy a full licence which would only be valid for the rest of that month. In comparison with something like car tax for instance this is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you believe the law should change to make fishing licences valid for one full year from the date of purchase.",
