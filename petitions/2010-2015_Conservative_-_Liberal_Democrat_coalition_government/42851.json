People in higher tax brackets do not pay their fair share of tax as they mitigate their tax liability entitlements through loopholes and  deduction arrangements.\r\n\r\nSo when we say that the rich should pay more tax, in effect through careful financial management they usually pay less!\r\n\r\nA flat rate of tax would be a fair system where everyone pays their fair share.\r\n\r\nIf you earn more you will pay more. 25% of \u00a320k is \u00a35k 25% of \u00a3100k is \u00a325k. Can\u2019t get fairer than that.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Federation is a considered a prime case of the success of a flat tax; the real revenues from its Personal Income Tax rose by 25.2% in the first year after the Federation introduced a flat tax, followed by a 24.6% increase in the second year, and a 15.2% increase in the third year.\r\n",
