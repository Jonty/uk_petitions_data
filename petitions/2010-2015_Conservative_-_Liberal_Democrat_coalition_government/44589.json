        "additional_details": "It should be illegal to wear a niqab/face veil whilst driving on UK roads. It's not acceptable to wear a balaclava, and a face veil is just as dangerous and intimidating. It isn't acceptable to not be able to see a driver's face, if any accident happened you would not know who it was.it is also unfair that you can get out of the car and walk into a petrol station wearing a veil over your face yet a biker has to remove their helmet.\r\n\r\nFace veils should be banned while driving on UK roads for safety reasons .",
