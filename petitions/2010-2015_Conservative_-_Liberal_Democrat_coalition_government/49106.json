This is a project that could cost the taxpayer another \u00a315 million on top of the \u00a310 million that was already spent on her funeral. This is happening during times of austerity where so many vital services are facing huge cuts.\r\n\r\nAlso loads of people have suffered under Thatcher's time in office such as the miners and factory workers who lost their jobs and had their unions made virtually useless. There are also the people from Argentina who faced war and death from this woman.\r\n\r\nThe museum is just a mockery of the people who suffered back then and suffer still. So please stop the construction of her museum. That money could do a lot more good elsewhere.",
