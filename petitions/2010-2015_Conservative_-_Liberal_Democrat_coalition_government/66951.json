        "additional_details": "We should abolish both houses of parliament and have a directly elected cabinet.\r\n\r\nTo prevent corruption, no minister should be allowed to work for money after leaving office. This would mean the end of career politicians as people would only stand for office after a lifetime of working in the real world.\r\n\r\nLegislation should be introduced by the public by, for example, the epetitions website, with the (20 or 30) most popular, including the budget, being put forward yearly to be ratified by a public vote.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet would therefore be public servants whose job would be to implement the people\u2019s laws rather than make them.",
