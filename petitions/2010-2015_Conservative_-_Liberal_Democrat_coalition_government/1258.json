        "additional_details": "Tons of litter consisting largely of plastic bottles and aluminium cans is dumped on our streets, roads and lanes each year. As they have no value there is no incentive for anyone pick them up and it otherwise costs millions of pounds for the local authority (i.e. the taxpayer) to pick it up or, more often than not, leave it where it is - an unsightly mess.  The UK has one of the worst litter problems in Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there was a 10p deposit on each item then, for example, 15 items would be worth \u00a31.50. Not a huge amount, but enough to make people think twice before littering and/or a sufficient incentive for someone to pick up such items.\r\n\r\nSuch schemes are very effective elsewhere in Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that the Government put a Bottle Bill before Parliament.",
