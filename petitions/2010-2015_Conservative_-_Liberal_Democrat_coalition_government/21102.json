        "additional_details": "Theresa May has plans to allow, without interference from the authorities, extremist muslim group, muslims against crusades, to denegrate our soldiers and to protest at armistice day parades. Our government are quick to admonish any non muslim groups, such as the EDL, but seem intent on allowing muslims to do as they please when they please. A two tier justice system exists in this country and the most lenient one is applied to muslims and they are appeased at every turn. Sign the petition to let our politicians know that this cannot go on and everyone should be subject to the same laws and regulations.",
