        "additional_details": "To be picked to represent your country in a sport is a privilege not a right of passage.  International sport is about country vs country.   Presently, too many foreign born and rasied individuals are being allowed to represent the home nations in a sport without having any links to those home nations whatsoever.  The general lack of rigid rules on qualifcation criteria is making a mockery of international sport.  It is unfair on home grown sportsman, unfair on the opposition and is also cheating.\r\n\r\nI propose that to represent a home nation of the UK in a sport an individual would need to meet the following 2 criteria:\r\n\r\na) an individual must be born and raised in that home nation\r\nb) one/or both of the individuals parents must be born and raised in that home nation.\r\n\r\nPlease support my e-petition!",
