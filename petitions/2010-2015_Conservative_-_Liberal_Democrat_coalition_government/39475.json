        "additional_details": "Having spent many times aboard the Arrivabus No. 70 crawling up the A5 Southbound up Chalkhill from the A505 Bypass and then crawling past French's Avenue and then crawling down High Street North to eventually arrive over half an hour later at the Central Dunstable Traffic Lights it is apparent that a Bus lane is needed on the A5 South from the A505 bypass to the Central Dunstable Traffic Lights at the Church St/West Street Junction with the A5. All buses & school buses etc will benefit from a proper bus lane - strictly enforced. Encouraging people to travel by public transport rather than adding to the congestion & pollution of Dunstable South & Central. The Bus lane will also help once the A5 North Bypass is started in 2014 too. Although we obviously need the Bus Lane before then. Please sign this petition if you agree that a Bus Lane is needed for the A5 Southbound from the A505 Bypass to Dunstable Church St/West St Junction? Thank you for your help.",
