        "additional_details": "HMG becomes the majority (84%) shareholder when HMG invested \u00a345bn on a nationalised bank. The bank should function as a HMG investment banking arm & can make profits by saving costs & invest in British industries' promising manufacturing projects. It cost a few billions to support British industries which are likely to that have countless beneficial & profitable returns for UK plc. Why can\u2019t the nationalised bank invest R&D in promising projects (like aerospace, IT) of British companies, as well as supporting their cash flows to tie them over financially in the short term? This will stimulate British industry & save jobs. The nationalised bank can be key players in consortiums to privately fund projects; like building an airport on an artificial island, which apart from relieving congestion & pollution has the benefit of stimulating jobs in British industries. HMG can act as an imaginative tycoon by investing & setting up new British companies/businesses & making good returns.",
