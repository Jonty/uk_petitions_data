This bill increases the maximum penalty for homosexuality to life imprisonment, as well as making it a crime not to inform the authorities of suspected homosexuality.\r\n\r\nThe UK must suspend all aid to Uganda, and urge our allies in the EU and elsewhere to do so, until Uganda repeals this law and institutes minimum standards of human rights for all it's citizens.",
