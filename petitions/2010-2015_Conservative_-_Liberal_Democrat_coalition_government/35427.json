        "additional_details": "Whenever something happens,  an MP immediately calls for the resignation of the person.  No matter how brilliant this person may be for the job, they just wish to get rid of an opposition.  We want the best person in a job.  Call for disciplinary action, or an apology is fine.  Mistakes happen, and we should learn from them, not get rid of good people.  Good people resigning should be the last option, especially if we want top people in charge of the country as well as private business.",
