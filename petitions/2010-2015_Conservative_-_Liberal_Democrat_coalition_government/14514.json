        "additional_details": "The position of \"President of Europe\" was created by a treaty that the people of Europe almost always voted against - on the rare occasions they were asked for their opinion at all. In order to ratify it, Eurocrats had to change its name - twice - and force Ireland to vote again, as it had originally said no.\r\n\r\nHaving forced the treaty through, Eurocrats appointed unknown mediocrity Herman van Rompuy \"President of Europe\", again without consulting the people of Europe.\r\n\r\nNeither the position nor van Rompuy himself have any more democratic legitimacy than, say, a general who has taken power in a military coup. Democratically governments, including Britain's, should refuse to recognise his entirely bogus claim to this entirely bogus role.    ",
