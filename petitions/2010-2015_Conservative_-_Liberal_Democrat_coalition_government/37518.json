        "additional_details": "Dylan Cecil fell from the jetty at Burnham-on-Sea on Sunday evening both his parents jumped into the sea in a bid to rescue him but they could not reach him and had to be pulled to safety themselves to now Dylan has not been recovered. Burnham-on-Sea has one of the highest tidal rise and fall ranges in the world, and is notorious for its dangerous mudflats, this alone should be cause for some type of secure measurement to be put in place along the Burnham-On-Sea coastline.we should have never waited until a tragic event like poor little Dylan's to take note of the ever looming dangers.\r\n\r\nPlease look at this petition and take it in to consideration for the sake of many more families that visit this coastline, and in the memory of poor little Dylan Cecil, may the angels guide him in to a piecefull place he would dream to be.",
