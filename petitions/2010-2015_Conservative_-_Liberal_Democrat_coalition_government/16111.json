        "additional_details": "The ban on AIM-listed shares being held within a self-select ISA deprives Britain's small and medium enterprises of a substantial source of capital - the private investor.\r\n\r\nThe ban complicates the management of investments (e.g. when companies move from the Main Market to AIM) and denies the public a tax efficient wrapper for smallcap investments - a vital part of a diversified portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe ban is also an unwelcome complication the ISA investment rules.\r\n\r\nPrivate investors are a considerable source of capital and liquidity to the UK's smaller listed companies. The ISA ban on AIM shares forces private investors to direct their money elsewhere at a time when the UK's small and medium-sized companies have been identified as key players in the economic recovery.\r\n\r\nEnd the ban.",
