        "additional_details": "I want the government to allowed Widowed Parent's to keep their allowance when they form a new partnership/civil/marriage. At present the government stop this payment when a new partner moves in.  The government's view is that the new partner helps provide for your dependants therefore no longer requiring benefit.  However if a person moves into a new relationship taking on children who already have a father the CSA do not take this fully into account.  Therefore a widow in a new relationship with someone who already has children, not only looses her WPA but has to assist her new partner in paying for his children, whilst not able to claim maintenance from anyone else.  The Government need to reinstate the WPA or the CSA need to take into account the widow's inability to have anyone to claim maintenance from when calculating her new partners weekly CSA payments to his biological children.",
