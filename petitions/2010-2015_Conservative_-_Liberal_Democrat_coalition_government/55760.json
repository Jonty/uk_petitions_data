        "additional_details": "The government have recently announced that they will be closing a large majority of children's centres and youth hubs across Oxfordshire and reducing all services that they provide. This will have a massive impact on families across Oxfordshire. Reducing services so there are a few centres in Oxford and one in Banbury! Britannia Road Childrens Centre offers a safe place to spend time as a family and to receive support, it would be a tradegy if this had to go and a great loss to Banbury. Please sign this petition if you have ever received support, friendship, help from this place and want to keep children's centres open! ",
