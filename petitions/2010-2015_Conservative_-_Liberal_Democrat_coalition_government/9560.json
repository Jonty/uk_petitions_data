        "additional_details": "I believe that Care Quality Commission is failing vulnerable adults. They do not take on individual complaints and I believe that they should. I feel that vulnerable adults are put at risk because concerns are not taken up sooner and they pass the buck onto the local authority rather than dealing with it themselves. Even if a service breaks 4 of the 16 essential standards they are still able to operate. And often people get a biased report of a service as they pick say 4 out of 20 care plans. And do not put negative views of a service into the reports. So often people don't get  the full picture of a service. I myself had safeguarding concerns. I was even abused by a registered person who runs an agency. Nothing was done about it. I feel the system is failing vulnerable people. ",
