        "additional_details": "Police bombarded with bottles, bricks, petrol bombs, iron bars & fireworks in un-precidented riots involving hundreds upon hundreds of yobs in different parts of the country.  Meanwhile our \"Prime\" Minister sat in his \u00a39000 per week villa in Tuscany, the Mayor of London continued his holiday in Vancouver as did the majority of the cabinet.  Those left behind were conspicuous by their complete and utter absence on the media in support of the fantastice effort of the police to deal with the mobs running riot on the streets.  Finally our coalition government criticised the handling of the troubles by our police forces and tried to take credit for bringing them to an end.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I would like to request a vote of no confidence in our Coalition government.",
