Allowing these proposals will destroy some of the county's greatest beauty and heritage.\r\n\r\nIt is our vested interest to retain our heritage and preserve the beautiful surroundings we have today.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see future transport initiatives to include re-investment in the UK canals and waterway systems, much of which still remains today.\r\n\r\nWe believe that we need to reduce the reliance on commuting to and from London and spread the wealth and load to other major cities within the UK.\r\n\r\nWith the use of todays modern technology this is possible and negates the need for the HS2 proposal within Nottinghamshire.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned DO NOT wish to see the HS2 proposal within Nottinghamshire.",
