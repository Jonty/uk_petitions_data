        "additional_details": "Yoga has been proven to be of immense healing value both physically and mentally. On countless occasions it has succeeded where western medicine has failed. The great champion of this system to the west is BKS Iyengar. He has developed adaptations using props to allow practise by the weak and diseased.\r\nIn view of this contribution and his brave dedication in bringing this art to the west we believe he should be formally recognised with a knighthood.",
