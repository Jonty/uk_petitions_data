        "additional_details": "There should be facilities in nearby major hospitals in UK for patients over 50 the right to have their brains scanned for conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, brain tumour, aneurysm; as well as their abdomen scanned for conditions like cancer, atrophy & damage of organs utilising CT (Computed Tomography), ultrasound scans. Brain scans utilising effective neuroimaging techniques like using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are scans that can study the structure and activities of brains effectively. MRI uses magnetic field interacting with radio waves and does not expose the body to ionising radiation and has better resolution for soft tissues (like brains). CT scans give better resolution when scanning abdomen. CT uses a series of X-rays to build up computer images. Ultrasound uses high frequency sound and like MRI does not expose the patient to ionising radiation (but has poor resolution).",
