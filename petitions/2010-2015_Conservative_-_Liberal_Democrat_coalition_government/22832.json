        "action": "Reduce the overall tax on fuel",
        "additional_details": "The rate of overall tax on fuel at +/- 60% is usurious and grossly inflates the price of fuel. It seems extremely unreasonable to levy two different taxes at such high percentage levels - Fuel duty accounts for 44% of the price of a litre of fuel and VAT 17%. The current levels of tax are too high; they adversely affect the price of goods and are causing many poorer people tremendous hardship up and down the country. This petiton calls on the government to abolish fuel duty altogether and to levy only VAT.",
