        "additional_details": "It's time the DWP recognised Fibromyalgia (FM) as a genuine disability. The impact  this chronic condition has on the sufferer's life is enormous and for too long we have had to suffer in silence as a forgotten minority. The DWP does not yet acknowledge this as one of their 'listed' conditions for the application for DLA, and their medical test does not allow for the many debilitating symptoms of this severe condition. . FM reduces a person's ability to function physically and cognitively and as a consequence  work life suffers to the point where sufferers lose their jobs and are unable to support themselves or their families. The government must now take action to help FM sufferers by getting the DWP to recognise this condition and adapting their assessment methods accordingly so those affected by FM can live with dignity and receive the support that is currently lacking ",
