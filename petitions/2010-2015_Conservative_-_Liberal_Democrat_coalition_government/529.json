Moreso than policy or corruption combined.\r\n\r\n   I propose a return to the principles of The Northcote-Trevelyan Report. Specifically the 'open, competitive examinations' applied at all levels of local and national government and the civil service.\r\n\r\n   Alongside sanctions for acts of gross misconduct or incompetence that match the private sector.\r\n\r\n   I give one example. Within the HR department of the Ministry of Paperwork, they copy and reprint around 5 application forms for each candidate to be granted an interview and sent to the panel.\r\n\r\n   Pallet-loads of paper are then shipped overnight around the country by secure courrier.\r\n\r\n   A competent department would scan the forms, encrypt the data and make it available for download on the ministry network. Saving millions per annum.",
