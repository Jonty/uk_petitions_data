        "additional_details": "To bring this parliment into the 21st century then MPs should be forced to use the electronic highway. There would be no need for MPs to travel to London. For example a local MP has claimed \u00a31,572.45 for 19 first class journeys in 1 year and a further \u00a31,650 for 33 taxi rides from Station to home.  How many other MPs have claimed for 1st class travel?  By using the computer they would be able to serve their constituants better and remain in touch with Parliment and possibly even serve a usefull purpose\r\nTraditions are alright in the right place but we need positive actions now not just appearances.",
