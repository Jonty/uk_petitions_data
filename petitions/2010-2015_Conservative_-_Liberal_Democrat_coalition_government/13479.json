There is already substantial evidence to suggest that the Daily Mirror (especially one of its past editors) has engaged in the practice too. We petition the government to investigate the Daily Mirror with the same scrutiny that is being given to the New of The World, and to then prosecute those responsible with the full force of the law.",
