        "additional_details": "We live in a global society with global costs. The \u00a310 hourly global minimum wage ensures that ordinary People are FIRST before corrupt bankster regimes. The EU is currently denying people fair wages by imposing austerity and huge inequality which is impacting the ability of the UK to provide adequate living standards. We demand the EU immediately change priority to put People FIRST or we demand the UK government give us an immediate referendum to leave the EU immediately. This is essential because billions of children around the world are cold and hungry due to EU austerity and warmongering. The UK will be OK when we say www.NO2EU.com and finally reclaim our freedom after 40 wasted years kowtowing to the EU dictatorship.",
