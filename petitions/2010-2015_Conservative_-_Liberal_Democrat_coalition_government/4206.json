        "additional_details": "A generous national wage limit of \u00a33 million a year would leave a vast amount of money unclaimed by the highest paid members of our society. No one needs more money than this however a great many people in our society need more money than they currently receive.\r\nThe extra funds could be used to provide more security in banks, which could then reduce their interest rates. The prices of products and services could be lowered and the salary of the lower paid members of the wage-limited individual's company could be increased. This would also insure a greater amount of income tax was paid as each person would pay a greater proportion whilst being able to enjoy a higher salary. This would provide more towards decreasing the deficit and funding our important services.\r\nThe very rich do not need financially protecting in our society however the very poor do.",
