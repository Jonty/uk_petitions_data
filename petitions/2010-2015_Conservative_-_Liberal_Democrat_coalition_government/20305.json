        "additional_details": "The government needs to act on reducing the exorbitant energy prices and greed operating in the Gas/Electricity companies whose profits are becoming obscene and are filling the pockets of their shareholders. Lots of people are being pushed into fuel poverty and the house of commons needs to take action to reduce the amounts these companies can charge and fix a cap on how much energy prices can be increased. A debate needs to take place in parliament and the politicians need to connect more with the general public. Talking to the energy companies is not sufficient action needs to be taken to prevent them communally fixing their prices. There is a definite requirement of more competition in this field.",
