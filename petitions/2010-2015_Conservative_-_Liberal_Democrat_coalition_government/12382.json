In medicine, this appears not to be an issue. Doctors routinely push their patients to their private list knowing that their bread and butter will be met by the NHS and also the NHS is a good hunting ground for private practice revenue stream. Let them pick one or the other. We cannot allow this conflict of interest to continue.",
