        "additional_details": "The armed forces are currently undergoing re-structuring where this will lead to a reduction in Regular's in the three services and therefore leading to the expansion of reservists. However, with the latest conflicts emerging in North Africa and the PM's keen attitude on supporting newly founded democratic governments, it has recently been made known to the public that further defence cuts may be viable. Further cuts may leave the armed forces unable to carry out such tasks on request of the government where I therefore advocate ring fencing the defence budget and protect what is one of Britain's proudest institutions.",
