Most people envisage happy and healthy chickens running free on open pasture. This is completely untrue, in almost every case, and the conditions may be virtually the same as for \"factory-farming\" (i.e. Overcrowding, debeaking, forced antibiotic consumption). We are (effectively) being over-charged, cheated and hoodwinked. We need a much better and clearer definition. Currently, it means birds must have 'access to the outside'. This can mean almost nothing in practice.",
