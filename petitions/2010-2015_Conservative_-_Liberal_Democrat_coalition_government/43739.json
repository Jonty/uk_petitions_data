He was in charge of the FSA during the worst financial crisis in living memory.\r\nSants' role in overseeing the introduction of the Retail Distribution Review is also subject to much criticism, not least in the FSA's pre-emptive rejection of a TSC report calling for a one-year delay in implementation. Sants later apologised for the \"clumsily worded\" statement.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned do not believe this man is worthy of any recognition. The making this award makes a mockery of the honours system.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
