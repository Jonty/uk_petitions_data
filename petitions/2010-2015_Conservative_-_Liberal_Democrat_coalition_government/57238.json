        "additional_details": "Peak times to and from work/school/college means standing inside a cramped bus. When the 490 bus is heading towards Twickenham and Richmond for students to go to college/ school or people to go to work. Surely it would make sense to have a double decker buses until 9am, and then one or two from 3-6pm.\r\nThis will then improve the value for money while also encouraging people to use public transport! Also the fact that a new school has opened this September, in Twickenham. There will be a strain on this bus, if this goes unresolved, next September will be awful as the school will then have two year groups.",
