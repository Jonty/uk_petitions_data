        "action": "Replace the house of commons with a demarchy - a random selection of 1,000 people who can debate on, and enact, laws.",
        "additional_details": "The problems this country faces could be resolved in a much fairer way by allowing the people of Great Britain to directly participate in the democracy of the country.\r\n\r\nThe current electoral system promotes ambitious and self-centred people to high office. Only a certain type of personality thrives on the duplicity needed to advance a political career.\r\n\r\nDemarchy will give every citizen equal political opportunity, irrespective of their personality, gender, ethnicity, disability or belief.\r\n\r\nLike jury service, all citizens would be called at random to serve in the government for a fixed period of time. This is known as 'demarchy'.\r\n\r\nSigning this petition indicates your wish to have your government form a prototype 'citizen's assembly' giving us the right to directly participate in the running of our country, with future actions taken over the next FIVE years to formally change the main system of politics in this country from democracy to demarchy.\r\n",
