        "additional_details": "Our local County Council have announced there intentions to sell the building in which our day care centre is run from. Tom Thumb nursery located at Marsh House, Gaywood is currently attended by some 70 children and is expecting 70 more in September. The building if closed will stand vacant for approx. 3 years before being redeveloped. The parents and owners of Tom Thumb are hoping to buy the building and offer it as a community venue to other groups as well as continuing with it's daycare centre. Please help us in our fight to prevent the sale of our building for redevelopment. By signing we are hoping to force our Local Council to rethink the situation by either dismissing the idea of closure or considering our offer of purchasing it in order to keep it up and running and providing the much needed childcare for our children.",
