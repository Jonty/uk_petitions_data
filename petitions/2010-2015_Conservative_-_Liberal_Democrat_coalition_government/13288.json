        "additional_details": "For a long time now we have seen criminals commit the most outrageous crimes such as first degree murder and violent rape on our streets. When these evil beings are finally caught, we have witnessed that the victim's family are always let down by the courts as the sentences handed out for the criminal is as good as a slap on the wrist. I propose the justice system is improved and punishment matches the crime commited... for example, cold blooded convicted murderers should have no right to live themselves. If only we hand harsh punishments to criminals will it make those killing out of boredom think twice. We may not stop all but at least we will get some to think twice and start to make our streets safer.",
