        "additional_details": "The rules for eligibility for DLA/PIP changed such that anyone being out of the UK for more than 13 weeks in a year would lose DLA and have to reapply for PIP on return. ( Previously this was 26 weeks)\r\nThis means that a retired person cannot go on an extended overseas holiday lasting more than 13 weeks. This would prohibit a retired, disabled person from going on a world cruise or spending the summer with relatives in places such as Canada and Australia.\r\n\r\n DLA/PIP is supposed to help disabled people enjoy the quality of life of non disabled people as much as possible given the high extra costs of having a disability and as such these changes are highly discriminatory against disabled people who rely on DLA/PIP to maintain a reasonable quality of life.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to reinstate the previous eligibility criteria allowing DLA claimants to be absent from the UK for up to 26 weeks before DLA is cancelled and allow reinstatement on return from a temporary absence.",
