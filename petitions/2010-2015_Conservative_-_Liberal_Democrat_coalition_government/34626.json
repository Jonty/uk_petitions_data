        "additional_details": "The new government has proposed financial incentives for potential teachers based on degree classification and subject specialism.\r\n\r\nThis means that trainee teacher will receive up to \u00a320,000 if they have a First class degree and choose the 'right' subject to specialise in.\r\n\r\nThis is a form of inequality and indirect discrimination. Potentially outstanding teachers may be reluctant to join the profession due to lack of financial support. Teaching is profession that requires passion and skill - something that is not guaranteed from obtaining a First class degree.\r\n\r\nWe want equal bursaries for all PGCE students.",
