This child is the next generation of terrorists who will bring war to our shores! To stop this we need to get rid of the problem at the root! We need to eradicate all convicted terrorists, make sure they can't promote racial hatred. We therefore need to also eradicate hate preachers as they are the core problem! We should also not allow any suspect terrorist entry to our country! We need to do more to protect our country! ",
