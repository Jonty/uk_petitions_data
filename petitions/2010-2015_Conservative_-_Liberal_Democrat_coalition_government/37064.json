How so many people would love to play Youtube videos smoothly at 360p never mind 1080p.\r\n\r\nThe problem is multiplied by families with more than 1 person using the internet at a time, The internet can just grind to a halt because the speed provided cannot handle it.\r\n\r\nThe Cumbria County Council were set to receive \u00a317m to improve the internet however we haven't seen any evidence or news of this been used.\r\n\r\nWe would like confirmation of what we can expect and when we can expect it. But above all we want to see our speeds improving.\r\n\r\nGet us up to the standard of the rest of the nation!\r\n",
