        "additional_details": "It is no secret that the goverment seems to have a form of hatred for the games industry, afterall why would they be putting such heavy tax on something which in 2010 made almost \u00a310 billion.\r\n\r\nBy not Achknowledging the strenght of the games industry from an economic standpoint our goverment is choking tallent and forcing them to move to other countries just to follow there dream, doing this also chokes the country out of a very strong potential income which in this economic climate would benifit us greatly\r\n\r\nI call on all the members of the industry, all the indie developers and triple A publishers, to the public and the students hopeing to go into the industry, myself included, to stand together and say \"The Goverment must stop this blatent ignorance of the games industry\"\r\n\r\nThe action we want is simple, A perminant tax reduction to the games industry that is ether comparable to the tax in other countries or agreeable between developers and the goverment.\r\n\r\nThank you",
