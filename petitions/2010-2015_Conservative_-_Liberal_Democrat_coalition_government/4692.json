        "additional_details": "The Government recently announced changes to the state pension age and it is inevitable that all our pension age will have to rise . However,those affected must have enough notice of changes, to allow them time to plan their financial and working lives accordingly.\r\nThe Government has not given a group of women (aged 56 onwards) enough time to change their plans. These women have already accepted ONE increase in their state pension age - suddenly, this group of over 330,000 women  are now being targeted again, and being told their pensions will be delayed another up to 4 years . This is going to cause dreadful hardship to many.\r\nPLEASE SIGN PETITION TO HELP.",
