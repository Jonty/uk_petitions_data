We all know what a great threat this is to our health.\r\n\r\n        There have been numerous petitions on this site arising from the lack of control on dogs in general and dangerous dogs in particular. These mainly want to bring back dog licences, to muzzle dogs to microchips dogs and so on. I believe a more effective way, which will not harm the dog at all as micro-chipping is reported to do, is for local authorities to register a DNA sample of all dogs (and cats) and store this information in\r\na database.  Any dog or cat faeces found in a  forbidden area could then be analysed, thereby providing identification of the owner who would then be fined a \u00a3150 for the first offence and \u00a3250 thereafter.",
