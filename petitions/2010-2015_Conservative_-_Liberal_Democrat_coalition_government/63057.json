        "additional_details": "The Asian food items imported from the South Asian countries or produced here in the UK, should be tested for adulteration and purity. In the UK, South Asian grocery shops are selling impure food  items, that are targeted at consumers from countries like India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka etc., One such food item is 'Ghee' (cooking fat) that is not 100% pure and contains vegetable oil or other animal fat. This is wrong. Pure Ghee is made from pure milk cream without any additives. This is just one example. These shops are freely selling 100s of other food products that contain ingredients which they should not. Ironically, there is no check in place, simply because the concerned department doesn't know what the products are and what they should contain.\r\n\r\nThe concerned department of the UK Government should form teams involving people from different ethnic backgrounds who would know what the product is and what it should contain. Such teams should collect random food samples for testing.\r\n",
