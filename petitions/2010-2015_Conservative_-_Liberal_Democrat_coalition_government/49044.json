        "additional_details": "During the time that Michael Gove has held the position as the Secretary for Education he has habitually condemned and damned those people he is supposed to hold closest to him, the teachers.  He does not support them in what they do, makes derisory comments and seems intent on making what is already an extremely difficult job even harder.  He knows nothing of the work and hours put in by teachers or he would not act in the manner he does. If allowed to continue in this roll then we will see a huge shortage of teachers as people will not want to take the career up.  As such it should be debated whether or not Mr Gove should be allowed to continue in this role or if he should be removed/step down.",
