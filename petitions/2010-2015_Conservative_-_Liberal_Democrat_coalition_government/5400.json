        "additional_details": "There is growing pressure on the Government to do away with GMT and keep British Summer Time all year round. That means no more putting the clocks back - instead we could all enjoy an extra hour of afternoon daylight from October to March. It would be better for business, better for people's general well-being and would greatly reduce the number of fatalities on Britain's roads.",
