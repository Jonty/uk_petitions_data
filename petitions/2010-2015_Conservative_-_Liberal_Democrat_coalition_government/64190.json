        "additional_details": "With 6.5 million carers in The UK, saving The Government an estimated \u00a31.6 billion, why do we only receive the same as those on Job Seekers Allowance, who do no work whilst claiming?  We perform a thankless task, often with no breaks from our 24 hr, 7 day a week duties, with only the generosity of local charities contributing towards a respite break (max \u00a3250 in a 12 month period).  I'd like The Government to increase the allowance to reflect the hrs worked (minimum pay would be ideal over 35 hrs) & create a \"pot\" which carers could use to take a holiday. Pensioners receive a winter fuel allowance, (regardless of wealth), so why not introduce a Carers Respite Break Allowance every year?",
