        "additional_details": "Montenegro has had visa-free travel for most of Europe for the past few years and this has dramatically helped improve relations between Montenegro and the Schengen Zone. Britain should follow suit and abolish the expensive and overly complex process of Visas of Montenegrin citizens.\r\n\r\nThe current system is very expensive and unjust for ordinary tourists and those with friends and family from Montenegro. The UK should demonstrate its commitment to South Eastern Europe and Montenegro\u2019s transition.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of Visas is long overdue and should be done as soon as possible as a sign of goodwill and as a stimulus towards economic and social exchange.",
