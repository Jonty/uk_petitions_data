        "additional_details": "Over the last hundred years the rights of individuals in this country have gradually equalised - from votes for Women to anti-discrimination acts protecting the rights of people of any age, race, creed, gender or sexuality. It is time this equality was extended fully because religion still has privileges not afforded to any other part of society.\r\n\r\nAn incomplete list of some places to begin:\r\n\r\n- Remove all state funding for Faith schools, including the building of them, running of them and transport for them.\r\n- Remove all guaranteed peer positions for religious institutions.\r\n- Form a Republic unless the Monarchy gives up its position as head of the Church of England.\r\n- Remove the act of swearing on the bible from the legal system.\r\n- Remove charitable status from all religious institutions.\r\n- Refuse any funding to future state visits by religious figures.\r\n- Balancing any religious education in schools and removing the requirement for a generally Christian worship.",
