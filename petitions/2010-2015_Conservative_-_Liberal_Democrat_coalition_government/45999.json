        "additional_details": "Current cancer treatment funding is still being subjected to an unfair postcode lottery.\r\n\r\nTreatments that are available in one trust area, are not being made available in all trusts. Some treatments are being fully funded by certain  trusts, where as others are denying treatment unless self-funding option is taken by patient.\r\n\r\nThe NHS should be operating equally, across all trusts as a NATIONAL Health Service.\r\n\r\nPlease support this e-petition to get this great mis-justice debated and corrected by the Government.\r\n\r\nJeremy Hunt  seems to very keen on this matter, and I would hope he would be the first one to vote for this.",
