        "additional_details": "There is a huge amount of growing discontent among football fans about the way the game is run at international level.  The international football governing body headed by Sepp Blatter has lost all respect from British football fans in the wake of many allegations of corruption at the highest level.  As well as numerous quotes attributed to Sepp Blatter which call into question his and FIFA's stance on issues of Sex, Racist and Homophobic discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for The Football Association, The Scottish Football Association, The Football Association of Wales and The Irish Football Association to withdraw from FIFA and all its competitions.\r\n\r\nA new independent governing body should be formed with fairness and transparency at its heart.  With all other countries invited to take part.",
