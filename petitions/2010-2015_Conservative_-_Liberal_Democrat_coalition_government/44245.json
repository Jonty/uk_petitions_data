        "additional_details": "MPs do a job that requires no formal qualifications, has no set hours, and they don\u2019t even need to live in their constituencies.\r\n\r\nStarting on \u00a365,738, they have access to expenses; and offices and staff whose cost is picked up by the tax payer.\r\n\r\nDespite this generous package, over the last few years MPs appear to have got increasingly out of touch with the problems of ordinary working people, young families, and people on benefits. They have fiddled their expenses, and disappeared into the jungle, instead of holding the government to account.\r\n\r\nNow they seem to think they deserve a 32% pay-rise (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-20978487)\r\n\r\nTo help give them a better idea of what real life is like, they should be paid the national minimum wage (\u00a315,420 for a 48 hour working week).\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not proposing they give up their allowances, pension, second jobs or any other source of income so they\u2019ll get by... But at least we\u2019d be getting better value for money ",
