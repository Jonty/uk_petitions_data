Having a younger brother who is majorly depressed due to bullying at his school the subject of bullying really gets me going. I know what it's like to be bullied, it's the worst thing for school children to have to deal with, but I also know what it's like to bully someone else: Not satisfying. I wish that bullying would be illegal in the UK due to the amount of suicides that have occurred, my brother also speaks of suicide. Bullying WILL be illegal, it's only a matter of time. Thank you for your support.",
