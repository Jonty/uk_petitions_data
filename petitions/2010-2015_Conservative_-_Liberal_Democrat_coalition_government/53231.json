        "additional_details": "Like many young people I would like to be able to drive a car to take me to places I need to be. For example, I would like a new job which is quite far from where I live and public transport would mean it would take me around 2 hours to get there - which is ridiculous.   Obviously statistics show that younger people are more dangerous and daring on the roads, but why can't insurance companies put people on something like a 6 month trial, making sure they obide by the driving laws, and confescating their liscense if they fail to do so. Its great to be able to drive, but witthout a car, its impossible.",
