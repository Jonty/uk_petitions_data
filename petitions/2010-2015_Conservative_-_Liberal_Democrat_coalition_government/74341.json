        "additional_details": "Having renewed my passport two years ago (mainly for ID purposes as can no longer afford holidays abroad), at a cost of over \u00a370, I have discovered that as I have married and taken my husbands name, I have to pay for a full renewal, thereby paying for the same eight year period from 2015 to 2023 twice.\r\n\r\nI had thought that the simple solution would be to use my Maiden name if I were to book travel abroad, but apparently that is fraud as I am no longer known by my Maiden name. This has further been compounded by the birth of our daughter and the fact that her birth certificate has my married name.\r\n\r\nI am therefore requesting that the Government consider, in this age of sexual equality, to consider whether it is fair to penalise women that take their husbands name. Furthermore, to look at the costs involved in amending a passport rather than issuing a full passport, to consider a sliding scale of administration costs dependant on the time remaining on the passport.",
