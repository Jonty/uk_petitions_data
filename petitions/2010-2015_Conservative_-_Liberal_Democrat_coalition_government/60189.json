        "additional_details": "I am petitioning the government to offer a solution to the situation that many Privately Contracted Armed Security Personnel (PCASPs) find themselves in as a result of the introduction of the Maritime Labour Convention (2006).\r\n\r\nResolution VII of the convention concludes that PCASPs are not seafarers and as a result are no longer entitled to discharge books or seaman\u2019s cards from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.\r\n\r\nMany PCASP\u2019s are ex-military and have been made redundant by recent defence cuts and have used ECLAS grants to retrain into alternative employments such as Maritime Security.\r\n\r\nWhat solution can the government offer to PCASPs who undertook training prior to the MCA\u2019s decision to withdraw the facility of discharge books to PCASPs and who now find themselves unemployable on British flagged vessels?\r\n",
