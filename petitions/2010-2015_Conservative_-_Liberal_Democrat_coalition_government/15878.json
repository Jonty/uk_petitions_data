        "additional_details": "As a group of 12 youths we have come together and decided to change the perception of youths these days, especially after the recent riots we feel a change is needed to unite youths and give them a chance to showcase there talents, as we are the future. We simply wish hold a series of events/Shows, in which young people can integrate and also a way of keeping them off the streets. All we ask  for is a small amount of funding, to rent out a hall and hire equipment. This small amount of money could go a long way and change a lot of youths lives. We are holding a campaign for our platform, on the 24th September 2011 in 3 locations Croydon, Clapham and Stockwell we hope to see you there, we will have youths performing various talents as a taster of what is hopefully to come, also a hand written petition to be signed please follow and support us, and help the youths of today 'Rise to the platform'",
