        "additional_details": "Considering recent controversy concerning cuts to the NHS made by the government and its restructuring, this petition is for the creation of an independent board that replaces the role of the Secretary of State for Health.\r\n\r\nIt makes sense for all decisions concerning the NHS to be made primarily by qualified & experienced health professionals from different fields, who understand the system & know best how to use resources while not compromising patient care. Union representatives should also be included. We should not doubt the intelligence of Jeremy Hunt, but  he is ultimately a career politician with very little clinical experience. The NHS is one of the best public health systems in the world, but should no longer be used as a weapon or game piece within British politics. This is damaging it, in addition to the 5 year government terms that render long term changes ineffective.\r\n\r\nAll government propositions (e.g. restructuring and financial matters) must be approved by the board.",
