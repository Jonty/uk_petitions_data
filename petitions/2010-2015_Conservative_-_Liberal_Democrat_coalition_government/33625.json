        "additional_details": "I would like the council housing list's priority need banding changed. While I agree that they help most, I feel that the following should be eliminated, unless said people face soon homelessness:\r\n\r\nPregnant women, or those who live with them.\r\n\r\nI am contesting this purely and solely because a lot of people deliberately have children to gain free housing and to continually abuse our benefit system, because they are too lazy to work. I know this for a fact as they have told this to me themselves.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose that the Priority Need banding should be changed to these bands of people getting Priority Need:\r\n\r\n1. Those who face becoming UNINTENTIONALLY HOMELESS within the next two weeks, and have nowhere else to go (whether they have children or not). And all the other criteria, except people who are given priority just because they have children or are pregnant.\r\n\r\nThis, I feel, will stop a lot of people abusing our benefits system and lessen teenage pregnancy.
