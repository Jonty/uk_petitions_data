        "additional_details": "Chess should be added to the school curriculum.  It is fun, and educational. It promotes logical thinking and focused thought, and does so in a game format which appeals to young minds. Also there is a rich and varied history to the game. It could be taught with a mixture of theory and practice, much like music is currently.",
