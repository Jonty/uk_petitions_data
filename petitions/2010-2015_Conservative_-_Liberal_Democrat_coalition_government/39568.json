        "additional_details": "We propose that passengers should be refunded around 2% of their train fare for every minute a train is late arriving at their destination.\r\n\r\nThis refund should be redeemable from the ticket office at the destination upon production of the ticket for the journey without the need for time-consuming applications for refunds which the train operators know are often forgotten about and never made.\r\n\r\nThis system would act as an extra incentive for train operators to conform to their own timetables and provide compensation for passengers who have not received the service they paid for in good faith.\r\n\r\nIf enforced, this system would likely lead to many refunds of a few pence that passengers may not consider worth claiming back. In this situation, we propose that these refunds be used to make a charitable donation where they may accumulate to make a considerable difference over time.\r\n",
