        "additional_details": "For example, drinking and driving should not disqualify (even for a driving job) for recovered alcoholics. Also common assault is not wounding, grievous bodily harm, occasioning bodily harm, manslaughter or murder. Fraud is different from robbery or theft. Certain offences (like for traffic, common assault or fraud) need not be revealed even when applying for a job requiring enhanced CRB checks, after a few years of no further record of committing such offences. A person should be given another chance to obtain a career of their choice or qualified to do. Also CRB checks should be within a limited timeline (say 2 weeks), otherwise it may jeopardise a job offer. A criminal offence should not disqualify a person of a job, as it is up to the discretion of the employer. However, checks on the register of offences against vulnerable people and sex offenders register should be given priority than general CRB checks.",
