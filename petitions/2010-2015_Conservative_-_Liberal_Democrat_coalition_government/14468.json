        "additional_details": "This petition is to get more justice and protection for the females who are in danger due to violent relationships, be it at present or in the past. We believe no female should be the victim of violent behaviour, and serious threats. The police do too little to protect them, so if this petition can give them more power to lock away those responsible, then at least we made a change. This is a really serious issue. Females i know have experienced this, they make numerous 999 calls because they are in danger, but nothing ever happens. This is a disgrace to the women of Britain. Sign this and make a difference, even save a life.",
