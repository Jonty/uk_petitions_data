        "additional_details": "Please ban the sale of fireworks to the general public.  Every year we endure weeks of people letting off fireworks in October and November.  They're not only noisy at all hours of the night but also a hazard if not handled properly or are let off too close to residential homes.  Not everyone likes fireworks, least of all young children and pets.  Public displays are not only more fun but they're also limited to just a few nights per year.",
