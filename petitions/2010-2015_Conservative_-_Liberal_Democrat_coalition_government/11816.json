Civitas reports that \"There is a proven correlation between illiteracy, innumeracy and offending.\" The statistics suggest that, for whatever reason, inmates have not benefitted from the education available to them outside of prison. The facilities already exist under the rules, so compulsion would be just be part of the sentence. ",
