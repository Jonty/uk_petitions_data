Also not all business can allow their staff to be off all at the same time therefore is the department of education now saying that children are not entitled to holidays with their parents anymore.\r\n\r\nAll children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year.\r\n\r\nGood parents or parents that work full time should not be criminalised for wanting to enjoy an affordable annual family holiday.\r\n\r\n",
