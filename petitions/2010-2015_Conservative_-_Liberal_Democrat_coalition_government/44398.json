        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call upon Tesco and Sainsbury's to reduce fuel prices in Newbury to those charged in Reading, Basingstoke and Andover and for the price in each location to always remain the same. This prevents local price fixing and residents in Newbury and surrounding areas losing out financially due to market conditions and lack of competitivity due to the absence of fuel discounters such as ASDA.",
