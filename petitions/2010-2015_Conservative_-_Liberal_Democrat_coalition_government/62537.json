        "additional_details": "I as many others will, believe that Emile William Ivanhoe Heskey should receive a knighthood for his services to the English game. Emile has changed to the way the game is played. He is an experienced, well loved and all round genius player and these accolades have so far, I feel, gone unnoticed. He has been an inspirational player at all the following English clubs: Liverpool, Leicester, Birmingham, Aston Villa and Wigan. He has inspired me and many others to take up football and is a true ambassador for the game.",
