        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, are of the opinion that euthanasia should be legalised in such a way that it allows those who clearly wish to end their lives, yet are unable to do so themselves, to be assisted by certified medical professionals in doing so. It is equally important that it should be moderated such that the interests of the vulnerable are protected in order to prevent them being taken advantage of. In addition, where successful treatment and rehabilitation is plausible, it should be pursued. In short, general terms - and provided one has the mental ability to informedly make such a decision - whether one wants to live or to die, it should be one's own choice to make.",
