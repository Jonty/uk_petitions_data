        "additional_details": "The Atlantic Array Wind Farm is an abomination. It will be a blot on the marinescape and ruin the beautiful coastline of Devon. It will provide no lasting source of power and will not result in a penny off consumers' electricity bills. The Atlantic Array is a sop to the green lobby and must be suffocated at birth before the precedent is set to destroy our rural heritage with wind farms and fields full of photovoltaic cells.",
