        "additional_details": "My name is James Austin I'm 69 years old and I have got a learning disability. I go to Thrive garden centre twice a week, it's for people whose got a learning disability and are disabled I already pay \u00a350.91 a week that is for 2 days at Thrive.\r\n\r\nWandsworth Council are saying that I'm in debt for \u00a33,000 which Thrive is a charity which I already pay the council \u00a350.91 a week. Because I'm an elderly gentleman I don't feel I should have to pay the council anything more.\r\n\r\n I'm a pensioner I can't afford it they put it up this time last year from \u00a338.17 to \u00a343.82. Then this past April it went to \u00a350.91 a week. (Youngsters and Alcoholics get referred to Thrive and pay nothing and it seems like I'm paying the council to swept up all the leafs at Battersea Park)\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm starting this petition is to ask if someone is in the same position as I am.\r\n\r\nwritten by my Support Worker (Jake)",
