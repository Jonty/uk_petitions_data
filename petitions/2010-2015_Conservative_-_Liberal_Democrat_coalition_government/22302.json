We want everyone to benefit from secure, clean, reliable solar projects of all sizes. We, call upon the Government to:\r\n* implement a \u2018Community Feed in Tariff rate\u2019 for community enterprises, charities, schools, co-operatives, CICs, religious groups and other community owned and led solar PV initiatives\r\n* This feed in tariff level must provide a rate of return which makes accessing finance a viable option to realise these projects and exempt such groups from the proposed 80% aggregated reduced rate.\r\n*set an ambitious target for the installation of community renewables for the civic estate (like that in Scotland).\u201d",
