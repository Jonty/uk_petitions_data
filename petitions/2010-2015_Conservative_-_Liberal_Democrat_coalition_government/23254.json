        "additional_details": "When the forces are comprised of professional personnel it is equitable that injured forces personnel are maintained on the roll. Injured personnel could form training units, adminstrative units or take over civilian MOD jobs releasing more for front line duty.This would improve morale of both injured and non-injured personnel and live up to the tenets of 'Serve to Lead' issued to all Army Offcers and maintain the Military Contract.  The Government should maintain injured servicemen on the forces roll in these terms and for these reasons.",
