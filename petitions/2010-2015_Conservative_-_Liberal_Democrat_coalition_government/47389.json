        "additional_details": "Grace Ava Williams was born with full trisomy 18 (Edward's syndrome) and told she would live 5-15 days. She is now nearly four months old and needs a life-saving heart operation but is being denied this on the NHS because \"she has Edward's syndrome\". Dr. Anand Saggar, Senior Consultant Clinical Geneticist in Harley Street says about Grace \"Although Grace has full T18 she has a milder version and I see no reason, if progress continues to thrive, why one would not operate to close the VSD\" (hole in her heart) but Great Ormond Street will not operate. Grace's family have met a young lady called Saskia who has full Edward's Syndrome and is 21 and attends college. Yes, Grace has a disability but that does not mean she should die. There are many people in this country with disabilities who live extraordinary lives. Please sign this petition to show your support for Grace's fight for her life. ",
