        "additional_details": "\r\nOn 6th April 1978 the Armed Forces Pension Scheme was changed to allow widows who married their husbands after leaving the Armed Forces to have a pension.  There was no opportunity to 'buy-in' previous service so there is a block that bars any service prior to 6th April 1978 from counting towards such a pension.  Some widows have no entitlement because their husbands left the Armed Forces prior to this date; others have only a portion of entitlement because their husbands had service before and after that date. FPS have long campaigned on this matter and so far have had no success in persuading the Government to remove this unfairness.\r\nWidows of Ex Servicemen should all be entitled to a pension.",
