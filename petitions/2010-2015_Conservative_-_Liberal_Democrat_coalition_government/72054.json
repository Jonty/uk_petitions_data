        "additional_details": "Tax and National Insurance is standard throughout the UK, so we all pay the same, however only the English pay \u00a38.10 for each item on an NHS prescription. This is unfair.\r\n\r\nCharging \u00a31 for each prescription (irrespective of the number of items on it) throughout the UK would be fair.\r\n\r\nThe \u00a31 charge is low enough for ALL patients to afford, including those currently exempt and the nominal charge would result in less waste of medicine by those who fail to value anything they don't have to pay for.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the \u00a38.10 prescription charges would be more than offset by the reduction in wastage and the greater number of patients paying something (about 90% of patients receive free prescriptions now).\r\n\r\nI currently receive free prescriptions as a Cancer patient, but in the interests of fairness, I would be happy to pay the \u00a31 charge I propose.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to support a proposal which is both fair to everyone and affordable.",
