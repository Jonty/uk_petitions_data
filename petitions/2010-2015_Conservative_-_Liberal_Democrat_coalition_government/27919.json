        "additional_details": "Following the governments decision to triple university fees, I feel that there should be a review into the decision by a cross party committee that includes interllectuals, teachers and students. I'd we triple the fees, then shouldn't we also triple the threshold of when you start paying back? I think that if this can't be achieved (as it would end up as \u00a345,000) then the threshold should be increased to \u00a330,000 from the current \u00a321,000. Also, student loans should be payed back at the rate of interest during the time of the students university time e.g if a student went away for 3 years and theinterest rate was 4% each year, then the average is 4% and so the interest on the loan should be 4%.",
