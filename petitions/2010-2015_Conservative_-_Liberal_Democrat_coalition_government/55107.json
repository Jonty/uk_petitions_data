        "additional_details": "As many will know Jeremy Bamber was jailed in 1985 after being convicted of killing 5 members of his family. However the evidence supporting that conviction is shaky at best. Dead bodies moving from kitchen to upstairs, silencers suddenly being found, telephone logs that state officers were talking to someone at inside the farm, marks appearing on mantle months after the event. Justice has not been done in this case.\r\nTherefore we the people demand that this case be examined using all the scientific technologies available. We demand that Jeremy Bamber either faces retrial or is granted a pardon. ",
