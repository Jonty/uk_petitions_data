Increases fuel consumption.\r\n4.    Increases polution.\r\n5.    Increases stress.\r\n\r\nFor safety sake, you should always keep a distance between you and the vehicle in front of you of AT LEAST one car length per every 10 mph that you're driving. For example if you're driving 60 mph, make sure there is at least six car lengths between your car and the one in front of you.\r\n\r\nPlease create a law for this and start enforcing this.",
