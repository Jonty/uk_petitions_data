This means that we the People are responsable to Governement and not the Government responsable to the people. The result of which is that MPs pass laws and regulation that the people did not ask for, we can remove the political party at the next general elaction but cannot undo the laws and regulations passed. This means in its basic term that we have an elected dictatorship and not a true representation of the classes and ethnic backgrounds representing and protecting the population.\r\nWith a written constition based on Swedish/American priciples written by an independent body and approved in a referendum HM Government would be and could held responsable to the nation and to the head of state",
