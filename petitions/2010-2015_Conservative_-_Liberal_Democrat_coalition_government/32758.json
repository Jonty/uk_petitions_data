        "additional_details": "For decades the world has ignored the Swaziland Monarch's and Government's blatant disregard for democracy and human rights. It is also guilty of serious financial misconduct as a chosen few line their own pockets at the expense of an ever more impoverished majority.\r\nAnd what does the British Government and the West do? Nothing!\r\nWe believe it is high time that the British Government applied political and economic pressure on this malignant dictatorship and offered support to its pro-democracy movement.\r\n",
