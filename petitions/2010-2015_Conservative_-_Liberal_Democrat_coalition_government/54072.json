        "additional_details": "Many people, rightly or wrongly, are being sanctioned because it is decided that they have not met their responsibilities regarding their entitlement to Welfare Benefits.\r\n\r\nAs a civilised society we must ensure that people at least have food on their plate.  Currently anyone under sanction has all benefits stopped. This is draconian and we must ensure that each person at least has sufficient funds for basic food each day.\r\n\r\nThis Petition is to demand that anyone under sanction is given \u00a310 per week (for each member in their household) for the purchase of food.\r\n\r\nCurrently it is an insult to the humanitarian aspect of society that even Food Bank vouchers are restricted to 3 times a year.",
