We believe that for ourselves, and for others.\r\n\r\nRussia in recent days has made a mockery of that belief. It has flagrantly and unapologetically occupied parts of Ukraine.\r\n\r\nThis cannot go unanswered by the international community or by the British government.\r\n\r\nIn the next week, the Winter Paralympic games start in the Russian city of Sochi.\r\n\r\nThe British government should recommend no British citizens (spectators or athletes) attend. The British government should recommend a boycott.\r\n",
