        "additional_details": "We are currently unable to carry knives in public which have a locking blade and/or are longer than 3 inches. The lock on a pocket knife is a safety feature to prevent the blade closing on the user's hand, a feature I personalty value quite highly.\r\n\r\nThe potential issue of criminal use is irrelevant as the majority of criminals use a fixed blade kitchen knife. By the very definition of criminals they will break the law meaning the only people disadvantaged by the current law are law abiding citizens.\r\n\r\nDue to these facts I request that the ban on carrying pocket knives with a locking blade be removed and instead a maximum length of 3 inches for all folding pocket knives, regardless of the lock or blade retention system in use, to be introduced for normal carry without other reason (i.e tools for work, hunting etc).",
