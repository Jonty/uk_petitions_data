This potential bill should include IT efficiency and modernisation within the police force and other organisations so that the PNC and other applicable departmental computer systems can be easily automatically checked by authorised persons carrying out CRB checks.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is to reduce business costs in employing people in a time when employment is needed and to stop detering poor people from applying for some jobs that require them to pay for a CRB.
