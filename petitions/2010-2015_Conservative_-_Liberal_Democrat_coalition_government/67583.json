        "additional_details": "At current, Cannabis is a Class B drug generating millions for the underground economy in the UK. The quality and toxcity of the end product varies on supply.\r\n\r\nFor some people the drug is a staple part of their lives, others use recreationally, much like alcohol or cigarettes. There have been more deaths linked to both legal substances.\r\n\r\nThe stigma surrounding cannabis and crime is ficticious, simply existing so people can look down on users of the drug, whilst they purchase their pack of twenty and bottle of wine a day.\r\n\r\nPut simply, 'the criminalisation of a plant' sounds absurd. But it doesn't have to be this way. Other countries such as Spain, allow growth of plants for personal use, whether it be smoking, cooking or for medicinal oils.\r\n\r\nLegalising cultivation for personal use would make a big dent in the underground economy, open up a new taxable market (equipment/consumables) and give people the freedom to choose/grow what they consume.",
