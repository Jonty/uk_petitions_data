        "additional_details": "It is so sad and disappointing to see that,there is no online electronic system to fill the immigration forms across all immigration visa categories at UKBA. UKBA (in country applications), requires applicants to print huge forms and fill it manually. For Example: - Tier 1 extension application has around 60+ pages and on an avg 1/2 of the application is left blank as it is not applicable to the applicant.\r\n\r\nWhile this has an adverse effect on the environment, it is error prone(any errors requires re-printing application form)  and time consuming to both applicant and the case worker.\r\n\r\nMoreover, UKBA introduced electronic applications for out of country applicants, but not for in country applicants.\r\n\r\nUKBA should upgrade there systems (like USA does) and provide various other services like online application tracking system etc..\r\n\r\nI urge UKBA to make a note of above and do the needful immediately...",
