        "additional_details": "In light of the refusal of Prime Ministers to refer public interest breaches, or suspected breaches, of the ministerial code for transparent and independent investigation this should be made compulsory. This would enhance public confidence in government and ensure ministers were truly accountable to the electorate for their actions. The current requirement for the Prime Minister to order such an enquiry allows for party political interference in the democratic right of the electorate to expect and to observe probity in government.",
