        "additional_details": "The June 2013 results for GCSE History Modern World B have drastically changed since January of 2013 for example a 32 on the A972/21 paper would give you a D in June but in January would give you a B, so we are asking for you to lower the Grade Boundaries as you have changed it so drastically. In addition to this the marking has been inaccurate checking the OCR website grade boundaries and comparing to results we have received, one of the sutdents had gotten 40 on A972A How Society changed in Britain and they got the grade of a C but on your website it states that a 40 would give you the grade of an A ( http://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/142071-unit-level-raw-mark-grade-boundaries-june-2013.pdf  (PAGE 45)) so we would also like you to reassess papers like you have done with A/AS levels exams ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-141039/Exam-grading-scandal-hit-100-000-pupils.html )\r\nSo students, please sign and help us lower the boundaries, it would mean a lot.",
