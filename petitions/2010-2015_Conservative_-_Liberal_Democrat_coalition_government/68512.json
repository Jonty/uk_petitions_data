The UK government should stop flights from these countries for the foreseeable future.\r\nA person who has been exposed to the Ebola virus may become unwell after arriving in the UK. As initial symptoms are similar to flu, this will put our dedicated doctors and nurses at risk before they know what they are dealing with, as has happened in Nigeria with one nurse dead and 8 other health workers having contracted the Ebola virus. We can stop Ebola coming to the UK.",
