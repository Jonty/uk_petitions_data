I agree that without it, the BBC could not operate in the way it does, but allow the public the choice please.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a debate for several options:-\r\n\r\n1. Integration of the fee into television packages. (Sky/Virgin). With no increase in package fees to the customer. In effect, the operator covers the cost through advertising.\r\n\r\n2. Pay-as-you-watch scheme. Allow viewers to pay for what they use only.\r\n\r\n3. Total abolition of the fee. Allow the BBC to advertise and pay their own way.  ",
