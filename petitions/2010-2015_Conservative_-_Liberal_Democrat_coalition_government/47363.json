Instead of working a standard 8 hours a day, we should work for 10 hours a day 4 days a week, therefore meaning no work time has actually been lost throughout the week.\r\nDoing this will improve the moral of the British by allowing us a 3 day weekend, will potentially boost spending as people will not be working as many days, ergo boosting economy. As well as this the banks will be able to keep hold of our money for an extra day and gaining interest.  ",
