        "additional_details": "There is an obvious requirement for a National Support Service in times of emergency, unpredictable events and if a disaster occurs. The purpose of such a service is to assist local authorities, emergency services, other government agencies and if appropriate the private sector. Such a service could consist of former armed forces, emergency services and civil service personnel and also former non government employees who are adaptable and flexible. However, I would also embrace using the younger generation, particularly those who are not employed and willing to respond with a \u2018can do attitude\u2019.  It must be trained, tested and trustworthy and able to respond within a 24hr period. Those in the Service may have other jobs but employers would be expected to release them in the same manner as special constables, retained fire fighters etc. This service should be seen as an essential part of any National Contingency Plan but requires further debate.\r\n\r\n",
