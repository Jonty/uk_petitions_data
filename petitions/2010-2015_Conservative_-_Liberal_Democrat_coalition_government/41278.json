        "additional_details": "The government should extend the provision of further education funding to distance learning courses, from relevant individual modules to full degree level study and beyond.\r\n\r\nCurrent funding options are limited to low earners, and many people earning more than the minimum could and would like to develop themselves, but are unable to afford the fees. Distance learning education is much cheaper than full time study, and could address the shortfall of work experience in typical undergraduates. It would also provide a short term economic boost by allowing a learner to add value to their employer immediately and longer term by creating a better educated work force.\r\n\r\nThe government should offer student loans for fees, with a separate loan for technology, books and travel to the many lectures and study groups available. This will offer a choice of study options, as well as a credible alternative for those of who full time study is not an option. ",
