The labour government will now be forever associated with the recession, the tories with ms thatcher, the liberal democrats with their lying to students.\r\n\r\nParty politics in our system also creates safe seats and loses a sense of local community as we vote for the party we would rather have nationally rather than an MP that is best for our community as well as our nation.\r\n\r\nI propose government bans political parties and MPs are voted individually from now on.",
