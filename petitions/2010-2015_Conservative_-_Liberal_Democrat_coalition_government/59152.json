How can any constituent be expected to present a case for serious discussion by Parliament in a mere 1000 words? I petition the House to change to format of e petitions to a summary of 1500 words with an unlimited support document on the basis that accuracy is more important than brevity. Any one that writes a rambling inaccurate support document is going to get the response it deserves. A well written document will aid the house to judge properly.  ",
