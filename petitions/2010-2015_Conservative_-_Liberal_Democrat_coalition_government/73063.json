Authorities should now recognise the risk factor for this group of people is too high. There are now vehicles on the open market that pose little more risk to the general public, but give 100% more protection to our sons and daughters. Young people are afforded far more protect from less dangerous machines in the workplace. It is now time to stop the culling of our future adults on our highways, because of a lack of forward vision.",
