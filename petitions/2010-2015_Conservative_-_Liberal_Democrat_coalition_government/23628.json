        "additional_details": "The current legislation on climate change is not enough and real change has to take place.  The problem is that real change would be vastly unpopular so I propose that any climate change legislation put into place must be agreed on by the majority of parliament and not attached to one individual party.  It should follow the scientific consensus and should not be changeable for at least 10 years where it can be reassessed.  Any government cannot repeal the legislation within their own term in office and it can only be changed after the 10 year limit.",
