The matters discussed in such e-petitions are the responsibility of local government.\r\n\r\nLike HM Government's website, all local government websites should have an e-petition webpage to create e-petitions regarding purely local matters; the minimal number of signatures required for a successful e-petition should be 20% of the registered electorate of any local government authority or borough.",
