        "additional_details": "The government need to reintroduce this invaluable resource for all new parents. Whilst investment in the Health Visiting service is fantastic the removal of this free parenting book is catastrophic. Offering advice on all aspects of a child's development and growth, coupled with practical advice and information, the Birth to Five book is a practical parenting tool. The book, alongside the Health Visiting service, allows parents to be better informed and better equipped for the years ahead. The Government must review this decision as the impact will be enormous in the future.",
