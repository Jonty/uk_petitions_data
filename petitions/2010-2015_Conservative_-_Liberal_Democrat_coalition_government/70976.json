        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the government to grant Ramin Forghani asylum in the UK. Mr Forghani is going to be deported from the UK to his native Iran. He is an outspoken atheist and is vice-chairman of the Scottish Secular Society and faces serious threats against his life if he is sent back home, where he is viewed as a traitor to Islam. Whatever your opinion on religion and whatever your think of his views on religion - he does not deserve to die. Sign this petition! ",
