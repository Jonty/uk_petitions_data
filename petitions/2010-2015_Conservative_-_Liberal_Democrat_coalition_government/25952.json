        "additional_details": "MPs' gold-plated pensions 'are the most generous in the world.'\r\n\r\nWhen Public and Private sector workers are having their finances stretched to the limits with pension contribution rises, no pay increases and inflation increases, MP's continue to receive above level pay and pensions.\r\n\r\nWe are being told to pay more, work longer and get less, MP's have left themselves out and continue to receive huge pensions on top of the other benefits.\r\n\r\nMP's insist this is the only way to reduce the cost to taxpayers then MP's should be included in this.  MP's should lead by example and accept the same pay and pensions conditions they expect the rest of us to settle with.  After all, their pensions are funded by the taxpayer along with other Public Sector workers.\r\n\r\nThis means the same increases in contributions, the change from RPI to CPI, a reduction in overall benefits and having to work longer for the same amount of benefit.\r\n",
