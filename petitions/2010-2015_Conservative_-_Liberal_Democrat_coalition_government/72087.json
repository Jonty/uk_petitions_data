        "additional_details": "Good education of our children is the most important gift we can give to the future of our country. Disruption of this education harms not only the child but our ability as a country to be a positive influence on a world stage. Teachers are paid well, have very generous holidays and a short working week. Teachers must be forced to find a less disruptive way to resolve their grievances. The recent news story about a teacher/union rep (who hasn't taught for 14 years) inciting teachers to strike over her grievance against school management is an example of what is wrong with education in the UK",
