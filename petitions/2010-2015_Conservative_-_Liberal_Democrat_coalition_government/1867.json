        "additional_details": "I regularly travel up and down the M6 and am getting increasingly frustrated at the log jams and dangerous breaking caused after lorries overtake each other during the rush hour in the morning and in the evening.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that within 12 months of the passing of this petition, the Government conduct a one month study of the traffic flow over not less than 5 junctions of the M6 (north of the usual bottle necks at junctions 6 - 10A and outside of the summer holiday period).\r\n\r\nThen, immediately following such a study and outside the summer holiday period, carry out a one month trial of banning HGVs overtaking during the hours of 7am and 9am in the morning and 5 to 7 pm, Monday to Friday.  If it is proven that the flow of cars, buses and coaches is improved by the restriction then Parliament is to draw up legislation to make such restriction permanent on the M6 and separately review a similar scheme on the other congested motorway routes.",
