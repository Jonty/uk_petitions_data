The poor people on benefits who need benefit rises in line with inflation.\r\n\r\nWhat about the people who are University educated, who used to have 60k jobs, who now have no job, a mountain of debt, council tax bills of \u00a3140pm which are completely unaffordable - yet still aren't claiming benefits.\r\n\r\nPersonally, as soon as I became out of work I started freelance work, which barely pays the interest on my debts, but at least means I am contributing; working; making an effort to acheive something. I receive absolutely no support from the government (that I voted for) - and I totally reject being patronised by these people who have millions in the bank and listening to people in jobs with good pensions moaning.
