Training will be given and the resulting work supervised by approved and qualified buliding contractors. The sentence will not be considered served until the buidings are completed.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that none of the criminals profit from their behaviour, that all of the damaged buildings are restored, and all of this at minimal cost to the tax-payer.",
