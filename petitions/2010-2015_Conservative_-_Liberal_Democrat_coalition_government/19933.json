In these very hard times the free food will help many homes survive.\r\n\r\nAn estimated pounds 6.7m worth of food is being thrown away every week by supermarkets - enough to feed 370,575 homeless people.\r\n\r\nSunday Mirror:\r\nSupermarkets are throwing away nearly two million tons of fresh food every year...as people in poor countries starve.\r\nA Sunday Mirror investigation has found major chains dump enough food to feed 6.3million people a year.\r\nAnd our check of supermarket bins found that much of the grub they chuck out is not even past its sell-by date.\r\n",
