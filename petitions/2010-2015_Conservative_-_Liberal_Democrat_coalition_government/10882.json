        "additional_details": "I want to see the Government make prisons and the justice system become a pproper deterrent for crime. The sentencing of prisoners needs to be far tougher and reflect the nature of the crime. Prisoners should be made to do hard labour repairing roads, helping to build schools, hospitals and other public works. People should be taught to fear incarceration and not look at it as a \"Holiday Camp\" as they do currently.There should be no \"Time off for good behaviour\" merely extended sentences for anything less! There should be less rights for the perpetrator and more for the victim and society as a whole.",
