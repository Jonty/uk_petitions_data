        "additional_details": "We want our purpose built nursery which was built last year due to the high demand for nursery places in are area to stay. It is due to close on the 31st March this year.\r\nOther local nurseries are over subscribed and cant take on anymore children, and no other nursery accepts funded 2 year olds in this area and so whats the point in allowing parents to apply for 2 year funding when they are planning to remove the only nursery in the area able to take on their children.\r\nWe want to be listened to and if Barnardo's the charity cannot afford to carry on running the nursery then we want to stay open under another provider. We have even said that we would be willing to run the nursery as a parent run nursery - We just need to be listened too! The nursery is financially viable and ever day there is a greater need for a nursery in this area so please don't take away such a valued asset.",
