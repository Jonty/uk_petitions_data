        "additional_details": "Due to the amount of accidents outside of Moreton Community School Old Fallings Lane, Wolverhampton WV10 8BY involving students & non students we the parents, carers & teachers want the Bus Stop moving from outside the school gates. Buses congregate & park there making it a nightmare when children are going in & coming out of school. Visibility in both directions is very limited with all of the traffic & People.There are currently 3 Bus Stops on Old Fallings Lane within I would say approx 600 yards of each other. All it would take is a further 1 minute to walk to the next Bus Stop down the road.This move would help ensure childrens safety.",
