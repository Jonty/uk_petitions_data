        "additional_details": "Whenever I use the M25 to go to a morning meeting, I waste around an hour sitting in stop start traffic.  I suffer mainly from J5 to J11, but I think it's all round the M25.  I feel it would be well worth having to pay if I could avoid all that wasted time.  I hate to think how much all that wated time every day is costing everyone affected (and that's not even taking into account the environment).  A congestion charge at peak times would stop anyone using the M25 who did not absolutely have to at rush hour, thereby adding \u00a3millions (or \u00a3billions given how big a car park the M25 can be?) in extra productivity.  I do not know how much a charge should be, but I should think around \u00a320 to make a real difference.  I know paying for things that are currently free wont be enjoyable (including myself), but in this case it would stop wasting so much of everyone's time, which is surely priceless.",
