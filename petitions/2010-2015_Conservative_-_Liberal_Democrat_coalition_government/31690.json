        "additional_details": "I'm a firm believer that given too much time politicians will talk without purpose and this is inefficient. I propose that parliament only be open for a maximum of 3 days per week. This will encourage them to:\r\n- focus only on discussing important matters (as they won't have time to discuss less important matters)\r\n- be brief if they really want to produce a result\r\n- work with each other to produce a result\r\n- spend more time in the constituencies\r\n- explore/negotiate options and solutions outside of parliament\r\nA working day needs to be defined as a calendar day of 24 hours and is not extendable as they currently do.\r\nThe only exception would be if a State of Emergency has formally been declared.\r\nPlease support my petition.\r\nThank you.",
