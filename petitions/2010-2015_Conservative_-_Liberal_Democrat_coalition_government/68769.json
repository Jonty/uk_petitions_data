That money has then been used to fund the unlawful and cruel deaths of hundreds, possibly THOUSANDS of innocent civilians at the hands of the terrorists involved.  THAT IS INCREDIBLY UNFAIR AND UNJUSTIFIABLE TO THE PEOPLE WHO LOSE THEIR LIVES AS A RESULT OF THESE BLOOD PAYMENTS. The, non-islamic,  people of this country do not wish to be associated with countries who are funding worldwide terrorism through payment of ransoms.  We, to our UTTER shame, already labour under the spectre of David Cameron massaging our taxpayer pounds across the planet to fund worldwide terrorism through what he revels in referring to as 'good for us' Foreign Aid payments.",
