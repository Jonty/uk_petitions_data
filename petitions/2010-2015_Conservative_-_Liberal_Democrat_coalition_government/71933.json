        "additional_details": "I am sick of those who smoke and think that they are above all non-smokers. Although they may not smoke some smokers believe that they have the right to drag the likes of us non-smokers down along with them.The fumes that are produced are vile and disgusting and endangering the lives of many old and young human beings.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong I do not have a problem with those who smoke but those who think it is okay to blindly rob the fresh air that we truly deserve.\r\n\r\nI would be okay with public smoking but its the people who do not even ask if other people mind. Most smokers could be smoking right next to a person who suffers from asthma which could in the long term lead to the death of a everyday citizen.\r\n\r\nDid you know that over 12,000 die from passive smoking alone in the UK.\r\n\r\nAll I want from this petition is for those who do smoke to take more consideration for those around them.",
