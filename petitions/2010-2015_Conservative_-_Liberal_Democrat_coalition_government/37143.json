        "additional_details": "Local councillors VERY quickly (more quickly even than national politicians) become accustomed to the gravy train.  This is because they have no need to impress the local people because council tax payers who refuse to pay (especially if they are old age pensioners) go to jail.  If local activities were paid for voluntarily on the basis of how well local councillors do the job for which they put themselves forward and were elected, then we might see some probitive, honest and appropriate use of council taxpayer pounds.",
