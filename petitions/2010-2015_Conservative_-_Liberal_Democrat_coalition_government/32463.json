        "additional_details": "We ask that all UK schools should become religion-free private schools, and that the government should fund each pupil, whether currently at a state or private school, using a term-based education voucher to cover the provision of an education appropriate to the  country's needs at the beginning of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nLocal education authorities should relinquish all responsibility for education, but keep responsibility for maintaining its school estates as at the date of change-over. Thenceforward, each private school would be responsible for improvements to, or the rebuilding of any schools deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nThe head teacher and governors of each private school would then be entirely responsible to its parents for the teaching quality and examination results at the school and the employment of its teachers.\r\n\r\nParents would be free to use their child's education voucher to enroll their chiold at a private school that is willing to accept them.",
