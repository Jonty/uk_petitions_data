        "additional_details": "UK Government to bring in a new law which forbids sale of fireworks all year round to general public.\r\n\r\nIn countries, such as Norway & Germany, fireworks can only be purchased in week between Christmas & New Year.\r\n\r\nCurrently, anyone can let of fireworks 7 days a week (365 days) up until 11pm.  At certain festivities they can be let of until 1am!\r\n\r\nFireworks disturbs peace, makes dogs, cats & other animals terrified out of their wits & awakens children & frightens the elderly.\r\n\r\nAll of this is dependent on people being responsible & abiding by current laws, but as we know, a minority has no respect for law and flout it when it pleases them.\r\n\r\nAt very least we should have similar law to Norway & Germany where it is an offence to sell fireworks anytime before 1 week to Guy Fawkes night.\r\n\r\nIf you feel society would benefit from a sensible approach to fireworks I would urge you to sign the petition so we may lobby MPs/Parliament to make a change to the current law.",
