        "additional_details": "To teach the religion of modern spiritualism in schools. This would entail the teachings of being conscious of life in all forms, and how that aspect affects our universe. To teach children love compassion and peace to all forms of life and in turn finding peace and compassion for themselves. To teach the ways of being happy with who we are rather than what we've got. Also to teach the acceptance of a higher power and through subconscious connections we are all as one. There are some children born with the gift of being able to connect with the universe in this way. Lets harness these gifts and learn the blanks science through human perception cannot fill! ",
