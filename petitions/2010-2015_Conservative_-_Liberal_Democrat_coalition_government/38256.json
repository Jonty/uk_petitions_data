I never had this help and was fobbed off and passed onto the Council who have equally confusing forms. As a consequence I am standing trial on 7th September being sued by the Council being accused of fraud!  I was a mature University student and it is sending out a very negative message. I know I am not the only one. Its too beaurocratic.",
