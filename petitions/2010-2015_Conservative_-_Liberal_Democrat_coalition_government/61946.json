        "additional_details": "Some malware is designed to periodically issue commands on a victims PC, typically to overload a website/server.\r\nGroups of infected computers are called botnets, they are run by cybercriminals and are a nuisance on the internet.\r\n\r\nAttacks involve making many false requests to a server in order to overload it, or making false requests to other servers and directing the response at the target.\r\nAttempts to block this fail because the botnet generates fake IPadresses in order to continue attacking.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION:\r\n\r\nMake consumer ISPs block ALL outgoing packets that claim to originate from outside their network.\r\n\r\nThis will make UK computers in botnets less effective and therefore less appealing to cyber criminals for this purpose, thereby making all UK citizens slightly safer on the internet. This won't affect normal usage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, compel ISPs to tell their customers in such instances so that those customers know that they need to remove malware from their computers.",
