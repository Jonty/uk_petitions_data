        "additional_details": "The quality of care at Eastbourne District General Hospital needs urgent attention. The current quality of caregiving at DGH especially to the elderly and other vulnerable groups needs addressing. Communication, compassionate care giving and medical services are all key elements of our campaign. We have evidence to support that in certain areas of the hospital these basic and necessary components are not being effectively performed. Distressing experiences of inadequate care for patients and their relatives have been reported at the DGH. We NEED a fully functioning hospital with all vital services in place in Eastbourne and Campaign for Change supports the fight to retain all these services however our focus is on ensuring that the levels of care are substantially improved and maintained throughout the hospital!! Eastbourne District General Hospital needs their Basic Human rights caregiving investigated and addressed NOW!",
