We have these disposal tubes/holes in our public toilets.\r\nIt is now a problem to let my daughters go into one of these toilets without me or mother double checking toilet cubical for needles first. Also we have recently found needles and spoons in our nearby park, so I feel that this is not helping the drug problem and is almost condoning use in public toilets.\r\n\r\nBAN NEEDLE DISPOSAL FACILITIES IN PUBLIC TOILETS!\r\n\r\nMaybe real help can be offered to users of these terrible dugs! Instead of this!\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN THIS PARTITION TO STOP THIS!",
