        "additional_details": "Builders continually want to build more houses in Faringdon, Oxfordshire despite the town having a stretched infrastructure & limited employment opportunities. In the last few years hundreds of additional houses have been added to the town, but they still want to build more. One area scheduled for development is a field known locally as Humpty Hill. Locals are against this development as it is on the western edge of the town & far from the shops & main roads etc. as well as being an area enjoyed for recreation by the town for many years.\r\nThis development was turned down, but the developer has appealed. The Vale of the White Horse District Council have referred the appeal to the Secretary of State for a decision & we want them to uphold the original decision of refusing development on this land.",
