Domestic violence leaves life long scars for all victims that do actually survive and nobody should have to feel failed by their justice system. I want the justice system to up the severity of domestic violence, review all current regulations and laws to look into ways of improving how the cases are dealt with and improving support for all victims during and after the abuse has taken place.",
