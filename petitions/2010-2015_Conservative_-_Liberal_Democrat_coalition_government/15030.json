        "additional_details": "Chewing gum has little to no nutritional value, and is more often thrown away than swallowed by the consumer, leading to gum being deposited on pavements all over the country.  If car manufacturers should be made to contribute to the recycling of their end-of-life products, then chewing gum manufacturers should be made to contribute to the cleanup of their end-of-life product, which costs the UK council tax payer hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pounds every year.  Chewing gum is an absolutely pointless product, and it's waste product should be treated as an environmental hazard.",
