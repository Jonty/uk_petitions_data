This should be extended to all British Serving and Reservist Forces to allow them a defence against Terrorist actions by being given automatic \"good reason or lawful authority\"  and permitted to carry an Extendable Baton, Automatic Knife, Sword Stick, Pepper/CS Spray and/or Electroshock Weapon.\r\n\r\nAs members of HM Armed Forces are entrusted as a matter of course to carry Firearms in the course of their duty, they should also be permitted defensive weaponry for their own protection.\r\n\r\n",
