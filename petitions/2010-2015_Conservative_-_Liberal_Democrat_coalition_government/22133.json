        "additional_details": "I propose that we should tax lorries for every day they spend driving on our roads. At the moment foreign lorries contribute nothing to the economy, except causing congestion and sadly, many accidents.\r\n\r\nThe money used should go towards a new freight rail network, lorries can be loaded on trains at Dover or even in France and travel to Holyhead and Scotland by train.  In time this would be compulsary for all long haul lorries.\r\n\r\nThe result will be quieter, safer roads needing less maintenance, combined with a significant reduction in CO2 and soot emissions from the often very polluting lorries.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition and change to make our roads clearer and safer.",
