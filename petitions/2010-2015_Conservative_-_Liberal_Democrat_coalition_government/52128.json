        "additional_details": "George Osborne is to review the Winter Fuel Allowance for ex-pats living in warmer countries without, I believe, knowing all the facts.\r\nYes, countries like Spain has warmer weather in summer but the winters can be very cold.  The houses in Spain are not built to UK specifications regarding insulation etc - in fact there is no insulation at all.  Therefore, in the Spanish winters it is warmer outside the property during the day than inside so be assured, heating is vital in the Spanish winters here too.  We also have increased energy bills here in the winter Mr Osborne!\r\nOutside temperature has no bearing on the interior temperature as the houses are designed to repel heat from the sun outside.\r\nWe want the Government to be extremely careful when deciding the so called 'temperature test' - what exactly will be the criteria for this?
