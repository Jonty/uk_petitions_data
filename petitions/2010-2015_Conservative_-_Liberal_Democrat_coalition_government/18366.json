        "additional_details": "I believe that the Government should agree to provide the same level of benefits to any EU citizen that a UK citizen would be entitled to claim in the country from which they came from.  An example would be a Belgian in the UK claiming benefits of the same amount  that a Briton would receive in Belgium.  The criteria for being eligible to receive those benefits should also be the same.\r\n\r\nFor those individuals who may be considered to see the UK as an easy option to live off the UK economy, this would mean that they would only receive the same as they would have received in their own country.  They would have to prove from where they came and this would need to be verified prior to them receiving any benefits.  The up side of this arrangement would be that other EU nations would be encouraged to raise their benefit systems to mirror that of the UK and their own citizens would stand to benefit.",
