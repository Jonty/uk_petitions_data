        "additional_details": "\"We, the citizens of the United Kingdom, request that Parliament draft and enact legislation mirroring that of the Animal Crush Act of 2010, passed in the United States of America. Animal crush video is an obscene, prurient, detestable interest, which need to be outlawed in the same way that child pornography is. It has no place in a civilized society and promotes heinous illegal acts. Please criminalize the production, sale, distribution, purchase, possession and ownership of these despicable depictions. This also needs to apply to internet media. Protect our society, our children and innocent animals from this travesty.\"",
