        "additional_details": "The development at White House Farm offered very little in terms of affordable housing for local people and in particular our younger generation. Local planning have asked for 44% (the government policy is 50%) and this is wholly supported by the Stokesley Parish Council. The appeal is being held on 10th & 11th April in the Town Hall and we wish to demonstrate our support for this much needed affordable housing provision.",
