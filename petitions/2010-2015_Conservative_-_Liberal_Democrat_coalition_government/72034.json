        "additional_details": "As a former member of the Armed Forces myself, I see no reason why there should be any call for this advert to be complained about, let alone, banned. It shows a re-enactment of a factual event. Yes, it may well have been twisted slightly from the original event to fit into a short TV commercial but for once it's nice to see the TRUE HEROES of this Great Nation acknowledged for once and it's also nice to see that profits from the chocolate bar sales will be helping a very deserving charity. A charity that supports the very people portrayed in the commercial. So don't let the PC brigade ruin another nice thing this year, support the ad, support the Royal Britiah Legion and support our troops.",
