        "additional_details": "This petition is in regards to latest A-level results (18th august 2011) and the subsequent  crashing of the UCAS track website which has left thousands of students not knowing what they will be doing or even what city they will be living in in September. This service is simply not good enough and is causing much unnecessary stress and anxiety. Therefore I propose that an inquiry is launched into the failings of the UCAS system as a whole with particular emphasis on the track system and how A-level results are dealt with",
