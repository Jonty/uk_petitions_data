Does Germany suddenly want to stop selling cars to the UK.  Of course not trade will still continue just as it has always done. Does EDF a French government owned company want to lose Billions of Euros of nuclear contacts in the UK . EUROPEAN companies get billions of pounds of trade a year from the UK any loss of trade would be to Europes detriment. A free trade agreement would be easy to get from the EU. It is a scare story put around by pro europe politicians and newspapers.\r\nClegg says we would get listenened to more in the EU\r\nbut the EU will not even listen to the UK's views on taxation, immigration etc. ",
