        "additional_details": "Telecoms, ISP's & energy companies employ sneaky clauses to squeeze extra charges out of their 'valued' customers. We want to see:\r\n\r\n1. A standard 1-week minimum notice period for mobile, internet & energy contracts.\r\n2. Make automatic renewals an optional clause on all contracts.\r\n3. Cancellation fees limited to 1-month's rate only.\r\n4. Providers take a proactive approach, for example, notifying customers that their contract is about to end so that they can shop around & renew only if they choose to.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this would promote competition, improve customer service & give consumers the same flexibility & choice we are afforded when buying other goods & services. The companies in question are large & profitable enough to cope with these measures. The tactics they use are designed to extort & restrict us, taking the ball out of the customer's court & reducing the need for good customer service & fair pricing. Enough is enough.\r\n\r\nCustomers before shareholders! Always.",
