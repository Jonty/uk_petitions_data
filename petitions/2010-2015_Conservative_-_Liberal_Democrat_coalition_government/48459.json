        "additional_details": "This will reduce the passenger pressure on Gatwick and Heathrow and thereby help to reduce the demand for the building of extra runways at those airports with the inevitable pollution damage which this will cause.  It will enable greater use of the existing runway capacity at Newcastle International Airport which has easy rail and metro access for a significant portion of the British population.  Again, the avoidance of extra flights from the north east to south-eastern hubs would reduce time and pollution costs.\r\n\r\nMany people I have talked to think that the airlines should spread their load throughout the regional airports, it would save hugely on carbon footprints, think of all the people that travel elsewhere to go to America, millions of people on business or families wouldn't have to waste fuel in travelling somewhere else before actually going to the States.\r\n",
