It's being used for stupid things and isn't fit for purpose.\r\n\r\nWe want a change to the system where different levels of human rights are recognised. Innate human rights and derived human rights.\r\n\r\nInnate human rights are the ones everyone in society should have.\r\n\r\nDerived human rights are the ones we get for being decent members of society.\r\n\r\ni.e Prisoners only have innate rights, no derived ones because they are currently being punished for not being decent members of society.\r\n\r\nThings like the right to vote etc should not be innate.",
