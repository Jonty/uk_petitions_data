        "additional_details": "\r\nRecently, the Government chose to reduce teaching budgets by 40% and increase fees to around \u00a39000. This is a large burden on students - many of which will leave university with student loans amounting to tens of thousands of pounds upon completion of their course. We call on the Government to immediately debate the possibility of revoking the rise in fees, and the cuts to education budgets. Fees should not be used to plug the shortfall when funding is cut.",
