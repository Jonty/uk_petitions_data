The viewing figures at are at all time high and continuing to grow. The Hungarian grand prix at it's peak attracted 6 million viewers almost 10% of the UK's population. By allowing the deal for Sky to go through yet another popular sport is being taken away from the masses.\r\n\r\nThis significant interest generates record attendances at Silverstone. The circuit has undergone significant improvements, other worldclass venues have been government funded and whilst the potential cancellation of the British Grand Prix was a real threat no actions was taken.\r\n\r\nThere is a further issue in that Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire are the centre of the Motorsport Industry injecting money into the economy and creating significant amounts of employment. At a time of recession and a tight job-market the government should be doing more to protect and enhance it's successful industries.",
