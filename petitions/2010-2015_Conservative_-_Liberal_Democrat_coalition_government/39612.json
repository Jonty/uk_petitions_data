        "additional_details": "We are a group of Year 10 students who are campaigning to make knife crime a part of the national curriculum in all schools. We believe this issue is something which affects everyone across the UK and if young people are not educated how can they avoid being a victim or personally involved. Also racist attacks seem ti be rearing its ugly head again and we use the Stephen Lawrence case as an example of this. We believe the murder of Stephen Lawrence should be taught as it was a case which changed our legal system.",
