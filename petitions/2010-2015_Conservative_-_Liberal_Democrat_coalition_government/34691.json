        "additional_details": "I would like to propose that supermarkets which adjoin or are in a residential area should have restricted opening hours. Those of us who have to live in close proximity to them are bombarded with lights, noise and pollution. Restricting opening hours would prevent stress and noise and light pollution as well as air pollution. Those supermarkets which are out of town could keep their extended opening times",
