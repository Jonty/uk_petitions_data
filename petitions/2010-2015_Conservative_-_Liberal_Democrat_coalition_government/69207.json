        "additional_details": "Those of us signed know that the British system requires change, however we also note that our system promote the right balance between school and home life.\r\nThe longer hours may cater for parents working longer hours, however using schooling as childcare is unacceptable and does not guarantee eastablishing a good level of learning.\r\nTeachers are not childminders and if this is the schools gimmick it shouldn't be allowed to open. The welfare of both children and teachers is dependent on a structured day to day plan and balance of home and school life. It has been in British culture for decades and we do NOT want to lose the 9am-3pm tradional school day.\r\nI hope you will consider all the points raised. I am not petitioning because I'm against the idea of changing the British schooling system, however I am against losing the balance between work and home life. I want children to be able to be just that, children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
