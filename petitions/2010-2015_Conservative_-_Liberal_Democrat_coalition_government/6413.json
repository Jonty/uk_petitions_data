Restore both through a rotation of fishing and preservation zones across these seas.\r\n\r\nEvidence and scientific findings show that sections of the sea protected from industrial fishing do recover and recover well.\r\n\r\nCreate such protected zones and rotate between protected and fishing permissible zones so that fish numbers recover and fishermen have fish to catch.\r\n",
