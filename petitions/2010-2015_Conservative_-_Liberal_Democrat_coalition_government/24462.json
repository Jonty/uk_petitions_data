But if you really know where and how they came from would you still buy them?\r\n\r\nI think that this is cruel to work people like this and not pay them a good wage compared they might die.\r\n\r\n         Child labor is becoming a big issue in the diamond mines now too.  Since children are smaller they can crawl through tight spaces and be lowered in to pits to collect the diamonds. Many children are dropping out of schools to go work in the mines. Now this brings up another problem. We need to keep kids in school becuase they will most likely not survive in these mines and Africa is losing there young population and losing there education and the chance to get higer paid jobs.\r\n",
