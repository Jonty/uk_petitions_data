The rate would be governed by the requirement of the country and although it would be a higher percentage, there would be no income or local taxes and all income would be disposable.   Products that damage us (and therefore create a cost to the treasury) should carry a high rate of tax, and essential foods should carry a zero rate.   VAT could carry multi-rates to influence wealth.    The notion of VAT replacing all other taxes should be discussed globally.",
