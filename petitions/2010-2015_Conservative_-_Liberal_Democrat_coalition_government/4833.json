The government should not intervene to save banks with tax payers money as they have shown that they will not lend to businesses but use the cash to shore up their own companies. Checks are already in place to reimburse savers up to \u00a350000 for deposits in any one bank. This is considerably cheaper than trying to save a failing financial entity which only has self interest at heart.",
