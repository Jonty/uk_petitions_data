        "additional_details": "The prohibition of recreational drugs is ineffective and so is decriminalisation and they cause more problems then they solve including causing peripheral criminal activity such as murder and assault, increases the costs of policing and criminalises and stigmatises people who are only halming themsleves.\r\nI believe that it would be better to have certain drugs inclueding canabis and MDMA available over the counter to those over the age of 18 with there contents regulated and that they should be taxed to help provide for any problems they cause and that better and more honest education should be provided on the potential harm they could cause.\r\nRegulation does not have to include all drugs for instance I personally don't belive that allowing over the counter sales of heroine or chrystal meth but I belive that there should be a sensible debate which needs to look at drugs and there individual traits and not look at all drugs as a sinlge issue.",
