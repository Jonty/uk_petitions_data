        "additional_details": "Implementing a fixed time scale for people claiming benefits for being out of work. People able to work should only be able to 'sign-on' and claim benefits for a certain time and then made to take employment, even if not in their sector, chosen career or field, regardless of the salary. There are too many Brits not willing to take menial task relating jobs due to the salary simply because it's easier for them to claim benefits. Once the time-scale runs out they are entitled to nothing! At the moment the benefits just change from Job Seekers to Income Support! If we have no income from the government then we will have to work - regardless!\r\nI'd like to make this clear that it does not apply to persons on incapacity benefit who are unable to work.",
