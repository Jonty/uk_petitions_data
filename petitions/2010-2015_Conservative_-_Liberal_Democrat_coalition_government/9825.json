        "additional_details": "In the light of the lawlessness/social breakdown we're experiencing (during the riots, but also more generally) & as a way for young people to gain the necessary skills/experience they need, we should introduce compulsory Community/Military Service for all young people during key ages (TBD based on consultation). The cost of this would be high, but much less than the cost of the overall societal breakdown we've been experiencing for decades and the national malaise that we're in. It would instil a sense of discipline & respect, help provide necessary skills, reduce harm/criminality/drug dealing/addiction and generally bring back hope. It should be mandatory for all (i.e. with no opt-outs for the middle class kids - part of the current problem is that - class-wise - 'never the twain shall meet' and everyone can learn something from different types of people  coming together). Through this the next generation can help build a society that is no longer broken. Let's make it happen!",
