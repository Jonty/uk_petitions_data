It is wrong that our politicians continue to use our income taxes to fund their politically motivated criminal activity by using our money to pay the fines and compensation orders arising out of their criminality.  People have been executed for less in our recent history, all we do nowadays is agree and let them take more from us in taxes.  This gross criminalisation of the population by association, MUST STOP.",
