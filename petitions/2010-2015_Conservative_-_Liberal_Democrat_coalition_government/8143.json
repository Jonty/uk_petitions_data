Not only do we - the taxpayer - provide them with everything else, we are constantly paying-out to defend those who assault us, rob us, steal from us, damage our property & burgle us etc. I have personal experience of this and, on a weekly basis, see the same solicitors representing the same people (many of whom who have  50 + convictions), over and over. The solicitors usually string the case out to ensure a maximum lay from the legal-aid golden goose. STOP THIS TRAVESTY NOW AND LIMIT THEIR ACCESS TO A MAXIMUM OF 1 FREE CASE. Why should we - the victims - continually pay to protect the criminals?",
