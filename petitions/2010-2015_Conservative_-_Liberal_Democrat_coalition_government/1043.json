        "additional_details": "That specific limits be set for all vehicles on the UK roads. We already have emmissions legislation, however, in the interests of safety, and the environment etc. all vehicles should be designed with a maximum speed capability not more than the UK law permits. Acceleration should be restricted, again to a set limit, ie 0-60mph in not less than...seconds.\r\n These criteria would greatly reduce the number of speed related accidents.\r\n One other design criteria long overdue is the limit on engine size. If a 1.4 l engine can move four people at 70mph, then why do vehicles with larger engines need to exist. There are lorries with smaller engines than many cars. An optimum maximum design limit need sto be set in the interests of the environment, and again safety. Over performance of a vehicle is a waste, and dangerous. ",
