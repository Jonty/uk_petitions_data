        "additional_details": "The current system of road fund tax is encouraging more people to purchase a small car due to the low level of road tax, this is adding to the congestion in our cities which could be reduced by encouraging people to travel by motorcycle. the RFT for an average size bike 600cc+ is more expensive than a 1400cc small car. As a bike will cause less damage to the roads than any car this is an unfair taxation and should be reduced to a level at least equal to that of a modern small car.  ",
