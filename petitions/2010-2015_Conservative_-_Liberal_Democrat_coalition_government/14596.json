        "additional_details": "Many traditional public houses in England are struggling to keep going in this economic climate. Many of those that are not able to diversify by opening restaurants and the like, are turning to Live Music to revitalise their trade. This is excellent for musicians that have had a hard time too, but now the publicans have a new battle. The Performing Rights Society. Not only are they having to pay for the musicians to work, they are having to pay a huge amount of their income to the PRS. Whilst we agree that musicians should be treated fairly, we think publicans are getting a raw deal. If there is a television in the bar, they even have to pay for music in the advertisments! Do we want to keep our English tradition or lose it? If you agree that the PRS need to review their charges to help our music pubs and our musicians survive, please sign this petition. ",
