Not only do they get poor pay for putting their lives on the line but the government has decided to insult them further by changing their pensions so that they are even worse off.  Civilians can stand up for their rights by striking etc but servicemen and women can't.  Please support our servicemen and women-join me in asking the government to leave forces pensions alone by signing this petition.",
