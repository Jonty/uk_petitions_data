        "action": "Increase Britain's military expenditure, improve navy and withdraw foreign aid.",
        "additional_details": "We would like to increase Britain's 2% GDP military expenditure to 4% (~\u00a356b), We currently give away ~\u00a310bn in foreign aid a year, we would like this to be spent on securing Britain's military future. Increasing our budget, we would like to see a drastic increase in our Navy's potential. Those improvements being: Replace tridents, 3 more carriers, 50 more F-35's and stop all military manpower cuts and an increase in fully employed soldiers. 95% of our trade relies on the seas, we need a large navy to protect this. A larger military will secure our future with our US allies and increase influence among the world and NATO, it will protect the millions who's jobs rely on the military existence as well as the soldiers careers, will provide education opportunities for those less fortunate and will decrease unemployment as well as deter any possible future threats from extremists or foreign nations. A large military allows you to avoid war and keep peace, but protect if it comes to it.",
