        "additional_details": "The Dept of Transport and Govt should be urged to rethink their strategy on speed-bumps.\r\nThey add response time to vital emergency services, contribute to the causes of many road traffic accidents and cause much damage to road users resulting in more repair costs on top of the already spiralling costs to be on the roads legally.\r\nThe placement of these speed-ramps/bumps should be limited to strategic areas in direct relation to public parks and schools along with defined areas with a high risk of accidents, such as accident black-spots.\r\nThe high number of speed-bumps needs to be dramatically reduced in areas that they have zero effect.\r\nRoad users are tired of paying for excessive and recurring damage to their road vehicles.",
