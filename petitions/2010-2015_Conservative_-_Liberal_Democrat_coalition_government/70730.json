        "additional_details": "Fireworks become more of an issue year on year. They are getting used well before 5th Nov, cause many ASB issues, they are attractive to some people who just like to set them off in the street as and when it suits, cause a lot of distress for animals, young children and elderly people.\r\n\r\nWhy not ban the sale of fireworks which make a bang? This does not restrict the sale to the general public, but would make them less attractive for misuse, would reduce animals stress as so many people have pets and create a more enjoyable time of year for a lot more people without prohibiting ones that cannot go to organised displays etc",
