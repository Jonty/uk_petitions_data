        "additional_details": "Petition to ban the wearing of all face veils (masks, hoodie, burqa or the niqab) in public. Many European countries have legally banned the wearing of full face covers in public places for security reasons and for its social, psychological and cultural impact on both the wearer and their society. There is a growing feeling in the UK that wearing the Islamic face veil hinders cohesion, proper assimilation and integration into the society and the British way of life, also wearing any face masks and hoodie sends a negative and threating feeling, because face covers act as a barriers isolating their wearers from their community and vice versa. With that plus the security implications of recent events, there are now growing concerns that face veils can be used by criminals to commit illegal and terrorist activities. For those reasons this petition calls on parliament to ban wearing any face cover that conceals the identity of its wearer in public places.",
