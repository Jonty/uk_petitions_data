Reasons:\r\n-The UK is a small Island.\r\n-We have an overly large human population of 62million which is growing.\r\n- Scientific surveys are showing that species, such as:Bumble bees, Corncrakes, Bats, Crickets, Stag Beetles, Wildcats, Dormice, Starlings, Sparrow\u2019s, Woodpeckers, Warblers, Hedgehogs, are threatened by, and going extinct due to habitat loss through human construction.\r\n-As people arrive, more houses, roads, schools, shops, airports, golf courses will be built. This will destroy remaining wildlife habitat, like grass lands, ponds, bogs and woods.\r\n-Since 1930, 98% of wildflower  meadows, that are bumble bee habitat have been lost to farming, and development.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to reduce the influx of people into the UK as wildlife is entitled to a stress free and peaceful life here.\r\n\r\n",
