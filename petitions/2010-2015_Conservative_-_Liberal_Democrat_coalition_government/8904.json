When the Royal Yacht Britannia was decommissioned, Her Majesty was deeply hurt and it has since been revealed that the decision was taken because a refit was considered unwise politically, not financially. Therefore, we call on the government to refit the Royal Yacht for Her Majesty, to be recommissioned and given to the Queen as a gift from the people of the United Kingdom. ",
