        "additional_details": "Formula One is a sport in which Britain has punched above its weight almost since its inception in 1950. In the history of the sport 10 British drivers have won 14 World Drivers' Championships between them, while another 10 British teams have won 33 World Constructors' Championships.\r\nNowadays, 9 of the 12 teams in Formula One are permanently based in the UK and employ almost entirely British staff. This is because many young Britons are inspired to pursue engineering careers after watching British sporting triumphs.\r\nBy allowing Formula One to be taken off free to view television, many young people will most likely not be inspired to take engineering paths as they do not have the means to watch a sport they are useful for.\r\nWe therefore ask the Government to ensure that at least all Formula One races are kept on free to view television.",
