        "additional_details": "Countless animals are put to death every year in the UK and worldwide due to abandonment and irresponsible pet owners.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by the PFMA that the pet population has reached 71 million in the UK. Approximately one adoptable, healthy dog or puppy every hour, (24 hours a day, 7 days a week) is put to death in the UK due to abandonment and not finding a new home. In 2012 the RSPCA alone rescued and collected 194,695 animals, but were only able to re-home 55,459 of them.\r\n\r\nYet the breeding continues and owners fail to neuter their pets, resulting in unwanted puppies and kittens. Shelters are full of healthy cats, dogs, puppies, kittens, rabbits, rats, etc which are put down daily.\r\n\r\nI am petitioning for the government to enforce neutering of all overpopulated cats and dogs.\r\n\r\n(Statistics from PFMA, RSPCA and Animal Rights Action) ",
