If it's registered as lost or stolen the vets have a legal responsibility to contact the person registered on the microchip and confirm if indeed the cat is lost or stolen.\r\n\r\nIf the cat is flagged up as stolen and the legit owner has confirmed that then vets are to take full details of the person who has taken the cat into the vet and log with the non emergency police number and request a crime reference number.\r\n\r\nPrince has been missing since the 1st June 2014 and believed to be stolen. He's a pedigree Siamese.\r\n\r\nThink of your cat being taken in or stolen and if you'd want to be reunited then sign this petition and make Princes law, law!",
