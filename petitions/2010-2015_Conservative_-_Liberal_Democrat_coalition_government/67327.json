        "additional_details": "I would like the government to pay compensation to people who were abandoned by their birth parents. It is scientifically proven that abandoned babies suffer severe psychological trauma from being abandoned, trauma so severe that it afflicts them for the rest of their lives. It seems that the human rights of the Mother to give up the baby are enshrined in law as are the rights of childless couples to become adopters. Where are the rights of the abandoned children? They seem to be forgotten, a sort of supply chain for the childless. I believe compensation should be paid for the inevitable psychological treatments that the child will require in the course of its life. ",
