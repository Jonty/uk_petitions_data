        "additional_details": "Council Tax should be abolished but councils will receive higher funding from the treasury. This additional funding will be paid for by higher investment bank taxes. Because banks threaten to take their business elsewhere if taxes are raised is not a plausible reason for ignoring it. The UK will always have a market for financial services and if the banks that currently provide those services feel that it's not financially viable to pay a tiny percentage of their billions of pounds in profits back into the communities that allowed them to grow so big in the first place, other banks will be more than willing to take their place. Banking is nothing more than financial alchemy at it's core anyway, so creating money out of nothing will never be a problem for them.",
