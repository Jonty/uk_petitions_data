        "additional_details": "Treat PPROM in pregnancy as an emergency & treat according to ROCG Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists official guidelines,including antibiotic treatment & a management plan to deal with this condition.Regardless of gestation ensure counselling is in place irrespective of outcome.Prompt & detailed diagnosis are required rather than sending mums home.Inform patients of all options,as currently treatment is being withheld if under 24 wks,when babies can survive with treatment. Treatment can ALSO avoid danger of sepsis for both mum & baby. Termination is NOT the only option with regards to this condition,as babies ARE surviving.PPROM is associated with 40% of preterm deliveries or where waters break before 37 weeks gestation.Patients are often left to deal with PTSD which is often missed after poor treatment. Patients frequently are not informed of all options. We want every UK hospital to treat PPROM 1Prompt 2Professionally 3 Reassurance 4Open minded 5Mental well being\r\n ",
