        "action": "A Petition For Greater Equality For Females In Sport",
        "additional_details": "This petition aims to raise awareness about the inequality women face in respect of funding and earnings throughout amateur and professional sport.  My personal objective is to highlight issues many females face in the community.  By bringing to peoples attention the disparities women face in particularly I hope the public\u2019s expectation towards women can be a vehicle for change.  Compared to their male counterparts females are often fortunate if they can support themselves in a professional manner and often have to give their chosen interest up like football for example because funding can sometimes be quite scarce for running such team sports.\r\n",
