        "additional_details": "Why?\r\n\r\n1. Because tax allowances and child benefit are the same type of thing: Tax allowances let you off tax so are basically giving you 'free' money, like child benefit.\r\n\r\n2. However, child benefit is MUCH better value for money:\r\n\r\na. More money goes to where children are, when the UK's quality of life for children in world league tables has been so bad;\r\n\r\nb. More money goes to women rather than men, making things more equal;\r\n\r\nc. Less money needed for means tested benefits as families will have more money to start with;\r\n\r\nd. It pays to get a job as you keep the child benefit, so there is less of a poverty trap;\r\n\r\n3. It's also better for all of us who have children at some stage because we pay in more at times when we don't have children to care for but get more in the tighter times when we are raising the next generation.\r\n\r\nWe call upon Parliament to put more money into child benefit, paid for by smaller or no basic tax allowance.\r\n\r\n",
