        "additional_details": "Prisons here in the UK aren't tough enough. We are running hotels for criminals, making them commit more crimes. Criminals quiet possibly have better lives than most of us citizens live. Television, Xbox, choices of meals, gyms. For FREE. What could possibly be next?\r\nOur soldiers have less rights than these criminals do. Our soldiers are heroes and yet they only get one choice of meal ,at times, no contact to family and risk their lives for us. Criminals get multiple choices of food, can contact their family whenever they would like and have broken the laws that have been created to protect us. These criminals are being treated like they are the heroes in our country. Soldiers are being treated like they are the criminals. The roles need to switch RIGHT NOW.\r\nIf you commit a crime you lose your rights. It should be as simple as that. NO luxuries, NO choices and NO rights. Make these criminals want to NOT commit a crime again. ",
