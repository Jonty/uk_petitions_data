        "additional_details": "We, request the following organisations - UHNS, Government agencies, health care commissioners, and the CF Trust - undertake a joint whole systems review of CF care provision. We strongly recommend that opening and funding a dedicated CF Unit be supported, staffed by a multi-professional and specialist team who have knowledge of the condition, competencies to deliver effective care and treatment, complementary to but improving the existing services provided.  Rooms are allocated on a \"1st come, 1st served\" basis, at times they can be waiting at home in an unsuitable therapeutic environment, unwell and awaiting intense and specialist treatment. At the moment, teenage/ young adult patients can spend up to 3 weeks on a general respiratory ward, often amongst elderly patients, and are at greater risk of cross infection and contraction of other infections, which could be mitigated more effectively if a CF Unit was established with its own dedicated and specialist inpatient facilities.
