        "additional_details": "Dear Reader,\u00a0\r\nI was left feeling angry and patronised by the comments made by David Cameron in his speech on religion on 16/12/2011.\r\nI was incredibly frustrated to hear Mr Cameron speak so proudly of his bias towards the Christian faith above all others. \u00a0I was particularly insulted by the suggestion that those outside of Christianity are somehow morally deficient!\r\nI am not a Christian, but I do not consider myself morally bankrupt and I do not appreciate having such generalised statements made about people such as myself. Exactly what my religious choice (or possible lack thereof) is irrelevant.\r\nIt is (quite honestly) patronising to all of us.\u00a0\r\nPlease sign up to my petition if you respect the multi cultural, multi faith society we live. And especially if you don't appreciate the use of religion in government to patronise anyone outside of a particular fath group.\u00a0\r\nGovernment should be kept secular, so that all may speak freely and all voices have equal weight.",
