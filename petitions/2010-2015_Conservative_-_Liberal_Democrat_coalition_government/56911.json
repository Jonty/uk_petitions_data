        "additional_details": "People can get addicted to gambling. Gambling problems can cause problems in relationships, in families, at work. It is very easy to get carried away in the spur of the moment whilst in a betting shop on the high street. It is even easier to clean out your bank account if you don't even have to leave the shop to get hold of more money. If a person with a problem is going to have a 'maybe thats enough' thought, they are more likely to have it if they have had to get out of the situation and out of the shop to withdraw more money. Having cash machines inside betting shops is irresponsible and encourages people with problems to carry on playing. Nothing seems real when you're gambling.",
