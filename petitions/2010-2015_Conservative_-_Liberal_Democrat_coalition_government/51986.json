        "additional_details": "A family member found himself on the ESA roller coaster of which he has had at least 3 'assessments' all of which scored him 0 points whatsoever.  However, discussing with his GP and hospital consultants, he is not considered safe or fit for work at this time. The ATOS assessments waste public funds & do not look into the medical history of an individual.  A sick note is disregarded, and if you fail your assessment you have to sign on JSA to guarantee money, but in doing so, you are breaking the law because you are signing as fit for work. Terminally ill people are being told they are FIT for work because they have not met the 15 points scoring necessary to qualify for ESA. We need to change back to letting our GPs and Consultants who know us best to decide whether we are fit or unfit! Our current system causes un-necessary stress, hassle and even suicide in some cases!",
