We could save money in these austere times by helping these men and women who deserve our help. Many have become institutionalised for many years and find the the civilian world too much to cope with. Many government jobs could prioritised for those leaving the forces. Councils should be instructed to ensure that ex servicemen are at the top of housing lists.\r\n ",
