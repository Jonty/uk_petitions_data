The notion of selling naming rights to this historical ground is an outright travesty. The fans of Newcastle United Football Club stand together with fans from around the world in rejecting the rapidly-growing and broadening commercial influence that is tainting the beautiful game in ways we could never imagine.\r\nWe may not have a choice in who owns our team, but we will NOT stand idly by and allow them to arbitrarily change such an important part of our team's identity.\r\nKeep the name \"St. James' Park.\"",
