        "additional_details": "Chemical attacks are completely unacceptable, but it is not clear what military intervention will achieve. We call on the UK government to send aid to Syrian refugees instead of bombs to Syria. If the sum of money that the government would have to invest in military intervention were spent on a highly coordinated aid effort instead, this would not only improve the humanitarian situation, it would also project a more positive image of the UK to the world.",
