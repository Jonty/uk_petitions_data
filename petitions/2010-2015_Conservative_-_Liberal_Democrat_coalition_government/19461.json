        "additional_details": "I propose a limit of 45 - 55 hours per week worked by investment bankers and stock market traders, similar to that proposed by the EU for doctors.\r\n\r\nCurrently investment banking is dominated by a culture of a few young people working extreme hours under huge pressure, motivated by short-term investment gains believing that these will allow them to retire young.\r\n\r\nLimiting hours will open the industry to more entrants as well as improving accuracy.  Companies will need to hire more traders for less money per person, helping ensure that less money goes to enrich a few overworked individuals and more goes to meet the basic needs of a wider workforce, potentially helping revenues spread more easily to the wider economy, as well as making the industry more of a responsible career than a cash-cow for a few financially motivated individuals.",
