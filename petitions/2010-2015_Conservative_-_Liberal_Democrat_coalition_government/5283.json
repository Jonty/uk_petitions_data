        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to commit itself to publishing a Green Paper on the feasibility of abolishing money in favour of a universal system of free access in which people could freely avail themselves of all goods and services without having to pay for them in any way. The benefits of such a system would be enormous, and would hopefully be rapidly adopted by other countries around the world (See http://andycox1953.webs.com/ for more on this). In due  course, it is to be hoped that the Establishment of Socialism/Communism Act will be passed by Parliament.",
