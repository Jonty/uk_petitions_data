        "additional_details": "I would like to propose changes to legislation regarding dog on dog attacks and responsible dog ownership. I propose that all dogs should be registered on a goverment database and should pay a nominal fee for a dog license. Money from the licenses could be used to fund kenneling and re-homing costs for dogs that are removed from irresponsible owners.\r\n\r\nAll dogs should have public liability insurance. If you own a dog and it damages any person, property or any other pet, the owners should be liable. Currently if a dog attacks another dog there are no laws to prosecute the owners, it is only a criminal offence if it bites a person.\r\n\r\nLegislation needs to change in order to protect our pets. The owners need to be liable for any cost incurred and either restrictions put on their dog or the dog to be destroyed depending on the individual case. Any owner deemed to be unresponsible should be banned from owning dogs and their dog taken off them. ",
