I am requesting that after the bodies charged with fining and collecting these sums of money have received their fees from the above figure, that you notify us what the remaining balance is and how much was used to help the needy and destitute of our country. Whilst we can find \u00a350m for overseas projects we are told that there is no money for uk.\r\nYes overseas disasters do need help, but we require you to let us know where all this money has gone.
