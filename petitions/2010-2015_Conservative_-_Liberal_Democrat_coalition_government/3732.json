But at what cost to road users and Society?\r\nDrivers' working time lost and the sheer frustration suffered and nervous energy expended by them appear never to be considerations which the Contractor takes into account in his traffic control planning.\r\nI ask the Government to bring forward legislation to ensure that:\r\n(1) Contractors are required to lodge Traffic Control Plans with the Local Authority for all planned roadworks and the Local Authority is to be responsible for agreeing such plans and\r\n(2) Local Authorities are made responsible for co-ordinating and restricting, if necessary, the number and scope of planned roadworks;\r\nin order to protect the rights and interests of road users.
