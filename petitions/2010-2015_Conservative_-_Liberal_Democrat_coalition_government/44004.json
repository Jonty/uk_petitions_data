I am in constant chronic pain and pass out regularly. Some days my entire body goes numb. When going to a&e I was rejected as the doctor shrugged it off as period pain . We need more help.  I want to ask that more help and respect to be given a.d that it be classed as a disability. And the severe cases to be able to claim DLA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have never had endometriosis you don't no what we deal with everyday. Each day is a fight. We need more help . Thank you ",
