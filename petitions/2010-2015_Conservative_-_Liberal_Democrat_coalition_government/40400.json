        "additional_details": "David and Julie Farrow have been breeding German Shepherds that havent been hip scored or health tested, this has resulted in one lady who bought a puppy from them, to pay out approx \u00a39,000 to put it right. Xray of the hips showed how bad the hips are. This is already a problem with some German shepherd breeders, and alot get away with it. But if one is found out then they deserve to be shut down.\r\nPlease help by signing this petition and also helping future german shepherds.\r\nHip dysplasia is very painful, and some dogs can have it as early as a year old. What life is that?",
