This needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nIf children are educated in these areas then they will be able to firstly give a more educated vote. Many young first time voters are confused, as they do not understand what the different parties are representing.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the teaching of these subjects may inspire young people to further their knowledge, and result in a larger variety of politicians.
