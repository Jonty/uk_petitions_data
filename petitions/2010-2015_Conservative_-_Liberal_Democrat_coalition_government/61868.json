        "additional_details": "In May, the UK will, once again, become the laughing stock of Europe when Molly Smitten-Downes receives nil points from the vast majority of Eurovision competitor countries for yet another woefully bland entry. The UK is internationally recognised as one of the most musically talented regions of the world but we repeatedly fail to demonstrate this at Eurovision. Responsibility for this rests entirely with the BBC, which has demonstrated extraordinary ineptness in recent years, apparently allowing unnamed bureaucrats to choose entrants in a process which has no transparency whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe government should remove responsibility for choosing the UK's entry away from the BBC and give it to independent television. Alternatively, the BBC should be required to hold a proper competition with a variety of contestants open to public vote. ",
