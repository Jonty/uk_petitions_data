        "additional_details": "For too long, Boxing has been cast to the dark ages by both the BBC and the TV networks in the UK. We HAVE to pay \u00a3150 per year, yet we see hardly any sports on BBC 1 or 2, in particular Boxing, which I can prove is the second most popular sport in the UK behind soccer.
