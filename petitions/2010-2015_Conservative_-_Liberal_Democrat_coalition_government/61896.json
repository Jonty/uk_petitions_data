        "additional_details": "We object to the development of 1700 houses: The development is too big, destroying wildlife habitat & woodland. It increases the population of Horwich by 1/3 and adds 3400 cars, causing pollution &stress to residents. the 2 main access routes for Horwich are both 1 lane. The roads are in very poor condition full of pot holes this will cause more damage to our roads. Schools are currently too small to cope with the number of new residents. The main shopping centre is extremely busy and often gridlocked. Our properties will be de-valued we will seek compensation for this. Other proposed developments of 500 houses to be built in Horwich.\r\n\r\nWe would like the proposed development to be substantially scaled back to have a less detrimental environmental impact.",
