        "additional_details": "Wild Swimming is fastest growing sport in the UK. Boosted by last years Olympic success many are taking to open water yet sadly they are facing problems. Many councils overact and try to ban access to water and attempt to have swimmers arrested. Wild Swimmers understand the risks of open swimming and accept this when entering the water. Wild Swimmers should be left alone. They accept the risks and are spreading a sport a promotes a health lifestyle and is 100% free. Something everyone in this country can support at this time of growing obesity and economical problems. ",
