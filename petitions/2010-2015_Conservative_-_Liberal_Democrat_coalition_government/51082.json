Recently they have even increased the visa fees for Tier 1 General dependents too. Actually , Tier 1 General visa holders are highly skilled people who are working mostly in IT and paying the income-tax and NI properly.\r\nWhy is the discrimination between Tier 1 and other visa holders. If the amount of effort from UKBA officials is going to be same for processing the visa application like other visas, why is there a discrimination for Tier 1 holders.\r\nPlease reduce the visa fees for Tier 1 General (extensions only exists)",
