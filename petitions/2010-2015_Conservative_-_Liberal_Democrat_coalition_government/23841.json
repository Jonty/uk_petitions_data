        "additional_details": "All driving tests should be fully recorded on video by a camera in the car, and possible also on the outside of the car. This is because learners are sometimes failed unfairly or for very petty reasons, causing great expense and stress with no means of appealing the outcome. Full video footage of all tests will ensure high standards of both examining and driving, ensuring people who deserve to pass are always passed and vice versa with those who don't make the grade, and weeding out bad examiners. This will be fairer and safer for all.",
