Ensure that all children have sex education in our schools.\r\nEnsure that any one under 18 can only be charged child prices for tickets etc. Under fives can be charged at one rate but 5 to under 18 are the same rate and  this must be 50% cheaper than the adult price. Why should any child pay adult price to enter an attraction or buy a ticket?\r\nMinimum age for driving increased to 18.\r\nDVLA Theory test taught in school. Every citizen should know the law of the roads when they leave school and have passed the this test. Test should be free.\r\n",
