        "additional_details": "Christmas, the biggest feast of the year in our Christian country, is tarnished by the shameless merchandising of Christmas themed goods by all retailers from as early as September.\r\n\r\nBetween the start of the sell-fest and Christmas itself there are numerous other celebrations, Halloween, Guy Fawkes Night, Remembrance Day, St Andrews Day etc.  Not to forget all the other events of other faiths, Hannukah, Diwali and of course International Talk Like a Pirate Day.\r\n\r\nBy the time Christmas Day actually arrives a good percentage of the population are just too fed up with it to celebrate it properly.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned believe the Government should introduce a blanket ban on the overt marketing of Christmas themed products until the week preceding advent, ensuring all such items are screened (as tobacco is now), no promotions are run, no Christmas music played in store and no Santa Claus, Reindeer, Elf or other Christmas themed characters are present in stores.",
