        "action": "Retain RAF Leuchars",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the location and record of RAF Leuchars as a base defending the airspace of the northern United Kingdom give it a strategic significance which requires its retention, since bases further north or south are less well placed to respond rapidly to threats to strategic assets in the central belt of Scotland and in northern England, whereas RAF Leuchars complements RAF Lossiemouth for the air defence of Northern Britain.  We therefore call upon the Ministry of Defence and Number 10 Downing Street to: (1) reject finding accommodation for soldiers returning from the Army of the Rhine as a valid reason for closing RAF Leuchars; (2) review and assess all arguments adduced to justify the closure of RAF Leuchars against the strategic objectives set out in the recent Strategic Defence Review; (3) either justify publicly the closure of RAF Leuchars to Parliament on genuine strategic grounds, or rescind the decision to close RAF Leuchars.",
