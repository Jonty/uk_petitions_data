        "additional_details": "Nuisance telephone calls such as those for PPI claims or home insulation grants are a growing problem in the UK.\r\n\r\nUnscrupulous cold callers ignore people\u2019s right to privacy and often pester them repeatedly. To most people this is annoying; to some it is intimidating.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to introduce legislation to clamp down on nuisance callers:\r\n\r\n1. Strengthen the Data Protection Act to make it illegal for organisations to sell people\u2019s personal details.\r\n\r\n2. Review the operation of the Telephone Preference Service and The Information Commissioner's Office which currently are not fit for purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Stop Telephone Service Providers from cashing in on nuisance calls and make them provide \u2018caller display\u2019 and \u2018unidentified caller rejection\u2019 to customers free of charge.\r\n\r\n4. Make it a criminal offence for organisations to harass people by repeatedly phoning them and make Telephone Service Providers supply details of persistent offenders to the police.",
