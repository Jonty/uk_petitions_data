        "additional_details": "I propose that the speed limits on britains motorways should be reviewed, if not abolished. However only on the assumption that an advised speed limit is in place and if you have an accident and are caught going over the advised speed then your insurance is void. There are many reasons for this such as economical advantages: businesses can travel faster and carry out more meetings in a day, time is not wasted stuck at 70, most business people take no notice if they are late or just want to get there. Other advantages include decongestion, if vehicles are travelling faster then the chances of a queue is minimised, HOWEVER hgv, trailers and coaches should not be allowed in the inside lane, (slow vehicles cause accidents). Also, high speed training should be given in pass plus, if you don't have pass plus you aren't allowed on motorways (possibly not even duals). To remind you Germany doesn't have speed restricted m'ways and their death toll for m'ways is less than 700. ",
