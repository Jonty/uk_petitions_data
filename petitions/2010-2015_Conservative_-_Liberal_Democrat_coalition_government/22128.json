I understand that the Airport Fire & Rescue Service is part of the private sector, which means, unfortunately, that its employees will not be eligible for the Medal, as the costs are being borne by individual Government Departments.\r\n\r\nEven though many members of the Airport Fire & Rescue Service are proud holders of the Queens Golden Jubilee Medal\r\n\r\n",
