All this is BELOW YOUR HOUSE.The Government will be changing Laws in order to RUSH through Rights for the Fracking Companies to get on with it.The house insurance industry will increase premiums. I propose the government has NO right to change these Laws about the land Under a persons property. Coal mines never went so deep or so horizontal and subsidence is still an issue. It is nothing less than irresponsible to change planning laws in this way.  The government should be held to account and prevented from such Short sighted policies and short cuts when changing the Laws of our Land.\r\n",
