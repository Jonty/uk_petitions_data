        "additional_details": "Smoking shisha indoors should be re-instated as there is no concrete evidence to prove that there is a strong case to show shisha is as bad as cigerettes. There are articles and researchers whom are continously researching the effects of shisha vs cigerettes and ONLY the research from a few UK scientists have found that there is apparently over 5,000 chemicals in shisha compared to cigerettes and one hour of shisha is equivallent to smoking 100-200 cigerettes. But the scientists in other countries across the globe have denied this stating that there are ONLY around 145 chemicals in shisha compared to the amount in cigerettes. And the main reason for deep inhale of cigerettes is to consume the effects and nature of it; compared to shisha you are able to feel the nature and effects just by a light inhale. The main reason for inhalement is only to produce the thick smokes that people like.",
