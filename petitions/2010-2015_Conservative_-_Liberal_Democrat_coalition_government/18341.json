        "additional_details": "Why do the Government not change the way we are taxed. If they did away with taxation on peoples earnings and placed the tax burden on peoples spending then the industry that has grown up around tax avoidance at a personal level would disappear overnight. The rich avoid tax but still love to spend. Reduce PAYE to zero and increase the rate and scope of VAT to address the shortfall.\r\nNo taxation at source would benefit all who wish to save, work hard and invest. They will pay tax on what they spend only. The billions in tax avoidance would be addressed. The very rich who will always spend money would pay at point of purchase, no matter what they bought or invested.\r\nI challenge the Government to make a real difference to its people!\r\n",
