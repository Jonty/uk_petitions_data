        "additional_details": "I want the government to limit the use of fireworks, so a licence is needed to buy and use them. They are dangerous, harming many people each year, and causing an increase in the need for the fire service at bonfire night. They cause distress to animals and their owners, are bad for the environment, are an easy way for terrorists to get hold explosives that would not be sold in any other format due to danger and finally they are used inappropriately by young people and those who don't know the safety procedure. The licences should limit to use to certain days- bonfire night, new year, Diwali, Chinese New Year etc. Money lost in tax or by businesses who sell fireworks is made up for by the many benefits of reducing their use.",
