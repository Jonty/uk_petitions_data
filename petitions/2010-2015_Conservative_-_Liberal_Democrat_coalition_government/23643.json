        "additional_details": "Government policy is increasingly being influenced by religious organisations and individuals who assert a moral authority based on the existence of a supernatural being generally known as god. This is right and proper if god exists and inappropriate and undemocratic if not. If there is no god, then in debates about and implementation of public policy, purely religious arguments should carry no weight. We therefore request that the Government establishes a formally constituted inquiry involving the scientific, religious and other communities as appropriate, to investigate the existence of god. The inquiry should look for empirical evidence of god in line with the widely recognised principles of scientific enquiry and research.\r\n",
