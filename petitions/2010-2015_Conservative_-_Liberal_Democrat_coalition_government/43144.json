I see no reason why the counter can't be programmed to increase by +1 instantly as soon as each new signature is accepted. It also seems highly inappropriate to make the people signing the petition type out their details every time they sign a petition instead of being able to store their details or at least copy & paste to save time. The search facility also has considerable room for improvement.",
