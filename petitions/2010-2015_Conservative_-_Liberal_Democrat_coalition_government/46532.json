Interest represents the preference that holding money has, saving it for the future instead of spending it frivolously today. Setting this rate to a negative number sends a powerful message of despair from an institution that we all expect (or hope) to be confident and steadfast.\r\nSetting this rate to negative does not pass the common-sense test. Who would consider money to be a burden? The mere suggestion of this policy change is dangerous and irresponsible.",
