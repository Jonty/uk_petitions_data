We would like to make people aware that many Armed Forces personnel that have died since World War II are not included on the Armed Forces National Memorial due to the cause and place of death not fitting specific criteria. All personnel are willing to serve their Queen and country under any circumstance, they suffer the same traumas, they display the same courage, We ask for the support of our nation and our government in helping us to gain the same recognition for our loved ones by supporting our campaign for a separate National Memorial at the Arboretum for those who do not have their names inscribed on the Armed Forces National Memorial but have died in service or of a consequence of service since WW2,\r\n",
