        "additional_details": "In the past five years, three former Prime Ministers have cost the taxpayer in total more than \u00a31.7m in public duty allowances. The system was set up by John Major in 1991 to reward former prime ministers for work including answering letters and attending public events. This is a ridiculous waste of public money. Thatcher, Major and Blair are rich enough already. Divert this money into worthwhile things like schools and hospitals.",
