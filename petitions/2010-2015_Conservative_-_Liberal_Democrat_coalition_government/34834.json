The government should actively encourage employment by reducing 'Job Taxes'.\r\nA meaningful reduction in Employer\u2019s National Insurance would result in a virtuous circle.\r\n\r\nIncreased employment = Lower levels of benefit claim = Government savings.\r\nIncreased employment = Increase in PAYE tax receipts.\r\nIncreased employment = Greater consumer confidence = Increase in VAT tax receipts.\r\nGreater consumer confidence = Business confidence.\r\nBusiness confidence = Increased investment.\r\nIncreased business investment = Growth.\r\nGrowth = UK economic recovery.\r\n\r\nA reduction in Employer\u2019s NI would increase tax revenue and stimulate growth.\r\nReducing \u2018job taxes\u2019 was an election pledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
