        "additional_details": "Please help stop the closure of our only OUT OF SCHOOL CLUB which is a viable business attached to our thriving junior school in Radcliffe in Trent, Nottinghamshire. It has 80 children registered with it and there is not enough alternative childcare facilities within our village which is projected to grow in size due to proposed housing developments in the near future. It's closure could potentially see working parents having to leave their jobs and careers which is neither productive nor forward thinking for the UKs economic growth.\r\nPlease sign this petition if you think our OUT OF SCHOOL CLUB should remain open.",
