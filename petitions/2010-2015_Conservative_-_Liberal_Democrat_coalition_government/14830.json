If town centres are to survive they need to positively encourage shoppers and that also means cars. Parking costs and enforcement is often high priced and off-putting. Sign this petition to show support for a fairer attitude to parking in our towns. Lower charges and lower fines with warnings and not fines for minor offenses. Fair Play on Parking!",
