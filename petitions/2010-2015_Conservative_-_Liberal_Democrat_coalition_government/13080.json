        "additional_details": "There are several petitions calling for the speed limit to be increased on the UK Motorways.  However as a frequent user of the Motorways in this Country I am constantly witness to the appalling driving and speeds that are prevailant on the Motorways; one frequent example I see is where I, or some motorist, is overtaken by some lunatic exceeding the speed limit only to cut up the car they have just overtaken and pull off the motorway.\r\n\r\nAlso these other petitions do not take into account the limitations of othr drivers; e.g. if they are eldery or disabled; nor do they consider  that other drivers pulling onto the Motorways do not give way to the traffic already on the motorway; an increase of the Speed Limit here will only increase the amount of accidents.\r\n\r\nUnti the majority of all other road users learn to respect and follow the drviving laws as they currently stand then we cannot justify an increase in Speed Limits.",
