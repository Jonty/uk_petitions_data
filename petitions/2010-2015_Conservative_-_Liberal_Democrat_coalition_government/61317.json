        "additional_details": "The Communist Party of Britain promotes a totalitarian regime and uses symbology (hammer and sickle) which is offensive to many in the British society. In particular the British citizens/residents who had the misfortune of living in the communist countries at some point in their lives will find the use of hammer and sickle and the communist propaganda especially hurtful. To illustrate this, the closest comparison for people of Central/Eastern European origin to the communist symbology and regime system is that of respectively a swastika and nazism.",
