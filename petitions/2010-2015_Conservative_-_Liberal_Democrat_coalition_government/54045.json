        "additional_details": "Richard III was a Roman Catholic and upheld the Roman Catholic Church as the Ark of Salvation just like English Kings had done for nine hundred years and more before him and two Kings (until Henry Tudor's change) after him. Richard III did not and never could have belonged to the Protestant church since it was enacted by the son of the man who defeated him at Bosworth Field. King Richard would want a Roman Catholic service and burial for himself in line with his Roman Catholic Faith and very identity. If in Leicester this should be in the Dominican Priory, if in York, where in the last year of his life he commissioned a college of 100 priests, this should be in St George's or St Wilfrid's, both of which have held Cathedral status. If anywhere else it should be in the most suitable Roman Catholic church or Cathedral.  ",
