        "additional_details": "We often hear of persistant offenders receiving legal aid on an ongoing basis. One offender recently was in court for 75th time. Commits crime, gets caught, gets legal aid, gets someone else to pay for it. Repeat every six months. Legal aid is an important facility to help persons who most need it. The vast majority of UK citizens will never require to use it but it is important that the facility be available for those who do, perhaps on one occasion in their lives. My proposal is that legal aid be limited to perhaps 5 instances during a persons lifetime. Persistant offenders, if they feel they may require the use of a lawyer, should be required to pay an insurance premium to an insurance company or to their favourite lawyer. The more they make use of the policy the more THEY have to pay and not the taxpayer.",
