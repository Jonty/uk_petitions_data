        "additional_details": "With the private sector housing increasing, the time is now to have tougher controls over private landlords.\r\nAt the moment there is no control over how long they can leave you with heating or hot water.  The time of repair is at their discretion, unless you want to take them to a small claims court if you have had to do the repair yourself \u2013 then you may not be reimbursed.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to be loaded in the landlord\u2019s favour which seems to give them the entailment to ride roughshod over the tenants, e.g. \u2018you put up with this or you\u2019re out\u2019, and let\u2019s face it how many people have the money for court cases and solicitors.\r\nAll I want is a fair system in which basic rights regarding the state of repair and the length of time they have to repair is set out plainly so there are no grey areas.\r\n\r\n",
