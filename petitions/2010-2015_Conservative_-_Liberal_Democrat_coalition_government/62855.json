        "additional_details": "The people who have signed this petition are in agreement that the age at which a UK citizen is eligible to participate in any election or vote should be reduced to 16 years old.\r\n\r\nThis is fairer as it allows young people to have a say in the way the country is run.  Many people who are 16 or 17 have a strong political voice, and, as they pay tax through VAT, it is just that they should get a say in how it's spent. To deny them this right would be undemocratic.  What's more, the average first time voting age would become 18, rather than 20 which it currently is.",
