These young men and women will be dedicated to protecting the people, not to contain a situation, only using force when citizen's lives or their own are in danger. Too many people are complaining about the police not doing anything. However, they have to remain in ranks and behind their lines to contain the situation. The community police can mingle within the troublemakers and cause panic and mayhem within their ranks. ",
