        "additional_details": "I would like to propose that a compulsory non-combative form of National service period is re-introduced for all young persons. This would help to instill/ reinforce discipline and responsibility in the younger generation across-the-board, irrespective of social upbringing/ background/ belief system. This also provides the individual with useful life skills not easily accumulated elsewhere in these formative years. This is still a system used effectively in some other European countries and helps to instill responsibility and discipline within the emerging younger generations, whilst providing benefit to the wider community and the individuals themselves.
