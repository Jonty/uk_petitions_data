        "additional_details": "As you are all aware, if you make an appointment with a Dentist, and fail to keep that appointment, and you do not have good reason for the same you get a bill for a nominal sum payable to that Dentist Surgery.\r\nAfter a visit to my local GP the other day I was totally amazed and also discusted with the number of appointments that had not been kept, and those that had made them had not cancelled or rearranged their appointment. I would like to see a fixed penalty charged levied against anyone who makes an appointment at a Doctors Surgery and fails to keep it in the same way as any Dentist ( including NHS Dentist do. ) I believe that this would reduce the number of un kept appointments and thus free up more time for those who are ill and need to see a Doctor. It would, in the long run save the NHS money at both local and national levels.",
