        "additional_details": "West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Bob Jones has called for a Fair Deal for Policing in place of the current \"grossly unfair\" system.\r\n\r\nWest Midlands Police have not had their full formula entitlement based on relative need and demand for many years because of what is called \"grant damping\".  Next year over 250 officers could leave West Midlands Police. If the funding formula was fairly applied, there would be enough funds for new recruits to fill all these posts.\r\n\r\nThe way \"damping\" is applied means that the West Midlands, with arguably the highest demand for policing and related services outside London, faced total cuts this year of over 4%. At the other extreme in Surrey, with much lower crime, the cut was just 1.5%. This disparity means that the West Midlands loses millions of pounds unfairly.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to help give the West Midlands a fair deal for policing, and have your say quickly and cheaply.\r\n",
