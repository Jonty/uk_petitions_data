        "additional_details": "I would like to repeal the Trade Disputes Act 1906 so that we are able sue the unions for striking and causing loss of earnings as a result of not being able to do our normal work due to trade unions organising strikes and causing disruption to our normal lives. It is the unions fault as the unions have gone out of their way to make the disruption as widespread as possible by instructing their members to strike.  The unions do not care about the consequences.  Clearly a threat of such a lawsuit would make unions realise what hardship they cause and make them think twice about causing a strike.\r\n",
