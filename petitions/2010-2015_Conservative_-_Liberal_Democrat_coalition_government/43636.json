        "additional_details": "Scrubs are seen everywhere these days: in wards,in the street and on commuting links.They pose a risk of infection where ever they go.\r\nHospital staff are now identical to each other; be it porters,doctors or nurses. Recognizing help is long gone.\r\nI call upon the Ministry of Health to create guidelines:\r\n\r\n-For scrubs to be kept in  a sterile theatre rather in open contact with germs and super bugs like MRSA.\r\n\r\n-Strict rules keeping scrubs from leaving hospital ground and in contact with greater public.\r\n\r\n-Nurses to have clearly identifiable outfits showing rank.They should be proud of their profession and not hide themselves in scrubs.\r\n\r\n-Doctors to wear white coats to show clearly the experienced professorial.\r\n\r\n-Porters to wear brown warehouse coats,this lets nurses and doctors find orderlies quickly for fast ward movement.\r\n\r\n-Cleaners and Caterers be issued with tabards and shirt to replace scrubs.This prevents confusion for patients.",
