We do not need to eat eat sharks, they provide less sustenance then the normal 'sustainable' fish species we catch, and are an immensely important ecological control in our seas!\r\n\r\n               http://youtu.be/ggtxA4wuXzY\r\n\r\nWhen sharks are caught, their fins are cut from their bodies, the shark is tossed back into the sea STILL ALIVE, suffering a slow, painful, lingering death.\r\nJoin me in calling for BANNING the IMPORTATION and SALE of all shark products in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nFACT: 100 million sharks are killed each year with the bulk of this to feed the demand for Shark Fin Soup which is seen as a delicacy in some cultures.\r\n\r\nFACT: YOU can help by signing the e petition NOW and stopping our country adding to this problem",
