        "additional_details": "It is in the public's interest that such an enormous industry upon which we are all dependent on at some point in our life is regulated. That they are forced to follow protocols set by professional guidelines & punished with fines & or closure if they operate against rules. Currently no incentive to do business in an honest & straightforward manner - are able to increase their income by dishonesty which, currently individuals would have to go to court to claim what monies are rightfully theirs - estate agents hold on to clients monies as & when they want to, with impunity : this MUST change & I ask for the Attorney General to look into this & ensure the protection of the Brittish public against ruthless estate agencies.",
