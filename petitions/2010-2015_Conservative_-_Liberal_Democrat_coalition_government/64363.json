Having your continence needs met is a basic human right, no child should be told they can only have three nappies, four if they are doubly incontinent and five if they have a life limiting condition. We want the Government to ensure that all Trust across the country provide a \"needs met service\"\r\nOther adults/children aren't limited on toilet rolls or underwear, Why should our children be?",
