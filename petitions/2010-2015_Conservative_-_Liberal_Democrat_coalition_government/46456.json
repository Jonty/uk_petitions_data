The BBC is a globally recognized symbol of British excellence and integrity, a perfect ambassador to the South Korean public.\r\n\r\nFor North Koreans without freedom of information, the BBC will provide objective news and help change their views. Unbound to existing interests on the Korean peninsula, the BBC will command special respect from all Korean listeners for its history of upholding citizenship and civil society everywhere.\r\n\r\nBurmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has remarked that while she was under house arrest, \u201cthe BBC was giving me something everyday, [...] and I hope that you will continue to do that for other people, in other places.\u201d\r\n\r\nMake BBC Korea a reality.",
