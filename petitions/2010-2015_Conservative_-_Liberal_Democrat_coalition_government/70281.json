The use of ultra sound scans would alert them if the cord was around the babys neck, the position of the baby and the size of the babys head in comparison to the mothers pelvis aswell as other issues that may arise. It could also decrease the number of unnecessary c sections being carried out, while also seeing needed c sections carried out sooner, before becoming an emergency. ",
