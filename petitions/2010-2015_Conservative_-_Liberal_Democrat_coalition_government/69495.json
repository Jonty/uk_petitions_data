        "additional_details": "We would like the Government to review the payment of registration and renewal fees to registered nurses and midwives by their employers, to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).\r\n\r\nCurrently there are consultations on the revalidation of registered nurses and midwives, and on the proposed fee increases. This would be an ideal time to update and review the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 (SI: 2002/253) and its subsequent amendments.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS), the checks are compulsory and ensure safeguarding of vulnerable people who require care. Generally organisation pays for DBS checks to ensure staffs are properly checked prior to employment. Registered staff would not have to consider prioritising their registration fees over the cost of living to support their families, and remain accountable and responsible for their work.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to encourage a review of the payment of NMC annual registration fees of Nurses and Midwives.",
