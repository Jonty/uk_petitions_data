        "additional_details": "In time of recession when we don't have enough money, the energy companies increased the gas and electricity prices even though they make billions in profit.\r\n\r\nCentrica for example made \u00a31.3 billions profit in the first 6 months of 2011 ONLY, yet they put the prices up for gas by 18% and electricity by 16%.\r\n\r\nEDF had profits of \u00a37.5 billions in the first 6 months, but the electricity increased by 4.5% to which added a 14.70p \"Daily Standing Charge\"; and gas by 15.4% to which added a 23.10p \"Daily Standing Charge\".\r\n\r\nThe increase in energy prices means many people, specially the elderly and disabled won't be able to afford to keep warm this winter.\r\n\r\nI call for the Government to step in, drop and cap the energy prices at an affordable level.\r\n\r\nI call for the Government to scrap the \"Daily Standing Charges\" for both electricity and gas.\r\n\r\nSince the energy companies just increased the prices by 10%-15%, a 30% drop and cap won't do them any harm, and they will still make a profit.",
