        "additional_details": "The world has run out of IPv4 addresses, making connection of new people and computers to the Internet a chore - and making existing addresses extremely valuable.\r\n\r\nIt has recently come to light that the Department for Work and Pensions has its own allocated block of 16,777,216 addresses (commonly referred to as a /8), covering 51.0.0.0 to 51.255.255.255. The estimated market value of this block of addresses is between $0.5 and $1.5 billion.\r\n\r\nAnalysis shows that the DWP is not using any of these addresses in public. If they are being used for internal, private networks then this is a phenomenal waste of public funds - the block 10.0.0.0/8 is specifically earmarked for use on internal private networks, and using the globally routed 51.0.0.0/8 internally is madness.\r\n\r\n\u00a31 billion of low-effort extra cash would be a very nice thing to throw at our deficit.\r\n\r\nhttp://blog.jgc.org/2012/09/the-uk-has-entire-unused-ipv4-8-that-is.html",
