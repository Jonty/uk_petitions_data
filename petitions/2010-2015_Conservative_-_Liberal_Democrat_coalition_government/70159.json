        "additional_details": " I was found to be high risk of blood clots and midwife said i would need clexane from 16 weeks until 6 weeks after birth, but when i went into see the Dr i was told they were only needed after birth for 1 week. Archie was born at 23 weeks + 4 days on 14th September 2013 at 00.40 and passed away at 01.30. I agreed to my placenta and umbilical cord to be sent for testing and they found a massive blood clot in my placenta which they say could have been why Archie came so early.\r\nIm hoping through this petition that every pregnant woman that is found to be at high risk of blood clots during and after pregnancy to be given clexane injections has a preventative measure.",
