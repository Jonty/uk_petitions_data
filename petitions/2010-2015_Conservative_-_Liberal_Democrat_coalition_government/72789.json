        "additional_details": "I find myself disgusted and angry at the fact a friend and former colleague is under investigation for a second time, 9 years after he was cleared of any wrong doing whilst on operations in Southern Iraq in 2003.\r\n\r\nI annoys me so much that these suits that we trust to run OUR country who's chances of being a BRITISH SOLDIER and HERO are nil. All private school boy's who have never suffered the conditions, hardship we endure after THEY sent us there to do a job. Quick to criticise everything from their posh houses paid by us and the blood of our Armed Forces. I am disgusted beyond what I thought was possible.\r\n\r\nI urge you all to sign this petition and share it with all your friends and family to sign in a show of respect for our fallen, and the current service armed forces we all love and care for. My friend Baz is being made another scape goat of the British Government for doing what they sent him there too do!!!\r\n\r\nPLEASE SIGN AND SHOW YOUR SUPPORT ",
