        "additional_details": "The Central African Republic has fallen into a state of anarchy during its current civil war between the broken government, Anti-Balakas and the Seleka, with atrocities being committed by both sides. This has lead to at least 200,000 being displaced and uncounted murders of people in their own homes.\r\nCurrently, there is a peace keeping force of French and South African troops, as well as non-combatants from the African Union to protect the refugees, however, they are stretched thing and so I propose sending at least supplies and preferably troops as reinforcements to the peacekeepers.",
