        "additional_details": "With recent news and past events it is obvious that there is a serious crime issue in the country, and the punishment is not enough. There are vile crimes happening such as the recent murder of Nicholas Pearton, in which they get off with what can somewhat be called a light sentence. The death sentence would not only bring the most atrocious of villians to justice, but would also initimidate anyone from ever commiting such offences. I think this is a good idea and should only ever be used for the most serious (and proven) offences. Lets see what people think about this.",
