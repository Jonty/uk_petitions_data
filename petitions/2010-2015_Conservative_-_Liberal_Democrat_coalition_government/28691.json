        "additional_details": "Introduce legally enforceable compulsory systems that progressively reduces the price of food reaching its sell by date in  supermarkets in line with trading hours. This would ensure that all food items automatically receive rebate incentives to increase stock rotation of perishable consumables.\r\nCurrent voluntary labelling systems are proving timely, costly and inefficient. Although the technology to reduce perishable items at the 'point of sale' has been available since bar-codes were introduced. Some reduced items and reduced sections have also been shown to have negative social connotations causing some food to be wasted.\r\nAt present few supermarkets effectively use this system which has the potential to save time, money and food compared to other food reducing systems; ultimately enforcing efficient, ethical and sustainable consumption.\r\n",
