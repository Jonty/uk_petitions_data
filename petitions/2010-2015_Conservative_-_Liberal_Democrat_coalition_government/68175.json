        "additional_details": "We ask HM Government to take all necessary steps to save Chesterton Windmill. This 350-year-old Grade 1 listed building stands sentinel over rolling agricultural land acknowledged to be of high landscape value in South Warwickshire. A core strategy plan has been approved by Stratford District Council which would sanction the building of a settlement of 3,000 houses in the environment of the mill. If this proposal is approved the pastoral backdrop to the mill on the southern horizon will be destroyed and the setting of a monument of national importance will be irretrievably degraded to the detriment of the enjoyment of present and future generations forever.",
