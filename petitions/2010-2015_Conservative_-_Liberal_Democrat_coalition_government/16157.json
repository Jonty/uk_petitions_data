        "additional_details": "The below signed hereby call for the immediate resignation of Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Democrats, on the grounds that his accession to these posts have not been wrought righteously but rather through blatant misleading of the electorate. Mr Clegg's place in the government, we hereby assert, is not borne of acceptable events as he has garnered the trust of voters through solemnly pledging courses of action which he has subsequently failed to deliver on in government. We hereby call that Mr Clegg be moved to resign from all his posts in the government of this country. To do anything otherwise would be to scorn the very foundations upon which our democracy is based.",
