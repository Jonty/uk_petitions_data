        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, believe that a serious change in British Law is required in order to prevent limited Companies that incur huge debts, from being voluntarily wound up, to avoid taxation, and the payment owed to creditors. At present, Companies, and their Directors, are able to close down a Company to enable such avoidances and then start up again, often using the same Company name, and begin their offensive behaviour all over again. It is recommended that the Dept for Business takes appropriate action over this issue without delay.",
