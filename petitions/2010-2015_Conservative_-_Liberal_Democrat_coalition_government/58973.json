        "additional_details": "The use of managed traffic systems with variable and/or reduced speed limits to manage congestion and traffic flow is enforced the same as speeding, with the same penalties as for breaking the speed limits posted for safety reasons.  Current penalties include both a fine and points on the licence, and accumulation of 12 or more points can mean disqualification from driving.  Such a penalty is disproportionate.\r\n\r\nViolation of speed limits imposed for traffic management should be treated differently to those for the speed limits set for safety reasons, and should at most be a fine not more than the current fixed penalty notice.",
