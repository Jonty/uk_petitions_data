        "additional_details": "Every year thousands of children and animals are killed or severely injured by the inappropriate use of fireworks.  At the very least dogs / cats are traumatised by the sound of fireworks.  This problem starts as early as September and can often continue through the Christmas and New Year celebrations.  Fireworks are explosive weapons, the sale of which should be banned from the general public, the exception being to those who can prove they are in a responsible position and the fireworks are to be used within the confines of an organised display.  Please make these explosives illegal and keep our children and pets safe!  ",
