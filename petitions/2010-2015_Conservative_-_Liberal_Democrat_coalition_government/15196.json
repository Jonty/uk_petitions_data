        "additional_details": "We urge her Majestys Government to remove the contract for medical examinations and assesments for benefits from the French dutch Company Atos - sub branch Atos Healthcare. The assesments cause untold suffering, mental anxiety, fear, and poverty amongst many disabled and vulnerable adults, teenagers, children and carers nationwide. Many have committed suicide, others have died, yet others have become homeless or had breakdowns.\r\nWe urge the Government to listen to your people to whom you serve in office, and under human rights, to take action and end Atos's contract.",
