        "additional_details": "I live on Somerset Road in Ashford, Kent.\r\nOn a daily basis we have people race on this road and there have been various crashes within the three years I have lived here. Most people that crash drive off because they do not want to be caught doing reckless driving.\r\nThe night before last there was an incident that resulted in a death of a young and very treasured man. An innocent life was taken. This could have been prevented if there were precautions in place.\r\nI propose a speed camera should be put in place so incidences like this are prevented from happening.\r\nIt has been proven that speed cameras reduce incident rate.\r\nPlease strongly consider this proposal.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\nJessie Jane Horvath\r\n",
