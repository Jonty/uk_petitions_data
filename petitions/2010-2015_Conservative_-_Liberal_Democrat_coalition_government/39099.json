        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that the 22 Government Cabinet Ministers should have experience in the field of work for which their department is responsible.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for Health should, at some point in their career, have been employed within the NHS. The Secretary of State for Education should have experience of both teaching in a classroom and running a school, and so forth for all 22 government departments.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this measure would restore faith in the Government, and rid it of its PR obsession of recent times.\r\n\r\nCabinet reshuffles as a PR stunt would become a thing of the past as skills are department-specific and not transferable.\r\n\r\nWhilst this is a radical departure from the current Cabinet set-up, we believe this proposal represents common sense and the government should take action to implement it.",
