        "additional_details": "The UK is sending \u00a3280 million a year to India in aid until 2015. This is money to assist India's economy and presumably aid for the poorer in society there. Yet today 5th Nov 2013, India has launched a space mission in a futile mission to orbit the planet Mars. It seems that the UK is effectively funding this project and it should be stopped right now and the money put to domestic causes like providing for the elderly and poor in the UK - there's enough of them!",
