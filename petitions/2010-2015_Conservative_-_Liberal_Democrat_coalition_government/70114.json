(including the 30,000 Iraqi soldiers who ran away)\r\n\r\n\r\na) The military action proposed by the Western governments is stupid.\r\nb)There is no credible plan.\r\nc)There are no discernible and achievable aims.\r\nd)There is no end point.\r\ne)Intervention without the above will only prolong the agony of the people of those countries and will delay their self determined societal evolution.\r\n With only a few exceptions, the MPs who debated this question and then voted on it yesterday are;\r\na) ill informed and ignorant of the culture of the region, and na\u00efve beyond belief\r\nb)of incredibly poor intellect and demonstrate astoundingly  poor judgement\r\nc) desperate only to assuage their guilt over causing all this angst in the middle east in the first place. The level of handwringing displayed yesterday does not belong in a place of sober debate and intellectual consideration.\r\n",
