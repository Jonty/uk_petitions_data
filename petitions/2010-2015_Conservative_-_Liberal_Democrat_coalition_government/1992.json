        "additional_details": "The current VED system is an inefficient way of collecting revenue. Its only other purpose is to provide an annual check that the vehicle is insured and MOTed, both of which can be check automatically from the roadside by the same equipment that checks vehicles VED. SORN provides no useful purpose as there is nothing to prevent a vehicle declared SORN from being used on the road beyond exactly the same checks as are done to check VED. Scrapping VED and SORN would save a substantial amount of money wasted running the DVLA. It would also save much personal time wasted on the part of normal people dealing with motoring bureaucracy.",
