        "additional_details": "In light of the recent and continuing riots and violence throughout London and the UK, I urge the Government to make urgent, decisive and positive changes to policing in this country. Perpetrators of such acts should be seen to have forfeited their human rights as soon as they get involved in such acts. They have more protection from the law than victims do. This needs to stop now.\r\n\r\nThe police need more powers to be able to put an end to disruption of this kind as soon as it breaks out, not to just stand there and be 'British' about it as Theresa May thinks they should. Water cannons, rubber bullets etc should all be more readily at the police's disposal in order for them to do their job properly - protect the public and send out the message that it is not acceptable.
