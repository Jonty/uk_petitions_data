        "additional_details": "Collective worship is currently compulsory in state schools under the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. This act should be ammended to remove collective worship from state schools as it is contrary to Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights, part of the Human Rights Act 1998 and contrary to many parents' and their children's wishes. Although parents can exclude their children under Section 71 of the School Standards and Framework Act, schools do not promote this little known clause, are ignorant to it and do not welcome parents that use it. Section 71 does not satisfy the Human Rights Act because children are still presumed to be of a certain religion, contrary to Article 9.",
