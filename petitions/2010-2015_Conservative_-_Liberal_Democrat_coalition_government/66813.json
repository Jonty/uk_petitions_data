        "additional_details": "This petition is to increase the wages of service men and women in our armed forces. I think that it is disgraceful how much these men and women get paid for the service they do to their country. We would like the wage for a New Entrant to rise to \u00a315,500 and the rates for a Private Level 1 to rise to \u00a318,500 and all other ranks wage to rise by \u00a32200. I would like this to be achieved by 2020.",
