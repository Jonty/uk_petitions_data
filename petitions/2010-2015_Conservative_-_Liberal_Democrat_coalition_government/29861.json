        "additional_details": "This petition is to call for a national public opinion survey. For the average person to be heard\r\n\r\nIt has occured to me that a very small amount of people in government have 62.3million British people\u2019s lives in their hand. They make decision on our behalf and spend our money how they see fit. I am not naive enough to think that I have any idea about the complexity of running a country but I would like to have my say on how their decision effect my life.\r\n\r\nThe survey should be a brief document asking about things such as immigration, healthcare, way of life, caring for the elderly and issues about violence, gangs and punishment etc.\r\n\r\nI am living my one life by other people rules and to be honest they are making it hell. So maybe by stating our views as a country we will be heard.\r\n",
