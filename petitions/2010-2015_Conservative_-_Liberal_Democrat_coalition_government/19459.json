So people on low income that been hit by bank charges could still pay for the basics like food, electricity and water,\r\n\r\nFor example a bank could not charged more than \u00a315 per month. Somebody who under 25 and on JSA who has overdrawn could still able to pay for the basics and paid the bank \u00a315.\r\n\r\nWhere as currently, my bank could charged up to \u00a3186 (\u00a36 a day that the account is overdrawn for).
