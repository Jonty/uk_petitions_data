Likewise any employee who witnesses such incidents should have the protection of the Government against repercussion when reporting any findings to Trust management.  Too often we see that pressures are put upon such people to discourage others from such actions, often to the detriment of that persons career/reputation.\r\n\r\nI petition the Prime Minister to urgently take more urgent action to protect such employees during investigations of their concerns.\r\n",
