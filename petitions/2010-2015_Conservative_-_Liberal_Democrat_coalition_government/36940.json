        "additional_details": "I would like to close down the Lincolnshire Police. I don't believe that they understand justice.\r\nAs may have read in my other petition I was contacting a friend who did not want to reconcile her friendship with me. I was trying to warn her that this is against bible laws. It says, you must forgive.\r\nBut she got her local Police (Lincolnshire) involved  and the Police threatened to arrest me if I contacted her again. I know it is Police duty to protect people but this means she could die at Armageddon.\r\nI tried to reason with them but they said that the officer acted lawfully and suggested I should get legal advice. How is that supposed to resolve a religeous matter? I could not get any. They have now closed the case.\r\nHow could the Police have been lawful if my friend is going to die as a result?\r\nSo I think this bad Police force should be done away with, especially if they are still attacking JWs and then replace them with ones who know how law abiding JWs are.
