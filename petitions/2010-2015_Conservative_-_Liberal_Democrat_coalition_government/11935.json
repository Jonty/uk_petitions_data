        "additional_details": "With turnout at General Elections in recent years the lowest it has been since the First World War, we petition the Government to do more to make a General Election an occasion where people feel their vote will matter. Making the day of a General Election a Bank Holiday will give the public more flexibility and little excuse not to vote. A General Election only takes place every 4-5 years and it is important that the government makes every allowance for people to vote. ",
