        "additional_details": "In the early 1990s the former nationalised British Railways introduced open stations to bring Britain in line with continental Europe where tickets are checked on board the train. In the last few years the privatised rail companies have been progressively reintroducing ticket barriers, They should be scrapped in most cases because:\r\n(a) Family/friends can then accommopany passengers to and from the platform, and help with luggage;\r\n(b) It will cut down on congestion at the stations, especially at rush hour time\r\n(c) It will be possible to board the train if, for whatever reason, you haven't had time to buy a ticket, and pay the conductor (even if it means paying a premium)\r\n(d) It will stop the railway companies treating everyone as a potential fare dodger, and inconveniencing the honest traveller. Tickets should be checked on board the train, as with buses and trams. It's much more civilised.\r\nIf the rest of Europe can run its railways in this way, so can we. ",
