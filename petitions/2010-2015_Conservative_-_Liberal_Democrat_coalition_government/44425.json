        "additional_details": "On 8 February 2012 IPSA announced that Members\u2019 of Parliment pay would remain frozen at \u00a365,738 for 2012/13.\r\nMPs wish to vote for \u00a320k+ pay-rise in the face of the public sector pay-freeze, whilst all UK citizens are facing hardship of a global recession and job losses along with the benefits being revoked for those in most need.\r\nPolice NHS Fire Authority Life Guards and Armed Forces have seen dramatic cuts to their operations pay and working conditions. It is obscene to allow MP's a 20K pay rise, Most of the UK work force have not had an inflation based rise in last 4years, while the cost of living rises but income declines, it is time for MP's to be accountable to the UK public regarding their expenses and dishonesty that has followed them over last 5 years, Pay rises should be based on performance on the individual on how they have performed in their community over last 12mths by the Public who elected them.\r\n\r\n",
