As this is a public website and an attempt to engage the public in Politics it makes a complete mockey of them, this website, and the governments attempts to re-connect with the public if they cannot be bothered to make time to discuss two issues which 100,000 voters have raised as something the government should consider.\r\n\r\nA discussion should be held on whether discussions of this nature should take place, and in discussing the discussion a decision should be made about further discussions.\r\n\r\nLink: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14852603",
