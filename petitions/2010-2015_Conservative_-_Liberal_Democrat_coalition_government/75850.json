        "additional_details": "Although human trafficking has been banned within the EU it still occurs within the UK and around the world.\r\n\r\n2,744 people in 2013 were identified as victims by the National Referral Mechanism, with 602 of these identified as being minors, however the number is suspected to be much higher. Roughly 2/3 of these were female.\r\n\r\nWhat we want is the Government to pay closer attention to these issues as well as making it harder for it to happen. Although regulations are in place, they are clearly not working and we want the government to tighten regulations in order to prevent innocent people from being exploited in this way. ",
