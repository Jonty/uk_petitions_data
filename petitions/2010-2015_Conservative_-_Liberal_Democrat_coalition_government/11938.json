        "additional_details": "I propose that that the bus industry should be re-nationalised and thus revoking part(s) of The Transport Act (1985). A similar system in London and Northern Ireland should be adopted. The outcome will give local transport authorities more control over bus operators with the aim of increasing patronage, service levels, encouraging modal shift, to name a few.",
