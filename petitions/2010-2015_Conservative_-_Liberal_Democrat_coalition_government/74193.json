This was recognised when VAT was introduced 42 years ago and books were zero rated, so why tax e-books, now representing nearly a quarter of all books purchased and forecast to be 50% by the end of this decade.\r\n\r\nWe must promote reading and by adding VAT to e-books we are smothering our culture under tax.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how unfair it is.\r\n\r\n\uf0a7\tVersion \t\t\t\tBook\t\te-Book\r\n\uf0a7\tSelling Price\t\t\t\u00a310.00\t\t\u00a310.00\r\n\uf0a7\tVAT\t\t\t\t          \u00a30.00\t\t  \u00a32.00\r\n\uf0a7\tafter UK tax\t\t\t\u00a310.00\t\t  \u00a38.00\r\n\r\nSo we at CUT - The Writers e-Publishing Community urge you the UK Government to join us in the fight.\r\n",
