These loans are often provided for relatively small amounts of money, with very high rates of APR (often, over 100, and cases of APR\u2019s over 200% are not uncommon).\r\n\r\nAll though the legislation governing the BOS is very strict companies like Logbook Loan disregard the legislation and the consumer credit act and bully their clients with any force needed to remove the cars.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Fair Trading can remove a company licence. This company and assets are then sold  to another company with the same disregard to legislation.\r\nIt is a multi million pound industry that needs to be brought back under control.\r\n\r\n.Government legislation is failing the protect the consumer against this type of lending.",
