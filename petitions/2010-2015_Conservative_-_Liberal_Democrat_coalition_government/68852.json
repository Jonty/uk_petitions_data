For this reason it is impossible to provide a service where impartiality is required.\r\n\r\nMedical Assessments need to be carried out by the NHS. In particular claimants with mental healthcare issues need to be assessed by a qualified mental health nurse (not a ATOS HCP who has 17 days of training to become an HCP with 4 days spent on mental health - info came to light from an FOI request on training material)",
