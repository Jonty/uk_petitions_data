        "additional_details": "The Police and Criminal Evidence act 1984 guidelines should be replaced with legislation so police cannot abuse their position.\r\nSeveral of the issues within PACE advise police discretion, well known issues such as a suspects right to legal representation and food can be delayed. The police can hold a suspect for 24 hours, however this can be extended by a senior officer to three days, if a senior officer is not available a low rank officer can decide to do this using their discretion.\r\nThe constant use of police discretion erodes the rights of the suspect and can lead to false confessions being made and severe mental health trauma.\r\nPACE should be replaced with legislation that does not allow police to abuse the rights of suspects because of their own discretion.\r\nRemember these people are Suspects not criminals and deserve the same rights as us all\r\n",
