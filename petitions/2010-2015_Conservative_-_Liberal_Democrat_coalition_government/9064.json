        "additional_details": "The recent riots across the country have highlighted a severe problem with a large number of the youths lack of discipline, respect and work ethic. These values, whilst beneficial to society are highly regarded and promoted by the armed services.\r\n\r\nThe recent strategic defence review has also put the armed services on track to become a smaller, better equipped force with a larger contribution from the T.A. The following proposals would therefore compliment the government's defence plans accordingly:\r\n\r\n1) All able males between the ages of 17 and 25 must undertake at least 12 months National Service.\r\n\r\n2) Only exceptional circumstances would permit an individual to be pardoned.\r\n\r\n3) Employers would be forced to accommodate for the more flexible working conditions.\r\n\r\n4) Employers could seek references from the appropriate trainer.\r\n\r\n5) Those who have completed the National Service with distinction would receive additional benefits.",
