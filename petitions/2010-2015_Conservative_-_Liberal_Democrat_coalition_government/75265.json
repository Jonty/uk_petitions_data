        "additional_details": "The beautiful old cast iron lamppost are being ripped out (and allegedly sold off) by Croydon Council and replaced with dreadful looking steel ones.\r\n\r\nThe old cast iron lampposts were a architectural feature of the community, were functional and also very pleasant to look at.\r\n\r\nThis is also a waste of tax payer money as the old lampposts did not need replacing and would have lasted another 100 years.  The new steel ones will undoubtedly rust within a couple of decades and need replacing again - costing Croydon residents again.\r\n\r\nResidents of Croydon (and all UK residents) make your voice heard and help us to stop this cultural vandalism.",
