Their treatment has been awful at the hand of Buddhist extremists.\r\n\r\nDespite European powers entering Central African Republic, Mali and many other countries where Muslims were in power, it seems that when Muslims are the oppressed minority, there is no interest in doing anything to help or assist the oppressed.\r\n\r\nOur inaction over the Rohingya is unacceptable to the British public and I call upon our leaders to make some real and meaningful efforts to assist them in leaving as equal and respected citizens of the Burmese state, and have their inalienable human rights respected by their government and fellow Burmese citizens.
