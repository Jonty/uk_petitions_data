        "additional_details": "One issue raised by the recent riots is the perception that Cabinet and MP's are out of touch with the society they represent.\r\n\r\nTime magazine (22/08/11) states that  the top 5% of earners in the UK earn almost 30% of UK income. 2009/10 Department for Work and Pension statistics show that 29% of children and 22% of working age adults live in households in the UK with incomes below 60 per cent of the average household income. The MP expense claim scandal has given the impression that, whilst MP's may not be in the top 5%, they come a lot closer to it than those who fall under the poverty line.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we petition that a discussion takes place in the House of Commons to determine how in touch Cabinet and MP's are by asking if they know the cost of a loaf of bread and a pint of milk from a local supermarket.\r\n\r\n",
