        "additional_details": "The risk of women suffering from PASS can be eliminated using the following methods -\r\n\r\nPre-abortion counselling -\r\nThis can encourage a woman to be more aware of what she wants without pressure from someone of biased opinion.  It can also help to ensure a woman is aware of all the options available to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nPre-abortion questionnaires -\r\nThe Marie Stopes website currently has one of these questionnaires online.  This could be used as part of the counselling or instead if, for any reason, there is no time for a counselling session.\r\nThis can help women to be clearer about what they want to do and can help clinicians be certain that this is the best option for each woman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor patients to be made aware of PASS -\r\nNot all patients will suffer from PASS but women deserve to know this is a possibility and where to get help if they do suffer from it later on.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information please visit my webpage: postabortionstress.webs.com - thanks\r\n ",
