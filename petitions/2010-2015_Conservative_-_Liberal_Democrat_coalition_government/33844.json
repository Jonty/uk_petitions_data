        "additional_details": "In recent days, following Mr V. Putin\u2019s inauguration, thousands of ordinary citizens across Russia have been exercising their basic human right of assembly by gathering peacefully in public places in a quiet and orderly manner. They are chased through the streets of Moscow in an unprovoked, forceful response from the state police. Hundreds of peacefully assembling people have been detained on unlawful grounds and some of them were convicted to prison sentences in unfair trials.\r\n\r\nWe demand that Russian state officials, who are responsible for breaching the right of freedom of movement and assembly in public places across Russian cities and are in charge of the unprovoked use of force against peaceful citizens, be refused entry into the UK until such time as the basic human right to peaceful assembly has been restored in the Russian Federation. This includes attendance of the major event of peace and equality to be held in just two months in London - the Olympic Games. ",
