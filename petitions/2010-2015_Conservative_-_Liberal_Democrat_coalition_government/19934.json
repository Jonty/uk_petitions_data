They should only be used at properly organized events.These should only be held in public parks or a reasonable distance away from housing estates\r\n\r\nWe all know that many animals suffer each year from fireworks But what people don't realize is many Veterans suffer as well .Its not a firework going off that some veterans hear and this noise can cause flashbacks from time gone by.Put yourself in a Veterans shoes ,\r\nA banner goes of \"Sound of a gun fired\"\r\nChines cracker \"Rapid Fire\"\r\nLarge fireworks \" Explosion \"\r\nWhen this happens a Veteran can smell the Cordite in the air  and taste the dust in their mouth\r\n\r\nPlease help to get fireworks off our streets thank you.\r\n",
