        "additional_details": "Irish coats-of-arms are granted by the Chief Herald of Ireland under the authority of the Irish Government. Suddenly in 1999, after decades of recognising such arms, the College of Arms in London has refused to record Irish arms in its Registers.\r\nThere has been no real justification for this refusal, and the refusal is in fact disrespectful to the Irish Government and People. This is in spite of the principle of 'Parity of Esteem' under the British Irish Agreement.\r\nThis Petition requests that the College of Arms be made aware of its duties and responsibilities to register Irish coats-of-arms at the request of those in right of such arms.
