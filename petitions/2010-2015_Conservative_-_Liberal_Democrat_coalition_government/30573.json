        "additional_details": "HMG should prioritise adequate resources (like funding, human resources, training, supervision, new procedures, technology, etc) to discharge their important duties of immigration control.  Border Force being made separate from UKBA would be cosmetic, unless HMG ensure retrospective correction of blunders like the frequent unauthorised suspensions & downgrading of  border checking on - Eurostar passengers, migrants with student (or other visas) & passports, fingerprints, etc. Over 500,000 Eurostar passengers are not checked against the Home Office index of suspected terrorists & those with adverse immigration histories. The agency had been working through a backlog of 450,000 asylum seekers claims since 2006. Out of 403,000 processed claims so far, just 38,000 (9%) have left UK. Due to such backlogs, 160,000 (40%) asylum seekers are given amnesty to stay (with indefinite leave to remain in UK) & 74,500 untraceable. Another 129,000 claims have been recorded as \"errors\u201d.",
