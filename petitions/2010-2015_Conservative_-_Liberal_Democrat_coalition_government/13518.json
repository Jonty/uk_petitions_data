The exception is for those with a genuine cognitive aversion towards alcohol. Feelings of the pleasures of drinking alcohol (heavily, moderately or occasionally) would depend on one's motivation, triggers, settings, lifestyle, perception, cravings and aims. If a recovering alcoholic have a genuine aversion towards alcohol in his or her own mind (COGNITIVELY) than it is certain that he or she is no longer a RECOVERING alcoholic but a 100% RECOVERED one.
