        "additional_details": "I.   The current Welfare Benefit Reforms are continuing to be unfairly implemented, particularly in relation to those with less visible health problems, such as mental illness.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nII.    A.T.O.S. and the D.W.P. are declaring numerous Sickness and Disability Benefit Claimants \"Fit for Work\", when they are - in fact - documented as being very clearly \"Unfit for Work\".\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nIII.   Numerous sick, mentally ill and disabled Citizens are now suffering ever more than ever, due to not having enough money for even basic things such as food and heating expenses.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nThe Bottom Line:\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNMENT:\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nSORT OUT THE UNFAIRNESS AND UNPROFESSIONALISM OF A.T.O.S. HEALTH CARE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF WORK AND PENSIONS.\r\n\r\n[short version of MP and Local Councillor Backed Parliamentary Petition - the full version is available online.]",
