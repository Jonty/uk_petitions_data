Similarly, research evidence confirms the adverse impact of breathing in second-hand smoke.  However the law at present permit people to inflict such smoke on young children travelling with smokers in cars.  Such children are not in a position to protect themselves.  It follows therefore that the State should put in place such controls.  The rights of children to protect their health should be put in front of the so-called \u201crights of smokers\u201d.",
