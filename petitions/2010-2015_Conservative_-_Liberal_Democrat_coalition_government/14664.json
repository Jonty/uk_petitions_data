        "additional_details": "Atos is commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to conduct medical assessments and provide reports on people claiming sickness and disability benefits. Atos assesses over 800,000 people a year. Atos has 141 medical assessment centres. Over 20% are inaccessible to wheelchair users. Only 50 have on-site parking. Each year, Atos wrongly judges many thousands of people as fit to work. Appeals are costing \u00a350 million annually. The DWP must comply with the Equality Act 2010, ensuring that its contractors also comply with the Act. It is must spend public money well. We believe that DWP is failing to comply with the Equality Act 2010 with respect to monitoring the equality outcomes of its contract with Atos. We believe that Atos is failing to provide facilities and services in ways that comply with the reasonable adjustment requirements of the Equality Act 2010. We call on HM Government to remedy this situation now and ensure proper implementation of the Equality Act 2010.",
