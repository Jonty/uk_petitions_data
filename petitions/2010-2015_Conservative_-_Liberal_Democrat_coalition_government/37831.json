        "additional_details": "Politicians are out of touch with reality representing only the very rich and powerful, responsible for crippling our rights to a free and democratic society. There is no such thing as democracy, politicians say they know what\u2019s best for us and with total disregard for our opinions make laws that undermine our lives and wishes. Public are taxed for a system that works for the very few. Therefore this petition calls on the Government to:\r\n1)  Abolish  House of Commons and House of Lords.\r\n2) Create online system where the people write their own laws and constitution and bring democracy back to the people.like an e-petition people would be able to submit policies /laws online for others to vote for, if this figure reaches 100,000 it can be debated and put to an online referendum, then public officials carry out the will of the people. People will then be fully responsible for creating their own future.If you can bank, buy and gamble online then you should be able to vote online.\r\n\r\n",
