        "additional_details": "Young women are denied smear test's which could save their lives just to save money. We have a government which is prepared to lose billions by selling a bank publicly owned for far less than the tax payer paid but is not prepared to spend to save lives. This has to stop, Parliament answers to us and we must tell them that lives are more important than policy.\r\n\"A Department of Health spokesperson said\r\n\r\n'Cervical cancer and mortality from it are very rare in women under 25. Since the starting age was raised in England in 2003 there has been no increase in mortality in women aged 20 to 24 or 25 to 30 years old.'\"\r\nThis is simply untrue, and we owe it not just to those women who are now being denied smear tests, but more importantly to those we have lost so that lessons can be learned from their loss.\r\n",
