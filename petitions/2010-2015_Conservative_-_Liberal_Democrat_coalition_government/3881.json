        "additional_details": "Far too many children have access to Freeview at home or in their bedrooms, they can switch it on and can easily scroll down and access adult channels. There are so many of them now and one is even named ADULT Filth.\r\n\r\nSome of these channels show women in their underwear posing provocatively as early as 5/6am when children are up and send out the wrong message. I propose that Freeview boxes should be restricted when sold and adult channels only activated when an adult verifies their age.\r\n\r\nAsking parents to 'delete' these channels or set up a 'pin' system isn't the answer as many parents aren't 'tech savvy', and as soon as the set top box is re-tuned it has to be done all over again.\r\n\r\nThe regulations MUST be tightened.",
