        "additional_details": "This petition is to strongly oppose plans with regards to the issues arising from wanting to build 775 houses between London Road and Rawreth Lane Rayleigh, together with the development of two industrial parks and the only Traveller site for the whole of Rochford District.\r\n\r\nOur town of Rayleigh struggles enough as it is with traffic, without 1000's of extra cars on the road. These extra homes with very little infrastructure to support it will hugely damage our town, despite what is promised by the council. People enjoy living in the local area due to the green land that surrounds it, the council are irresponsible in building homes here. The traveller site will bring untold problems to our community. The mere mention of travellers de-values homes, causes environmental and social issues that are hard to police.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to take another look at this and make the effort to talk to residents to hear our concerns. We have not been properly informed about these changes! ",
