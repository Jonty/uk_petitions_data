We should introduce a grading system for the driving test; higher the grade you pass with, the lower the car insurance you would pay. It doesn't seem right that just because of your age and your sex you should pay higher car insurance, the premium should be proportional to the car value and at what grade you passed your test.\r\n\r\nThe insurance system needs to be more fair and transparent!!!\r\n",
