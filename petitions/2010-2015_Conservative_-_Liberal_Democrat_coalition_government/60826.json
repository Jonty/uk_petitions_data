        "action": "to reinstate the duty of the Health Secretary to provide and secure comprehensive  healthcare",
        "additional_details": "The Health and Social Care Act introduced in March 2012 removed a clause that stated the Secretary of Sate for Health hasa duty to provide and secure comprehensive healthcare across the country.  He is now left only with a duty to  promote this.\r\nSince the  introduntion of the Act service provision has been determined solely by market forces, unlike previously when it was determined by need.  Where services have been lost and need is left unmet  the government can no longer be held accountable.  This petition calls for a debate on the duties of the Health Secretary and hopes for the original duties to be reinstated.",
