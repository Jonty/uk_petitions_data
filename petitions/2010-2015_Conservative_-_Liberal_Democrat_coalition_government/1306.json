        "additional_details": "The CSCS card scheme has been introduced to ensure standards of health and safety are met by all on-site construction employees. It is a mandatory requirement for all on-site workers and currently costs between \u00a380-150 to take the course and receive the card. How can the unemployed afford that and where is the incentive to get back into work? Stealth tax on the poor. The Government has introduced a scheme they can not afford to operate so the red tape slack is taken up by the unemployed. ",
