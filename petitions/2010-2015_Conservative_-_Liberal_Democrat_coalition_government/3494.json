        "additional_details": "As a wheelchair user I find it infuriating that I have to travel great distances and often unable to access  buildings, hotels, shops, cinemas etc due to disabled parking bays being taken up by the non-disabled and those with larger or expensive cars that they simply want to park in a larger bay to prevent damage by nearby parked cars. The disabled bays policy is currently not policed, the only way that disabled people will be able to use this service created to assist their access will be to implement a fine. \u00a350 would be a suggested fine.",
