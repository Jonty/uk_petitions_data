That is why the government does not interfere in what a newspaper or magazine chooses to publish. However, with this freedom comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nNewspapers must, of course, abide by the law, but they also sign up to a Code of Practice, overseen by the independent Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The Editor's Code of Practice sets a benchmark for the standards the press is expected to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you would like any more information on the PCC and the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice, it can be found on the PCC\u2019s website at: http://www.pcc.org.uk.\r\n\r\nThe PCC has an independent commissioner who reviews its work.  If you believe the PCC is not fulfilling its remit, you can contact the Commissioner at chartercommissioner@pcc.org.uk\r\n\r\nIf you have any complaint about the manner in which your complaint was handled by the Commission, you should write, within one month of being told the outcome of your complaint to:\r\n\r\nThe Independent Charter Commissioner\r\nHalton House\r\n20/23 Holborn\r\nLondon EC1N 2JD\r\n\r\nThe Charter Commissioner will investigate the matter and report any findings and recommendations to the Commission. He does not deal with appeals against the substance of any decision by the Commission."
