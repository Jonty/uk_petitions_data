        "additional_details": "We would like all child killers to receive a mandatory life sentence if found guilty.\r\n\r\nDependant on the seriousness of the offence, minimum terms for murder are stated as 15, 25 and 30 years.\r\n\r\nChildren are vulnerable and defenseless and deserve protecting by the law. Many murderers of children will still be fit enough to reoffend on release and that needs to be stopped.\r\n\r\nWe would like to see the minimum term starting point for  murder of a child increased to 40 years. This will ensure that no child killer is released from prison until they are unlikely to be in a position to reoffend.\r\n\r\nWe would also request that the government give consideration to including guilty parties who have 'assisted' in the search for the child, clearly perverting the course of justice and prolonging the agony of the family and friends of the child, to be included in the offences with a starting point of 'Whole Life Term'.\r\n\r\n",
