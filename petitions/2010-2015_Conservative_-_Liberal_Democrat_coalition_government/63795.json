        "additional_details": "A lifetime ban for sex offenders is needed immediately in the UK to put a stop to grooming on the internet & stops rapists joining dating sites.\r\nRandom house search by the Police and monitoring the sex offenders place of residence for internet access will show if they have been actively using the internet. An internet block can be placed on any dwelling, as used in prisons, would also help. If the government do not even attempt to stop internet usage by sex offenders then what hope do our children and citizens of the UK have against these monsters.\r\nPlease sign this petition & pass on to others so all victims of a sex crime & our childrens voices can be heard in Parliament.",
