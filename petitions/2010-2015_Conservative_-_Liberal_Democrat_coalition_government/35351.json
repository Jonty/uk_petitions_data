        "additional_details": "The fourth plinth would be dedicated to Alan Turing and a small plaque added to the base of the plinth. The space on the plinth is then left as a free space, allowing for the continued free expression of ideas.\r\n The plinth's 'air space' for free expression is a fitting memorial to Turing's  life and work.\r\nThe plinths in Trafalgar Square are dedicated to war heroes and Turing is a unique war hero that saved millions of lives. He also layed the foundations for computer science that changed the world. ",
