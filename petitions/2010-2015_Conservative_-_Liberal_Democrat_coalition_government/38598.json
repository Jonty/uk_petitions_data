        "additional_details": "The independence of Britain\u2019s last major defence manufacturing Concern, BAE Systems is vital to the National interest.\r\nIt is imperative that the Company responsible for the design and maintenance of our submarine nuclear deterrent as well as other Royal Navy vessels, remains totally under UK control and ownership. We have already lost the indigenous manufacturing capability in vital areas such as ground radar systems, navigation aids, and Military as well as Civil aircraft manufacture.\r\nWe petition the Prime Minister to prevent this merger on the grounds that it will compromise the ability of the British Defence Industry to be able to independently and indigenously support the needs of the Armed Forces in any future manufacturing or maintenance requirement. Once undertaken, it will be almost impossible to reverse the effects of this merger, it cannot therefore be allowed to happen.",
