        "additional_details": "I think that David Cameron's ties to People implicated in the phone hacking scandal should lead us to seriously question his judgement. We cannot dictate who the PM has a friendship with, but to have a close relationship with Rebekah Brooks who was very senior at News international and then to actually appoint Andy Coulson as his communications director, an editor who had resigned following the conviction of one of his reporters for illegal phone hacking, is very disturbing. I have lost all confidence in the PM's judgement and would like parliament to consider a vote of no confidence in the PM.",
