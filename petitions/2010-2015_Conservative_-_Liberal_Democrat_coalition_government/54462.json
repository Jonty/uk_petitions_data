        "additional_details": "As detailed on the Ofqual website (http://ofqual.gov.uk/news/changes-to-gcse-english-and-english-language/), a change to the English and English Language GCSEs that severely devalues coursework and completely eradicates the Speaking and Listening mark as part of the GCSE grading is to made with immediate effect. This move will affect current Year 10 students, most of whom will have taken the affected portions of the GCSE already.\r\n\r\nThe first line of Ofqual's \"About Us\" section on their website says the following:\r\n\r\n\"It\u2019s our job to maintain standards and confidence in qualifications\"\r\n\r\nHow can Ofqual possibly be maintaining standards and confidence when they are pulling the rug out from underneath the feet of hard-working students who have entered an examination period with one set of rules and left with another? I petition the Department for Education to delay or revert these changes with immediate effect.",
