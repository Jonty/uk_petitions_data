        "additional_details": "In their 2010 manifesto, the Liberal Democrats had a policy to pass an Education Freedom Act, which promised to prevent politicians from getting involved in the day-to-day running of schools. We respectfully request that an Education Freedom Act is passed in the first possible instance, and that the executive is replaced by a democratically accountable professional body, elected by teachers and the wider educational community. This would allow education policy decisions to be based on 10-year plans, rather than being tied into the short-term pressures of the 5-year electoral cycle.",
