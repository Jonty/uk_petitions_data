Why? my awesome family run off-licence and many other small businesses will suffer.... It will also stop the Precinct Theatre from operating.. an important resource for young people.\r\n\r\nThis application (# P112904) will be heard on the 26th July 7.30 pm... so sign and come along to show your support!!",
