They went as ordered, expecting that their employer  held up their part of the contract,  of care for them, should they need it,   they did and their employers are not!!!\r\n'How loud do these PTSD victims have to shout before they are heard, let us all add our shouts  to theirs to ensure those who are responsible cannot fail to hear!!\r\nDo not fail these brave heroes they did not fail you!\r\nWe cannot, we must not , we will not allow this to continue.\r\nENOUGH  IS ENOUGH!!!!!'\r\nDO SOMETHING  NOW!!!\r\n",
