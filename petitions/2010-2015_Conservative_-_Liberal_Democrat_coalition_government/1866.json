This prevents social integration and results in insular communities in inner city areas. Many of these people do not seek to learn English due to cost or availability of teaching resources. With increasing numbers of people taking TEFL courses (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) to allow them to work overseas, it should become a requirement for these course providers to educate non-English speaking communities as part of the training programs.\r\n",
