This attitude can only be changed in the same way that to drink-driving was. An instant 12-points penalty will enforce the law that all other methods have singularly failed to do.\r\n[The constant disregard of these laws by some drivers/riders is rooted in the same disrespect for all  other citizens as was the recent street rioting.]",
