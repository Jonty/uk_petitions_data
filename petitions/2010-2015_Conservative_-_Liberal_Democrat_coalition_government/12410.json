        "additional_details": "It is practically impossible to sack those in public service who fall below the high standards of performance that tax payers expect them to meet. Particularly in the NHS, scandal has followed scandal, but was anyone sacked? A significant disincentive to poor performance will be to put them all, including the entire hierarchy of management, on a rolling 1 year contract, renewable subject to work performance, but without any payouts on termination, which renewal will be at the sole discretion of the Service.  Their failure to perform satisfactorily is wasting taxpayers hard earned money, as well as costing some lives, and that cannot be tolerated any longer.",
