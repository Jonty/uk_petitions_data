        "additional_details": "I propose that the requirement to renew a Statutory off road notification (SORN) is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the requirement to apply for SORN every year is unnecessary and appears to be simply a method of generating revenue from those who simply want to store their own vehicles for their own future use. At the point when the vehicle is taken off the road the vehicle should be declared SORN. - At this point no further correspondence should be necessary until the vehicle is re-taxed or declared scrapped.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to forget about a motorcycle or car that has been tucked away in a shed. - It should be assumed that the car or motorcycle is still SORNed unless otherwise notified.\r\nPlease take the time to sign my petition if you agree with my view.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\nDoug Stacey\r\n",
