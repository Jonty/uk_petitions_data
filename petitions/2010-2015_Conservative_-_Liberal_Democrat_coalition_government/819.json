        "additional_details": "This is a plea for the Government to change what will be put in place from November 2011. The Government are going to implement a change that will ruin peoples lives if they can not access the services that they already have access to at mind if they do not have a CPN. My mother is one of those people, she is not entitled to a CPN because she has not tried to take her life and because of mind she has been on the slow road to recovery after her breakdown but still needs the support. If that is taken away from her then she will be back to where she has started and the risk of her taking her life will be greater. What happened to prevention being better than cure?\r\n\r\nPlease if you are one of these people like my mother or have a family member in the same boat sign this petition and together we can help people change and save lives",
