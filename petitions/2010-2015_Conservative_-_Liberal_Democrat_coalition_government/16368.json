        "additional_details": "As England is the only constituent country in the UK that doesn't have a form of democratic devolution, it is time for the west lothian question to be addressed. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have democratically elected tiers of government that represents a voice for that part of the UK, and ensures the people within their constituent countries get issues raised and addressed for their people. England has no such body. The scottish, northern irish and welsh people all see free prescriptions and better educational support because of their representative governing bodies, don't you think it's time for England to have an equal say and have the same opportunities as the rest of the UK?",
