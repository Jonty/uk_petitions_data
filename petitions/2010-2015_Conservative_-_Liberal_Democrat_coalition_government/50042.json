        "action": "Create a Standard of Value for the Monetary system",
        "additional_details": "The gold standard restricted money supply and served as a stabilising influence. We want the UK government to create a monetary system where banknotes represent value of physical precious metal assets held by the Bank of England - Gold, Silver and Copper, and coinage  made from those metals.\r\nThe different values of these three metals will mean a greater spread of denomination allowing easier exchange and trade than if the gold standard alone was used.\r\n\r\nIf enough people sign this petition this will lead to debate and awareness of what the best system is to help stabilise the economy.\r\n\r\nWe need to achieve 100,000 signatures in time for 4 September 2013 to coincide with USA goldstandard2013.org petition",
