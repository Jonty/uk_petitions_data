The people who work for them just don't help at all and their signal is very very poor all over the country and that is unacceptable considering what we pay. Everytime someone complains to them all they ever say is \"send me your postcode and we'll let you know\" and they search the ppstcode and every single time they say \"there's a mast down but it won't be fixed for a while'. This is completely unacceptable consindering many people pay over \u00a315 a month and they can not use the service. Also if someone wants to cancel a contract it can take up to 10 different phone calls for them to  eventually cancel the contract which is also unacceptable. Something really needs to be done to make sure they listen!",
