        "additional_details": "Due to the legislation in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, any persons that enter police custody or the courts systems are entitles to fee legal advice. Alhough this is appropiate for law abiding citizens that may be out of work, why should the tax payer pay for legal advice for people tha are infront of the courts or arrested week after week. The government should change the law so that if persistent offenders would like legal advice they should have to pay towards it or the money claimed back through sentencing.",
