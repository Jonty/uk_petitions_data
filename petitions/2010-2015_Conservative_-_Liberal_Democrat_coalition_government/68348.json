        "additional_details": "Planning permission is sought to build 160 homes on the land near Walshes manor/road. The land currently farm land, has established hedgerows and a diverse range of wildlife including dormice, badgers, bats, great crested newts and reptiles. All protected in the UK.\r\nCrowborough is already losing many of its green spaces, and I am calling for the government to stop the unnecessary building on this site when there are brown sites available close by which can be developed and will not have a wide impact on the wildlife, environment, and which already has the right infrastructure to handle such development.\r\nClose to the land is a site of archeological interest.\r\nThe development would also cause a considerable amount of traffic flow to an area already suffering from a high volume of traffic ( Western road) down a narrow road causing an array of problems, and the small narrow country lanes surrounding the area will also be affected. Many of the lanes are single lanes without footpaths.\r\n",
