        "additional_details": "Politicians have recommended that all Primary schools should teach sex education from the age of 5. In the same breath they suggest that children should be protected from sexualisation. ALL the evidence shows that increased sex education increases the teenage pregnancy rates, STD rates and exposes children to harmful effects such as online Porn. Children now share nude photos with each other and child sex attacks are also on the increase. Parents should be the ones to teach their children these things not schools. ",
