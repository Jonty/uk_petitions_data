        "additional_details": "If a claimant in the 'small claims track' wins his case it is usual for the defendant to be ordered to pay the claimants court fees.\r\n\r\nIf the same claimant has had his fees waived by using form ex160 then the defendant gets 'off' the fees even thoug he may be perfectly able to afford them.\r\n\r\nThe ex160 is there to help those who can not afford access to justice, get justice.\r\n\r\nIt is not there to get a reduction in penalty for those who are financialy secure.\r\n\r\nI propose that judges be enabled to make an order that losing defendants are to pay an amount equal to the waived fees into the court.  To protect the claimant, such fees should be secondary to the main order.",
