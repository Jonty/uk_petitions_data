        "additional_details": "The cost of car insurance for young adults is prohibitively high meaning, I suspect, that many young adults are either uninsured or insured as a named driver rather than the main driver.\r\n\r\nI would like Government to put a cap on insurance premiums for young drivers, funded by a pool of money that all insurers would be required to subscribe to. I understand a similar system operates very well in Australia.",
