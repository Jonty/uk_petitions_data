The Police have little or no effect on them. We spend millions on the Police getting these people under control and off the streets. I would like to see the introduction of heavy fines for such behaviour. I suggest \u00a31000  fines for fighting in a public place while under the influence of alcohol. I further suggest that any hospitalisation due to the self inflicted effects of alcohol be charged by the hospital that treats them or there victims.",
