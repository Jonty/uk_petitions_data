This should mean a person who kills another serves at least ten years in jail.\r\n\r\nThis should apply to Murder, manslaughter, causing death while driving, causing death by wilful neglicence and any other legal responsibility for causing death.\r\n\r\nBeing under the influence of alcohol or any illegal drug should not be regarded as a mitigating circumstance.\r\n\r\nThis aims to prevent situations like the recent case of a man who killed another by punching him to the ground only got a four year sentence because he was chargrd with manslaughter.
