        "additional_details": "Guinea pigs - Most people don't know, is that the breeding of guinea pigs can result in their death. 20% (1 in 5) sows die giving birth, and sometimes their pups do too.\r\nThere are hundreds of unwanted guinea pigs in rescue centres across the country, desperate for homes.\r\nOne gene (roan allele) can even produce 'lethal' pups, baby guinea pigs that will likely not make it even a few months, are usually blind and/or deaf, and have deformed molars, making them unable to eat.\r\nBreeders need to be educated to these facts and continue to condemn multiple sows to death, and hundreds of rescue centre pigs to a life without a home.\r\nThis petition is aiming to make intentional Breeders, whether for profit or as hobbyists (as opposed to accidental breeding) to be licenced, with fines for breeding from recognised defective gene mixes and custodial sentences for breaching the animal rights act 2006.",
