        "additional_details": "At present Credit Card and Loan APR is set too high. Often a 0% offer is followed up with a 25% + APR after it runs out.  That could mean a bill from \u00a370 to \u00a3300+ over night.  I would like to see APR be capped at 13% APR on any loan or credit card.  It would allow individuals to at least afford to pay back their debut and at the same time the banks can still make a profit.",
