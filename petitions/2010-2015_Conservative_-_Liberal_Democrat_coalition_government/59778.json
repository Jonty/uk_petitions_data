        "additional_details": "Although there is some political concern at the steady decline in voter apathy in Britain, there has no attempt to address same.\r\nEveryone has a right to vote and thus there should be a veto vote for those that think parties need to rethink their manifest and policies. Should there not be a vote for the majority who think that policies need serious change? In surveys one in ten say they won\u2019t vote on principal. This applies across our universities.\r\nThe veto vote would democratically send a message to politicians and political parties and enhance democracy. It is not democratic for a party to be elected where those that voted did so merely out of loyalty or habit and the majority don\u2019t vote at all.\r\nVoter apathy/ anger has been resultant of policies that do not encompass popular opinion such as the aversion to Britain getting involved in wars following the US lead. The foreign office and government need to promote democracy rather than the aggression we cant afford.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
