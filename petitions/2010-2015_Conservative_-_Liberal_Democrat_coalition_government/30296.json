To date that has not happened. I don't think that the 25 year rule should be brought back, I believe it should be at least 30 year old vehicles.  There must be hundreds of vehicles, SORN Class, that never see the roads because of the enormous cost of looking after our Heritage Vehicles. It must cost the Government quite an amount of money and time, taxing a vehicle for six month and then having to reimburse the the owner after 3 months.",
