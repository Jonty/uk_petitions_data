        "additional_details": "In an age where saving and investment is more important than ever, the petition calls on the government to abolish the punitive 0.5% tax on buying shares. Few other countries have such a tax and where they do it is invariably at a lower rate. It also wrongly penalise investors, when more speculative Contracts for Difference and Spread Betting do not attract such a tax. Removing stamp duty would see be revenue beneficial to the government by encouraging more saving and investment in the UK.",
