This is justly unfair to hundreds of men and women who have to deal with not only the shock of finding out that their husbands/wives are gay but, knowing they will have to make up another reason why the divorce is needed.\r\n\r\nRightly so the gay community have the same rights as anyone else but, that should also allow their partners to be able to divorce them for same sex affairs.
