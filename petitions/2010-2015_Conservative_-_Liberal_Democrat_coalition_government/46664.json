        "additional_details": "St Patricks Day has been a bank holiday in Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland for about 100 years, A few years ago St Andrews Day was made a bank holiday in Scotland. It is obviously unfair that the Welsh should not be given an opportunity to celebrate their patron saint on 1 March. Wales gets only 8 bank holidays a year, fewer than most European countries. There are also many celebrations that happen throughout Wales in Particular the National St David's Day Parade in Cardiff which many people have missed out on because of work especially School Staff who are bound by Term Time Contracts and therefore miss the Parade every year. We call on the government to make St. David's Day a bank holiday in Wales so then everyone can Celebrate our Patron Saints Day properly with Pride by joining in the real celebrations around Wales.",
