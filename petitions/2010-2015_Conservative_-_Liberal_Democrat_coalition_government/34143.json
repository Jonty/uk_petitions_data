        "additional_details": "In these times of austerity and real financial hardship, maintaining the royal family is an additional burden that the citizens of the UK should not have to pay for. There are hidden costs associated with having a monarchy. For example,the very heavy police security that we, the taxpayer, has to pay for, along with their additional transport costs. For example, why should the tax payer have to incur the high cost of  police security for the Duke of York's games of golf, and the associated transport costs? Also, the considerable expense of maintaining all the royal family's various palaces and houses should not be met by the taxpayer.",
