For example 90% of school leavers to be above level 2 literacy in 10 years time.\r\n\r\nIf the policy is successful the minister and team involved all receive very large bonuses, even if they have since left office.\r\n\r\nIf the policy is unsuccessful they receive nothing and the results are publicly available.\r\n\r\nThis policy will encourage ministers to look beyond the next election. The policy will also help to ensure that ministers are only rewarded when they succeed.\r\n\r\nThe best and brightest people with genuine ideas to improve people's lives will be encouraged to be part of government by the large bonuses. People who desire power and influence without having any good ideas will be discouraged by the low basic salary.",
