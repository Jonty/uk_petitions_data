The comments cannot be undone by making a simple apology afterwards, particularly if this is not the first time it has happened.  The BBC seems to take an inconsistent approach depending on who makes the comments - Jeremy Clarkson should be treated in the same way as Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand.",
