Organisers of the Virgin London Marathon are refusing to give Clare a medal, as she won't finish within 24 hours - a newly introduced rule.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask that the rules be relaxed in certain circumstances in order that disabled people have equal right to not only finish the marathon, but to receive a finishers medal.",
