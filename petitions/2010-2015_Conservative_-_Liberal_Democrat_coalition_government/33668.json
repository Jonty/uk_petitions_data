No longer a society with secrets -esoteric- only inteligable to the initiated.  If they become open and have nothing to hide in an illegal way, it would be a more progresive 21st Century understanding.  They should have to declare themselves in any public position, Government, Army, Navy, Airforce, Religion, Judges, Royal Family, Police, business, Fire Brigade, NHS, & Ambasadors from other countries.
