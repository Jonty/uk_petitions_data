All dogs can be potentially dangerous.A badly behaved dog in a public place can spoil recreational activities in the counrtyside, public parks or beaches.\r\nThe following statistics are on the DEFRA site,\r\n\"In England in 2008/09, there were over 5,000 hospital admissions resulting from being bitten or struck by a dog (excludes people treated in minor injury units (MIU) or accident and emergency (A&E)\"\r\n\"In 2009, dog attacks on people in England cost the Health Service \u00a33.3 million.\"\r\nI would like the government to consider making it an offence for a dog not to be muzzled in a public place.\r\nBy reducing attacks on people and other animals money will be saved by the NHS treating injuries. Investigation costs by local authorities would also be reduced.\r\nThis simple measure is a common sense approach to improving the enjoyment of people in public and reducing the worry associated with badly behaved dogs and irresponsible dog owners.",
