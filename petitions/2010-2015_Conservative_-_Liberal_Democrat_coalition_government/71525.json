        "additional_details": "I propose that the possession and personal use of cannabis be legalised, whilst supplying, trafficking or producing cannabis remains illegal.\r\nQuite often, people who use drugs like cannabis do so because they are depressed or are trying to cope with an issue in their life.\r\nIn 2000, Portugal reformed their justice system so that drug crime became a health issue rather than a justice issue. Please see: http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/reports/drug-policy-portugal-benefits-decriminalizing-drug-use\r\nThe approach and attitude we have to drugs now, is one that is quite simply not effective. Counsellors will explain that, a 'tough love' attitude does not work. Despite this, our legal system is one that promotes the idea of 'tough love'. This quite simply is not effective. This attitude may cost lives, where people overdose because they aren't receiving the help they need, and won't seek it because they are afraid of being admonished and punished for their use of illegal substances.",
