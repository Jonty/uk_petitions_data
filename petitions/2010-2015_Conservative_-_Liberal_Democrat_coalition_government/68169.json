        "additional_details": "End government ban on rehabilitation of offenders.The rule of law states court sentences are the only lawful punishment for crime s committed. Government subverts  law by empowering government and regulatory organisations to refuse employment or permit membership of professional bodies to anyone with a criminal record.  Convicts are effectively given life sentences of economic exclusion from our capitalist economy. Policies preventing rehabilitation create a burden for tax payers maintaining  6 000 000 convicts on benefits. Their economic exclusion from society is unlawful. This must end. Let teachers doctors nurses and others  presently subject to  criminal record  checks and inability to register with their professional regulatory bodies thereby excluding them from their workplace go back to their careers .Crimes committed in the community have no relevance to the work place and should not result in un employability of the offender.
