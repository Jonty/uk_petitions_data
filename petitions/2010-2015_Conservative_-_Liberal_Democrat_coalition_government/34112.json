        "additional_details": "I would like the law changed to allow the Police to use a carrot and stick approach to good and bad driving. The stick is to allow the confiscation of the vehicles of drivers convicted of dangerous or drunk driving. The carrot is to give a percentage of these vehicles away in a monthly prize draw to drivers who local traffic police have noted for particularly safe and considerate driving. This gives a heavy financial penalty for those putting others and risk and gives a strong incentive to other drivers to concentrate on their driving skills and attitude to other road users. The scheme could be administered and publicised at a local level and little or no cost by the traffic police in conjunction with the driving standards agency.",
