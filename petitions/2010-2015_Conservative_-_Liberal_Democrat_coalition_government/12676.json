        "additional_details": "To eradicate the benefit culture in the UK, the government should take into consideration what taxes people and their families have paid into the system in past. There should not be generations of families that have and always will rely on benefits. Benefits were established to help people that want to work etc but due to circumstances beyond their control (such as the current recession) are not able to get work. I think the fact that builders and tradesmen that were self employed and have paid taxes all along and are not entitled to benefits because they were self employed is appalling. These people went out to work everyday and are now entitled to very little help when there is no work in construction, yet other people and families that have never worked a day in their life and have never contributed to the system are entitled to a lot more. Please can we make things fair for the  hard working families that have always worked hard and paid their taxes. ",
