        "additional_details": "In the UK there are 1000s of products that contain ingredients that are banned in the EU countries that are being sold freely here in the UK.\r\nOne such example is Food colour E133 (Brilliant Blue FCF, FD&C Blue 1). This is found in tinned processed peas, dairy products, sweets and drinks, and is banned in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Long term consumption of products containing such synthetic colours, and other additives leads to diseases related to heart, kidney, liver, lungs and stomach, and many forms of cancer which is very high in the UK.\r\n\r\nGovernment should ban the shops and food stores from selling such products.  Tests should be conducted on food samples taken randomly. Strict penalties should be imposed on the guilty.\r\n",
