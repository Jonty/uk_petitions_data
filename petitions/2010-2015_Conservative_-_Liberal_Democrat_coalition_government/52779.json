It should apply across all MPs and departments.\r\nBy making misleading statements, e.g, on the use of Universal Job Match (there is no data to prove how useful it is) and generally on the unemployed (there is a vast exaggeration of their impact on the welfare bill etc) IDS is victimising the unemployed and creating divisions that help to get support for policy by misleading the public.\r\nAll policy should be flexible and evidence based, and requires MPs to listen and to respond to problems so that money is not wasted (e.g. on the UJM system).\r\nIf MPs are prepared to ignore data to get their policies through they are bad MPs and bad policies. Misleading and misrepresenting data should be a sackable offense. There should be a clear and unequivocal guidelines developed for this. http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2013/may/09/iain-duncan-smith-benefits-cap-statistics\r\n",
