        "additional_details": "I would like the government to ban local councils from ruining major transport routes by introducing unnecessary and unwanted traffic calming schemes and lane reductions.  This is stopping people getting to work on time, so that they can earn money to pay taxes and keep the economy going, then stopping them getting home again at a reasonable time.\r\nSalford City Council has broken British law and should be prosecuted. They should have consulted ALL people affected by their drastic lane reduction and traffic calming obstacles on the A6, not just some people living in Salford.  They FAILED to do this.  Their money wasting scheme has reduced traffic on a major A road to a crawl in morning and evening rush hours, making workers spend several extra hours a week trying to get to work on time and home again.  It has vastly increased congestion on roads in the surrounding area including housing estates and near local schools, caused near misses and road rage.  ",
