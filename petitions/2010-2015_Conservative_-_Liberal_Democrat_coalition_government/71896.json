        "additional_details": "All signatories of this petition will vote against David Cameron's re-election as Prime Minister for his continued support of the badger cull, which according to leading scientists has failed for the second year in succession.\r\nThe Coalition has wilfully selected science in order to justify the badger culls despite public and scientific opposition both in terms of humanness and effectiveness in terms of eradicating BTB.\r\nDEFRA research carried out to justify the present cull policy shows that 9 continuous years of badger culls in one area will at best reduce the incidence of BTB in cattle by 12-16%\r\nWe urge the Prime Minister to think very carefully about tackling this disease by looking at improved and annual testing measures and investment in bio-security.\r\n",
