I could cope with some bias if the analysis was considered and balanced enough. Unfortunately, it's not the case. The commentary team can not even get the basics right e.g.  during the Eng v Sco game \"when was the last time Johnny Wilkinson missed three penalties\" .. answer, just three weeks earlier against Argentina !",
