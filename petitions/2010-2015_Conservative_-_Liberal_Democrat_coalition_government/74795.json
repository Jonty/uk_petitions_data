HG is a pregnancy condition which often goes undiagnosed and untreated.\r\n\r\nTreatment for pregnant women would reduce abortions and repeated hospital admissions for moderate to severe cases.\r\n\r\n30% of all hospital admissions under 20 weeks are for HG yet actual diagnosis figures do not reflect this.",
