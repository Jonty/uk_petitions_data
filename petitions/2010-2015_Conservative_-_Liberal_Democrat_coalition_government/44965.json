        "additional_details": "Our major roads network is bad enough but when snow strikes there is chaos and the country grinds to a halt. As well as causing misery for commuters the UK economy is badly affected due to lost production and schools close causing child care problems and lost learning time.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the government looked at new technology rather than relying on gritting and snow ploughs. If our major roads could be heated in some way just like football pitches then snow would melt and traffic would flow freely. Technology already exists for this to happen and I propose that trials are done to see if this is will work.\r\n\r\nThis could form part of a major infrastructure investment, and create jobs, as well as solving our shambolic response to winter weather. In addition, road accidents may be avoided and lives saved.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to get the heated roads trial started !",
