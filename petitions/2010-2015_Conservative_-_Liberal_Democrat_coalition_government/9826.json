        "additional_details": "For centuries Britain was one of the most committed nations in the exploration of our planet. Sending it's sailors to all four corners of the globe and setting the foundations for the largest empire the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\nToday Britain has taken a back seat in terms of exploration and no longer seems to have that hunger to commit itself to explore. With nations such as China, Brazil & India all having ambitions to explore space I think we need to look again at where we want to be next to these other nations.\r\n\r\nI think we need a manned space program to put Britain back on the map again. It will inspire the young as well as provide jobs to British industry who can all be part of this new ambition.",
