Then why should we pay \u00a3145.50 for a year's licence?\r\n\r\nEven UK Government ruled on some countries in the past and some of them are still under british rule even those countries are TV Licence free? why\r\n\r\nWhy not here in UK?\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to get rid of that legislation.\r\n  ",
