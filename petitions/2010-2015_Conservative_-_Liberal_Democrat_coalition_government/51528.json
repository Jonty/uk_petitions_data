        "additional_details": "We believe that the scrapping of the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) was a grave error. EMA allowed students from some of the poorest families to access Further Education, and its abolition has had a hugely detrimental impact, hitting young women and Black students particularly hard.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the government should reinstate EMA, which would require only a modest investment to broaden access to education and benefit the economy as a whole.
