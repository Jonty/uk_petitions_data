        "additional_details": "It is clear that supermarkets and other food companies cannot properly budget the amount of product they need to meet customer demand and therefore overproduce massively. However something must be done.\r\nWe need to hit massive companies where it honestly hurts and introduce bigger fines for every 100kg of foodwaste produced in a week, this would provide more of an incentive to either set up food donations with charities either when the food is wasted or before it's put on the shelf. Any reduction in waste will still be hugely beneficial for the environment. It's about time we became a bit more honest with ourselves.",
