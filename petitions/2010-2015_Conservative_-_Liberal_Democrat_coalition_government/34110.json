        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, hereby petition the government to pass legislation to make using a public highway without high visibility clothing by cyclists, horse riders and horse drawn carriages an illegal offence.\r\n\r\nThe Highway Code states that horse riders should wear light-coloured or fluorescent clothing in daylight and reflective clothing if riding at night or in poor visibility. It also states cyclists should wear light-coloured or fluorescent clothing in daylight and poor light, and reflective clothing and/or accessories (belt, arm or ankle bands) in the dark. We the undersigned would like to see, at minimum, the above made compulsory by law.\r\n\r\nA minimum legal standard for the amount and type of high visibility clothing required at all times, would increase visibility of the above vulnerable road users and therefore improve road safety. A constant standard for all hours of day would have clarity and no risk of vulnerable road users getting caught out by dusky conditions.\r\n",
