        "additional_details": "Currently the signing rules with Jobcentre require applicants to search for and accept any appropriate job within 90 minutes' travel. Many citizens who are willing to work find that they cannot apply or easily commute to such venues without the ability to drive. This can be due to constraints on public transport (e.g. no buses on the night shift), which would not be a problem if the applicant could drive.\r\n\r\nI believe that the chance to get a tuition fee loan towards an initial driver's license would help people nationwide to get back to work, as well as give better access to local amenities to support their household. There are loans for most other kinds of adult study, so it makes sense to raise accessibility to the roads for anyone who would be fit to drive, regardless of financial background. I would like to see the government introduce a fee loan towards qualification for all road vehicles, repayable only if a license is eventually obtained.",
