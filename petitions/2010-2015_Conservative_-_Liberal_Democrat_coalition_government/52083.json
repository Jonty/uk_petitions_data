This is false - the laws are decades old, not fit for purpose and should be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe Government should propose new legislation, in consultation with industry and human rights groups, amending the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to provide strong, clear protections to the privacy of ordinary UK citizens.\r\n\r\nSuch legislation should make it clear that interception and storage of communications without specific sanction by an independent panel of judges is illegal in all circumstances and regardless of the medium of communication.\r\n\r\nThe new legislation should include strong criminal sanctions for those who intercept, store or process communications in violation of the legislation (including those intercepted by the intelligence agencies of other governments or third parties).",
