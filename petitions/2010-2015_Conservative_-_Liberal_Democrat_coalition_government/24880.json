        "additional_details": "The driving test is prohibitively expensive, there are one million young people unemployed and the cost of learning to drive is already expensive.\r\n\r\nCharging \u00a331 and \u00a362 respectively is unreasonable in this economic climate, retests for the practical part of the test cost a mere $10 USD in New York, USA.\r\n\r\nConsidering the inequality of driving test centre pass rates something should be done to help people. Many jobs will not consider applicants without a full driving license.\r\n\r\nI propose that arbitrary 18 month time limits on the theory test be abolished. And that retests should be discounted for people who fail the first time. Additional support should be available to the unemployed as it will help them get back to work.",
