        "additional_details": "The people of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth should be allowed to have a referendum on whether we should intervene militarily abroad before our government decides to do it without the support of the people. This issue should be debated in Parliament because we should be living in democractic society and this means we should have control over our own destiny. Hopefully the debate may inspire the government to pass a bill regarding this issue.",
