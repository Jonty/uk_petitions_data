I believe they could be put to good use and then they would quite literally pay for there crimes.\r\n\r\nThe fact is the criminal population will only grow since there is a depression/recession in play.\r\n\r\nSo this would help to pay for the criminal justice system.\r\n\r\nNot only that physical exercise would be good for the prisoners and it would give them a sense of purpose.\r\n\r\nOf course there would be a exception to some of the people who could work as a convict laborer, such as the disabled. You would go into further detail as to who could and could not go into convict labor.\r\n",
