        "additional_details": "Currently there is ongoing debate and controversy about the possibilty of a HS2 line being constructed, which, if it is ever built, will take many years to complete, be extremely costly, and inevitably cause environmental disruption. Meanwhile, the Midland Main Line, linking Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham and Leicester, 4 of England's major cities, with London, remains non-electrified north of Bedford. It must be one of the few main lines in Europe still reliant solely on smoky diesel trains, which can only reach a certain speed. Electrification and upgrading of the existing line would surely be a far quicker process, cost considerably less, and can have only a positive environmental impact.",
