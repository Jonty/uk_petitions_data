        "additional_details": "Scores of youth workers could face redundancy and youth clubs could close under Wiltshire Council plans to save \u00a3500,000 from its budget.\r\n\r\nOfficers for union Unite say they have seen documents that outline four proposals for change to youth workers at the meetings. There will then be a consultation period which will end on April 22 when the Wiltshire Council cabinet will make a decision.\r\n\r\nIn the worst case scenario the union says all 144 members of staff would be made redundant and 24 youth centres would close.\r\n\r\nWe need to act now. A decision will be made by Wiltshire Council on 22nd April 2014, if you want your local youth centre to remain without cuts then please sign this petition.\r\n\r\nYoung People need youth centres and youth workers always will.\r\n\r\nSAVE WILTSHIRE YOUTH SERVICES",
