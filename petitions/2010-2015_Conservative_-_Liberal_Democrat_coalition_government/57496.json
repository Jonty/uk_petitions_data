        "additional_details": "Melbury Vale Farm is a family home and multi-functional 28-acre specialist farm in Dorset.  Tourists, locals, and many groups, including the Scouts, use it.  It offers English Native Woodland, regenerated with much love and care by the current owners, Wildlife, an Alpaca sanctuary, Horse livery, A vineyard, producing award-winning wine, Archery/paintball/zip wire, Camping/facilities/holiday let, and a Christmas Tree Farm.\r\n\r\nAccording to DEFRA: \"The government believes that we need to protect the environment for future generations, make our economy more environmentally sustainable, and improve our quality of life and well-being. We also believe that much more needs to be done to support the farming industry, protect biodiversity and encourage sustainable food production.\"\r\n\r\nOne would imagine it safely on the map, however, after ten years investing in the Farm, the owners are facing eviction.  We urge the Government to step in and protect this much-loved local resource.",
