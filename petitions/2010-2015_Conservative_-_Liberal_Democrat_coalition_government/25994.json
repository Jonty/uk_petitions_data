        "additional_details": "Politicians are lying when they say banning all donations would necessitate parties being funded by the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nWhy can't they fund themselves?\r\n\r\nThe Labour party has c.190,000 members paying fees of at least \u00a32million per 5 year election cycle. The Tories have even more money. How much does it cost to create a website with their policies on it? What is the rest of the money is used for? propaganda and to drown out the voices of smaller parties/individuals.\r\n\r\nCurrently, most donations are given to the only 2 parties that have a chance of forming the government. Forcing parties to spend according to their means, i.e. income from their membership fees (which should also be limited to, for example, \u00a310), would mean party funding would be more proportionate to membership/popularity and allow other parties to challenge the big 2, or at least keep them on their toes: what would we say if we only had 2 supermarkets to choose from? or 2 banks? or 2 utility suppliers?",
