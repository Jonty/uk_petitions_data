        "additional_details": " Mental health issues do not just exist during the day in the working week, they're around 24/7. This being said, I believe that there should be some form of out of hours mental health care accessible to everyone, not just those already being treated and not just one age, because for many when they reach the breaking point where it is crucial they receive help they aren't getting any. What I'm suggesting is not a whole new service, but maybe a few drop in centres at sites already dedicated to mental health services that have trained staff who can exist people whatever the time of day. This would then mean that people could get one on one sessions, even just short ones, where they discuss the issue and how they're feeling and then the professional can decided what is best, whether it is to be kept under a close eye by family or to be admitted.",
