        "additional_details": "As you may know there are two GCSE exam tiers.\r\n\r\nThe first is Higher Tier where your highest possible grade is an A*. Now that's all well and good but with the second which is Foundation Tier the highest grade that in the exams is C (there may be some exceptions).\r\n\r\nI think this is unfair because this C can be harder to achieve than the higher tier C as it requires getting an above average mark, which can lead employers to misunderstand what the potential employee is capable of and dismiss their application instantly even if in reality they did really well in foundation exams.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we should have it so that people who take the foundation tier can get an A and the higher tier grades have a * at the end (A*,B*) to show that they have done a more challenging exam or anything else that properly shows the achievements of foundation students.\r\n",
