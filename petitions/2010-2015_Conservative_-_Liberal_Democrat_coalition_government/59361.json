        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to help save the local ambulance service to England's most remote area - Alston Moor, Cumbria.\r\n\r\nWe have had a fantastic local ambulance for 50 years and now our Ambulance Trust - North West Ambulance wants us just to be served by first responders.\r\n\r\nAn ambulance takes at least 50 minutes to get to the area if there are no hold ups and if an ambulance is available. Most often it is over an hour, sometime two hours. Our local ambulance can arrive within 15 mins. But NWAS is slashing it.\r\n\r\nWE NEED OUR AMBULANCE!! Please support this petition.",
