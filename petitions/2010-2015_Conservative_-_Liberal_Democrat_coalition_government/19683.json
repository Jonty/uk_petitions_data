Anyone who would have looked after your child has to go through expensive certification, even grandparents.  This forces families to operate on single salaries, effectively guaranteeing childhood poverty.\r\n\r\nAdd a free day care facility to every infants school and don't bother with all the fiddly subsidies.",
