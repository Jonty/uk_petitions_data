        "additional_details": "As a 16 year old A-level politics student, the thought of the vote for 16 and 17 year old children frightens me. There is not enough education on politics in secondary schools. I know 16 year old boys who think we are in a coalition with Labour and not Liberal Democrats. Even the most basic of political knowledge is lacking. How can these young people get the vote when they don't know what they are voting for. Basic political education should be introduced from years 7-11 to ensure maximum political awareness even if the vote for 16 and 17 year olds is not introduced.",
