        "action": "Introduce a comprehensive 21st Century National Service Scheme based on Military/Civil & Community/Environmental Project work streams.",
        "additional_details": "I would propose that the Government examine the introduction of a National Service Scheme which would require individuals in their mid teens/early twenties to undertake for a period of say 18-24 months, some kind of Military/Civil/Environmental work for the benefit of the State and for their own personal and professional development. It should be possible for participants to gain meaningful qualifications as appropriate under each scheme. In this way, young people would develop a better sense of social responsibility and sense of citizenship and that society would benefit more widely and it might just deal with so called \u2018gang\u2019 culture. Further benefits would be better provision of comprehensive services to local communities, training of transferable skills into employment, the provision of military trained and disciplined individuals and a more cohesive environmental strategy valued by all stakeholders in society.\r\n",
