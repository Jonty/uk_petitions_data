At such a low rate there would be little for fund managers and other financiers to complain about.\r\n\r\nIndividual investors should be exempt from this proposed new tax where their collective annual transactions amount to \u00a3100,000 or less.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services_industry_of_the_United_Kingdom\r\n\r\n",
