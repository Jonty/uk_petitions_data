        "additional_details": "In this day and age of energy efficiency and trying to save costs, after a certain hour (to be decided) can every other street light be turned off in certain areas. For example we live in a quiet cul de sac that currently has 7 street lights. When people have returned from work and the road quietens half of these lights could be extinguished. This could be put into action on relevant streets throughout the UK, saving money and valuable energy resources.",
