        "additional_details": "British Summer time (BST) is kept an hour head of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) in the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October, all changes taking place at 01.00 GMT. GMT is regarded as daylight saving (giving more daylight during waking hours) in the winter, so why not continue to use GMT in the summer. In the summer there is often enough sunlight in UK from 5am (0400 GMT) onwards till about 8pm (1900 GMT), so it is unnecessary to keep BST ahead by 1 hour. Keeping to GMT all year round meant that there is still daylight in the summer between 4am till 7pm GMT. The advantage of keeping GMT all year round is that there is no need to expand effort & resources in altering clocks by an hour twice every year and less confusion about adding one hour at 1am GMT on last Sunday in March and subtracting one hour every last Sunday of October at 2am BST .This will also be confusing to others in the internationally community, as well as to animals.",
