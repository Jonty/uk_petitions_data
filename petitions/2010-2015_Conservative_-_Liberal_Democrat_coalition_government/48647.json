Why should someone who kills a human (an animal) get 20 years in prison when killing an animal only gets you 6 months?\r\nThe Conservative Party prides itself on being the party that is \"tough on crime\" but from what I can see it is abhorrently weak. The RSPCA are also a joke. When provided with video evidence, they refuse to act on animal cruelty which can blatantly be seen.\r\nAn example of why the law needs to be changed is this: http://robertlindsay.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/arab-throws-a-dog-off-a-building/\r\nI'm aware this wasn't in our country but there are videos out there based in the UK.\r\nWhy does the Government allow this sort of behaviour and find it acceptable to impose a minuscule of a sentence?\r\nIf the UK prides itself on democracy, freedom and justice, then surely the government will do the right thing and impose a tough, new law on anyone who is seen to be committing animal cruelty.",
