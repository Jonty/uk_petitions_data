This is completely stupid if it is going to be 1 person living in the home to afford WITHOUT some sort of financial help.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see is a tiered system for rental prices.\r\nIt'll be manageable for 1 person either living in a studio or 1 bed property (less than \u00a3500 preferably)\r\n\r\nBetween \u00a3500 and \u00a3700 for a 2 bedroom property (depending on whether it is a family or roommates)\r\nI bring this up as 2 of my friends are in a 1 bed have just had their 2nd kid (both were surprise ones) and the local council has pretty much turned round and said sorry, can't help you.\r\nThere is also my cousin who is single with 4 kids in a 2 bed and her council won't help unless she was with a partner with 1 less kid.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and maybe Landlords and Landladies won't be greedy pigs and more people won't be going in debt and arrears over their Rental payments.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
