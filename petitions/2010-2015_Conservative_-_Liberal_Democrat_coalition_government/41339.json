        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the DECC Minister Ed Davey to \u201cDash for Gas!\u201d in the Energy Bill.\r\n\u201cBritain is sitting on a \u00a31.5 trillion shale gas goldmine\u201d, which will help us achieve energy security, get bills down, create jobs and save the British countryside from windfarms.\r\n\r\nClimate legislation, windfarms and carbon taxes have increased fuel poverty - hurting 7 million families. Thousands of businesses in key industries are now uncompetitive due to skyrocketing energy bills.  This is unacceptable.\r\n\r\nRight now plans are being drawn up in the Energy Bill for shale gas exploration and dozens of new clean and cheap gas power stations in the UK, and we support this action. We want an Energy Bill based on \u2018too cheap to meter\u2019 energy.\r\n\r\nHelp us dash for gas! Support Repeal the Act campaign.\r\n",
