        "additional_details": "Over 70% of the membership of the combined British leagues football teams are foreigners.  This places us at a huge disadvantage when international matches are involved because only 30% of the nations footballers are eligible to play for the nation.  It also means that MONUMENTALLY HUGE amounts of money are being taken out of the country by foreigners who have no loyalty to the fans who are being ripped off to pay these people.  The law MUST be changed so that foreign players are removed and banned from our football teams.",
