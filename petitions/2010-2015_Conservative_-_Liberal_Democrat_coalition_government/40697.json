        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to promote the Olympic legacy by closing Richmond Park to motor vehicles on Sundays, on the following grounds:\r\n\u2022\t2012 was an unprecedented year for British cycling. After watching the Olympic road races navigate London and the Surrey Hills many people have been inspired to get out on their bikes. This increase in participation can only be maintained if there are suitable and safe venues in which to cycle.\r\n\u2022\tTwo-thirds of people surveyed said they felt no benefit from London hosting the Olympics and Paralympics. This would bring the Olympic legacy to the widest possible audience.\r\n\u2022\tRichmond Park is a National Nature Reserve, an SSSI and a Grade 1 Listed landscape. The temporary closure would not only enhance the experience for cyclists but would also promote the conservation, protection and improvement of the natural and physical environment of the Park, and its peace and natural beauty for the benefit the public and future generations.\r\n",
