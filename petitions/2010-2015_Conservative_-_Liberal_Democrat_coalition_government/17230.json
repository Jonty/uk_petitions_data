These would be fixed periods and provide the kind of experience you can only get from actually working. Currently there are thousands of people like myself who cannot get regular work (I'm freelancing) simply because they haven't got enough experience in areas employers actually want. There will be a major skills shortfall in the years to come if this issue is not addressed, and education alone is quite obviously not sufficient.",
