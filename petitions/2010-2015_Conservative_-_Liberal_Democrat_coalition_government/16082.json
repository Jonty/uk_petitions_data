        "additional_details": "So many historic buildings are at risk or falling into disrepair, perfectly good buildings are being demolished and it is estimated that 1 milloin buildings are empty, all of these would provide good homes if converted or restored so why is this not the first option, restoration needs to be cheaper if not tax free, and it needs to be made more difficult to just demolish rather than convert, carbon emissions caused by demolition are far more damaging than restoration. Many of the buildings, Halls, Hospitals, Chapels etc need to be saved and converted to provide homes , but to do this the tax needs changing  ",
