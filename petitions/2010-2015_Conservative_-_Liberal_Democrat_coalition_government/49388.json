Does Mr Cameron agree that it was incredibly stupid for him to make comments which would be likely to influence the panel and impact on their ability to be impartial? Apart from trying to boost his own ratings, what does Mr Cameron feel he achieved by publicly attacking a man who had already, unreservedly accepted his error, paid a fine to charity, issued apologies to all? Does Mr Cameron make it a habit to kick hard working men when they are down? ",
