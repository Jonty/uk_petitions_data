        "additional_details": "Dog excrement left on pavements and verges by careless owners is not only a nuisance to those who step in it or run their buggy/wheelchair through it, it is a risk to public health. The current Dog Act (1996) only imposes a small fine of \u00a350 if owners are caught. This petition proposes that tougher penalties are put in place, such as heftier fines and community service during which the dog owners must clean up dog excrement from the pavements in their local area. The public should also be actively encouraged to report irresponsible owners to allow the law against dog fouling to be more effectively enforced. ",
