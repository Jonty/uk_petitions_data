        "additional_details": "The education reforms proposed by Micheal Gove not only ignore the knowledge and expertise of both teachers and leading academics,they also completely fail to take into account the needs of children and the way that they learn.\r\n\r\nMicheal Gove is not a qualified teacher and has very little classroom experience on which to base his decisions, I propose that he comes to teach my year two class for a term to understand the pressures involved in teaching young children and what skills they need to become independent learners.\r\n\r\nThis of course will never happen but if I was Micheal Gove I would want to feel like I was basing my decisions concerning millions of children's futures on some kind of practical experience. We can at least give him that option.",
