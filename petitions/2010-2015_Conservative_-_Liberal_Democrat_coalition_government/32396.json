This is not acceptable in a free democratic society. I ask this of the \"if you've nothing to hide, you've nothing to fear\" brigade:\r\n\"Do you share your private life - what goes on behind your curtains, the contents of your credit card bill, bank account or your love letters - with others freely? No, of course not, even though you do nothing wrong, you STILL cherish the right to privacy.\r\nI call on the Government to abandon this policy.",
