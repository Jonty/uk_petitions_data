To properly include us in our society and show us the trust and respect that society expects of us by giving us the right to vote. A 16 year old can: \u25e6leave school and enter work or training \u25e6pay income tax and National Insurance \u25e6obtain tax credits and welfare benefits in their own right \u25e6consent to sexual relationships \u25e6join the armed forces\r\nWe should be allowed to vote as we are as much apart of this country as any 30 year old +. We are the future generation and we should be allowed to say what happens to our country and should at least have a say in how it is run.\r\nWe want the government to realise we should be able to have the opportunity to vote and share our thoughts and ideas!",
