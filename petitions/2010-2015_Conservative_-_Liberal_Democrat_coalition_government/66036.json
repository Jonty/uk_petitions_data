        "additional_details": "The EU is able to impose laws on us and demands equality for citizens coming to the UK putting a strain on our systems resulting in Uk citizens having to endure the cost through taxation. We are then told by our government that we must work longer and state pension age is pushed further away. This is unfair and if other EU country's citizens are able to retire early, then we should be able to do the same in the UK.  Alternatively a 'blended' retirement age should be accepted as the norm for every EU citizen. ie if we are 67 and other country's are 63, everyone should be 65.  Equality should apply more than anything to an important time in your life that you have contributed towards for decades.",
