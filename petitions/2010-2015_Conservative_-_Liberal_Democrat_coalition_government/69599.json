The UK Government immediately suspend the Union and dissolve Parliament.\r\n2. That it then holds - before Dec 1st 2014 -  a Yes/No referendum on England forming an Independent Nation State under a Constitutional Monarchy with its own bank, financial system, defence force, health service, educational system and other current benefits enjoyed by the current and misnamed United Kingdom\r\n3. That it does not seek permission of The Northern Irish, Scottish or Welsh devolved governments who have all expressed their independent views many times in the past and often violently.",
