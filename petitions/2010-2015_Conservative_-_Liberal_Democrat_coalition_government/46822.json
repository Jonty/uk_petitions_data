We, our families, our friends and neighbours are not getting justice for crimes that affect us. This issue surrounds our daily lives and something NEEDS to be done. So please, if you agree with the motion I am putting forward that the judicial system needs to be changed, sign now!\r\n\r\nThank you.",
