        "additional_details": "UKTV is half owned by BBC Worldwide, which in turn is owned by the BBC. As the BBC is paid by all owners of Television sets, Radio sets and Computers it is deplorable that UKTV is largely not available on Freesat and only five of the channels are available on Freeview.\r\n\r\nWe demand that a service that we are paying for is made available in it's entirety on the Free to Air formats of Freeview, Freeview HD, Freesat and Freesat HD.\r\n\r\nThe channels (and their HD equivalents) include the following and any future additions under the UKTV umbrella:\r\n\r\nAlibi, Blighty, Dave, Eden, Gold, Good Food, Home, Really, Watch and Yesterday.\r\n\r\nWe also demand that these channels are immediately removed from Sky's paid subscription service and that any BSkyB action to claim compensation is immediately rejected as they knowingly and willingly entered an agreement that they knew should not have been allowed to happen.",
