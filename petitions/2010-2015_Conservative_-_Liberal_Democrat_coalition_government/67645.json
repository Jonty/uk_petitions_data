        "additional_details": "Cancer screening should always be an option and entirely a woman's personal choice, but because GP's are given financial incentives to meet an 80% screening target for this type of cancer, this choice is compromised, as many women face great pressure to get screened against their free will.\r\n\r\nCervical cancer is a rare cancer and a disproportionate amount of consultation time is wasted on this topic at the expense of other more common (and possibly fatal) health concerns.\r\n\r\nIt is unethical for doctors to treat a disease more than any other, because they will be rewarded with a cash bonus for reaching an 80% screening target.\r\n\r\nIt is also a violation of the our human rights to deny us a choice in screening.",
