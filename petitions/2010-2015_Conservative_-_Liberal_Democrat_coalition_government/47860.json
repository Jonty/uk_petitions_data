        "additional_details": "I request that the Daily Mail be shut down. They are allowing racially abusive content and death threats against Nelson Mandela on their blogging website. As the Daily Mail is unable to be a balanced and a fair newspaper, then it should be rendered unfit to broadcast news as we the public are sick and tired of their bigotry and poor reporting skills and sloppy journalism. I request that British Newspapers be controlled by the British people and not a religious group as this leads to unfair and biased reporting that protects the minority who are controlling what we read. The minority that control the press cannot be trusted or relied upon by the British public. The minority that run the press are not representative of Great Britain.",
