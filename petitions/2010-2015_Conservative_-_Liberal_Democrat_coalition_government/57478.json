        "additional_details": "Defibrilators can increase a person's chances of survival after heart failure from 6% with CPR alone to 75%. They can be used by anyone, with no training, as they talk you through what to do step-by-step and will not shock until they have assessed the person's heart and ascertained that it needs to be done. They cost from around \u00a3750 upwards, and yet the government add another 20% on top in VAT. There are several campaigns and petitions calling for them to be installed in all schools and sports centres but removing the VAT as well, will mean other sports clubs, and community groups and even individuals may be able to aford to buy them when otherwise they wouldn't. The price will continue to come down as more of them are sold so removal of VAT will make them a lot more accessible.",
