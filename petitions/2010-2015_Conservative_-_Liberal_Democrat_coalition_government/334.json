England is the only nation within the United Kingdom not to have its own legislature or debating chamber. It is time that anomaly ws put right. An English Parliament should be established after a referendum (England only voting) and would be formed of existing MPs who sit for English constituencies. There is no need for an extra layer of politicians or civil servants. It is time the UK government introduced legislation to hold a referedum and, assuming a Yes vote, then to establish a Parliament for England.",
