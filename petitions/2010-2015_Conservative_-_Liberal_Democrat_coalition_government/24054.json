        "additional_details": "We call on Parliament to reverse the 1971 process of decimalisation and return to the older, much-loved pre-decimal currency. One option could be to have a redenomination of our current currency so that \u00a3100 GBP becomes roughly equal to \u00a31.\r\n\r\nIt would then follow that each \u00a31 would be separated into 240d (pence) each equal to about 41.6p in today's money. Half Pennies and Farthings would be worth about 20.8p and 10.4p respectively. Thrupence would be equal to about \u00a31.24 and Sixpence \u00a32.49. A man presenting a Shilling in a pub might, if he's very lucky, get two pints.\r\n\r\nRestoring our ancient currency, one quite unlike any other in the world, would be a strong signal of Britain's economic sovereignty. We'd also be restoring a link with an altogether more human type of money, with beautiful, weighty coins and transactions could once again become thoughtful affairs as people get used to the once-commonplace mental arithmetic necessary to deal with a unit of currency divided into 240.
