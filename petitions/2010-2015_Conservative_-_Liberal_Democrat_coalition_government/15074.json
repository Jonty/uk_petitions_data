        "additional_details": "We are constantly reminded of the cost of everything and when the suggestion was put foward years ago that we required more prison places this was discounted because of cost.   Instead both Police and Her Majestys Court and Tribunial Service is now and has been, partially dismantled to create savings at the Home Office.   Surely crime should  not be allowed to pay.   It follows that criminals should pay where it is proved that they are well able to afford to do so.  We are told Departments and Ministers are being asked to think the un-thinkable.   Has anyone proposed such an option?  Government should 1. Care for the needs of the population from birth to old age allowing those in retirement to live with dignity. 2. Create a sound and well funded Health Service free at the point of use. 3. Have an effective Police Service and Criminal Justice System.   That is after all what they are paid for.",
