        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for the government to recommend to the NHS that treatment for mental illness continues for the individual until they are well. At present short periods of therapy are available which then end once the immediate crisis is over but leaves the patient either only just able to get by or still struggling. Life experience remains poor. If the issue was e.g. diabetes or cancer, the person would be treated until they were well or there condition to be continuously managed. I ask that the same provision be applied to those with mental illness. There is currently a very small provision for long term care where waiting for assessment is currently 6 - 12 months with another lengthy wait for treatment. This is an unacceptable wait and most people requiring help cannot wait this long as there is not support in the meantime.",
