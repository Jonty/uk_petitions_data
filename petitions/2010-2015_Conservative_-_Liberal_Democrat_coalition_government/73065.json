Its about time they were classed as key workers, they are a vital part of this aging nation. As part of that they need a living wage, not lose money traveling to places, and allow them to care for people. To give every person the knowlege that carers are equal to nurses, drs, teachers. That they dont have to work too many hours just to make ends meet.\r\nkey worker status should be the least they should have.",
