Ruby Cooper was subjected to this treatment after complaining to natwest/rbs bank that her accounts had been hacked into and she was being stalked...see www.natweststalker.com....I want a system where whistleblowers cannot be criminalised for complaining and bringing their case into the public eye.\r\nOver 78 crimes were committed against Ruby Cooper all of which were kept of all official records by police, CPS, IPCC and the judicary...I want this petition to get an enquiry into why the metropolitan police and city police would NOT log any of the 78 crimes committed against Ruby Cooper\r\n4 trials and an appeal were RIGGED...I want the petition to investigate this as trial rigging is illegal but went on.Without whistleblowers we cannot make the world a better and safer place",
