We've all seen it, the property adverts that says no pets allowed. What's the harm in having a pet? Please landlords, explain why? What's the damage caused to a property that can't easily be fixed with a lick of paint - particularly if the property is unfurnished?\r\n\r\nAs the growing number of people unable to get on the property ladder grows, so does the number of people unable to experience the joys and benefits of having a pet!\r\n\r\nLet's put a stop to it now - PETS FOR RENTERS",
