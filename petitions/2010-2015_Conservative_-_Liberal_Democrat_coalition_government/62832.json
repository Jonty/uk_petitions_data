        "additional_details": "Excessive daydreaming is a problem for a lot of people and it interferes with everyday life. It can reduce people to a life of solitude and little is known about why daydreaming becomes maladaptive. More research and a support network needs to be in place to help individuals get the help they need. Some sufferers regard it as a shameful secret and hide their excessive daydreaming from other people.\r\n\r\nI want the government to recognise and offer help through the NHS for people who suffer with debilitating excessive daydreaming. Psychologists need to be aware of the problem and realise how widespread it actually is.\r\n\r\nThe three things I would like to happen is for\r\n1. Maladaptive Daydreaming to be recognised as a mental health disorder.\r\n2. Support and help to be available through the NHS.\r\n3. A specialist charity to offer 24 hour online support for sufferers and their families with government support.",
