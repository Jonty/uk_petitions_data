        "additional_details": "As consumers, within the British economy, we should have the right to buy and sell as and when we wish. Not only will we become a more modern, 24 hour economy and catch up with the rest of the Western world, but it will increase consumer choice and give people greater opportunity to spend their money when they wish. It will also be of greater convenience to the consumer due to a lessening of queues and will allow stores, and the wider economy to grow - this has been observed in Spain and Finland in recent times amongst other nations.\r\n\r\nIn our modern times it is no longer a valid excuse to use religion and the 'day of rest' to justify these restrictions on trade. People are willing to work on Sunday and people are willing to go shopping on Sunday. Ultimately religion doesn't play a huge part in our society any longer.",
