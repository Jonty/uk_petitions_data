        "additional_details": "This is a non-political, moral based petition, to reverse the government\u2019s decision to reduce the 50% top rate of tax, to 45% with effect from April 2013.\r\nAt a time when a huge swathe of the population are struggling under the impact of cuts to benefits and services, massive unemployment and increased taxes, we believe it is morally wrong to reduce the tax burden of the wealthiest 10% in society.\r\nThere is a huge moral vacuum appearing between the people who run our country and the rest of the population, and it is fueling a breakdown in our society. The democratic process in the UK does not allow us to address this, as successive governments continue to pander to the richest in society, as an ever smaller percentage of our population takes an ever increasing share of its wealth.\r\n",
