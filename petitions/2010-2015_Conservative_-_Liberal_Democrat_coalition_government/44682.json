        "additional_details": "I am appealing to the people of the UK who consider a Horse to be treated like a Cat or a Dog i.e. this beautiful animal has always had special bonds with us and thus its slaughter for horse meat intended for consumption should not be permitted, either in the UK or exported from the UK for this purpose.\r\n\r\nNb America has its own 'American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act' and I feel we should have a similar act.\r\nHorses have served us throughout history, carrying us on their backs, tilling our fields, drawing wagons & carriages, and enriching our lives as friends & companions, just to name a few examples.\r\n\r\nThere is a market to produce horse meat for consumption here in the UK & some terrible methods are being used when slaughtering. I feel this practice in our modern world is morally wrong.\r\n\r\nI APPEAL TO YOU ALL TO HELP ME IN THIS PETITION FOR A SUITABLE LAW TO BE PUT IN PLACE",
