        "additional_details": "Budget airlines use all sorts of tricks to make money: Automatically opting you into unnecessary travel insurance, selling you luggage, car hire, hotels etc.  Web savvy users know that they need to pay attention to de-select all these annoyances.\r\n\r\nBut why are UK economy airline companies still allowed to charge exorbitant \"administration\" fees on credit/debit cards?  Who hasn't been hit with one of these when using a budget airline?  For example does Visa really charge RyanAir \u00a315 to \u00a320 on each transaction?  Have you ever encountered an \"administration\" fee at any other online store?\r\n\r\nThese charges can often more than double the price of a flight.  If these charges are real (highly doubtful) and part of the cost of the flight, then force the airlines to show the real price.  Otherwise this is blatant profiteering at the expense of an already stretched tax burdened travelling public and should be made illegal.\r\n\r\nSign if you agree!!",
