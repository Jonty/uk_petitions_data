This information is necessary to be able to comply with UK tax and company legislation and case law.  Prevention of access to the same information is therefore prevention of performance of statutory filing responsibilities for all companies, individuals or other relevant bodies.  The UK government is in breach of its contractual obligations and should immediately reinstate working links to the detailed information held at the HMRC and Companies house websites.",
