        "additional_details": "Please lend us your overwhelming support in this monumental quest to thrust the legendary Chuckle Brothers, Paul and Barry, onto your screens in next years I'm a Celebrity. This is something we see as essential to British culture and entertainment and without this British media will fail to fulfill it's full potential. Throughout their careers which has not only been long, but very girthy, they have managed to erect not only smiles upon thousands of children, but much, much more. In summary, anybody who is not promoting such a cause is clearly promoting the downfall of not only the British media, but this great country and should therefore be seen as an enemy of the state. Thank you.",
