        "additional_details": "We have a Royal Navy and a Royal Air Force, both of which are well known throughout the world by these titles with no need to reference our country. I believe that it is time to correct what is no doubt an historical quirk and to rename the Army as the \"Royal Army\". This would also recognise the stirling work the Army does in defending our freedom and I believe the public mood is right for such a change. ",
