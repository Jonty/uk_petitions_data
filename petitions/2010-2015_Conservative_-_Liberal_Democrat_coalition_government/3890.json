        "additional_details": "Political parties are currently funded by donations from individuals and corporations.  These corporations and individuals obviously fund political parties because it will benefit them in some way.  This may not be to the benefit of the majority of the population.  Therefore some or all of the following changes should be made to the current system:\r\n\r\n- A donation cap be put in place.\r\n- A ban on donations from government contractors.\r\n- Bans on corporate and trade union donations.\r\n\r\nI understand that this may lead to a large decrease in political party donations.  The shortfall may have to be made up for in some way by state funding such as in most other European countries.",
