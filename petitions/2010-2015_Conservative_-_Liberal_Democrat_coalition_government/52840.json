        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the government to repeal the Treason Felony Act 1848 as it goes against everything this country stands for. \"If any person whatsoever shall, within the United Kingdom or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend to deprive or depose our Most Gracious Lady the Queen, from the style, honour, or royal name of the imperial crown of the United Kingdom, or of any other of her Majesty\u2019s dominions and countries,\"\r\n\r\n\"imagine\" Why is there a law that can imprison someone for life for simply wanting to imagine that the UK was a republic? If this is the case then there are thousands of people all over the world guilty!\r\n\r\nThe UK says it stands for democracy but how can we call our self a democracy when you can't even have an imagination with out risking a lifetime in prison?\r\n\r\nThis law also clearly violates article 19 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights which the UK voted in favor of and adopted in 1948.",
