        "additional_details": "I present two arguments: 1st the financial impact, 2nd the impact on the military covenant.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Liam Fox, MoD has taken the decision to scrap a \u00a31.5Billion plan to upgrade decaying barracks. [Telegraph 9/11]\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomically the decision is flawed. The accommodation must be repaired so the \u00a31.5billion will eventually need to be spent; a delay will cost the tax payer more. Investing in the programme now will provide growth now, provide jobs now, give people spending power now [leading to more jobs later] and bring in more tax to pay off our nation\u2019s debts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo-one is asking for luxury, just accommodation in a good state of repair for them and the families left behind when serving overseas. If they are willing to volunteer to serve and protect our country (regardless of the political will behind the decision to deploy), we as a nation should honour the military covenant and make sure their housing is adequate.",
