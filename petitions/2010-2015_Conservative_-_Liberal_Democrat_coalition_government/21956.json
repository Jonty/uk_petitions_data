        "additional_details": "Wind farms will hugely increase the cost of energy. They don't generate when there is no wind. Nor when the wind is too strong.\r\nThey need 100% conventional backup or the lights will go out. In winter there can be weeks with cold weather and little wind.\r\nThe only reason they are being built is a European directive agreed by Tony Blair.\r\nThey are all constructed by foreign companies who only do it because they are heavily subsidised by the UK taxpayer.\r\nIn 20 years we will be decommissioning them when it is realized they don't work and are unaffordable.\r\nStop this folly now.\r\nChris Huhne is dangerously ill informed and should ask engineers, not politicians for advice.
