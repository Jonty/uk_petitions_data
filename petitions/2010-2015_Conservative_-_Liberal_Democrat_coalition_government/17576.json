        "additional_details": "In Britain it is policy and guideline for the NHS not to medically interviene to save a baby's life whom is born before 23 weeks. Due to the severe premetureity of such babies life saving treatments are very expensive and labourious. Due to this money saving guideline, babies are needlessly dying and parents are needlessly suffering agonising guilt and grief. Imagine how it feels to watch your baby die and be able to do nothing to change that, to be ignored by the very people who could help the situation? This is a babrbaric practice and should be stopped.\r\nThe action for government to take would be to review this guidline and lobby to change it so as the babies born before 23 weeks would have the right to receive life saving treatment by NHS staff.",
