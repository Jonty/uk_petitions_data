        "additional_details": "This is a very simple petition, with a couple of key points.\r\n\r\nFirstly, why can someone who commits a cold-blooded, evil murder, be back on the streets after as little as 12 or 13 years in some cases thanks to their joke of a 25-year \"life\" sentence being halved thanks to \"good behaviour\". The only life sentence is for the friends and family of the victim.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the most severe of crimes, which include murder, must have no opportunity EVER for parole. To this end, the minimum sentence for \"life\" must, without question be 40 years. Furthermore, all sentences must be cumulative. So for 2 murders, the minimum sentence is 80 years.\r\n\r\nThe only deterrent to evil people carrying out such a heinous and devestating crime is to make them realise that when caught, they are unlikely to spend another day in society, or at least not until they are very old and frail, so they will \"lose\" their life too.",
