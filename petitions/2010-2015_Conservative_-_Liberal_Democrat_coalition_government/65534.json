And amazingly in December she was given the all clear!! This was short lived and Natalie continued to struggle with pain and discomfort.  she now has 2 nephrostomy bags and a illeostomy bag, why should young females have to suffer like this let them have the smears test under the age of 25, they save lives natalie has now been told she is terminally ill.",
