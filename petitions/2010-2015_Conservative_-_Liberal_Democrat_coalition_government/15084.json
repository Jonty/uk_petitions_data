        "additional_details": "To introduce a system similar to that which exists in many US states. This requires energy companies wishing to increase prices to submit their requests to a Utilities Commission which sits in judgement having regard to company profits and what is fair for the consumer. This would introduce a greater degree of regulation over the energy companies which would no longer be able to simply impose the sort of unjustifiable increase we have seen over recent years while they continue making huge profits. This would be much fairer for the consumer.",
