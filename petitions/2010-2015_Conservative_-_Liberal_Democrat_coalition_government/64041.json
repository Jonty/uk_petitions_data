Muslims, and others, who choose to travel to join in the fighting do so entirely of their own choice AND THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO MAKE THAT CHOICE.  It is NOT right, however, that we UK taxpayers should not be forced to fund any FCO activity arising from that death. If the family want to know the circumstances then they should be invited to pay for it UP FRONT AND BEFORE ANY ACTION BY THE FCO.",
