Even the VAT guides allow us to correct errors in future returns, and I believe the guidance is that errors under \u00a32000 can be corrected on following returns without informing the HMRC. This applies also, and maybe more so, to the biggest corporations in the UK where paper or computer data gets mislaid. Having to sign \"information given above is true and complete\" makes liars out of all of us, every time we sign a return. In my mind the only businesses that can genuinely sign this are non-trading companies with no expenses and making null returns. Help make the UK more honest, change the wording, please!",
