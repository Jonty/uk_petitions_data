Health and behaviour issues should be considered and investigated before planning a litter, with the sole purpose being for the benefit of potential puppies.Unfortunately, there is constant growth of \"back-street breeding\" mostly of the Staffordshire bull terrier type, and \"/tea-cup\" breeds. Back-street breeding, and the lack of care by these breeders HAVE resulted in these circumstances/outcomes:\r\n1.Pups being born with genetic defects, and un-necessary health problems.\r\n2. Many have been subject to \"Pit-Bull\" type category.\r\n3.Thousands of dogs left homeless, or abandoned.\r\n4.Physical harm to female dogs, being constantly over-bred.\r\n5.Dogs being bred for characteristics associated with fighting.\r\nMake it illegal and a criminal offence to breed a dog without a licence..",
