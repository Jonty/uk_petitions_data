        "additional_details": "I propose that companies that make profits should be required to pay back, to the government, the amount in tax credits that was given to their low paid workers.\r\nTax credits ccan be good for company start-ups etc, as they allow the companies to access a labour force until they become profitable. However, these shoudl not be used to prop up unprofitable companies indefinitely. Tax credits should not be used as a subsidy to make it possible for companies making huge profits to pay their workforce low pay - below a living wage - whilst creaming off profits for their shareholders at the top.\r\nIf companies make a profit this should be assessed not only for tax due, but for the amount of tax credits paid to their low paid workers, and companies making a large profit should be made to foot the bill for their workforce by repayment of tax credits.",
