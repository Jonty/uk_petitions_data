        "additional_details": "There have been numerous reports in the press that the previous government deliberately \"opened the floodgates\" to an uncontrolled flood of immigration in order to forever change the face of Britain, creating a multicultural society as well as to rub the Right Wing's nose in it. The nation needs a Public enquiry to establish whether this was in fact the case, and that the previous Govenment deliberately increased the levels of immigration in order to to create a multicultural Britain, and remove the arguments against continued EU membership as well as increase the numbers of people likely to be pro EU membership living in Britain.\r\n ",
