        "additional_details": "Mass immigration has been a disaster resulting in stretched resources, lost jobs, increased crime and foreign cultures establishing their own 'countries within our country,' even to the point of trying to seek legitimisation of their own legal processes. The UK does not need and cannot sustain this continuing influx, which is why ALL non-EU immigration should be banned immediately. The only non-EU people allowed in should be highly-skilled specialists; their families should not receive automatic residency; and they should be given a visa only, which would have to be renewed. The government should also re-negotiate EU immigration quotas, as a condition of remaining in the EU, according to similar criteria with a cap of 10,000 per year. Those who are given leave to remain must be employed and should be refused benefits until they've paid into the system for a minimum 5 years.",
