        "additional_details": "Children that suffer from cases of bullying will often confide in their teachers or school staff members, however direct contact with the parent/guardian is not always guaranteed. Many parent's/carers are unaware of the aggressive behaviour that their children may carry out upon others because that information is withheld by the school.\r\n\r\nI suggest a change in law, which makes direct contact with all parents/carers involved in known cases of bulling compulsory, so that fewer recurring cases of aggression and/or violence occur within schools, and fewer suicides to occur because of behaviour that is left unattended or ignored.",
