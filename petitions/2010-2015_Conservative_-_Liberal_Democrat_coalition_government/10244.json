This does not mean fighting wars in the army, but does mean offering unpaid service back to the community and spending a number of weeks/months in army barracks to learn about discipline, morality and the purpose of working with and for your country rather than against it. National Service should be a prelude to gaining British Citizenship and the rights that come with that.",
