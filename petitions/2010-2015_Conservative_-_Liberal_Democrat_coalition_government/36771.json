        "additional_details": "Prior to the Olympics, the IOC raised the possibility that British TV rights for future Olympic games could be sold to satellite/cable broadcasters and so would not be available in their entirety on free-to-air TV. I would like the government to reaffirm the position that this will not be allowed to happen.\r\n\r\nThere would be no financial benefit to British Sporting National Governing Bodies, as they do not own the rights, the IOC do. So the money would not be reinvested in British sport - community based or performance level.\r\n\r\nSo there would be no benefit to the British Public and a continuation of over commercial exploitation of the Olympics",
