I feel this is wrong, surely a man who has the power to chang the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people who serve or who's loved ones serve in the military should have served himself and thus know what it is like?\r\n\r\nAs a result I propose it becomes law that all future Defence Secretaries have served at some point in any of the three services or Reserve Forces so that they may have a better perspective on their own decisions. No-one would tolerate a Chancellor who had never been in business so why should the military tolerate this injustice?",
