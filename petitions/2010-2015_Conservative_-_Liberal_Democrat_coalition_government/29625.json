        "additional_details": "A snare is a wire noose that acts as an anchor to stop an animal from escaping. These are still legal in the UK. Snares are usually set for foxes and rabbits although other animals more than often fall victim to these inhumane devices also, as the snare cannot discriminate between species (cats, badgers, dogs etc). The snared animal is usually caught by the neck but it may also be trapped by a leg or round the body. When the animal is caught it panics and struggles to free itself. The more it struggles, the tighter the noose becomes and the greater the animal's struggle and suffering. Victims of snares may die of strangulation, starve to death or be killed by predators. Usually the wire has cut into the flesh so deeply that the animal will bleed to death or die from the resulting injury. Please sign for the government to consider banning the use of snares, there are many more humane alternatives.",
