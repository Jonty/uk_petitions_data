However their application has been rejected, but not until the new york visa office had given it adequate time to gather dust in someones in tray. (2.5 months)\r\n\r\nI call on the people who are going to attend, who know about this or who have read our detailing of what has happened to sign up to this petition and show the bureaucrats that this relationship between these two people is not just a another bit of paperwork its something almost intangible but still real affecting real people.
