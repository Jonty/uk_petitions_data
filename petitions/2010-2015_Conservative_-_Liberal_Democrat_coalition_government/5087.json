        "additional_details": "It pains many of us that we work hard yet still see large amounts of our incomes disappear from our wage packets to be handed out to those on benefits. It has, for some become a way of life to be dependant on the state and our money whilst giving little or nothing in return to the society which supports them.\r\n\r\nI propose that everyone who is claiming jobseekers allowance for more than 3 months have to carry out a set number of hours per week (approx 20) community service for the local council & other community organisations/charities if they wish to remain eligible for jobseekers allowance.\r\n\r\nThis will serve the community twofold by carrying out useful functions for society and by giving people useful skills & experience which can be used in the search for paid employment.",
