The revision is promised because previous guidance, contained in Annex C to Home Office circular 46/2004 has been discredited and is generally accepted as unsound.This petition is on behalf of disabled former police officers, injured in the line of duty. It exhorts the Home Office not to repeat the mistakes of the past and not to issue more flawed guidance. It should issue revised guidance that says only, 'FOLLOW THE POLICE (INJURY BENEFIT) REGULATIONS 2006'",
