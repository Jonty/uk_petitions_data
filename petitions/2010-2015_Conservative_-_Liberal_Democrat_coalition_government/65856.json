        "additional_details": "We would like the British government to bring the wreckage of \"Easy Elsie\" the last lancaster bomber from 617 squadron - (the dambusters) back to the UK. She crash landed in in a swamp in Porjus, Sweden on 29-10-1944 after attempting to sink the Tirpitz. All of Elsie's crew survived. She currently lies outside, open to the elements, while slowly rotting and being scavenged by souvenir hunters. We believe this historic and unique piece of British military heritage should be returned home, preserved and used to educate this and future generations about the bravery and sacrifice made by our ancestors during world war 2.",
