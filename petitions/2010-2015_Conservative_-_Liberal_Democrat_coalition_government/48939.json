        "additional_details": "Every year the taxpayer pays over \u00a340000 per prisoner in the UK. This surely cannot be right when the government is slashing so many other areas of spending. I would like the government to do away with all the priviliges prisoners have such as internet access, swimming pools, gymnasium, etc and severely cut the amount spent on our prisons. Stop prison time from being a vacation. Those prisoners have only harmed society, why should society pay for their luxurious upkeep.",
