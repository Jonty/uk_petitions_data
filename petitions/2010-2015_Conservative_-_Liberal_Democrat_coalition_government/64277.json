        "additional_details": "The speed limit which exists in Northern Ireland for R drivers on Motorways and other main roads is ridiculous. 45mph is dangerous and creates a hazard on these roads when people are not paying enough attention to the road ahead. Not only that, R Drivers sticking to their speed limit can create long tailbacks on main roads where not many opportunities for overtaking exist. Even raising the speed limit on A and M roads by just 10mph to 55 would mean that both of these problems are reduced dramatically.",
