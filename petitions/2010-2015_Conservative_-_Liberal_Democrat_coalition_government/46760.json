        "additional_details": "Burn in North Yorkshire has had a traveller site since 1984. Both settled and traveller communities have enjoyed a good relationship, which is now threatened by an extension more than doubling it in size. The site has already been extended once in 2004 and now has 12 pitches with space for two more.  Selby District Council\u2019s plan to extend the site again will create a giant site of 29 pitches covering almost 5 acres. It would be by far the largest site in North Yorkshire in one of its smallest villages.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State should intervene and prevent Selby District Council from creating this huge traveller site and should legislate to require Local Authorities to hold a referendum in the nearest settled community to show a simple majority in favour, before any further new authorised traveller sites can be built.\r\n",
