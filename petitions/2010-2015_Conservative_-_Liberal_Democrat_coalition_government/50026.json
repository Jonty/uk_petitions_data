        "additional_details": "Michael Gove's education policies are baseless and ill informed.  He has no experience of state education and ignores advice from those working within it.\r\n\r\nA Secretary of State for Education should have personal experience of the department for which he works and refrain from introducing knee jerk and reckless policies.\r\n\r\nEducation should not be used as a political football and teachers should not just be expected to fall in line with a career politician's irrational ideas which have all been formed from his elitist educational experiences where there are only 15 in a class.",
