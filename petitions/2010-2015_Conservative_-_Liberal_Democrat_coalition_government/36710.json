        "additional_details": "\u00a36.08 - the main rate\r\n\u00a34.98 - the 18-20 rate\r\n\u00a33.68 - the 16-17 rate\r\n3 minimum wage rates are active in the United Kingdom. The 40% difference between the top and bottom rates represents discrimination against young people.\r\n\r\nWe believe work should be paid for equally, whoever carries it out.\r\n\r\nWe believe the view that young people need less money is faulty, especially given high rates of teen pregnancy and young people moving from home.\r\n\r\nWe believe the lower minimum wage rates are discriminatory against people from lower income households, as they are more likely to work, and work more, between the ages of 16-21, and are more likely to work part-time while in education.\r\n\r\nWe believe reducing youth unemployment with a lower minimum wage is an excuse based on very basic economics. We stress that the lower minimum wages may contribute to youth unemployment by being too low relevant to benefits. The result is voluntary unemployment as young people have little incentive to work.
