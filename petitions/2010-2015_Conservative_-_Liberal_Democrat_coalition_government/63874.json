Their current slogan, \"Don't Cook, Just Eat\" and associated adverts are a blatant encouragement of unhealthy eating.\r\n\r\nPresently there are very real and current issues regarding health problems, money issues and a lack of basic culinary skills.\r\n\r\nPlease take down these adverts and replace them to promote healthier, more intelligent and informative lifestyles.",
