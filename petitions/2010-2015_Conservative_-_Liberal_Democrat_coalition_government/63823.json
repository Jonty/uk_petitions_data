        "additional_details": "Citarum River in Java, Indonesia. A source of water for drinking, cooking and washing replied upon by 35 million people. And also the most polluted river on Earth.\r\n\r\nBrought to light by Channel 4's Unreported World, the horrific violation of what was once a tropical paradise must end now. The effect on human health as well as on the natural environment is truly unthinkable.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the British Government and the international community to act against this abhorrent exploitation of both people and planet by banning the importation of clothing material that originates from Java, thereby obliging the Indonesian Government to clean up their act in the interests of protecting their own economy, and by piling pressure on the Indonesian Government by publicly condemning their actions in failing to address this devastating situation. For more info, please view Channel 4's Unreported World coverage of the issue at 4oD.\r\n\r\nThank you for responding to the pleas of the people of Java.",
