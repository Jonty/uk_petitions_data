        "additional_details": "I call upon the Government to lobby on the decriminalisation of cannabis.\r\n\r\nIt should be made legal for adults over the age of 21 to possess an ounce of the drug, or up to 16 ounces of cannabis-infused goods like brownies or cookies, or up to 72 ounces in liquid form.\r\n\r\nGrowers and processors of cannabis should be regulated and the drug would be sold in licensed shops.\r\n\r\nIt would also be subject to a 25 per cent tax at each stage of that process. The change would bring hundreds of millions of pounds in tax revenue for spending in areas including schools, health care and education on use of 'hard' drugs such as heroin or cocaine. Personal cultivation of 4 plants per household should also be considered however not sold.\r\n6 out of 7 British Citizens believe now is the time for the government to make this change. ",
