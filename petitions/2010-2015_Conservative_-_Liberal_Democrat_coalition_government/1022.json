        "additional_details": "Many supposedly \u201chealthy\u201d juice and water drinks contain up to a whopping 8 teaspoons of sugar.  We are calling for legislation which forces soft drink manufacturers to clearly label the added sugar content in their drinks.\r\n\r\nSoft drink companies increasingly market their vitamin and juicy water drinks as healthy options.  What they don\u2019t make clear is that some of these allegedly healthy drinks contain more added sugar than 5 Crispy Kreme donuts.\r\n\r\nDespite recent and shocking press coverage of added sugar in healthy drinks, still not enough people realise what they are drinking.  With obesity and diabetes on the up, we think this is completely wrong!  Sign up if you would like the government to insist that drink manufacturers stop adding sugar to \u201chealthy\u201d drinks, or make it very clear on their labels about how much sugar they are really adding.\r\n",
