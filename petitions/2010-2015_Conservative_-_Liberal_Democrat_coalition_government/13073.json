        "additional_details": "Being made to pay a minimum of \u00a31 to drop someone off at the airport is just the airports way I believe of cashing in. By maybe using the reason of safety brought about by the attack on Glasgow airport in 2007.The reason can\u2019t be an environmental deterrent to get people out of the cars as they offer long stay parking sometimes at ridiculously cheap rates in comparison to \u00a31 for ten minutes.\r\nAlso the short stay parking rates seem a little unfair.\r\nA scenario\r\nIf someone drove to Manchester airport to pick some one up and they are delayed the cost of short stay just balloons. Cost as of the 17/8/2011\r\nUp to 30 minutes \u00a32.20,\r\nUp to 1 hour \u00a34.00,\r\nUp to 2 hours \u00a38.00,\r\nUp to 4 hours \u00a312.00\r\nIf the airports dropped their short stay parking charges they would probably get more people using their facilities instead of parking in laybys and side streets waiting for a phone call and could possibly bring in more revenue and the customer doesn\u2019t feel ripped off",
