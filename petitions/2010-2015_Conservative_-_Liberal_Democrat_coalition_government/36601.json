        "additional_details": "The Government have been building more shared ownership houses and have promoted first time buyers to think of this option as a way of getting on the property ladder. Keyworker shared ownership schemes to keep key community services also promoted this as affordable housing to keep keyworkers in the local area. What happens however if you are a keyworker who becomes ill and needs to claim benefits to meet outgoings?? When all forms, CAB computer programmes, local councils in fact nearly all forms do not recognise you have a mortgage and pay rent. Most say we only have option for one or the other. This makes it hard to claim and claimants may not be achieving the eligibility for the benefits they would most likely get if just renting or just buying a house. I think all forms should represent the society as a whole with the appropriate options. I hope the government will not only reform their benefits but the benefit forms too ",
