Ban zero hour contracts and set a minimum 16 hour contract should be created with some controls like commission only jobs would be illegal, shifts would have to be a minimum of 4 hours and split shifts would be Illegal. Also every employee would have to get paid for their breaks. Also as temporary work goes no temporary contract would be allowed to be less than 3 months. Also if you work Christmas Day or New Year's Day then you get triple time. On other bank holidays it would just be time and half.",
