All residential roads, at the 20mph limit woulde be that much safer.\r\nPresently, Local Highways Authorities will only consider a 20mph limit: \"Where Accident Statistics Merit The Cost.\"  That is nonsense for it puts cost before safety. It must be put right at once. We have the right to feel safe on our roads - whether drivers or pedestrians. The Law must be changed now.\r\n",
