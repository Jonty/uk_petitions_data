        "additional_details": "Currently the Government borrows \u00a3126 billions pounds sterling on the international markets. Most of this money is then immediately sent abroad to the EU, World Bank, IMF, Ministry of Aid and International Development, Ireland, amongst others. It makes no snse to keep borrowing and for the money not to be used within the UK. Is it really necessary to send money abroad to India to fund projects which onkly benefit politicians, for example, India's space programme? It is time the Government got serious about borrowing and sold the gold off held in the Bank of England (\u00a330 billions at the last estimate).",
