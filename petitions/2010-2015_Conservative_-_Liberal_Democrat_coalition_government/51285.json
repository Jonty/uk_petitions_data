        "additional_details": "Say no to the proposed fixed penalty for excessive  middle lane use. Choice of lane depends on a variety of factors including traffic conditions and chosen speed.\r\nThe inside lane of any motorway is usually heavily used by joining/leaving vehicles and relatively slow moving HGV's; the outside lane by vehicles overtaking at high speed, which leaves the middle lane for steady through traffic. Far more accidents are caused by impatience and excessive lane chopping than by lane hogging.",
