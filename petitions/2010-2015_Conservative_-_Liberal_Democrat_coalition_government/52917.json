        "additional_details": "So Penzance has been given the privalige of a new street plaza. Only\u00a0problem for BMXers is that your not allowed to run stunt pegs here because it damages the concrete APPARENTLY! The skate plaza in wherrytown has been built recently and opened to the public on the 10.07.13. I have travelled the country and have never seen a rule of this sort anywhere. The oldest parks in the UK and world still allow pegs and are still used to their full potential! We do not want to fall out with anybody over this. We just need to make pegs allowed for not only locals to ride but for people who travel to ride aswell. Please add thoughts,questions and anything else you can think of to this group but not negativity. Cheers lads! lets do this! Please sign this petition to help us change this rule.",
