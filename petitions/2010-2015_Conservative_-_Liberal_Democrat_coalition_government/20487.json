        "additional_details": "Currently The Act only refers to Flats. This causes problems with Right To Manage, especially in mixed developments of leasehold houses and flats, with multiple management companies being involved. By including houses in the Act it would eliminate these anomalies and allow RTMs to manage the complete development. It would also allow leaseholders of  housing developments to create their own RTM and have more control over the service charges etc.",
