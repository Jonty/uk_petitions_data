Pay an appropriate salary that allows MP's to adequately carry out the job rather than the current system of expenses. Furnished, serviced and equipped accommodation should be provided free of charge (including meals) in parliamentary owned secure hotel type buildings in central London for any MP's requiring it (not their families) with rooms booked as required but not reserved for their sole use. In addition (for all MP's with constituencies outside the M25) travel costs to their constituency should be provided at a rate equivalent to an annual  2nd class season ticket for the rail/ferry fare, though they should be allowed to upgrade at their own expense to travel 1st class or fly or drive instead as they please.",
