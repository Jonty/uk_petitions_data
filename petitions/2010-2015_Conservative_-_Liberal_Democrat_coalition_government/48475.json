The politics of the individual Prime Minister in question should not to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nThis is to end the bizarre situation in which some Prime Ministers such as - Churchill and Thatcher - are afforded the ceremonial funeral or state funeral whilst others - such as Wilson and Heath - are not.",
