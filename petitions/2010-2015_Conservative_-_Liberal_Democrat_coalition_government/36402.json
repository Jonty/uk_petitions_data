        "additional_details": "I would like people to stand up and ask the government why it isnt spending money on not just renewable energy but free energy.  Byron energy gives the user the ability to burn water and has no polluting side effects.  It also enables the user to power their car for 500 miles on a cup or so of water and gives the bi-product of steam.  Magnetic energy and over power enable the user to produce seven times more power than they input in to a magnetic turbine.  Tesla power has the ability to power the world from wireless electricity and a combination of these methods could result in free energy, meaning production costs would be less and in turn people would not need to work as much as they do.  Electricity pumped remotely to the world would result in crops being able to be grown in even the remotest areas and put an end to world poverty.  ",
