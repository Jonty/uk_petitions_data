This needs to be taken down straight away. whether your anti wind or you just generally care about the landscape this so called landmark needs to be stop. I do not need to describe why wind power is bad they is plenty information out there. But i thought we at least deserve a say on whether it should be built. if we live in a democracy we should be allowed to choose our energy sources and where they go. ",
