        "additional_details": "We currently operate a system whereby our 'elected' MP's each represent the views of 50-60,000 UK citizens. Direct democracy would give every citizen the right to vote on every issue, in person or via proxy  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy).\r\n\r\nRecent events have shown our current system of representative democracy to be open to corruption, self-promotion, cronyism and commercial lobbying. This has left many citizens and commentators doubting the efficacy of our current system of government, as the actual views of the electorate under representative democracy are subject to the whims, whips and career aspirations of their MPs, and are not adequately considered in the Parliament. Direct democracy presents the most realistic option for corruption-free government.",
