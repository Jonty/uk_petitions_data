        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the Government should be aiming for the creation of a UK wide Maglev train network in the long term. Instead of investing billions on high speed rail, the UK should be investing in the future and in doing so surpassing the transport infrastructure of continental Europe and the far east instead of merely playing catch up. Maglev trains have the potential to travel at incredibly high speeds, benefiting our economy and our international prestige. Sign this petition if you want Britain to be a leading economy in the next century!",
