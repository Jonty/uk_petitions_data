There were two people responsible for the conception of the child - therefore both should be given equal rights at the birth.  Too many men have to fight to attain just a fraction of the rights the mother is given and it is costly for their pocket which could be used for the up-bringing of the child and it is time consuming keeping usually the father from bonding and spending quality time with his child.  If one of the parents (MOTHER or FATHER) is a bad role model, then they can petition through the courts in the usual way regarding  justifying contact to the child.  This should also be recognised in terms of financial support for the children.",
