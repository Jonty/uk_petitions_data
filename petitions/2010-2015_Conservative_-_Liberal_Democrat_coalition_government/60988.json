Although severity exclaims for immediacy, eating disorders are failing to be treated as what they are primarily: a mental health issue. They should not continually be treated on the basis of physical deterioration.\r\nThe government urgently needs to pour greater resources into eating disorder units, so that everybody, no matter what 'stage' they are at in their illness, receives equal, and immediate assistance.
