        "additional_details": "Clan Cameron history illustrates the fusion of tribal squabbling  Britons and their petty chieftains into a peaceful,prosperous constitution. They fought The  English with The Bruce in 1314, at Flodden in 1513, Killicrankie in 1689 and Culloden in 1745. In 1939 the Cameron Regiment \"Ladies From Hell\" spearheaded the defence of the realm from tyranny..Cameron hould not traduce the principle of union to political badinage but by sporting the kilt at the despatch box he might support Scottish  culture, industry and togetherness. He may recall the Cameron motto \"Let Us Unite\" and the war cry ;\"Sons Of The Hounds Come Hither And Get Flesh\"  ",
