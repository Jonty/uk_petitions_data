        "additional_details": "Whitelaw housing estate is situated on the outskirts of Castle Douglas next to the A745. It is primarily housing for families with young children. The A745 which runs next to the houses has a speed limit of 30mph but due to the fact that this limit starts near the beginning of the estate, the traffic coming from Dalbeattie have rarely slowed down to this speed by the time they are at the area that the children cross the road. Also a lot of the traffic starts to accelerate out of Castle Douglas as soon as they come round the bend at the bottom of Oakwell Road. A pedestrian crossing is needed NOW before a child is KILLED or seriously injured. This problem will not go away until something is done about it. ",
