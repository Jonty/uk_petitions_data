        "additional_details": "Currently within the Senedd, there are only 60 Assembly Members. An increase in members would allow the Members to properly scrutinise the Welsh Government.\r\nCompared with the rest of the UK, Wales currently has the smallest amount of Members in a devolved government. Scotland currently has 129 MSPs and Northern Ireland, which has a population smaller than that of Wales, has 108 Members.\r\nIn a report, called Size Matters, it was reported that backbench AM's are badly overstretched and are struggling to effectively scrutinise a \"powerful and well-resourced\" government.\r\nOur National Assembly should reflect our status as a modern devolved Nation by having an Assembly which can cope with the demands of the people of Wales in the 21st Century.\r\nThis debate has already been discussed in the Richard Commission and the Silk Commission Part II, which both looked at expanding the assembly's powers, recommending at least 80 AMs once it received law-making powers.\r\n",
