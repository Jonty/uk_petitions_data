        "additional_details": "I think Dad's should be given more paid time off to spend with their child(ren) after birth, as most fathers return to work almost immediately and then miss out on bonding with their kids.\r\n\r\n2 weeks is not long enough to help look after a new born often leading to lack of sleep for both involved and much more. If the time was upped to at least 1 month of  fully paid leave, so much more can be achieved in caring for the child(ren) and will more than likely help families to have a greater bond and result in lesser splits and ruined relationships often affecting a childs growth and development.",
