They would be accompanied by a qualified instructor and give help and guidance on a range of problems such as irrigation,food, contraception ect. We are in a double-dip recession and many are struggling financially due to the austerity measures. The people here who want to help can raise funds for this by social events in their spare time. This would bring people together as a community and they would get personal satisfaction from this. So come on, save our pockets and create a good sound,society that we can be proud of,British resedents!",
