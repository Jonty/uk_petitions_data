Here is the plan which would make the BBC more effiecient:\r\n- Scrap BBC Four, not as important as the other points, but it needs to be done.\r\n- Get rid of the BBC radio shows that nobody listens to (effectively only keeping Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4)\r\n- A 20% pay cut for all those who \u00a3200,000 and over within the BBC, and if they do not agree with these new contracts do not negotiate, but instead let them leave.\r\n- Give the public a say in how the BBC is run.\r\n- Cut down on antique and cooking programmes by at least 25% per week.\r\n- Scrap the CBBC channel during the week, as children should be in school, and then it could be shown on weekends and midweek nights.\r\n- Scrap S4C.\r\n- Scrap most of the BBC Worldwide channels.\r\n- Get a more knowledgeable base and cut out the bias of pundits on sports programmes.",
