        "additional_details": "A significant number of cyclist pedestrians and motorcyclists are injured every year due to the surface of man hole covers becoming polished with traffic passing over them making them a slip hazard on the foot paths and roads, especially when wet. There are now manhole covers that maintain the same high levels of grip from the time they are installed to the time they are replaced. Could it be written into the rules on highway construction that minimum in use grip levels be manditory for replacement manhole covers and all new instillations during road building. Some of the covers are now also made from non metalic materials making them worthless for scrap metal so less likely to be stolen. Also that the utility companies inspect their cover at least once every two years for signs of excess wear and replace them as required.",
