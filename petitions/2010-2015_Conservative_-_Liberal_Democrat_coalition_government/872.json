        "action": "To have the Government review the BBC/Sky/FOM deal in light of the almost unanimous response by F1 fans against it.",
        "additional_details": "The BBC had a deal with Formula 1 Management (FOM) to air all F1 races and qualifying until the end of 2013.  Now we are told that FOM has signed a deal effective from 2012 that BBC and Sky will share broadcasting rights meaning that not all races will be available live on free-to-air (FTA) TV; in breach of the BBC / FOM agreement previously in place.\r\n\r\nWe petition the DCMS to urgently review the deal struck to see if it conflicts with current contractual arrangements.  We also petition the DCMS to review the new deal to see if it meets government guidelines for FTA sports deals.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the deal announced at the end of July is bad for F1 fans, many of whom cannot afford a Sky subscription (estimates are for around \u00a3500 for a full season of F1).  We also believe the deal is a disaster for the BBC based on the impact this decision will have on licence fee revenues.",
