        "additional_details": "Whilst our kids are trying to get changed in swimming pools' changing facilities, they are also being exposed to the image of grown ups walking around stark naked near them. Such neglect leaves an open door for criminals and gives them the freedom to carry out some of their immoral acts. Many of these children's parents are not aware of this ongoing problem, they give their trust to the pool manager and the school principal when they send their kids for swimming lessons.\r\nWe request the government to:\r\n1. Prohibit Adults from getting stark naked in changing facilities when kids are present.\r\n2. Prohibit Kids from using changing facilities unsupervised by an adult (parent, carer or staff member).\r\n3. Prohibit the use of mobile phones and/or photographic equipment within areas where children and young people are changing/ showering.",
