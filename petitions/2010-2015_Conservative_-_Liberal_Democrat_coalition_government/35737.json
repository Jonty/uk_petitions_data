        "additional_details": "The Armed Forces are renowned worldwide for their work and 'get the job done' ethos.  An ethos which is blatantly (and often publicly demonstrated to be) deficient from the current staff and executive levels in our Border Agency who give the impression of being there merely to draw a salary and good long term pension prospects without giving ANYTHING in exchange.  The country must be rescued from the devastating complaceny of these people - which is an obvious and imminent threat to our national security - by replacing them with people who are proven to be capable of doing the job required of them.",
