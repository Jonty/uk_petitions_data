        "additional_details": "Review of when injunctions re: domestic violence can be sanctioned. Review of violent parents 'rights' over access to children when this places the non-violent parent in danger. Measures need to be enforced that the victim does NOT have to be attacked further, but if a valid belief that violence could ensue (backed up with evidence, even if by telephone threats/threats to 3rd parties/in person) the an injunction, with power of arrest, should be able to be obtained with immediate effect.\r\nI lost my children into care because my ex was violent. Social Services placed us in firther danger by forcing me to allow their father into the home to gain access to them, as per his 'human rights'. When he was violent again - I lost my children as SS said I 'failed to protect them from witnessing violence'.....even though I had asked them to accomodate supervised access etc, and a police report sent to them in 2003 stated that I 'would always be in extreme danger at the hands of the suspect'",
