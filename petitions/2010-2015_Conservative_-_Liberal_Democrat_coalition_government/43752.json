        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, urge the government and CPS to make UK use of social media subject to full registration.\r\n\r\nLately platforms like Twitter have been used for: spreading images of child abuse / pornography, hate speech, defamation, racism, harassment and bullying.\r\n\r\nFreedom of speech, debate and critical dialogue is vital in a healthy and democratic society, however social media must not be a realm beyond the law of the land. Currently, UK users avoid identification and prosecution as inadequate identification occurs at the point of registration.\r\n\r\nRegistration should not remove anonymity during use of these services but must allow for proper disclosure of identity for law enforcement.\r\n\r\nThe Government should consult with social media providers to bring in legislation requiring UK users to provide full personal information which is subject to the Data Protection Act until and unless law enforcement agencies or legal proceedings require their disclosure.",
