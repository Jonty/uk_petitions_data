        "additional_details": "We the undersigned ask the UK government to review the current tax system with an aim of both simplifying and making the system more transparent.\r\n\r\nA study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last year said: \"The current UK tax system is opaque and unnecessarily complex, imposing two entirely separate taxes on earnings \u2013 income tax and national insurance contributions. Recent changes have introduced a bizarre marginal rate structure.\u201d\r\n\r\nPoliticians have raised national insurance to avoid putting up income tax. Labour, which had pledged not to raise tax rates, increased national insurance in 2002 to fund a budget boost for the NHS. If national insurance had been abolished it would have been more transparent that the Labour government broke their pledge not to raise taxes which they effectively did by raising national insurance contributions.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that our tax system is opaque and needs reforming and a good start to that would be abolishing National Insurance.",
