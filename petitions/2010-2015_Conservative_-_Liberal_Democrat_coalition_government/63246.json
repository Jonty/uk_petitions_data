Most children uneducated about how to contact their local decision makers and about how politics works on a local and national scale. We, the youth of Bournemouth, would like Bournemouth Council and the DoE to re-introduce the United Kingdom Youth Parliament or a similar scheme to hear and act on the views of the young people of Bournemouth. Furthermore, it is not just Bournemouth, it is the United Kingdom as a whole.\r\n\r\n- Michael Bryan",
