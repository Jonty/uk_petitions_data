        "additional_details": "We are disappointed to see that psychology is seen as \u2018a non-priority\u2019 subject and therefore trainee psychology teachers would not be eligible for a bursary. Future trainees will need to find up to \u00a39000 for fees on top of living expenses in order to train. Psychology is the only science subject not to have been designated a priority subject, and therefore not to attract a bursary. We are unclear as to why this is the case, especially at a time when the uptake of science subjects by young people in the UK is a concern. Through high quality psychology teaching students develop essential transferable skills which enhance learning and achievement in other subjects as well as those which can encourage them to make healthier choices of life-style and become critically confident citizens. Students in this country deserve the best quality psychology education and the best quality psychology teachers. We urge you to reconsider this policy and demonstrate that the government believes this too.",
