Gymnophobia is someone who has the rational fear of nudity.\r\nWherever stories about nudists have been brought to the attention of the press, there is an incredible amount of hatred and prejudice against those who wish to be nude in nudist areas. There is no law against public nudity in England and Wales, so they say. There needs to be a direct change in the law to make it clear that nudity should be properly legal without prejudice from those who see it as an offence and in particular where the law seeing it as a sex offence or public nuisance. The law needs to be clear in regards to those who go nude in public. As it stands, there is a lot of confusion. ",
