        "action": "To order the scrapping of junior school syllabus",
        "additional_details": "This petition asks the government to take drastic steps to save young British men and woman.\r\nMy proposals are quite simple and, I believe, will be immediately effective.\r\nTo order the scrapping of junior school syllabus, teach only\r\nReading, Writing & Arithmetic with an active sport every day.\r\nVast numbers of children leave school with a total lack of basic skills; unable to read, spell, write legibly.  Numeracy to any useful level is a rarity. Introduce other subjects during secondary school.\r\nNot implementing the above means another school generation leaving with no hope of a worthwhile job.\r\nWith immediate effect, open all military bases and prepare to take young people for 2 years.  I would call it National Service  but call it what you like.  We have to get people off the streets, off drugs, off benefits and give them a sense of purpose.  Teach the 3 R`s, discover their vocation & help them achieve that skill during their service to the country.\r\n",
