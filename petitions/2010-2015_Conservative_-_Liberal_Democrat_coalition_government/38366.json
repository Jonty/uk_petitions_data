        "additional_details": "In these days of austerity and attacks on public sector pay and conditions, surely the Government should make their own contribution towards cutting the national debt.\r\nI suggest that they forsake their salary and pension rights.\r\nThis may sound ridiculous, however by merely becoming a minister opens many doors.  These ministers could make up their salaries by various other means, such as consultancy work, directorships, memoires, etc.  Obviously expenses would still be available where relevant and ethical.\r\nOne only has to look at Mr Blair, Mr Brown et al to realise this is one big gravy train.\r\nPlease vote for this and may be will can all be truly 'in this together'.",
