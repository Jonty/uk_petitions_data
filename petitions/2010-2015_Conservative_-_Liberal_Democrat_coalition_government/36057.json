Existing schemes like the Telephone Preference Service have no real power and are routinely ignored.  The government should act to give consumers the right to force service providers to stop delivering communications that they do not want to receive.  In the case of junk mail, this is costing local councils a lot of money in recycling.\r\nThis would affect the Royal Mail, BT and other telecom providers and internet service providers.  They should ask customers first if they want to receive such communications.  If not authorised, they should not deliver it.  It is no good expecting companies to police themselves such as with the TPS.  Service providers must be responsible.",
