        "additional_details": "Modern developments increasingly use rent charges to collect payments for services. Leaseholders have the right to challenge unreasonable charges in the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal. Owners of freehold property have no equal right to challenge unfair or unreasonable charges. This petition demands that freehold property owners are given the same rights as leasehold property owners in challenging unfair or unreasonable rent charges either in the LVT or a similar tribunal.",
