        "additional_details": "Cases of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) poisoning from BBC News Online:\r\n\r\nHuman: Lee Knight, deliberately poisoned, 2005 (severely disabled), Glennis Middleton, drank accidentally, 2002 (recovered). Martin Bingley, drink spiked, 2006 (blind and deaf). Accidental poisoning of 4 at a Crayford pub, 2003 (recovered).\r\n\r\nAnimal deaths reported first half of 2011, England: 16 cats, one dog, in a fortnight, Malvern. 9 cats dead, 2 missing, Harleston.  3 German shepherd dogs deliberately poisoned, Deal. 5 cats in one day, Norwich, 30 December 2010.  In 2007 the RSPCA took 41 calls about cats with anti-freeze poisoning, in 2010 they took 248.\r\n\r\nWe ask the government to investigate and take action to reduce this suffering.  Alternatives include:\r\n\r\n1)  The use of a bittering agent, as the sweet taste can be attractive.\r\n2)  The addition of a dye that will stain the mouth, aiding in swift diagnosis and treatment.\r\n3)  Change in use from ethylene glycol to safer propylene glycol.\r\n\r\nThank You!\r\n",
