        "additional_details": "The South Staffordshire Line between Stourbridge and Walsall has been closed to passengers since the Beeching Axe. This petition proposes that Network Rail and the Government financially support the reopening the line for passenger services again, bringing rail links to Brierley Hill, Dudley and Wednesbury. The line being used for freight would also highly benefit the local economy of the West Midlands, bringing much needed jobs to the area.\r\n",
