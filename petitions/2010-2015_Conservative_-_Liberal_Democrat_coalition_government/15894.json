Notably we have recently been dragged into two unethical and extremely costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and in many other instances as well our foregin policy has effectively not been our own. We could instead have a genuinely independent, positive and constructive role in the world and thereby improve our image and standing which would benefit our security and improve cohesion at home also.",
