        "additional_details": "We the undersigned beleive that a large increase in fuel duty for Road Freight Hauliers should be enacted ASAP. Also a drop in fuel duty for Rail Freight Companies (FOC's) and Passenger Train Operating Companies would also be Required to Create a Freight Modal Shift to Rail. Lower duty on Passenger Train Operators will encourage people to use Rail. This will lead to a more profitable railwaw. And with more trains running the increased revenue could go into major capital infrastructure projects.",
