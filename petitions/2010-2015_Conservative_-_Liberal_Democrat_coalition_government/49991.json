        "additional_details": "Michael Gove should resign as the Education Secretary before he can cause more damage to the already hurt education system or insult hard working students anymore. He has displayed an unwillingness to understand the demands that the current system puts upon students and instead is content to sit on his high chair and label all students as lazy and unworthy of the good grades they have worked for. For this he should resign.",
