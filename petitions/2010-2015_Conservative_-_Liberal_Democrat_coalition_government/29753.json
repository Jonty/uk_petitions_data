        "action": "Reduction in fuel tax for UK Cruise Lines",
        "additional_details": "In the current economic climate, cruise lines are having to pay high fuel taxes on low grade diesel fuel that they use for cruise liners. These costs are passed on to cruise agents like WeCruise (http://www.wecruise.co.uk) and to their customers.\r\n\r\nWith the travel industry struggling to keep prices of holidays affordable, there needs to be a temporary cut in fuel tax for all cruise lines sailing from UK ports. This will reduce prices and boost business in key UK ports like Southampton. Smaller independent agents will also benefit by being able to offer simple pricing.",
