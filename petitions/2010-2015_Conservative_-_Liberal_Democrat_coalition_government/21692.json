All ballots to be in this nations language.\r\n3.Non-residents will NOT have the right to vote no matter how lonmg in this country.\r\n4.Non-citizens will NEVER be able to hold political office.\r\n5.Foreigners will not be a burden to the taxpayers. No welfare, no food stamps, no health care, or any other assistance programmes.\r\n6. If foreigners come here and buy land. Options will be restricted.\r\n7. Foreigners may have no right to protest, no demonstrations,no political organizing.\r\n8. If you come to this country illegally. You will be actively found  and deported.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo strict,  these laws are the current immigration laws of most Muslim countries. These sound fine to me.. Now can we have these laws to be our laws??",
