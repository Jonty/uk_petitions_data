        "additional_details": "All past and present serving members have thier pensions taxed as unearned income, which in our [all exservicemen]view is wrong we have served our country to the best of our ability, to be hit with a big tax demand at 60 or 65 yrs and for all the years after. It all makes a mockery of the governments plans for people taking out these pensions, not to be told that you are going to be paying tax on what you have saved for a comfortable life style, but to find you are let down by those we have served for over the years. Leaves a nasty taste. Please review the forces pensions, to become nontaxable.",
