        "additional_details": "The penalty for late submission of PAYE returns should be human as for VAT, first a warning letter, then up the scale for repeat offences (e.g. over the next 3 years). Raise the upper limit to \u00a3200,000 to help small business growth. HMRC should have a duty of prompt notification to minimise penalties, or be obliged to reduce penalties for THEIR lateness. *** If businesses with a turnover of less than \u00a3150,000 fail to make a quarterly VAT return on time they are warned. If they reoffend within a year they are put into an escalating system of penalties, not necessarily including fines. This is fair. *** If that small business makes its annual PAYE return (P35 and P60s) late, it is instantly fined \u00a3100 per month, even if all employees (e.g. husband and wife) are paid below the ET (ST 2011-2012) so no PAYE or NI is payable by employee or employer (to minimise administration) - and because \"HMRC are so busy\", not informed for months when the penalty is already \u00a3400 or \u00a3500. This is unfair.",
