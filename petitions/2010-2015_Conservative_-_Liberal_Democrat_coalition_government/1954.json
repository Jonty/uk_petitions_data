A great deal of public money has been spent providing safe dedicated cycle ways, yet cyclists persist in ignoring them and use the road instead putting themselves and other road users at risk -imagine if car drivers adopted the same approach to using the roads!! I would suggest a law is passed to make their use compulsory.  ",
