Some of the children now believe that they gave the \"WRONG ANSWERS\" and blame themeselves for the schools current situation.\r\n\r\nThis is not about faith schools or free schools, this is about our children and their future.  Something has gone seriously wrong with this inspection process and needs to be addressed before it damages our children any further",
