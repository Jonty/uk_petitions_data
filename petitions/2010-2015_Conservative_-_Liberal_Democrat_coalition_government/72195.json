England should make a stance and withdraw from ALL FIFA programmes and seek to start a new World governing body to manage football in a non profit way. The fans should be involved in this organisation with a 50/50 share on the board.\r\nThere would be clear transparency on all matters so unlike the current secret FIFA body who have created jobs for the boys and clearly have NO interest in either the football fans or the beautiful game itself.\r\nLets make a stand NOW no matter how difficult it sounds we have to start somewhere,\r\n DON'T WE?????
