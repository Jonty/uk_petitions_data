It also resolved that IPSA should introduce, by 2015, a new pension scheme for hon. Members which is informed by the Commission's findings and their subsequent application to other public service pension schemes. On 22nd October 2012, the IPSA announced a consultation aimed at arriving at a long-term settlement for MPs pay and pensions. IPSA plans to publish further details in Autumn 2013, with changes taking place after the 2015 General Election.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found at www.parliamentarystandsards.org.uk.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
