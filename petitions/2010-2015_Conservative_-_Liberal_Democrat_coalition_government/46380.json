This applies to drug dealers too. confiscate the drugs, send them right back, let them take their chances with their suppliers. Why should the UK tax payers pay for the prison time, and all they claim once inside our borders!!!\r\nDoing this would make our country more secure, and empty some of the prisons, more room then for home grown criminals and terrorists. All the UK decent people can see this is what is needed, for goodness sake, why can't the UK government ? ",
