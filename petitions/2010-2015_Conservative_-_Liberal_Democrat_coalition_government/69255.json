Currently there is no warning, as a result most of my young dogs are dead, despite verbal assurances given by an Inspector of new homes, and being signed for new homes.  The following is the euthanasia figures of the RSPCA in recent years, 2007 66489, 2008 60203, 2009 63231, 2010 59384, 2011 53183, 2012 64295, 2013 in the region of 61,000 {figures are now given in graph form[.  In 2011 the RSPCA euthanized 10 of the 58 animals taken in under the Home for Life Service.  We ask the government to make the RSPCA put written warnings on this documentation, so the owner can make a better informed decision regarding the future of their animals",
