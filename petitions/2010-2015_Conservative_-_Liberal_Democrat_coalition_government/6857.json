        "additional_details": "\r\nWith the UK now potentially sitting on a massive store of Shale Gas we need three simple steps imposing on the industry.\r\n\r\n1 \u2013The industry should pay for an underwriting policy to cover any damage caused by tremors  - this local housing insurance costs/availability not affected.\r\n\r\n2 \u2013 Regulate the chemicals used in Fracking in the normal way.  List the chemicals, regulate by the normal authorities including those that regulate the UK waterways.   If cleaner fracking methods need to be found the industry WILL achieve this through R and D.\r\n\r\n3 \u2013 Tax  shale gas to subsidise renewables. Long term result from Fracking is that we have paid for green and sustainable generation for the future. In doing so jobs for the creation of green power should be UK based with a percentage of going to the areas where fracking is occurring.\r\n",
