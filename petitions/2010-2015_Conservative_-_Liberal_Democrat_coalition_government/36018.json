        "additional_details": "Transport minister Mike Penning announced on 4 July 2012 the closure of the entire DVLA network of 39 local offices, ten enforcement offices and three processing units by December 2013. There will no longer be a face-to-face DVLA service. Other impacts of closing these offices include weaker enforcement of vehicle licensing and increased crime. 79% of respondents in the recent consultation did not agree with the proposals yet, despite this, the minister has decided to proceed. Around 1,200 jobs will be lost across the country at a time when local communities can ill afford to lose them. We, the undersigned therefore deplore this attack on the vital services provided by an efficient and effective workforce and call upon the minister to reverse his decision to close the DVLA local offices, enforcement centres and processing units.
