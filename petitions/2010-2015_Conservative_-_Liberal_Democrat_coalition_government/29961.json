It causes people who listen to it to go into a zombie like state where they are unable to communicate with other members of society.\r\n\r\n2. It causes listeners to ignore personal hygiene, become squatters and grow dreadlocks.\r\n\r\n3. The frequencies Psychedelic Trance music produces are those also know as \"Satans Chord\". These frequencies are used to open portals to the underworld where Satan's minions will rise from and bring rapture to the World.\r\n\r\nBAN PSYTRANCE TO SAVE THE WORLD!",
