        "additional_details": "The residential areas next to the train line are used to routine noise from passing trains during the times that they are running. Recently there has been a large maintenance train parked up on the track that is next to Chairmakers Close in Princes Risborough. There have been isolated incidents over the past few months, however for the last two days the train has started up its engines at 1am and has continued until the morning. I have called network rail who were largely unhelpful, however have been informed that this will be happening pretty much every night until the middle of July to extend a platform at the station.\r\n\r\n-Why does the train have to be parked up in a residential area when there are miles of track that are not inhibited?\r\n-Why are the engines left running for hours on end with no activity?\r\n-Why does it have to be at such long antisocial hours?\r\n-Why did we receive no prior notice?\r\n",
