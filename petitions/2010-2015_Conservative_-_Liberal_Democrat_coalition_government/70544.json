RSPCA stats back this up.  As does evidence that children who are cruel to animals usually go on to do the same to humans.\r\n\r\nI would like to see a nationally-kept register of such people, especially those prosecuted and given various animal-keeping bans, so that these can be upheld even if the person moves to a new area.\r\n\r\nI further suggest this information is available to registered charities dealing with animal rescue and rehoming.
