        "additional_details": "Nationalise vehicular tunnels under the river Tyne.\r\n\r\nAt an annual cost of \u00a3640 per car, this is an unfair 'tax' on a local workforce many of whom will be on minimum wage. For many there is not an alternative.\r\n\r\nThe alternative,Tyne Bridge crossing does not require a toll but for many living and working in the North East its position makes it an unrealistic alternative. Thus, the added cost of travel for regular Tyne Tunnel users has become a post code tax.\r\n\r\nMake work pay! Scrap the toll!",
