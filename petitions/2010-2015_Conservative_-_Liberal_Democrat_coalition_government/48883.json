        "additional_details": "It is vital in a democracy that people detained by the State have the ability to challenge their treatment and detention in the courts with the provision of free legal aid. We call on the the Government to rescind its harsh and unfair proposals to cut prison law legal aid because it is unfair, and it is also wrong that the Government which is so often the defendant to such prisoner challenges should exercise a Parliamentary power to stop such challenges from even beginning in the first place.",
