        "additional_details": "The Football Association should look to introducing strict measures to eradicate bad behaviour on pitch from a few players.\r\n\r\nIf a player indulges in grossly dangerous or unfair play they are booked, but that does not really affect the team except in red card instances. If the team saves the match that foul is quickly forgotten. Gross fouls which help a team win a match occasionally garner accolades for the player such as he took one for the team.\r\n\r\nThe only way to stamp these out would be for the team to be docked points or collectively penalised by granting the opposition a walkover. This way it would be in the interest of the team to ensure that each player played a fair and honest game of football.\r\n\r\nSportspersons including footballers are big role models for kids around the world. What their impressionable young minds are seeing is that a foul is only a foul if you get caught by the referee. Maybe 4 yellow cards in a game should result in the opposition getting a walkover.\r\n",
