        "additional_details": "We request that HM Government consider the plight of students with disabilities, neurological difference or medical difficulties before making any changes to examinations at 16.\r\nPeople with Asperger's Syndrome and Autism Spectrum Disorders are often society's most creative thinkers, who could enhance the future of the world - but with an exam only route to higher education many will not make it.\r\nPeople with disabilities and variable medical conditions can't always peak on the day or sustain periods of high pressure, but that doesn't mean that they aren't gifted and talented.\r\nIn the post Paralympic period when we saw differently abled athletes shine - it is not the right time to set up an exam system which will discriminate against so many clever but differently abled scholars.",
