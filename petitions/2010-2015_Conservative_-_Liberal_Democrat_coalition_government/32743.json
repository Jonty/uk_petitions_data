        "additional_details": "The Royal Victoria Hall was the first municipal theatre built in England under the Local Government Act 1894. It was erected to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria and was opened in 1900. The Royal Victoria Hall has been  at the heart of Southborough and Tunbridge Wells Community for many years.\r\nThe current council have made this very difficult for the local community and businesses. Consequently due to increase in hire costs and the rigidity in their approach the local community are able to use the facilities less and less and it is now under threat of closure or changes from its intended use. Please support us in keeping our Hall/Theatre at the heart of our community and not let it close or change from what the community has grown to love.",
