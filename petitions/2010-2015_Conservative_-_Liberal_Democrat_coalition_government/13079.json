        "additional_details": "As the number of people registered with Telephone Preference Service, (TPS), grows, some telephone marketing companies now seem to be using the pretense of carrying out telephone surveys to get around the TPS regulations, this is because survey calls are still allowed under the TPS. To prevent this abuse of the TPS, I would like the Government to include unsolicited survey calls in the TPS regulations to stop this abuse, and give us the peace we desire and demand in our own homes. Please help close this loophole by supporting this petition to include unsolicited survey calls with the TPS regulations.",
