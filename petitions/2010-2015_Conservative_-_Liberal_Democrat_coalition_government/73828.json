Two years later he made his first appearance for England and between 1964 and 1982, he went on to play 108 Tests for his country, scoring a then world record 8,114 runs including 22 centuries.  His career total of 48,246 first-class runs is the most by any batsman since the Second World War.\r\n\r\nIn 2002 he was diagnosed with throat cancer, and despite being gravely ill he bravely overcame this awful illness.  He has since raised large amounts of money for charitable causes and has become a hugely respected broadcaster and commentator on both television and radio.\r\n\r\nIn 2012 and 2013, he was president of Yorkshire Cricket Club.\r\n\r\nAt 74 years old it is now time for Mr Boycott to be awarded a well deserved knighthood.",
