        "additional_details": "Females born 1951-1954 are denied a state pension and Freedom Bus Pass at age 60. The Equal Pay Act 1970 means that females working prior to that Act received lower wages than males doing the same work. The Pensions Acts 2008 & 2011 are equalising the state pension age for men and women. Raising the state pensions age by up to 6 years for women. Men and women born in 1951,1952,1953 are all entitled to a Freedom Bus Pass at the revised state pension age. Because of the Equal Pay Act 1970, women born between 1951 and 1954 are entitled to a state pension and a Freedom Bus Pass at 60. I urge the Government to amend the Pension Acts 2008 and 2011 in view of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and re-instate the state pension and Freedom Bus Pass for women born in and before 1954.",
