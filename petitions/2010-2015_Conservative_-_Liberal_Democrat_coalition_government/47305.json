        "additional_details": "Tens of thousands of people across the legal services industry could lose their jobs over the next year as a direct result of the government\u2019s savage civil justice reforms.\r\n\r\nAnd it's the 'Human Toll' of these reforms that the government has ignored with non-legal staff such as secretaries and administrative staff bearing the brunt of job losses.\r\n\r\nThe government says these reforms will reduce insurance premiums \u2013 even though the insurers admit they will make no difference. In pandering to the wishes of the insurance lobby, this government will jeopardise the lives of many families across the UK.\r\n\r\nIf the government hikes the small claims limit  from \u00a31000-\u00a35000 most claimant, and defendant law firms will close, forcing thousands of support staff into unemployment.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to STOP any further changes to the legal industry and protect jobs.\r\n\r\nSAY NO - to raising the small claims limit from \u00a31000 to \u00a35000",
