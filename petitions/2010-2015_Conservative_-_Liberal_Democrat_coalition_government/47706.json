This must be revised. The telephone service is inefficient and needs changes.When attending Jobcentre Plus the staff have not been trained to deal with clients to resolve issues. I therefore propose that the Government must address these issues with the utmost urgency and press for change to improve the failing system currently provided by the Department of Work and Pensions and the Jobcentre Plus. .
