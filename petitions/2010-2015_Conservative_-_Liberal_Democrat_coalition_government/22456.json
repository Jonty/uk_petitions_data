The House also resolved that IPSA should introduce, by 2015, a new pension scheme for hon. Members which is informed by the Commission's findings and their subsequent application to other public service pension schemes. On 22nd October 2012, the IPSA announced a consultation aimed at arriving at a long-term settlement for MPs pay and pensions. The first stage of the consultation is open until 7th December 2012.\r\n\r\nMore information, and the opportunity to respond, can be found at www.parliamentarystandards.org.uk.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
