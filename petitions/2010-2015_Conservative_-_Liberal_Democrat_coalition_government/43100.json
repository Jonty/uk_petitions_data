This would severely reduce the amount of fiscal resources wasted on the growing drug trade and reduce the attraction of the trade.\r\n\r\nHowever drugs should not be used in the presence of babies and children. If found committing such an act the user should be put before a court and given firstly a fine and if this proceeds a prison term. The money gained from fines and savings can be used to educate and fund rehabilitation schemes. And drug use in public should be targeted in the same way.\r\n\r\nI also propose that any medical conditions that arise from drug use that require treatment by the NHS be paid for by the user or at least a proportion of it. If i choose not to take drugs i choose not to give them my money. This would not stop the NHS debt problem but provide a buffer and discourage drug use. The same approach may be taken to smoking.\r\n\r\n",
