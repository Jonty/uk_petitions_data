        "action": "Stop 'Government Backed Schemes' companies from using international and withheld numbers",
        "additional_details": "Whilst we welcome the provision of 'Government backed schemes', the companies who offer to carry out the work often employ annoying methods to obtain the work. Households are receiving recorded telephone calls from international or withheld telephone numbers, even when the receiving number is registered with the Telephone Preference Service. The TPS doesn't deal with international calls and withheld calls mean you are unable to obtain the company and name to allow you to report them to the TPS.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the Government to make it a condition for any company providing a service under these Government Backed Schemes to:\r\n\r\n1 - adhere to the conditions of the Telephone Preference Service.\r\n2 - make their telephone number visible so people can view the number calling them.\r\n3 - restrict these companies to making their calls from the United Kingdom only.
