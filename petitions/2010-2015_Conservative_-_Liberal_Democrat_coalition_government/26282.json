        "additional_details": "We request the validity times of the 16-25 Railcard without incurring minimum fare to be extended.\r\n\r\nAs students we already incur a lot of debt. With fares rising every year and being unable to use discount, we will be unable to attend education courses anymore. It already is very hard for us to make ends meet.\r\n\r\nIn other countries students receive statutory discounts for rail travel of even 51% and they do not need to pay any minimum fares at all. Therefore we are asking to modify the conditions of the 16-25 Railcard in the way so they allow us using the card without incurring the minimum fare during school days.",
