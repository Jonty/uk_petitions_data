        "additional_details": "The Victoria Arches were a series of arches built in the embankment of the River Irwell in Manchester. They served as business premises, landing stages for Steam packet riverboats and as World War II air-raid shelters. They were accessed from wooden staircases which descended from Victoria Street\r\n\r\nBuilt in 1838 they have survived the test of time but are now under threat. Other towns and cities (such as stockport) have opened such spaces up to tourism.\r\n\r\nSave a piece of our nations history before it is lost forever",
