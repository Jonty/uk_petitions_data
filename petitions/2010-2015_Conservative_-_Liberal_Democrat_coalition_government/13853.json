        "additional_details": "I would like to see UEFA balloted to change the set-up or name of the Champions League. At present 22 teams go directly into the group stages of the Champions League with only 13 of them being champions. Surely to call this the champions league & to sell it to consumers as such is against the trade description act 1968. I would like to see UEFA either being forced to change the name of the competition or to change the make-up of the 22 teams who go directly into the league stages to the top 22 association champions from their co-efficiency. If associations are to have 3 & 4 teams them they should be made to qualify at different entry rounds during the qualifiers. This would ensure that more champions were playing in the group stages & give the competition more credibility.",
