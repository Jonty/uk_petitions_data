This means the general public can not listen to ATC traffic in the UK (but can listen to ATC in the US!).\r\n\r\nA licence is not required for a radio receiver as long as it is not capable of transmission as well (The Wireless Telegraphy Apparatus (Receivers) (Exemption) Regulations 1989 (SI 1989 No 123).\r\n\r\nAlthough it is not illegal to sell, buy or own a scanning or other receiver in the UK, it must only be used to listen to transmissions meant for GENERAL RECEPTION.\r\nIt is an offence to listen to any other radio services unless you are authorised by a designated person to do so.\r\n\r\nChanging the law to designate Commercial ATC (not Military) to general reception will allow enthusiasts and training the chance to listen in.\r\n\r\nSpecific Ofcom publication to be found here: http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/ra/publication/ra_info/ra169r7.pdf",
