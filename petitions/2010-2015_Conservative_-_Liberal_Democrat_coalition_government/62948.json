We are trying to reduce knives and gun crime yet manufactures are allowed to sell them as toys to our young innocent children. Whether as parents you allow or not allow this they can still get hold of these toys through other children. I'm disgusted that children use these toys in the way they are used in real like. I truly think the manafactures should not be allowed to sell any form of this as a you to children. Please help me stop this. ",
