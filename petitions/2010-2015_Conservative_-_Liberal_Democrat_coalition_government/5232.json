Land line users should have the right to deny access to all who do not provide a contact phone number.  I consider that I have a right to privacy in my own home.  I'm fed up of picking up my phone to hear no one at the other end.  I'm particularly concerned for:\r\n1. The elderly who are easily put at unease.\r\n2. The self employed who are deflected from adding value to our economy by unsolicited calls.\r\n3.  Those anxiously waiting for important phone calls.\r\n4.  Those plagued by malicious calls.  ",
