I would like it to be brought back, this would make 'criminals' who have committed an infraction more employable, and less likely to commit further crime.\r\nThe cost of keeping criminals behind bars seems to be aggravated by the comforts they are allowed (such as T.Vs and DVD players). Such items are luxuries that they should forfeit on imprisonment. They should not be considered a human right.",
