While some wards do see changes between parties at elections, many stick with the same parties and councillors, time after time.  Where's the incentive to get things done before handing on a new legacy to the next generation?  Why make it so difficult for new people to break into local politics?  Bring in fixed terms and gain local dynamism.",
