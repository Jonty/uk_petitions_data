        "additional_details": "Increase tax credits from incomes below \u00a340,000 to less than \u00a355,000 to increase the level of disposable income for families living with 'hidden poverty' in middle incomes. These families have faced massive increases in food, fuel, utility costs & childcare. It is unsustainable and only putting greater pressure on a fragile economy.\r\n\r\nMany are unable to invest in a pension as there is no money left to plan for the future.Quantative easing has\r\nonly increased future concerns as it has lead to\r\na fall in future pension values.\r\n\r\nBoost the economy by increasing the spending\r\npower of middle income households.\r\n\r\nObtain savings by abolishing family allowance\r\nfor all families earning above \u00a360, 000. Link tax credit payments directly to payroll tax adjustments to avoid human error and unnecessary duplication and the reliance on individual updates.\r\n    ",
