        "additional_details": "This is a petition to help keep equal opportunities for all, the rising university fees discriminate against those people who are from lower income backgrounds and cant afford to pay the amounts asked. This petition aims to get the university fees lowered or asks the government to educate young people in how to cope with the rise in fees. Did you know that of the universities in England charging the maximum \u00a39,000 tuition fees only 29% are Russell Group universities? This means the price of education doesn't relate directly to the quality of the education received. We hope to make a change, please sign.\r\n",
