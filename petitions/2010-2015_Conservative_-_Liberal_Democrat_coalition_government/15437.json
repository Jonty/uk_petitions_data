As these claims are hardly ever brought to any reasonable conclusion other than the fraudulent claimant receiving a nice tax free loan and no fear of any real prosecution making it a rather nice proposition for those with low morals. HMRC should prosecute ALL false claims and recover the monies or enforce custodial sentences in the same manner that they would for tax evasion. 25% of claims are false, kind of sums up why this country has no money. Fraudsters and thieves are NOT ENTITLED to anything other than public contempt and as such should prosecuted and used as a public poster campaign to deter the 25% of the pond-life that use this system as a career choice from an early age.
