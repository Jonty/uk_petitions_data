Adults in a more senior position, such as a Head of Year, Pastoral Support Worker or Deputy Head, should have to know more about mental illnesses and also where and how to give certain exemptions to a student with such misfortunes.\r\nFor example, a suicidal student with insomnia, severe depression and anxiety should not be expected to have the same attendance, concentration span and punctuality in school as a perfectly mentally-stable peer. It is also extremely unreasonable to punish someone in such a position in the same way as you would a normal underachiever who just cannot be bothered to move.\r\nI would like it to be compulsory for a student in such a position, if they tell a teacher so, to be allowed to be excused from the normal school rules.",
