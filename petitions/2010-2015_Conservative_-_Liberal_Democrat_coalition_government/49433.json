Everyone who could be affected needs to know the plan and what they should do if it needs to be put into action.\r\nPlanning for a volcanic eruption includes:\r\ncreating an exclusion zone around the volcano\r\nbeing ready and able to evacuate residents\r\nhaving an emergency supply of basic provisions, such as food\r\nfunds need to be available to deal with the emergency and a good communication system needs to be in place\r\nVolcanos in Iceland and Yellowstone Park will not necessarily give notice and could have devastating effects on the UK as well as Europe. Satellites and communications, electricity, gas, water and transport can all be seriously damaged.\r\nThere does not even appear to be a government department responsible for such an event, which demonstrates how unprepared we are for an disaster which could be on our doorstep.
