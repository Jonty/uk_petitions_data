        "additional_details": "This is a proposal to present an incentive to the British people to either continue to work or to go out and find a job. It proposes a voluntary contribution of \u00a31 from the salaries of those paying income tax into a fund whereby at the end of each calendar month the sum is divided among a proportion of the contributors as chosen at random from the National Insurance numbers in the \u2018pot\u2019. The proportion beneficiaries would get would be dependent on the cost to run the incentive divided by a flat payout expected from the remaining \u2018pot\u2019. E.g. the first month brings in \u00a31,000,000. The cost to run is \u00a3250,000 leaving \u00a3750,000 to be divided amongst its contributors at a flat rate of \u00a350,000 per person which would see 750/50=15 contributors rewarded with a sum of \u00a350,000. They would become ineligible to receive a payout again for 12 months.\r\n\r\nPlease note the sums are purely arbitrary and the eligibility of contributors negotiable to the point that the contributor must by employed.\r\n",
