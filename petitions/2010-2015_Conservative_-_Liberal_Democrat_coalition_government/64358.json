        "additional_details": "after checking the stagecoach gold timetables, i noticed that plymouth to torquay gets a service 7 days a week and services finish around 11pm.\r\n\r\ni feel that this is unfair to the people of the Dartmouth service as our last bus leaves torquay at 1745. and has NO services on a sunday at all which i don't see as fair or good to customers.\r\n\r\nthe point of this petition is to get extra services put on during the week and to have a sunday service put on so we get treated fairly and have the same as the plymouth run",
