        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\n  A person is unable to go in to a chemist to get  emergency  EpiPen's which  may  save a life of a person who suffer from anaphylaxis   with out a prescription\r\n\r\n In the event of an anaphylactic shock, an EpiPen can be used to stop swelling of the throat and tongue. Without this treatment, anaphylaxis is potentially a life-threatening event and can be fatal in minutes.\r\n\r\n ,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n I am therefore proposing that the Government introduce new legislation  called sarah-jane law to require all restaurants,public places etc to stock EpiPens & be able to administer such medication .that  should any person require it.\r\nAlso that the government should introduce a card that a person who suffer from anaphylaxis ,can carry with them at all times . And in the case of unfortunate events people can take it to the chemist and receive epi pen's to hopefully save the life of the person who suffers anaphylaxis ",
