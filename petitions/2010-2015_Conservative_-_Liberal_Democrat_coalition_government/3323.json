In far too many instances this has been proven that their judgement was totally wrong, with these people committing the same or worse crimes again and again. When this happens, I would like to see the people on the Parole Board held accountable for their actions and given a custodial sentence themselves as they have just released a potentially deadly weapon onto our streets. How many so called experts would then be so quick to say these people can now be safely released back into our society. ",
