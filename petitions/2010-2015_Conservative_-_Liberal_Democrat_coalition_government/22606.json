A great investment for all.\r\n\r\nSurely it is illegal to move the goal posts with little notice under the European Law.  The rest of us have to adhere to what we have set out within our businesses by law otherwise we would be in BREACH OF CONTRACT. So why does the British Government say 'do as I say' NOT as I do'???\r\n\r\nOther countries eg Poland do not suffer with electrical bills like we do.  Let the UK citizen choose\r\nand help take Britain forward with the initial FIT 43.3p as initially stated. BREACH OF CONTRACT TO UK CITIZENS/COMPANIES?\r\n",
