        "additional_details": "Government should legislate to make defibrillators compulsory in all schools.\r\nAll schools should have sufficient defibrillators in prominent positions such that any person suffering a cardiac arrest can be reached within 3 minutes from the defibrillator location.\r\nIt is believed up to 270 cardiac arrests occur annually in UK schools.   When someone goes into cardiac arrest, every minute without CPR and defibrillation reduces their chance of survival.\r\n\r\nAppropriate ratio of personnel trained in CPR and defibrillation should be established according to the population of the school.  A major part of a child\u2019s life is in school and some of the activities they take part in can provoke  a cardiac arrest. There is also a high footfall of teachers, staff, parents, etc. all potentially at risk of cardiac arrest.   A defibrillator at a school would be available to help anybody who goes in to cardiac arrest giving them the best chance of survival in vital first minutes\r\n",
