A harsh shock tactic for anyone who thinks of prison as being easy, even a short sentence will make people think twice before committing an offence. Depending on whether the prisoner is cooperating, the system becomes more flexible over the next two months. Longer time to socialise, a tv in the cell, books, but everything is earned through good behaviour. Month three rehabilitation begins, teaching the prisoner the skills they will need to lead a normal life. This balances punishment of not wanting to go to prison and giving the skills they need when out. Prisoners who have drug addiction will go through stricter policy for them to have zero access to drugs. Dedicated anti drug management prisons...Prisoners who are mentally ill to be removed from prisons and placed somewhere where they can be given the proper treatment required.",
