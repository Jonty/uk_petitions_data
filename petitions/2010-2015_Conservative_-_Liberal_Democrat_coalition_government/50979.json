Anyone caught not equipped with either/both should receive an on the spot fine and a point on the licence.\r\n\r\nIf they are caught without a licence, or have reached the maximum, the police are allowed to immediately confiscate the bicycle.\r\n\r\nBicycle insurance should also be needed. This would be based upon the rider, rather than the bicycle (so the insurance would cover them on any bicycle). ",
