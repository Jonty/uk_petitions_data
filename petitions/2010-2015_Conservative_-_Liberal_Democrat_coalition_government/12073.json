        "additional_details": "Climate change is potentially a major problem, and the UK has targets to reduce its CO2 emissions, but currently fossil fuels are generally cheaper sources of electricity generation than nuclear power or renewable energy sources. A carbon tax on using fossil fuels for electricity generation would encourage energy companies to use alternative energy sources. This would provide funds for the government to subsidise renewable and nuclear energy and help make homes more energy efficient, all of which would help to reduce CO2 emissions.  ",
