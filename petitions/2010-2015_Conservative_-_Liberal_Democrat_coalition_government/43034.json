        "additional_details": "In 2011, the government established a Home Affairs Select Committee on Drugs.\r\n\r\nHundreds of NGOs, youth workers, former and current drug users, and professionals in the drugs sector submitted evidence to the committee.\r\n\r\nThe Committee has now published its report and is calling for a Royal Commission to be set up to reform the drug laws in the United Kingdom. This country's drug laws are no longer fit for purpose - we are fighting a losing battle against drugs. The people we seek to protect from the harms caused by drugs and their associated social problems are the ones most being harmed by the current laws.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned urge the government to support the recommendations of the Committee and to establish a Royal Commission for Drug Law Reform.
