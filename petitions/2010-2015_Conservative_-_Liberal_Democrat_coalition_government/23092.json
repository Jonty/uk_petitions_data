Apprentices often have to work a full time job 30 - 37.5hours a week as well as complete a qualification, an NVQ for example.\r\n\r\nThis is cheap labour for employers and frankly an insult to those young adults who take part in these apprenticeships. The Government is trying to promote apprenticeships, the wage is a major issue and should be addressed.\r\n",
