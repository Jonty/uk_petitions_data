        "additional_details": "A great deal of emphasis has been placed on the importance and numerous advantages of attending university and pursuing further education, but an issue we feel is not being addressed is the methods in which going to university can be made possible for all students of different backgrounds and religious groups.\r\n\r\nGoing to university is something we all aspire to do, but due to repayments being at the real interest rate, the current Student Loans System is incompatible with the Islamic faith.\r\n\r\nWhilst you have identified a Shar\u012b\u2018ah-compliant model, which may be implementable through the Student Loans Company, to assist those, both Muslim and non-Muslim, so affected, no earlier than the academic years from 2016-2017,this delay would clearly be very damaging to the educational prospects of affected students.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we have signed this petition to urge you to move the development of an alternative model so the proposed three to four year is considerably shortened.\r\n\r\n",
