        "additional_details": "DWP and Benefit employees at present have the power to stop any and all money claimed in benefits.\r\nI wish to petition the DWP and all Benefit agencies that if a claim is already in place, and has been for a number of weeks, months or years, and a decision has been made to adjust down for whatever reason.   The claimant should be notified that future payments well be effected after last payment is received.  This single power to stop benefits for innocent claimants as well as the guilty is wholly unjust.  Innocent claimants are not expecting to have their benefit adjusted in any way and they do not make provisions on their already low income.  The DWP and Benefit agencies have the full backing of the Inland Revenue and legal system to recover the 14days of  last claim should they find fit to recover. This however would allow the innocent claimants to make provisions, appeal, seek advice, or claim any hardship benefit, and not be left without funds.\r\n",
