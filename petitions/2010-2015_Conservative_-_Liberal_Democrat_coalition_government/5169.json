        "additional_details": "Public funding of research and development is skewed towards military projects: our military R&D spend is several times that of health.\r\n\r\nThe government should progressively rebalance this spending in favour of peaceful research, not least to invest in our health.\r\n\r\nA particular case in point is dementia: some 3/4 million people in this country are suffering from the horrors of dementia and this number is rising. Treatment costs billions but there is no cure, we can't even arrest the neurological decay. Professor Clive Ballard of the Alzheimer's Society says that there is \"a pitiful lack of investment\" in the necessary research to discover the biological mechanisms involved and develop effective treatment.",
