These Acts were used to by-pass the authority of the House of Lords in order for the Government to force its own agenda.\r\nIn 1910 Prime Minister Asquith, in an attempt to pass a Finance Bill which had been rejected by the House of Lords, put political pressure on the House of Lords by threatening to create 500 new peers. The purpose of the these new peers was to vote for the closure of the House of Lords. Attempting to interfere with the authority of the House of Lords is an act of treason under the, still extant,1848 Treason Fellony Act. The 1848 Act prevents the House of Commons and the House of Lords from interfering with each others cognisance to carry out their own business in their own way, and that includes all who sit in either house.
