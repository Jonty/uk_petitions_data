Lossing these are hindering people in their 20's and early thirties with getting jobs or being able to drive large vehicles or tow. It can cost up and over \u00a32000 for people to get the same categories that people have who passed before  1997, this is unfair that people with \"grandfather rights\" are able to drive with no further test! Please bring it back to all licences and reinstall it on people who passed after 1997. ",
