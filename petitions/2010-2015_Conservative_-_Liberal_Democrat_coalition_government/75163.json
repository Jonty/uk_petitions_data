        "additional_details": "You don't use analysing poetry in the real world, so what is the point in doing it?When you have finished school, you will not have to analyse the poem and write about the meaning, you would read a poem for fun. I've studied poetry and there is no one I know that has actually understood a poem that is being taught and all find it useless, boring and a waste of our time so it should be stopped.Do you really want your children to be studying something that they will never use and has no importance in the rest of our lives? I understand that poetry in primary school can be fun as you don't really analyse it you just read and may write your own but at secondary school you do not need that knowledge.",
