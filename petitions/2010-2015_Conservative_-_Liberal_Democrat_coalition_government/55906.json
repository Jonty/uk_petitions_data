There is no regulation that protects girls and boys from changing in front of the opposite sex. This is a direct contravention of every child\u2019s right to privacy. It encourages teasing, poor body image and inability to determine what is right from wrong when children are faced with decisions to say \u2018NO\u2019 when it comes to their own bodies. They are just made to comply, regardless of how this makes them feel.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to review this regulation. Children as young as five should be allowed to change without the opposite gender.",
