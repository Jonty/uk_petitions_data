        "action": "Listed properties should be exempt of proposed mansion tax",
        "additional_details": "The Government has a major chance to support the UK's built Heritage by exempting listed properties from any proposed mansion tax.\r\nThis would financially support existing owners who already have the burden of high running and maintenance costs. It would encourage new investment as many potential purchasers currently overlook listed buildings. It would give listed buildings a deserved tax advantage.\r\nIf listed buildings are NOT exempt then what would be the incentive for owners to maintain and improve these properties as any increase in value will result in an increased tax liability? In fact many owners may decide to allow properties fall into poor condition in order to cap their tax liability or in order not to breach the proposed \u00a32m threshold.\r\nThe economic and social benefit would outweigh any tax revenue raised. If the Government wants to ensure the future viability of the UK's built heritage then make owning a listed property a more desirable prospect.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
