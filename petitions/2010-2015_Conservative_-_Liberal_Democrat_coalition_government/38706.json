        "additional_details": "The government e-petitions service adds nothing to our democratic system. It functions like the \"close door\" button on a lift, doing nothing but making people feel like they have control, when in reality there is nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nThese petitions barely even receive lip service if they ever pass the threshold for a debate. Government e-petitions are just another tool to allow them to pretend to listen when they're doing nothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nWe don't need this service from the government, and would be better off without them.",
