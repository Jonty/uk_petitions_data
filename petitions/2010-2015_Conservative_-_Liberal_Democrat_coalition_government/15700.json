        "additional_details": "Heatham House - one of London's largest youth centres - is facing possible closure in order for the site to be developed into a boutique hotel. While the centre would be moved to a different location, the facilities there would be extremely limited and hundreds of youths would suffer. We are canvasing the local Twickenham council to persuade them that is action must not be taken, and to do all they can to prevent it from happening.",
