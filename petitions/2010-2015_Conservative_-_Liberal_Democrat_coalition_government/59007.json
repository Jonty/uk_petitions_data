        "additional_details": "We as a village and surrounding areas are extremely concerned for the safety of pedestrians and drivers. There have been numerous accidents over the past few years, two in the last 24 hours in the same place! One involving two 11 year old local girls trying to cross the very busy road after getting off there school bus! We are aware that speed limits are being reduced,but this just isn't enough! A few ideas, speed cameras like baston/langtoft nearby? Mobile police cameras? Ideally traffic lights and a crossing for the safety of the many school children in this village! Something more has to be done, before things get worse. As it is some motorists ignore the local speed limits, even through the 30mph villages.\r\nOutcome, ideally traffic lights and crossing at both busy junctions, if not, speed control/cameras in place.",
