Not only would this help the pub industry, which has suffered recently, but more importantly it would allow a large number of people to enjoy watching the matches in a public setting.\r\nThe government previously allowed pubs to stay open for the Royal Wedding and the Jubilee, however does not believe this once in 4 years occasion is a matter \"of national importance\".\r\nI believe many people in this country would disagree with this.",
