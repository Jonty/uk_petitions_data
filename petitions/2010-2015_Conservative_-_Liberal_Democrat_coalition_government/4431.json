        "action": "Update the law on licensed dog breeding",
        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned call on the Government to review and revise outdated legislation on dog breeding to bring licensing rules in line with modern understanding of dog welfare.\r\n\r\nUnder laws dating back to 1971, dog breeders who have more than 5 litters per year must be licensed by their local authorities.\r\n\r\nLocal authorities' duties to consider the welfare of dogs in granting licences and inspecting premises are minimal.\r\n\r\nIn particular they have no duty to consider whether the resulting establishment looks after dogs in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 nor to ensure prosecution if it does not.\r\n\r\nNot all licensed breeders follow bad practice.  But there are many large scale puppy farms in which dogs' welfare and health are grossly neglected and which produce puppies that will never make good pets.\r\n\r\nThe laws on licensing dog breeders should urgently be brought into line with modern understanding of dog welfare.\r\n\r\n",
