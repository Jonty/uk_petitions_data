        "additional_details": "Michael and Debi Pearl are the \"proud\" writers of a highly controversial and evil \"parenting\" book named \"To Train Up A Child\".\r\nI recently read that two parents in Washington, America have been found guilty of murder after allegedly following the abusive parenting techniques advocated in this such book.\r\nRightly so, they received maximum prison sentences after being found guilty of beating and starving their adopted daughter to death. The methods they used to \"discipline\" their daughter were advocated in this \"Christian\" book.\r\nThe Pearls book supports child abuse, torture and horrific \"teaching techniques\" as a way of \"discipline\".\r\n\"To Train Up A Child\" is given out free at churches in America, is sent free to Military families and is also available to buy on Amazon.\r\nPLEASE help put a start to banning the publication and sale of this incredibly evil book by signing this petition and in doing so we can help save so many children from its cruel and inhumane \"teachings\".",
