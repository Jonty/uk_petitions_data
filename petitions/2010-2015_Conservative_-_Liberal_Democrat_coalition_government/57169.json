        "additional_details": "Why do we no longer have Grammer Schools? The Conservatives answer is that it is elitist. Surely it is the opposite of that becasue it allows less well of people the chance at an excellent education rivaling (academically at least) the experiecne of public school. At the moment there are only 164 grammer schools in the UK and if we could double that over the next 5 years, I believe are education system would benefit. Not only does it allow intelligent children a chance of developing their education, but it also means that a university degree is not needed to be able to get a decent job. It is a more demoratic education system, and a fairer country is a better country.",
