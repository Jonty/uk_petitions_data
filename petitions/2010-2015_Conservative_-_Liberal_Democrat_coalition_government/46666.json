Open up the hard shoulder during busy times. Those of us who use the M6 regularly know that this simply doesn't work\r\n\r\nWe propose that the government buy the M6 Toll and make it a free to use motorway for everyone\r\n\r\nOpening it up would allow a lot of passing traffic and a lot of lorries to completely skip the troublesome stretch this would greatly reduce congestion, accidents and the money spent on them and more importantly SAVE LIVES.\r\n\r\nIt may even bring more money/business/workers to the area as the commute will be a lot easier.\r\n",
