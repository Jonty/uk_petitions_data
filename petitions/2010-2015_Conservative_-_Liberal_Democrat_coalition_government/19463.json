        "additional_details": "The extortionate price of motor insurance is forcing people to drive uninsured. Young drivers are being pushed off the roads because they cannot afford the approximate price of around \u00a38000 for a car valued at \u00a3600  It is time this industry is regulated. We see all the T.V adverts relating to car insurance and not one relates to any young person who has just passed their test. The price of car insurance has risen by a third in the last 12 months. What is the point of having no claims bonus when it goes up in price anyway. Please sign our petition  to make the Government sit up and listen.",
