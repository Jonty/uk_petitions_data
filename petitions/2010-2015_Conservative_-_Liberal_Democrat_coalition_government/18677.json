        "additional_details": "The ECB has decided not to award Edgbaston an Australian Test Match in 2013, this decision is wrong and Dept for Culture, Media and Sport need to get the ECB to reconsider.  Reasons why Edgbaston should get a test match\r\n1. Largest capacity outside London giving the opportunity for more people to enjoy the game and feel good about England\r\n2. Australians fear Edgbaston particularly after 2005\r\n3. Edgbaston has built a new stand costing \u00a332 million with the approval of the ECB and this now has the best facilities in the country\r\n4. Test matches bring revenue and job and the West Midlands need these\r\n5. The England team love playing at Edgbaston they call the crowd England's 12th man",
