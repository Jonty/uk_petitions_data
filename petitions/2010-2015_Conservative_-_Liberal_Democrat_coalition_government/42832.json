        "additional_details": "Sport/School/Community hall prices across the UK have created a situation for minority sports that is now impossible to survive. Prices are already extortionate! \u00a350-60 per hour and continue to rise every year. How can we develop sport in this country? How can we combat obesity and attract young athletes to activity in a situation like this? Halls lie empty during the day because schools cannot afford to use them. Children need to associate their local sports centre with sport/activity/fun and something they could afford to use.This message will pass down to future generations. Halls are lying empty at night because no one can afford to pay the high prices and are travelling further afield to keep their sport/activity alive. Most importantly no one can start a sport because it\u2019s too expensive and clubs are dying because they cannot afford to pay hall fees which means rising membership costs. In light of the Olympic Games and Commonwealth Games. Our legacy starts here",
