        "additional_details": "You cannot avoid walking down the high-street without being affected by at least one person smoking. People like myself who suffer from smoke itolerance are seriously affected, resulting in allergic reactions, collapsing and even death - why should people who genuinely cannot go near smoke have to be subjected to it in order to go to the supermarket or pick up their children from school? Why should people who have chosen not to smoke have to breathe it in every time they go into a public area?\r\nI am petitioning to ban people from spreading their toxic smoke in Britain's streets to people who do not wish it to be inflicted upon them - and those it could have potentially fatal results for. Smoking should be done privately or in contolled areas.\r\nPlease, consider those who suffer for someone's addiction.",
