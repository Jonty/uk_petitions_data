        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are asking the Rt Hon Maria Miller Secretary of State for Culture, Media & Sport to investigate the BBC's plans to remove BBC3 from general broadcasting to an online only platform.\r\n\r\nBBC3 is a unique channel that is predominately targeted to a younger audience with programming comprising mainly of comedy and factual programming aimed at young adults. It has also been the launchpad for the careers many of the UK's favourite comedians. By moving BBC3 to an online only presence the programming shown on BBC will diminish and it will mean the demographic of BBC3's target audience will no longer be truly represented by the BBC.\r\n\r\nWe urge the the Rt Hon Maria Miller to investigate the plans of the BBC to ensure that the BBC caters correctly for young adults and that as a public broadcaster the BBC's plans are in the best interests of all license payers not just those who watch BBC1 & 2.",
