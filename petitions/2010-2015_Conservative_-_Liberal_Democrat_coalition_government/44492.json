        "additional_details": "The high street has, over the last few years, been severely crippled by supermarket expansion and undercutting from certain online retailers. High streets across the country suffer from boarded up husks of empty shopping space.\r\n\r\nBut the death of the high street does not need to be inevitable. We can prevent it from happening, but only if the government acts! Steps should include:\r\n\r\n1) Forcing all tax avoiding online retailers such as Amazon to pay tax for operating in the UK and shutting down all UK based \"tax avoidance havens\"\r\n2) Tax breaks or reduced rental charges on all brick and mortar stores with recognised financial problems\r\n3) Introduce renewed management practises that help stores to thrive and pricing products at competitive, affordable RRP's more comparable to online or foreign market pricing.\r\n4) Investing in small but potentially expandable new retail brands should existing ones be forced into closure.\r\n\r\nThe death of the high street does not need to be inevitable.",
