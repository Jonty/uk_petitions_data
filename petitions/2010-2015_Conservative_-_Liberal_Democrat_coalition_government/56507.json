If you agree with me that it would be exceptional to live in a society where both genders were equal.\r\nIf you agree, please read the text below of what you can do to help achieve the ultimate goal:\r\n-Do not encourage girls to cook or clean with toys or boys not to. Let them decide.\r\n-encourage girls to participate in sports\r\n-Men should do more household chores\r\nI believe advertisements on television influent our society. Cleaning companies show just women and kids' cleaning and cooking toys show just girls. Boys and girls are equal. We just need everyone to understand this.",
