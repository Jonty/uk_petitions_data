As well as capping their pay, the government should enact legislation to bring in the following measures:\r\n\r\nMPs pay should be capped at its current level until 2020, and then reviewed with the possibility of an annual increase IN LINE WITH INFLATION thereafter.\r\n\r\nMPs should have to live in the constituency they wish to represent for a minimum of two years before being eligible to stand for election.\r\n\r\n\"Pairing\" should be abolished.\r\n\r\nMPs should have ONE house, in their constituency, that THEY pay for.\r\n\r\nExpenses should be limited to office and establishment expenses, and permitted overnight stays in budget hotels eg Travel Lodge.\r\n\r\nThere should be a MINIMUM ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENT at Parliament, which, if not met, would result in pay being docked.\r\n\r\nMPs should have NO OTHER PAID EMPLOYMENT while being an MP",
