I have been nearly made homeless because of this and feel that this should be taken out of the assessment. I want to pay for my child but this is beyond a joke. im an absent parent fighting to see my child and have been collared with this which is affecting my other children at home. I have had to cut everything back and I nearly had to give up my home. this in affect would have made my other three children homeless because of the amount of money CSA want from my income. this needs to be stopped for the benefit of other children that are in the same situation as mine. please sign and share.",
