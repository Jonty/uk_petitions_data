We demand that this be done retrospectively; any shortfall in funding to be \"CLAWED BACK\" from the excessive bonus's given to members of the Banking Fraternity subsidised by this Government using taxpayers' money. Given that the taxpayer owns at least 80% of RBS (us having contributed our share in the past) it is the only ethical action to take bearing in mind that we are some of the poorest members of society.  Also on the grounds that you will be responsible for many more pensioners dying from the cold this Winter or is this your intention - the final solution so to speak?",
