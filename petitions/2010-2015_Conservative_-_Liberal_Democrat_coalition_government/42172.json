        "additional_details": "The former Rangers Football Club has won an appeal against a tax bill over its use of Employee Benefit Trusts.\r\n\r\nThe club, which is now in liquidation, used the scheme from 2001 to 2010 to make \u00a347.65m in payments to players and staff in the form of tax-free loans.\r\n\r\nHM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) had challenged the payments, arguing that they were illegal.\r\n\r\nRangers disputed the bill and a First Tier Tax Tribunal (FTT) has ruled the payments were loans that can be repaid.\r\n\r\nThe decision was welcomed by Murray International Holdings, who were majority shareholders of the old club until Craig Whyte's takeover in May 2011.\r\n\r\nHowever, HMRC said it was considering an appeal.\r\n\r\nLiquidators BDO said they were reviewing the tribunal's decision closely.\r\n\r\nRangers chief executive Charles Green said the verdict in the so-called Big Tax Case \"undermines the validity\" of a Scottish Premier League investigation into alleged undisclosed payments to players.",
