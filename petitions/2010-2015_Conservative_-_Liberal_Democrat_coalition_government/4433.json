        "additional_details": "The government has ring-fenced overseas aid at a time when other departmental budgets are being cut, and ordinary people are facing hardship. There is no virtue in handing over huge sums of money in the hope it will do some good in the world. DFID's mission \"to reduce poverty\" is idealistic.\r\n\r\nDFID should instead fund UK companies to improve the infrastructure of recipient countries, thereby creating jobs and real wealth both in (say) Africa and in the UK. In return the UK should get mineral rights where applicable. The thrust of our aid programme should be businesslike with an element of self-interest.\r\n",
