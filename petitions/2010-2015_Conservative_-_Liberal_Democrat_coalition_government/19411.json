Not everybody has Mummy and Daddy to pay off these rediculous fees. At the young age of 18 how many people can afford the cost of university as well as living costs. Fuel has gone up, Insurance is rediculous, to rent a home costs a great deal and while in education of such a high level and large workload how can young talents be expected to afford this. Britain should help support, not be raising fees. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MAKE IT SO HARD FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO WILL BE RUNNING OUR FINE NATION. Riddle me that.",
