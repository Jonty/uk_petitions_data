        "additional_details": "Copycat websites such as https://www.dvla-driving-licence.co.uk/ mimic official Government websites and dupe customers into paying large fees for services that are usually provided free or low cost by the Government.\r\n\r\nSuch websites work around Distance Selling Regulations (that allow you to cancel an online transaction up to 7 days after receiving your goods) by claiming their services begin immediately after payment. Customers report being unable to contact the websites after payment and are left powerless.\r\n\r\nThis petition asks the Government:\r\n\r\n- To strengthen controls over copycat websites to improve consumer protection\r\n- To compensate customers of copycat websites for money lost\r\n- To ensure that all online sellers must abide by Distance Selling Regulations\r\n\r\nMPs David Davis and Caroline Lucas are lending their support to the campaign against these websites.\r\n",
