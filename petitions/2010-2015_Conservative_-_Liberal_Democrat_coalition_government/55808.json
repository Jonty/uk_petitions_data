Any minister or ex minister (of ANY political hue) who is found to have acted thus MUST be banned from holding any taxpayer funded position or political appointment for the remainder of his or her natural life, either in the UK or the EU.  The people MUST be able to rely on the fact that these people are at the very least HONEST in their day to day dealings with us and this is patently not the case at the moment with the number of cases of dishonesty being disclosed.",
