This is particularly apparent when we are subjected to what appears to be the increasing powers of the EU over our own law makers.  This creates an increasing gulf between the electorate and the political establishment, whereby we feel that we have no direct influence over the EU law makers who govern many aspect of out lives these days.  The people should be given a voice to reject, or otherwise support the recovery of Parliamentary Democracy.",
