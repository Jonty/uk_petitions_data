        "additional_details": "For around 20 years the Chernobyl Children Life Line (CCLL) and similar charities have been bringing children from Belarus and Ukraine to the UK for short periods of respite care following the devastating effects of the Chernobyl Nuclear disaster in 1986. These short periods of respite care, usually between 2 and 4 weeks, help to boost each child's immune  system and according to doctors extend life expectancy by two years.\r\n\r\nThe UK Borders Agency (UKBA) plans, to introduce Visa charges of around \u00a370 per child in April 2013 will increase the cost of each child's stay by some 22%. This will severely hamper the already arduous work of the charities involved in this important humanitarian task.\r\n\r\nIt is the intension that this petition, with your help and support by the additon of your signature, will draw the attention of the Government and force a debate in the House of Commons hopefully bringing an end to this unjust, uncharitable, inhumane proposal.",
