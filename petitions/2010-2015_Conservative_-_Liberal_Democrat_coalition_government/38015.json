        "action": "Ban alcohol suppressant drugs",
        "additional_details": "The Government should ban alcohol suppressant drugs which recently came on the market in the UK. They encourage drink driving, create a danger to the user and general public and fly in the face of successive Government and Police campaigns to reduce drink driving. Suppliers claim that these drugs will allow drivers to drink up to 5 pints and still pass a police breathalyser test. Yet they admit the drugs will not improve the performance of a driver who has been drinking.  They will do nothing to counter the health effects of alcohol or the danger posed by drink drivers to themselves and others. By merely offering a method of deceiving a breath test they both encourage drink driving and, in seeking to avoid the penalty, perverting the course of justice. On ethical, legal and health grounds they should be banned.",
