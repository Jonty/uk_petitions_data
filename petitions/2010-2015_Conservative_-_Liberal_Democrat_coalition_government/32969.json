This form of female discrimination explains why English women have colonized other countries in an effort to feel important alongside their brothers and several working women complain of the glass ceiling. I also keenly observed that this form of \u201cMale led\u201d workplace is the root cause of the class system where several lower class women are without a feminist leader at their disposal all the time to alleviate all of their burdens.\r\n\r\n ",
