        "additional_details": "I propose that we, as a nation, should show our disapproval of the oppression of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender folk around the world. We British should not be impolite about this, of course. The change of our National Anthem for the next year to \"Glad to be Gay\" written by Tom Robinson would show our support for all those oppressed by unjust laws. I am sure that Her Majesty would be gracious enough to accede to this as she has had her praises sung regularly for 60 glorious years.",
