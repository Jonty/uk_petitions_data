Taking your bike on a train should be a genuine alternative to using a car.\r\n\r\nThe Government's current position is that we should adopt the Dutch model of improving cycle parks at either end of one chosen train journey. This is instead of making space on the trains themselves and doesn\u2019t facilitate flexible travel around the UK.\r\n\r\nMany train operators allow a maximum of only two bicycles per train. On the majority of services reservations are not possible. This rules out the option of booking trains in advance as there is no certainty of getting your bike on one particular train. It also rules out the possibility of cycling trips with more than two people.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to allow a reservation for a bike via a central system for all rail journeys. The government should have access to data in order to pressure rail operators to increase capacity for bicycles.",
