        "additional_details": "So yesterday the Prime minister stated that if the interest rate was increased homeowners would suffer a dreadfull blow ........Does the Prime minister only care about home owners then???  very nice for the Landlord (INVESTOR)  who pays \u00a3369.. per month for the mortgage but the Tennant (FORGOTTEN ABOUT INDIVIDUAL) pays \u00a3 1,800.00 per month. Keeping the Landlord rich and the home renter poorer. How much longer can the Goverment ignore the renter ..The economy would buzz instantly if every tennants rent was in line with the intrest rate, The recession is for everyone can tennants please receive the same benefits as the Landlords. Allow renters to pay rent at the current  interest rate of the house value . ",
