        "additional_details": "An african proverb says \"if the children are not initiated into the village they will burn it down just to feel its warmth.\"\r\n\r\nWell they haven't been intiated into the village in terms of local knowledge. As a Croydon resident I always believed Reeves was part of a chain store, I had no idea of its history. It was only when it burnt down in the riots that its history was revealed.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to older residents, I become aware how much I don't know about the local area, yet it has so much to teach terms of case-studies to areas like Geography, Business Studies, and History; these can be formulated by the school or local government, and remain unexamined as a more humane element of school teaching.\r\n\r\nI believe re-humanizing the teaching process and devolving it a little from the National Curriculum, will give our children something they can relate to, and help tackle the problem of the younger generations's alienation from Briitish society.",
