The issues in Palestine are complex, but the illegal occupation of land and indiscriminate killing of civilians will never promote resolution.\r\n\r\nInexplicably as a country we do absolutely nothing material to end this, making us complicit in the slaughter.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the UK government to immediately impose all possible economic sanctions against Israel until such time as they both withdraw from all illegally occupied territory and cease all extra-territorial military operations which impact civilians.\r\n\r\nWe also call upon the government to exert all possible influence within the EU to procure Europe wide sanctions to the same effect.",
