        "additional_details": "Ian Duncan Smith (IDS) has claimed in the Telegraph that he could live on \u00a353 per week if he had to.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to make such a comment when you will never have to do so. I therefore wish through this petition to force him to do so for a period of 12 months (any less will not give him a true representation of what it is like).\r\n\r\nHe should be given \u00a353 per week as well as any benefits he would be entitled to (such as housing benefit or any council tax help provided by the council) and should have no access to his savings, vehicles, house...\r\n\r\nHe should find a room to rent from a landlord that will accept housing benefit and should be keen to go through this process as I am sure he will learn a lot from being a mystery shopper.\r\n\r\nAfter all we are all in this together.",
