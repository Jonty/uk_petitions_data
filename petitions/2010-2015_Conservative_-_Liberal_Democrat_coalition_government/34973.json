Clearly this is an absolute offence as seen on a PCT website Q&A - \"My partner/patient representative filled out the back of the prescription incorrectly. Can the penalty be cancelled?\r\nNo, the penalty can't be cancelled. A patient is responsible for the actions of their representative. If the representative incorrectly claims exemption from prescription charges then a penalty notice will be issued to the patient. Penalty charges will not be reclaimed from the patient's representative\"\r\n\r\nThis above is ludicrous and yet another attack on the vulnerable. Ban this money making scheme.\r\n",
