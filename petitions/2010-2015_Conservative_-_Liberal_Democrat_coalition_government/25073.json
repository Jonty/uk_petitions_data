We have all seen a HGV struggling to over take another one who is doing its 56mph limit, this then blocks and slows the faster lane/s then to suddenly swerve back in front, nearly causing an accident.\r\nGermany has this policy and it will make our multilaned, high speed roads safer and less congested.",
