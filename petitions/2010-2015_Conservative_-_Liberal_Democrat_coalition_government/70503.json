        "additional_details": "For years research into mental health, particularly anti-depressant medication has been unfruitful. It's common knowledge that most anti-depressant medication, when tested in clinical trials, only narrowly has an effect greater than a placebo.\r\n\r\nThis may show that anti-depressants work for some, yet illegal medications may have a greater effect. To underline this I would like to mention the current research into THC and cancer patients, or the self medication of LSD on Cluster-type Headaches.\r\n\r\nSo by passing this bill to allow unrestricted research into medical uses of currently illegal substances. While the stigma of an illegal substance will often be attached to the research, the current system makes said research illegal.\r\n\r\nTo clarify my use of the word \"unrestricted\" I would like to state that the illegal substances would be carefully measured and \"uncut\" with heavily monitored substances on a weekly reported in-out measurement, and random spot checks for substance \"cutting\"",
