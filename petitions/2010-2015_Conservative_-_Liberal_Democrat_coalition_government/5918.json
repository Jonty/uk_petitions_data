        "additional_details": "Those addicted to heroin and other opiates are currently treated with methadone as part of their rehabilitation. Ibogaine is a compound which has faced poor funding, but has shown a staggering success rate in reducing or even eliminating opiate withdrawal in those countries where it is used. It is reported that a single dose of the drug can completely negate withdrawal symptoms.\r\n\r\nFurther research should be conducted by HM Government into the viability of its use as a treatment for opiate addiction into the UK. If such research supports current knowledge of Ibogaine, both the cost and efficiency of drug rehabilitation programmes could be dramatically improved.",
