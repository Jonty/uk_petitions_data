        "additional_details": "The Israel and Palestine conflict was started in by the UN in 1947 when they stole Palestine and gave it to Israel. Since then many Palestinians have been MASSACRED and many have been put in a Prison AKA \"Gaza\" where they have been denied their \"Human rights\", which is why they are fighting for their Freedom and Peace. It is about time the Government Finally ended a Conflict and MASSACRE it helped caused. What is needed is a Solution that meets the needs of Both sides. In the past the peace plans have only looked at Israel's needs that's why they have failed! What about the needs of the Palestinian People?",
