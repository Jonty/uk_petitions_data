This means a main meal portion, not just biscuits and cakes which don't make a good lunch.\r\n\r\nThis covers every Restaurant, Cafe, Mobile food unit, Caterer (including buffet providers) and food stockists.\r\n\r\nIt's relatively easy for Vegetarians to eat in most places these days, so Gluten Free allergy sufferers should be the same!\r\n\r\nPlease support this campaign.",
