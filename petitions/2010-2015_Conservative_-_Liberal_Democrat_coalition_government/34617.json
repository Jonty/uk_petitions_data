        "additional_details": "No international terrorist group can work without the help of fund raising in the rich world. Sri Lanka's civil war had been funded heavily by the Tamil diaspora groups in the west. The London's funding was perhaps the most significant, considering that duirng the past three years,  several men have been arrested and charged for supporting, funding and buying weapons for the terrorist group LTTE of Sri Lanka. Terrorists killed at least 80,000 and amputated at least 400,00 men and women during this time.Thus we request HM Home Office to launch an investigation to find out how much the diaspora funding helped the war over the past 30 years in Sri Lanka.
