And yet, the public has no recourse to examine how it uses the hundreds of millions of pounds it receives for doing work at the bidding of the DWP and its policies, despite this being the subject of parliamentary enquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Minstry of Justice should designate Atos Healthcare a public authority for the purposes of its work on medical assessments for DWP decision makers, including access to the LiMA system.
