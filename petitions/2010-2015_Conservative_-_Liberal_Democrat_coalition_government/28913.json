        "additional_details": "I petition the government to consider the legalization of Euthanasia and for reforms to the Suicide Act of 1961 to allow for Euthanasia.\r\n\r\nMany people suffer years of needless suffering, in the case of terminal illness or non-life, in the case of some mental illnesses. In these cases, people who assist someone who cannot take their own life in taking their own life, should be able to do so without fear of legal comeback.\r\n\r\nFor many U.k citizens the opportunity to be assisted in ending their lives would bring an end to their long lived suffering, without having to travel overseas or fear for the fate of those assisting with their wishes.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that \"80% of British citizens and 64% of Britain\u2019s general practitioners\u201d are in favour of legalizing Euthanization, yet those who represent the people, refuse to act upon the wishes of those they are meant to speak for.
