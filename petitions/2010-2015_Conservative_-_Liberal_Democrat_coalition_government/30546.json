Thousands of people every year take their own lives due to the lack of any form of support, having strong medications thrown at them with no follow up or monitoring. This has to stop. Now. One in  three will suffer from a Mental Health Condition during their lifetime, be it depression, anxiety, phobias, trauma, depersonalization, bipolar, schizophrenia or the like.\r\n\r\nRaise awareness, funding and accessibility of Mental Health Services across the UK.",
