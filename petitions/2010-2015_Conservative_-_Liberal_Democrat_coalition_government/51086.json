Many people, both young and old can become entrapped by this. This can lead to addiction. Often in newsworthy cases involving abuse or murder of children, there is an association between the perpetrator of such crimes and an addiction to extreme pornography - presumably from a gradual descent from so-called soft-core pornography.\r\n\r\nI want the government to close-down any internet site that allows any free access to sexual content. Any person wishing to access such material should be required to enter their debit/credit card details before accessing any part of their website. Any \"free\" areas of such sites should not contain any sexually explicit images.",
