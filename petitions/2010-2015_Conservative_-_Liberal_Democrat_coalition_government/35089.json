The government are still out to catch him but he is still on the run creating more havoc everywhere he goes. Over 100,000 children have been part of this. This is still happening in places like Libya.\r\nWe want to raise awareness about how children in Congo, Uganda and children who live in towns and villages in the Middle East aren\u2019t safe from the terror of being kidnapped and used.\r\nWe want as much people as possible to sign this, if you can please send it to other people. We need to try raise as much awareness as possible.\r\n",
