        "additional_details": "Our country is in decline. There is no argument to that. We were once a nation of prosperity. Prior to 1948 we as a country were free of people didn't want to work and full of proud, wanting to work young men and women. The idea of socialism is a good one yes. But its ideals and consequences are not. Now that it has been tried and has ultimately not prevented the poor from suffering, just kept them in a trap for generations to come, it is time for change. The welfare trap is the governments fault, and ultimately people may disagree, but it is the governments duty to protect these people from generations of it. The Welfare state is used as a hammock not as a safety net, and that is wrong on people who are stuck on it, and the people forced to pay for it.",
