        "additional_details": "This petition calls for Prime Minister David Cameron to reply to Sergei Stepashin, former Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.\r\n\r\nSergei Stepashin published an open letter to David Cameron on 31 July.   His letter appeared in English in the Independent newspaper on 12 August.  It was a reply to Mr Cameron\u2019s article of 20 July in the Sunday Times in which he made sweeping accusations against Russia in relation to MH17 and the Ukraine.\r\n\r\nMr Stepashin criticised Mr Cameron for supporting the neo-Nazi regime of the Ukrainian government and seeking to lure Russia into war at a time when Russia is trying to avoid global conflict.  He drew a parallel with Neville Chamberlain\u2019s call in 1938 for European leaders to support German Nazis against the USSR.  He also pointed to growing evidence that MH17 was shot down by the Ukrainian military.\r\n\r\nMr Cameron should now reply to Mr Stepashin and publish his response.\r\n",
