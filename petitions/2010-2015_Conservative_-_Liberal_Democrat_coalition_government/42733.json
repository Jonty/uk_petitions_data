It is my opinion the Government must be unemotional, uncaring and extremely unintelligent.\r\nAnimals FEEL fear and pain, both physical and emotional.\r\nI want the government to SERIOUSLY reassess the custodial terms imposed to offenders of the discussed crimes.\r\nPrisons may be over crowded and an extreme expense to the tax payer, but perhaps if the government implemented tougher sentences and tougher conditions within Prison it would act as a deterrent to offenders, thus lowering offences committed, lowering prison populations and lowering the expense to the tax payer.\r\nI wonder how the Queen feels towards Animal Cruelty and the law's surrounding it?",
