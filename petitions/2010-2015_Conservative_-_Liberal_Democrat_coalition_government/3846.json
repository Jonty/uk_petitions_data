The total votes are also rarely sufficient to justify any serious credibility, let alone to initiate a parliamentary debate!\r\n\r\nThe 100,000 e-petition votes required equates to only 0.16% of the UK population. The remaining 62.2 million (99.84%) are not represented \u2013 the vast majority may disagree with the petition objective.\r\n\r\nTo put this into perspective, around 2.2% (1.4 million) of the UK population have an IQ score below 70 (mentally retarded). This is a massive 14 times greater than the \u2018significant\u2019 e-petition vote!\r\n\r\nThe e-petitions website should therefore be changed to an e-survey format, adopting both AGREE and DISAGREE options, enabling a statistically significant vote.\r\n\r\nA minimum requirement of 100,000 AGREE votes AND at least 40% voting AGREE is suggested. Therefore if only 40% vote AGREE, at least 250,000 total votes would be required.",
