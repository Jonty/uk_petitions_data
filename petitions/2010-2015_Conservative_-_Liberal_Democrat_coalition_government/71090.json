        "additional_details": "Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia is a genetic condition which affects the way our Adrenal Glands work. It is caused by a blockage of the steroid 'Cortisol' which we need in order to survive. The condition, most common from birth, goes mostly undetected due to the fact that most health professionals do not know  the signs and symptoms, and sometimes don't even know the condition even exists. Undetected, the person affected can go into adrenal crisis and die.\r\nI am petitioning for 3 things to happen:\r\n1) that paediatric health care workers, midwives and health visitors are made aware of the condition and trained in what the signs and symptoms are.\r\n2) that it is tested for in the Newborn Heel Prick test to prevent crisis (as it is in many other countries!)\r\n3) for press coverage in UK soaps, so that health care professionals and parents know what to look for.",
