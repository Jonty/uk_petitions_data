        "additional_details": "Scrap the Hazard Perception part of the Driving License Theory Test. The test is unclear, confusing, completely unituitive and the instructions are misleading and even contradictory. While improving young drivers hazard perception skills is a good idea in principle, unfortunately the test as it is currently being operating is not fit for purpose.\r\nThe goverment should intervene and scrap this fascicle test or at the very least insist that the test is reviewed by the DVLA and a completely new system designed which works clearly and consistently.",
