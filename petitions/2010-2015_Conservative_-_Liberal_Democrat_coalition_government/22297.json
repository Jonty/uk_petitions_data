How about \"thrived\" or \"throve\"?\r\n\r\nI propose that we clean up some parts of the language so our teachers don't spend so much time correcting perfectly understandable writing that's 'wrong' - just because of arcane language rules.  Too much time is wasted correcting faults that are an artefact of the language, not really a fault of the pupil.\r\n\r\nLet's concentrate on teaching stuff.",
