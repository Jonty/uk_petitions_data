        "additional_details": "People rent substandard housing as there is no option & landlords pocket rent with no consideration for tenants. Tenants get stonewalled when raising maintenance issues. A Warrant of Fitness issued for residential rental property makes the landlord bring the property up to a minimum standard for human habitation set by Government. Cost of WOF would offset implementing it. Landlords unwilling to bring properties up to scratch would have it compulsorarily purchased for housing stock or sold off. Benefit would trickle through to NHS & first time buyers. ",
