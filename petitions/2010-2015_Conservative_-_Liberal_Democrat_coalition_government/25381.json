        "action": "Bill to regulate the unnecessary changing of volume by Television broadcasters",
        "additional_details": "This is a petition asking the government to legislate against television broadcasters preventing them from using large increases of volume to gain attention. An example of this is that which occurs at the start of every advertising break causing millions of people to reach for remote controls to turn down the sound. As soon as the programme recommences it is necessary once again to adjust the sound.\r\n\r\nThis habit is anti social, affecting not only viewers viewing pleasure but people in neighbouring apartments who each advertisement break are subject to a large increase in sound from their  neighbours television.\r\n\r\nAn unpleasant commercial practice, increasing volume by broadcasters should be stopped.\r\n\r\n",
