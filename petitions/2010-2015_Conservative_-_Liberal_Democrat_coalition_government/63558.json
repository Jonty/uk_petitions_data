She has brought Parliament into disrepute and is casting a stain on the standards of the MPs.\r\n\r\nShe has countenanced the intimidation of a national newspaper for her own personal advantage. It is disgraceful that she is responsible for the regulation of the free press of Britain.\r\n\r\nAt the very least she should be dismissed as Culture Secretary.",
