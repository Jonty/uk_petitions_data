        "additional_details": "Everyday experience indicates that rehabilitation & detox programmes for alcoholics are often not cost effective due to its high regression rate. The only way for alcoholics to give up alcohol completely (i.e. teetotal) is when they actually wanted to do so. Saying that \u2018you can take a horse to a through but you cannot force it to drink\u2019 comes to mind. No one can force a person to voluntarily not to drink alcohol unless he/she genuinely cognitively desire not to and therefore have a real aversion towards alcohol. Feelings of the pleasures of drinking alcohol (heavily, moderately or occasionally) would depend on one's motivation, triggers, reinforcers, settings, lifestyle, perception, cravings and aims. If a recovering alcoholic have a genuine aversion towards alcohol in his or her own mind (COGNITIVELY) than it is certain that he or she is no longer a RECOVERING alcoholic but a 100% RECOVERED one from my experience.",
