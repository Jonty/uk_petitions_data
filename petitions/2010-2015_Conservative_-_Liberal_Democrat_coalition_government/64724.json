        "additional_details": "Teachers and students all across the UK are being negatively affected by the actions of Michael Gove.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree that attendance is important in education, the way he proposes funding for students should not be based on this. He does not take into consideration individual differences between students. This is just one of his ridiculous, unpractical proposals and does not give children a fair chance to achieve.\r\n\r\nI propose that Mr Gove's actions are severly monitored and that the voice of the public and those within the education sector, including teachers and students, need to be heard.\r\n\r\nI fear for the education of children of the future as Mr Gove's actions could end up causing severe consequences for the current generation.",
