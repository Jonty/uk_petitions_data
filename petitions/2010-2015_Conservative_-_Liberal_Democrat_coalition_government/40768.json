I believe that we should not be persecuted or prosecuted for a bad joke that we make in 140 characters. This is not to say that we should be able to freely \"Publish or post direct, specific threats of violence against others\" but that there is a lot between threats of violence and a joke. As Twitter themselves say \"Since tweets are short, only 140 characters long, the author's intended meaning may have been lost of distorted\" I simply ask that they take their own advice and \"Consider the timing\" and that \"Tweets can be upsetting if one doesn't understand the full story behind the tweet\" I believe that our right of freedom of speech should be protected on Twitter and across the internet.",
