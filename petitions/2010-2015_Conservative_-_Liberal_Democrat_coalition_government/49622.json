        "additional_details": "\r\nWe demand that 'ticket touting' legislation be abolished. The wording states that it is a crime to dispose of a football ticket WITHOUT AUTHORISATION from the club.\r\n\r\nAuthorisation automatically exists for holders of executive seats and private boxes but it is withheld from supporters in the cheap seats. This means that the rich can legally sell their tickets FOR ANY PRICE without a crime taking place whereas the lowly plebs can be fined if they give their ticket away FOR FREE.\r\n\r\nA ticket tout asks you where you would like to sit and your wishes are accommodated whereas the club will only offer HOSPITALITY where the fans are mixed. It is the clubs that mix the fans, not the touts.  Furthermore, the legislation is actually used to help the clubs sell expensive seats to companies. These companies then profit from the onward CASH sale of valuable tickets without fear of prosecution and it is a form of money laundering.\r\n",
