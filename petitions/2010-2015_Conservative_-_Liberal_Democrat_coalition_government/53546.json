        "action": "Make it a legal requirement that a safety helmet must be worn at all times when operating a bike on a road.",
        "additional_details": "What cost would you put on a life compared to the cost of a helmet?\r\n\r\nFor too long a large proportion of cyclists have been allowed to operate a bike without a safety helmet and this must be stopped.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS AND FACTS:\r\nCyclist Casualties, 2011\r\nKilled: 107\r\nSeriously Injured: 3,085\r\nSlightly Injured: 16,023\r\nTotal: 19,215\r\n\r\nBicycle helmets can reduce the risk of head injury by as much as 85%.\r\nBicycle helmets can reduce the risk of brain injury by as much as 88%.\r\nIt is estimated that 75% of bicycle-related deaths among children could be prevented with a bicycle helmet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT I RECOMMEND SHOULD HAPPEN:\r\nI recommend that the government issue a heavy fine if a cyclist is caught not wearing a helmet. If the cyclist is under 16 then the parent should pay a greater fine or if the issue happens again court action.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this e-petition and I urge you to share this petition.\r\n\r\nThanks",
