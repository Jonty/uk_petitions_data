        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that the level of citizenship education in schools is not sufficient enough to properly educate potential voters. Too many young people leave school not knowing basic ideologies of parties, as a result they many either; voting the way their parents did and their parents\u2019 parents before that; waste their vote; or not voting at all. We would like to see the government put in place a new citizenship education scheme which will felicitate the needs of future voters.",
