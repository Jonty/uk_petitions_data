        "additional_details": "I believe EVERY child should have the option of free milk even  milk/ Soy allergic pre-school/ Reception children who CANNOT get their free milk entitlement due to the Scheme only providing Cows milk.The House of Commons, Department of Health,  Dr Dan Poulter.  His response states that \"The Government do not discriminate against children with allergies, the free milk scheme is a welfare food , not a medical intervention.\"The provision of a safe milk should be an option for milk/ soy allergic under 5's.\r\nThe free nursery ,milk scheme states \" for each child under 5!\", therefore by NOT providing a safe milk it is a form of discrimination.\r\nPlease sign this e-petition in support of safe alternative milk being offered for allergic under 5's. (Some parents will still wish to provide their own in order to ensure safety).\r\nThe PRINCIPAL is that it a safe milk SHOULD be an option for EVERY CHILD as the scheme states.\r\nhttp://www.nurserymilk.co.uk/pdf/Nursery%20Milk%20Guide.pdf",
