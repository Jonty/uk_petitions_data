        "additional_details": "I believe that the government should pass a law which makes it illegal for police officers (And any other horse riders) to leave the excrement from their animals on the pathways and roads, not only is this unsanitary but it also extremely smelly and quite disgusting to see. If dog owners have to clean up after their animals then horse riders should be forced to do the same.",
