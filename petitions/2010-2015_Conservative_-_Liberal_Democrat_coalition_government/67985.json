        "additional_details": "The governement should remove MP David Tredinnick from the health committee and the science and technology committee.\r\n\r\nThe British Health department as well as our science and technology centres are world class. Today however I was deeply saddened to read an article on the above mentioned MP stating he he is guided by what has long been debunked psuedoscience.\r\n\r\n     He also continues to proselytise the alleged benefits of alternative medicine despite no evidence of its effectiveness. Alternative medicine that works has a special name.........medicine.\r\n\r\n    It is my belief this man has views are incongruous with modern science and will detract from the efforts of those people who seek funding for genuine medical and scientific research.",
