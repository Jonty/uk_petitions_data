        "additional_details": "The House of Lords should be 100% democratically elected. Members could be elected for one fixed 15 year term only.\r\n\r\nIn addition, all candidates standing for election should have to stand on their own merits (i.e. by explaining their qualifications and experience as well as their individual viewpoints on specific issues) and would not be allowed to be a member of a political party or be endorsed by one. Electoral material (e.g. posters or leaflets) should not include reference to any political party either.\r\n\r\nThe effect would therefore be a democratic upper house which is not in competition with the House of Commons containing people with the relevant skills to review and improve legislation to a high standard.",
