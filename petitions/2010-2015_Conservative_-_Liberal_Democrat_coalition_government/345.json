Also inclusive of these roads and the areas where they intersect.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely built up area in terms of pedestrians- from tourists to the local workforce, not to mention the vibrant nightlife. At the moment the traffic races through this area at dangerous speed. There have been many incidents and some of them fatal. Enforcing a 20 mile an hour zone should hopefully prevent any further fatalaties and protect the local community and those visiting London.",
