And p.s, Did i mention NO *TAX EVER!!!, Better working conditions, more jobs :) and so so much more :)\r\n\r\nfacebook.com/cjdelphi for my in-depth idea and to discuss it further.\r\n\r\nPetrol, Gas, Fuels, Land, all tax free to everyone except business, how it works is simple, 60p for a pint of beer, the tax you normally pay is lifted, land tax, gone, you just pay for the house? sounds too good to be true right this is how.\r\n\r\nTax the businesses not the people, for big business, anything over 1.5million the rest goes straight to government to invest in health, roads, everything tax money pays for, other than that nothing much changes, i explained more on my facebook page and would love to discuss this with more people somehow... hopefully on facebook.\r\n\r\n",
