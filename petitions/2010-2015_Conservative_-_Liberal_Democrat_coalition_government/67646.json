Due to a lack of time & MPs voting not to allow it through automatically to a 3rd reading, the bill disappeared.\r\n\r\nAction: Care Leavers are still being placed in inadequate accommodations upon leaving the care system, we, the undersigned, call for a new bill, which places statutory obligations upon local authorities to provide an agreed minimum standard of accommodation for care leavers.",
