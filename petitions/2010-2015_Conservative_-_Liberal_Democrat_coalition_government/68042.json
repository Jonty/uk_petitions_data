        "additional_details": "That the UK Government must help bring Hamas Terrorists before an International War Crimes Tribunal as soon as possible. The reason for this is simple. Hamas is going against all international norms of Conducting a War in the 21st Century, here the Geneva Conventions in its unjustified War against Israel. Hamas is deliberately stockpiling and launching weapons from urban heavily populated zones, here Schools, Hospitals and places of Worship. Such areas of not military thus are not allowed to be used in this manner in the first place and in times of war. Nor is Hamas conducting its unlawful War against Legitimate Israeli Military Zones rather Hamas is only targeting Israeli civilians. Please support this e-petition.",
