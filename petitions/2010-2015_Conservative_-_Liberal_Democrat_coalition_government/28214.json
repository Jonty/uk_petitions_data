        "additional_details": "Kids need 14 weeks holiday but why should they have to miss 5 days school during school term time for teacher training days when these could quite easily be moved to days in  the 14 weeks schooll holidays I see no reasons why this can't be done. This is made worse by all holiday clubs, play schemes ect being closed and finding a child minder to have a child for only 5 days per year is near impossible.  I know teachers work hard but so do soldiers,doctors, nurses,policeman/women ect along with the rest of the adult population.many thanks for taking the time to read this and please dont keep sending me abusive messages on twitter and facebook just for having an opinion and wanting to ask this question.",
