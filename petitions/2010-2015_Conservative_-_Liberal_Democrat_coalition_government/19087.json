        "additional_details": "VAT on insulation materials will force homeowners to compromise on energy efficiency due to costs constraints. The potential to achieve high levels of energy efficiency will be lost due to the addition of VAT pushing costs higher than affordable resulting in less insulation being installed than could have been. Spending the money normally taken up by VAT on increased levels of insulation will achieve far greater energy efficiency than will be achieved by charging VAT.",
