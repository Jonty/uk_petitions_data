Then, as those under 9s move to under 10s, they will carry on with this system into 2014/15 and under 11s in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nYou can speak to any parent at any club and they will tell you that no child will have any chance of winning the league, nothing to aim for and can have as much fun playing football in the streets with friends.\r\n\r\nThis in turn will effect the way our British children will perform and compete for years to come.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this e-petition and stop the rot.",
