        "additional_details": "This is a petition to stop the development of Oakfield playing field on Bilton Road. The development is not wanted, the children will have nowhere to play locally. The schools in the area are all full and it will overload the gyratory system with a further 60-70 cars in the nearby area. We have little green belt and playing fields left for our children and we need to start defending it from greedy developers who want to build on any free land they can find.",
