The proposal is that the offence shall attract a mandatory custodial sentence of 7 Years minimum term with no parole. The cost of incarceration will be met by savings to police work and NHS work caused by drug abuse from users and dealers.\r\nThe UK has a drug problem and the UK electorate elect politicians to help us all deal with social issues and it is time politicians opened their eyes and fixed the drug problems in our lifetime.",
