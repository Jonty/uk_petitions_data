        "additional_details": "To have gender neutral toilets for trans, gender queer and non-binaries. These people face difficulties each day because they cannot decide with toilet to use - their assigned sex, their gender or even no gender? Having gender neutral public facilities would also help protect these people from social stigmas. I would like the government to make it law or heavily advise city counsels to have gender neutral toilets in public places.",
