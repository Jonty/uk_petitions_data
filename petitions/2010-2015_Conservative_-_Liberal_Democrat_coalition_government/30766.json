I pay my taxes and the government distributes my taxes as it sees fit.\r\nIn order to earn that pay cheque, I work on an oil rig in the North Sea.\r\ni am required to pass a random urine test for drugs and alcohol, with which I have no problem.\r\nWhat I do have a problem with is the distribution of my taxes to people who don't have to pass a urine test.\r\nShouldn't one have to pass a urine test to get a benefits cheque because I have to pass one to earn it for them?\r\nPlease understand that I have no problem with helping people get back on their feet.\r\nI do on the other hand have a problem with helping someone sit on their arse drinking beer and smoking dope.\r\nCould you imagine how much money the government would save if people had to pass a urine test to get a benefit cheque?\r\nPlease pass this along if you agree or simply delete it if you don't.\r\nHope you will pass it along though, because something has to change in the UK , and soon!",
