        "additional_details": "On 17th September, my daughter, Izzy Dix, hung herself in her bedroom with her school tie. I suspect she found out how to do this by researching it online.\r\n\r\nInternet search engines, Google and Bing, have recently announced a move to make 100,000 child abuse search terms come back with a 'clean return' (i.e. no results are delivered). We need the government to help us put pressure on the large search engines to include 'suicide' and 'self harm' search terms in this list, so when young people are searching for websites to assist and guide them in how to undertake suicide or self harm, nothing is returned.\r\n\r\nInstead, help and advice information would appear in front of them, outlining a variety of websites and phone numbers, such as The Samaritans, ChildLine, BeatBullying, Kidscape, etc., where the person can receive the help they need.\r\n\r\nIf this initiative was in place already, then perhaps Izzy, and others like her, would still be with us today.",
