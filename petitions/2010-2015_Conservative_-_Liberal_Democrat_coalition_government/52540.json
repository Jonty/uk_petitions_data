        "additional_details": "European judges have decided that because of section 3 of the human rights act that whole life prisoners should have the possibility of release. These criminals lost there human rights the day they took some other persons life why should they be released so they have the chance to commit the same crimes over and over again. Our streets won't be safe if there is serial killers, rapists, murders and any other vile criminal that the judges have decided deserve a second chance. I for one do not want to be living in a society which is full of inhuman animals. If they where originally given a life sentence with no chance of parole then they where deemed unfit to fit back into society for a reason they are far to dangerous so why would we want these people walking around our streets where our family's, kids and friends are going to be put in danger, sign this now and stop these animals from being released and protect the people of our future!
