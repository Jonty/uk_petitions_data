It would ensure that benefits paid are used properly for the purpose that they were intended. I do not believe that the majority of people on benefits are corrupt and playing the system however we read all the time about the benefit cheats and it infuriates the working people of this country, this has created a lot of bad feeling and contempt to which the honest people on benefits that really need them are tarred with the same brush as the cheats. Their is a small minority of people on benefits that the worst thing you can do for them is give them cash that can be spent on Drugs, Alcohol and Cigarettes. If this stopped it is logical to assume that it would save the NHS which is flooded with Addicts, Alcoholics and Cancer (Smoking related) patients a considerable sum of money also. ",
