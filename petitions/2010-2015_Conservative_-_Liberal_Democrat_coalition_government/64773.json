        "additional_details": "The sentence of four years handed down to the killer of Andrew Young in Bournemouth was a disgrace. This sentence being upheld on appeal, stating it was not unduly lenient, is ridiculous. Any sentence handed down to someone who carries out an intentional violent act, resulting in the death of another person, should not be allowed to be so small. I would like the government to increase the minimum sentence for such acts, perhaps following Australia's lead in this respect. Overly lenient sentences are an insult to those murdered and to the families left behind.",
