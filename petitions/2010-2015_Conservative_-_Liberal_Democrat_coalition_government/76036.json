        "additional_details": "I petition for the Government to ringfence money in order to provide a free Telecare alarm to all people aged 80 and over.\r\nCurrently in the UK it depends on where the Elderly live as to whether they qualify for financial help in order to have a Telecare alarm. Some councils give it free to all those 80+, some make them all pay, yes, even 99 year olds who fall regularly, who are in and out of hospital.\r\nA Telecare alarm won't prevent falls of course but as demographics show the peripheral familes no longer live close by their Ageing parents. Having the alarm installed provides the families with peace of mind that if their loved-one does fall, has a heart attack, becomes ill, is late getting the care that they need etc, help is at hand to get the appropraiet assistance asap.\r\n",
