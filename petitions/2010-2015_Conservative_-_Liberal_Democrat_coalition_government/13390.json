This is an aggressive and most unfriendly gesture to the UK, which would pay the lion's share of the costs of this proposal.\r\n\r\nIt is predicted it could cost the UK economy \u00a313 billion and damage the economy badly.  We can I'll afford this kind of damage to the economy. Why should we pay to prop up the Euro, which can now be seen to be an experiment gone badly wrong. Let it fail.",
