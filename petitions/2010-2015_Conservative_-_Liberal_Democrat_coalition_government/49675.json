How many people would be able to answer that question, and supply a suitable home- either a pond, or a tank of 3ft and 100l plus in capacity, just for one fish, with suitable filtration, and regular water changes and tank/ pond maintenance? I'd bet not many.\r\n\r\nWe need to stop this barbaric practice from happening, and the legislation changing, banning the practice of giving away fish as prizes. ",
