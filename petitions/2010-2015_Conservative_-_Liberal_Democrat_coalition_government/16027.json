        "additional_details": "The proposed badger cull in England is the typically stupid response of a bureaucratic Whitehall organisation to a problem it does not understand and cannot be bothered to find out about.\r\nA badger cull in a vain attempt to control TB in cattle is an irreversible step which will do nothing to control the disease but will destroy a harmless animal which has lived in our islands as long as we have.\r\nIf DEFRA was worth the huge amount of taxpayer's money it wastes every year it would pursue the rapid development of a suitable TB vaccine for use in badgers... AND the other species whichy carry TB !\r\nKilling badgers is easy and will achieve nothing... Stopping TB requires considerably more applied intelligence and real effort !\r\nPlease sign this e-petition and make your feelings known before it is too late for our badgers !",
