        "additional_details": "The new bus service that has replaced the DAC 79 is abominable, buses have changed from every half an hour to every hour. The new route no longer serves the estates of callington, downgrate, harrobarrow, cox park or anywhere expect Gunnislake and Calstock. Furthermore, western greyhound are only extendeding an existing route from Liskeard to callington, therefore there is no way buses will be on time and reliable! They need to reconsider their time table and Cornwall county council need to provide more funding or find another company willing to fill the gaps! ",
