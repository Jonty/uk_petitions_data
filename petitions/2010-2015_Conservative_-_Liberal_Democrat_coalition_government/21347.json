        "action": "Abolish Empty Property Rates for Industrial and Commercial Premises.",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the Government to abolish Empty Property Rates (EPR) for industrial and commercial premises. In the present economic climate EPR places an additional financial burden for commercial property owners already suffering a significant decline in rental income. In addition it is holding back new development and the refurbishment of older premises due to lack of financial resources and the risk of incurring high rate charges whilst premises remain empty. Abolition of EPR would lead to more investment and job creation at a time when the country badly needs incentives for economic growth.",
