It is the first step in a move towards raising the education leaving age to 18 by 2015.\r\n\r\nWhat is not widely known, is that once a child is over 16 \u2013 and starting in further education \u2013 they are no longer entitled to a free bus pass to school/college, despite the fact that such attendance is compulsory.\r\n\r\nThis is a petition for the free bus pass scheme to be extended to those children in compulsory further education schemes, to cover transport to their school/college etc.\r\n",
