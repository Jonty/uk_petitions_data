        "additional_details": "The River Teign Estuary in South Devon is a beautiful location with reputed spa qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Area of Great Landscape Value (AGLV) designation was first used in Devon County Council's County Development Plan in the early 1950s, and received ministerial approval in 1959.  Since then the unspoiled Estuary has continued to find a place in the hearts of local people and visitors alike.  The loss of protection afforded by AGLV status could result in housing and commercial development being allowed to spread along the Estuary, irretrievably destroying a valuable and much-loved asset for both Devon and the UK.\r\n\r\nIt is our fervent wish that the Department should support its retention.",
