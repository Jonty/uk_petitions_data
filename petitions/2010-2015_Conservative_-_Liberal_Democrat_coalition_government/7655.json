During recent times it has become apparent that there is no sense of respect or value among a large portion our youth and that local services are proving ineffective and are at a breaking point. It would be of great benefit to both the United Kingdom and these misguided youths if we could intervene and help provide a sense of Pride both Personal and National as it is a key building block in a healthy society.",
