Internet/mobile-phone control would be techologically simple.\r\nEscape would be almost impossible (and self-defeating).\r\nThe life-style can not be deemed 'unusual or inhuman punishment'\r\nThe UK's moral dichotomy will be resolved.\r\nThis will have a strong deterrent effect.\r\nIt is hard to imagine a better option, though new Laws are needed to accommodate it.\r\n                      ",
