An example of how it could work is:\r\n\r\n15% tax on property value\r\nthe tax is then tax deductable by the owners being UK tax payers on all of their income.\r\n\r\nThe tax could not be reclaimed if the property is owned by companies, trusts or in the names of low earning family members to prevent tax evasion on this tax.\r\n\r\nIf the tax is unpaid for a certain length of time approaching the value of the property, this could then result in the property being siezed through the courts and sold in favour of the economy.",
