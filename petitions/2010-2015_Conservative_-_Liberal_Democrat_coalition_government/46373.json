It makes women seem inferior. (As you see with jobs, capability, and clothing expectations)\r\n2. It has created many sex-obsessed generations. (Shallow minded, selfishness from urge)\r\n3. I have also witnessed that it has helped create many pedophiles.\r\n4. It drastically raises anorexia.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to make everybody in advertisements to be fully dressed and wearing appropriate clothing. (Covering stomach, thighs, back, and chest.) I would also like for all forms of under wear to advertised only on manikins.\r\n",
