        "action": "Ban the sexualisation of children in the media.",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are sick of seeing television programmes that see children as young as 10, dressed in make up, hair extensions, and provocative clothing by their parents, for the sake of winning a competition. This over sexualisation of children is completely unacceptable, and they should not be forced to grow up too quickly in this manner.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned therefore would like to press the government to prohibit any media depicting such displays of children. At best, it is inappropriate for a child to be taking part in such practices, and at worst, it is borderline paedophillic.",
