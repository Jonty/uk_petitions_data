The Chairman - Mr Ken Bates and CEO - Mr Shaun Harveyhas been asked to clarify the situation and provide this information on numerous occasions, however have refused to do so and continue to remain evasive on the subject. The same situation applies to all football clubs financial dealings and ownership. Football finances need a top to bottom investigation to provide greater transparency. Thank you.\r\n\r\n",
