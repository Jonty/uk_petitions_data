        "action": "Should HMG choose funding a conventional HS2 railway over funding an airport twice the capacity of Heathrow on an artificial island? Funding both?",
        "additional_details": "Perhaps HMG should now seriously facilitate private funding to build BOTH an airport build on an artificial island & maglev trains.The envisaged cost of HS2 will be around \u00a332bn. How about exploring the feasibility of using maglev trains travelling up to 311mph which guide along tracks by magnetic levitation instead?  A British company is already able to tender for contracts to build maglev trains. Airports built on artificial islands & land masses, would reduce noise & smog pollution, congestion, as well as acting as a barrier against flooding. British built Hong Kong airport is built on an artificial island, for example. There is already on the drawing board a design for a \u00a320 bn four-runway airport in the Thames estuary. Another \u00a330 bn to build an integrated transport system with the airport, a new tidal wave power generating station & a four-track high speed rail route system that circle London, linking the airport.",
