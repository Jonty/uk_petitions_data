        "additional_details": "I petition the  abolition  of comercial  council rate,s  on  property , this  was first  introduced when  britain was a flourishing country and  very  prosperouse.  it is  no longer  like that  now , every  buissness  is  struggleing , and  we are seeing  more and more  empty  buissness  premisses empty.  the  rate paid to  councils are now  equal to  the same  rent  paid in rent  and you get  nothing for it you dont even get your  bins emptied .. this  is totaly unfare especialy to small buissness.  it  may even  put a stop to  recless councils spending tax  payers  money on  madcap ideas, and  make them think  on  where  the  less money should go.",
