        "additional_details": "During last year's general election we as a nation witnessed on live T.V, 'The Great Debate'. On this Mr Cameron assured the country that were he to gain leadership he would like to remove the U.K from the EU.\r\nSo far this hasn't happened and therefore he has gone against his word. This petition is to make this happen immediately. As a once great nation we relied only on ourselves. Ever since we joined the EU our financial troubles began.\r\nI believe that disbanding from the EU would not only reduce population, create further jobs vacated by those from other EU countries, increase the number of homes available thus reducing the number of homeless but also keep the pound in circulation inside our own country.\r\n\r\nLet this be done!",
