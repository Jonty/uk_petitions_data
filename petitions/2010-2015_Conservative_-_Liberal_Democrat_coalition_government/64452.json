        "additional_details": "Currently the RSPCA has limited legal power to act, this petition is to ask the government to increase that so they can act not just in cases of extreme cruelty and neglect but in cases of general mistreatment where such treatment impacts on mental and physical well being of animals eg: dogs kept in cages, too small, no access to food or water, not excersised.\r\nThere was a case recently of this apparently on FB and legally they couldnt act. If they could this animal would now be in a better place",
