        "additional_details": "\r\nThis petition is to challenge the current disparity between the heterosexual couples and lesbian couples when naming parents on a birth certificate. From a legal perspective the proposed non-birth mother who would like to be named on the birth certificate to ensure joint parental responsibility and decision making, on investigation of the current law this is not allowed unless we have a Civil partnership prior to conception/ or we conceive through a clinic.\r\n\r\nWe the unsigned believe this to be wrong, and unfair as this isn\u2019t the case for heterosexual couples who are allowed to both have children outside of marriage and both be named. We would like a change in the law to allow unmarried but committed lesbian couples to be afforded the same privileges extended to heterosexual couples in the name of equality and fairness.\r\n",
