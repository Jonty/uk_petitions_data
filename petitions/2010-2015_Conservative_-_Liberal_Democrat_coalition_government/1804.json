This issue has been debated in the past and Parliament have consistantly and overwhelmingly voted against the death penalty. Therefore as a counter to minority pressure groups I call upon like minded people to counter these reactionary and divisive e-petitions that are trying to return the UK to the dark ages and sign this petition.",
