        "additional_details": "MPs provide themselves with big salaries and pensions for life after just serving one term of office. However those standing as MPs know that the job is a fixed term of employment and as such they should have only the same rights they impose on all fixed term/contract workers.\r\n\r\nIn having to face the same rules and regulations as fixed term employees then they would have to make provisions for their own pensions like these workers do in the employment market. They would also not be paod a salery for a further 6 months after there term finishes.\r\n\r\nBy doing this it will ensure your local MP listens to his local people and not be driven by the party whips. It would also put them on a par with all other fixed term employees",
