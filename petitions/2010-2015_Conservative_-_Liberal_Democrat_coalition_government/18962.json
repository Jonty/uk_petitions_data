        "additional_details": "Prevent the BBC ending the Long Wave service by claiming that 10 valves are left for their LW transmitter, so once they are used, the service is gone. Action to be taken: Please make it part of the BBC's requirements as a public broadcaster to provide the LW service for those in our Islands who cannot recieve any other radio service. ie The Cairngorms, or our Merchant Fleet out at sea. The objective is to utilise the BBC's development team to build the transmitter in the 10 years they expect those valves to last. The BBC developed RDS, they can develop a new LW Transmitter.90,000 homes use this service according to the Guardian Newpaper ",
