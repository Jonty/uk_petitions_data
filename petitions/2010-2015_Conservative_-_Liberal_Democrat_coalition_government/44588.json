These individuals when proscuted for consistent anti-social behaviour, serious breaches of the peace, or any other matter involving the authorities, should have all their benefits revoked until such times as they can prove themselves to be a law abiding citizen.\r\nThis should cover every benefit that the Governement issues this individual.\r\nThis course of action will be a real deterant to persons who think they are above the law, as unfortuantely current legislation and police powers do not go far enough.\r\nThe removal of benefit should also be binding, and not be open to appeal either in the United Kingdom Courts, or the European Courts.\r\n\r\nThis Country will not survive until problems like this are repaired.",
