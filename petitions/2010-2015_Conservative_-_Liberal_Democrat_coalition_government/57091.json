        "additional_details": "It has already been proven that MDMA holds many benefits for people, many people that have died as a result of this particular drug have died due to it being illegal and people are putting unknown substances in it in order to dilute and sell for better profits. People need to know that prohibition does NOT work. Legalising these drugs will take the money out of the hands of these dangerous people who have no scientific knowledge on this particular subject and will render it less harmful by a massive degree. Let people put what they want into their own bodies, our bodies are our own, not the Governments. ",
