Avoid service providers the chance to cherry pick who inspectors talk to, and sugar coat the care plans. Inspections should only be planned if they are follow up inspections following initial failure to meet the standards.\r\n\r\n*More indepth Inspections\r\nInspections should be akin to full audits as in accountancy where each area is inspected/audited and reconciled.\r\n\r\n*Sanctions\r\nRecurrent failings of the same standard should either have an increased fixed penalty say \u00a310000 and/or result in the dismissal of the Manager or Supervisor and get someone else in. Start to operate a 2 stikes and you're out system.\r\n\r\n",
