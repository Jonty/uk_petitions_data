        "additional_details": "Although it is, with current technology, impossible to revive a human being from cryonic freezing. It could, in theory, be possible in the near future.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the present, to so at the present would render an individual legally dead and thus the person who caused it would be  guilty of murder, manslaughter, or euthanasia.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I believe that in the case that a person has a disease or injury which is incurable with present technology, it should only be legal to do so, but also funded by the NHS. Please sign this petition if you agree.",
