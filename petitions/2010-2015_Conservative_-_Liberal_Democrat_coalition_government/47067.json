        "additional_details": "Rents in London are completely out of control.\r\nNormal \"middle class\" families are being priced out of even the cheapest boroughs in London, and with rents continuing to rise at astronomical rates, and wages barely moving, something has to be done.\r\n\r\nFor most people, rent is as high as a third or their total outgoings. And for those of us wanting to get on teh housing ladder, we have no hope of saving for a deposit whilst rents are so high\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be done to stop this rip off in what is in effect a captive market - we can move, but at the expense of jobs we like, and friends and family we want to live near.
