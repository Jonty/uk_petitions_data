Please vote for an investigation into the delays and why the situation has continued and is not being addressed. This government has taken a sledgehammer to crack a nut and the weakest may go to the wall as a result. Why should vulnerable young adults most of whom cannot speak for themselves and carers be put through the anxiety.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
