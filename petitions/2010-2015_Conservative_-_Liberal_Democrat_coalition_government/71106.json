        "additional_details": " What is parental responsibility?\r\nWell as stated on gov.uk:\r\nIf you have parental responsibility, your most important roles are to:\r\n\r\nprovide a home for the child\r\nprotect and maintain the child\r\n These are the main 'jobs' as a parent. However when a parent has been absent from a child's life for a long period of time they have failed to maintain these simple parental duties but yet still legally have the same rights as the parent who has provided for their child their whole life.\r\nIn my eyes a parent who doesn't adequately care for a child shouldn't have any rights over this child. Surely his should be classed the same as neglect.\r\nI call for a parent to get the chance to legally try and claim sole parental responsibility.",
