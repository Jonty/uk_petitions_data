        "additional_details": "The requirement for all visitors to supply a \u00a33000 bond to visit the UK from the following countries will imply that those who save to visit the UK will have to foot the bill for the bond, extortionate visa fees and of course travel costs. Given that the countries are from Africa and south Asia, the reason can be seen as having a racist agenda.\r\n\r\nThis prohibits families from visiting relatives, prohibits visitors from feeling welcome in the UK, prohibits spending in the UK along with many other negatives.\r\n\r\nThis is the start of creating a closed and paranoid atmosphere in the country and will have many negative effects if enforced.\r\n\r\nIndia is soon to become the 5th largest economy in the world, having this restriction will mean that the UK will not be the country of choice for trade with India especially given that the initial impression is one of distrust.\r\n\r\nCountries affected: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Nigeria",
