        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the government to maintain a fair justice system and observe due process rather than bowing to public calls for kneejerk reactions to the riots. We call on the government to remember that a country in which justice and fairness are only afforded to those deemed to deserve them is a country that is neither fair nor just. We call on the government to remember that our legal system is founded on a belief in innocence until proven guilty and our welfare system is founded on the concept of helping those who are in need, not only those deemed to deserve that help. We call on the government to stop encouraging mass hysteria and to stop rushing the justice process for the sake of public appeasement.",
