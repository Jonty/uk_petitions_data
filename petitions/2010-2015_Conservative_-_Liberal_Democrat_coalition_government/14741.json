The Government are wasting money assessing these people when, if they loose their appeal to remain on ESA (which I believe is everyone), will move onto Jobseekers Allowance. This is more or less the same amount of money they would receive on ESA, the only difference I can see between JSA and ESA is the fact that claimants attend the Jobcentre to sign on instead of seeing their GP.\r\nIn this economic climate where Job are short, it makes more sense to allow able bodied peoples to get into work and for the existing ESA claimants to remain on ESA until the economic climate improves.\r\nWhilst it would be understandable for to Government to pursue this policy if there is a shortage of workers, in the present climate it is a waste of resources. The Government must see sense and start creating jobs instead of juggling money for political ends.",
