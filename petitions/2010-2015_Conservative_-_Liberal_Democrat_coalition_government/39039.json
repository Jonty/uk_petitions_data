        "additional_details": "It is wrong that hard working taxpayers money is being spent to give those living in council houses a luxury lifestyle. They are given new bathrooms, kitchens, windows, doors, new roofs and new walls all which is funded by the taxpayer (as most of them are on housing benefit therefore also pay no council tax) but for which the taxpayer has to pay for themselves in their own homes.\r\n\r\nYou will also find that most troubled families and anti social behaviour comes from people living in these council estates, as they do not know what earning money or looking after their area is, because they have not paid a single penny for anything as it has all been funded by the councils with taxpayers.\r\n\r\nWe ask the United Kingdom parliament to make compulsory sell offs of council homes in not just England, but in Wales and Scotland also. As the right to buy scheme is still flooding council homes with taxpayers money.",
