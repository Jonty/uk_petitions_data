Child Trust Funds have been obsolete since 1 January 2011, over 6.3 million Children have savings tied up in these Child Trust Funds which now have become very expensive and underperforming. It is unjust and unfair as to why these children's savings are trapped in these CTF accounts and should not have to await another 15 months before they can move their savings. Please sign this petition and help over 6.3 million children have access and control over their money.",
