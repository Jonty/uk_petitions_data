If the appointment is missed without being rescheduled  or is rescheduled  more then twice the benefit should be suspended until the health check of the child is completed.\r\n\r\nIf someone were claiming any other type of benefit they would/do have to under go check-ups/sign on. Why should we not protect and check on the children. There are to many accounts of children suffering needlessly when a simple check-up could prevent this. ",
