        "additional_details": "All new mums are told that breast is best, I propose that we fully implement the WHO guidelines, train doctors and health visitors so patients are getting up to date factual advice rather than opinion and that we enforce these guidelines so that formula companies who are breaking these guidelines regarding advertising of substitute breastmilk formulas are properly dealt with. I propose that we exted the ban on advertising formula and that advertising of any formula up until the age of 2 be prohibited rather than just the first 6 months as this could make a real difference helping mums to continue breastfeeding.",
