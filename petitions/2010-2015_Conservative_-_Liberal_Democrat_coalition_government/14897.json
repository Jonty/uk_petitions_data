        "additional_details": "There are too many examples of local government and government funded local services using \"Health and Safety\" concerns to prevent normal, everyday activities.\r\n\r\nWhile we recognise the need to prevent injuries and risky behaviour leading to injury, the types of activities being restricted often are not justified or indeed often have no basis in the law.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is that all health and safety bans or rulings need to be reasonably justifiable going forwards. Also, any person or entities issuing such statements should be able to provide the legal basis of any such bans/decisions when queried.\r\n\r\nRecent examples included:\r\n1. Banning street parties during the royal wedding\r\n2. Banning sack races for schools\r\n3. Banning children from playing in parks\r\n4. Banning Wimbledon spectators from walking on wet grass\r\n\r\nSee more:\r\nhttp://www.hse.gov.uk/news/bizarre-bans/index.htm\r\n\r\n",
