        "additional_details": "For a long time our country has turned a blind eye to the increasingly intensive and harsh conditions in dairy farms. Thousands of individuals choose to not consume dairy products when they witness the barbaric cruelty that occurs on British farms.\r\n\r\nCheap milk, cheese and butter is frankly not a good enough excuse for exploiting our dairy animals so intensively. Cows that are bred for milk have their children taken away from them almost instantly at birth and 1-week old dairy bulls are shot because they are not needed.\r\n\r\nThe government should enshrine in law the requirement for mix-use breeds of cow in the UK. This is feasible, efficient and involves far less wasted life. Cows can be bred for milk production and bulls can be cultivated for beef. No animal needs to die so early in life because they are not wanted.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the government should re-evaluate current legislation on intensive farming and ensure more is done to enforce these laws on farmers.",
