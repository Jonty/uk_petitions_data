        "additional_details": "NHS hospitals do not provide suitable consultant doctor service during the night or during weekends. This therefore means serious ill people and people who may be in life threatening situations are unable to get the help and advice they need from consultant doctors until the next day or possibly have to wait until Mondays when consultant doctors are back on working hours; meaning these people are left suffering for a whole weekend.\r\n\r\nThe NHS do provide very few consultant doctors that work these shifts, but there are very few for each hospital which seems very unfair on patients. The cost of this may be the reason but I'm sure the money can be found in order to save people's lives rather than wasting it on other things that are not needed.\r\n\r\nWhy do we have nurses and other members of staff working around the clock but not consultant doctors when they are the most important people needed?",
