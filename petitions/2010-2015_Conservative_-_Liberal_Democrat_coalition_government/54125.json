        "additional_details": "This is a plea to our government to debate a change in the law that would allow parents who are separated from their children, the automatic and legally protected right to see their children. This is already law in some countries\r\n\r\nAt present the parent with whom the child lives can stop the other parent seeing their child all together, simply by refusing contact or stopping the other parent seeing their child this is damaging to both the health of the child and the parent.\r\n\r\nChild Support Agency do not help with this as the parent being stopped access is classed as a non contact parent and made to pay more money in child support. This creates questions as to the motive of the parent preventing access\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to request equal parenting rights to both the mother and the father.\r\n\r\nThanks",
