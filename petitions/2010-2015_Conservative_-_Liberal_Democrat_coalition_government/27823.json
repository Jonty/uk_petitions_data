        "additional_details": "I live in Worksop, North Nottinghamshire. I buy diesel for my car and it costs 141.9p a litre at Tesco's and Sainsbury's. However in nearby Sheffield and Doncaster - 15 miles away and Mansfield - 10 miles away, Tesco's and Sainsbury's sell diesel at 4p a litre less at 137.9p a litre.\r\n\r\nThis has gone on for years and many people complain to the local paper but nothing is done about it. I feel that the Government stop these supermarkets descriminating people for where they live and sell diesel/petrol at the same price. If they can sell it at 137.9p in one place, they can sell it at the same price at the other.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they are not allowed to sell say a bottle of milk at \u00a31.00 in one store and \u00a31.05 in another as it is against the sale of goods act. Please sign the petition and stop descriminating people for where they live when buying fuel for their cars.",
