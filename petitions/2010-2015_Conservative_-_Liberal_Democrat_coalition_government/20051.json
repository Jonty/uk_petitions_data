        "additional_details": "Due to the banks now receiving further 'quantitive easing' and the low bank of england interest rates why are the benefits not being passed on to the people who need the help the most. If credit card interest rates were reduced to an acceptable level, people could afford to pay them back, reducing bankruptcy and non-payment of debt. It seems incredulous that rates still remain so high. Why can't it be seen that it would greatly help the economy if rates were fair. The banks are raking it in on interest at the expense others.  Please do something about this!! ",
