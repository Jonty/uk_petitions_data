Transport For London is forcing thousands of van, lorry, camper, mini-bus and 4x 4 drivers to have an eco filter fitted costing in excess of \u00a32000, either that or they are suggesting the vehicle is sold and a newer model is purchased. This is totally unfair and will hit small businesses the hardest who are already struggling in the dire economic climate. sign this petition to stop this outrageous policy. Also write to your MP and Boris Johnson the Mayor Of London",
