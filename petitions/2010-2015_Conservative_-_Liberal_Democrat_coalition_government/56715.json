Fireworks can only be collected by arrangement on a date close to their event date and must explain their storage facilities for storing explosives.\r\n\r\nOnly once we have some sort of regulation, will we stop the use of fireworks misuse in the streets and also confine them to a couple of dates in the year.\r\n\r\nHopefully, it will also encourage people to only attend organised displays, instead of using them at home.\r\n",
