        "additional_details": "Voters in the UK often don't vote in a local or general elections because there is no candidate/party they wish to support. As a result many voters don't exercise their right to vote for this reason, which is a shame considering the cost that has been paid so we can vote in a free country. Politicians of all persuasions put this none voting down to voter indifference, when in fact it's because they don't listen to the people and/or offer policies the people want.\r\n\r\nIf all ballot papers included at the bottom \"No Suitable Candidate\" or \"None of the Above\" then people could exercise their franchise of voting without actually having to vote for a candidate. The benefit of this would be to increase the turn out at elections and demonstrate to politicians that they are not delivering policies that the public want.\r\n\r\nI ask the people of this great nation to support this petition so we can demonstrate our displeasure if we wish to at elections.",
