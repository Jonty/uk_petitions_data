The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has recognised the British team as \u2018GBR\u2019 since its inception, before the addition of Northern Ireland and the creation of the United Kingdom. Consequently, the BOA is proud that GBR is one of only five nations that has competed at every Olympic Games in the modern era.\r\n\r\nThe BOA state that a team name was created which they believe is marketable across all the territories in the BOA\u2019s jurisdiction. The BOA also took into account that some Olympic sports compete on an all Ireland basis at the Olympic Games which makes it difficult to use \u2018United Kingdom\u2019 to describe the Team."
