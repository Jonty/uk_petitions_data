        "additional_details": "This country is a democracy and we the people demand the proposed cuts to police budgets are stopped. Police forces across the country are not only losing officers but custody centres are closing up and down the country and vital supplies are being replaced with cheaper alternatives or scrapped completely. Regardless what the politicians say these cuts will have a detrimental effect on policing and public safety. The prime minister must listen or the people of this country will ensure he will not get the chance again! ",
