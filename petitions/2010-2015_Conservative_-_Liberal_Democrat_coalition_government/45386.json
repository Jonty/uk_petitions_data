Hemihypertrophy is an example of Hemi-asymmetry, where part or all of one half of the body is enlarged, affecting multiple tissues on a primary basis. It affects approximately 1 in 80000 - 90000 births.\r\n\r\nOther very rare congenital overgrowth syndromes that have been reported to feature hemihypertrophy.\r\n\r\nHemihypertrophy is linked to a variety of benign and malignant disorders that usually appear during childhood, but can develop later in life. These disorders include cancer of the adrenal glands and liver.\r\n\r\nLittle is known, and little research is done.\r\n",
