        "additional_details": "We desperately need imposed speed limits for all vehicles passing pedestrians and animals on country roads and lanes. There is a misconception that walking in the countryside is safe - it is anything BUT safe.  There must be a limit of 30mph (preferably 20mph) when passing horses, pedestrians and livestock.  Animals can behave erratically for the simplest of reasons - birds, animals, fluttering litter, noises etc. and yet many people think that driving past people/animals at 40, even 50, miles and hour on narrow lanes is acceptable.  This stupidity and selfishness is costing lives.",
