        "additional_details": "If ALL car number plates were issed to the driver, not the car, it would save lives a year. By stopping those 100,000s who drive without licences & insurance from ever buying a car to begin with. With no number plates, an unlicenced driver could never drive the car.\r\n\r\nIf every time a car is sold, the number plates are retained by the owner & the new buyer supplies their own, it would employ 1000s across the country. Issuing number plates & annual plate renewals etc & all totally self financed by the fee's. To buy your number plates you would have to prove, drivers licence & when you register it to a vehicle, your insurance & MOT.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to look at the current law of issuing number plates & the criteria for being able to own a pair.",
