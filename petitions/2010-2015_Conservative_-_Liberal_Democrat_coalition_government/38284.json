        "additional_details": "I am proposing for the government to scrap the HS2 project and start putting things in place for a brand new airport in the Thames Estuary. I know many people like myself who feel that the HS2 projects positive impacts, aren't worth the negative impacts and the cost of the entire project. I feel that this airport allows for more airport capacity in the South East without expanding Heathrow.",
