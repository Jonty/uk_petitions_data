        "additional_details": "The government must abandon its plan to switch off the analogue radio signal, making digital radio the only option.  The analogue signal works perfectly well.  Ploughing millions of radio sets into landfill is obscene and about as ungreen as you can get.  I cannot afford new radio sets and throwing the existing ones away will be the only option if this switch off goes through. I, like many others have several radios including the one in my car. There is no proper provision for digital car radios the signal will not cover the whole of the UK.  This switch off policy encourages waste.",
