        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, urge Her Majesty's Government to restore court dress in England and Wales to their pre-2008 forms. Barristers should wear wigs and gowns in all cases (except with children and when the temperature is too high), and judges should wear their traditional robes and wigs in all cases (again, with the above exceptions). We believe that court dress strengthens the legal profession, and creates continuity and respect for the law.",
