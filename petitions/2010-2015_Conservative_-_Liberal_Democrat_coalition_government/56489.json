        "additional_details": "Cameras should not be allowed to film Court in session, as it may tempt barristers and judges to play to the camera, not focusing entirely on the actual matters of the case before them.\r\n\r\nWhile it is arguable that judges and barristers in the Court of Appeal are above this, it is a long established principle that if there is any possibility of something wrongly affecting a case and its procedures, then it has no place in Court.\r\n\r\nFrom cameras first being allowed in the Supreme Court to now being allowed in the Court of Appeal, it is foreseeable that this Americanisation of our Judiciary could eventually extend to Crown Courts and Magistrates Courts.\r\n\r\nAs such, we oppose the recent policy change allowing cameras in the Court of Appeal and call for its revocation.\r\n\r\n",
