        "additional_details": "House prices are bloody ridiculous.  At the moment renting a house costs more than a mortgage on the same property.\r\n\r\nThe rich people who own several houses are pushing up the costs of renting and also pricing middle class people out of the housing market because they buy all the houses, then they have a monopoly on the renting market.\r\n\r\nThis is taking the mick.  Yet another way the rich get richer and the poor don't get a bloody thing.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned petition Her Majesty's government to make illegal the renting/letting of residential properties at a price which exceeds that of servicing debts secured on the property.",
