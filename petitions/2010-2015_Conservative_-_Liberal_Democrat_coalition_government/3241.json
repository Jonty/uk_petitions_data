        "additional_details": "Barbed wire is a terrible invention, probably designed as a wartime defence mechanism, that has no place to be located alongside the footpaths of our green and pleasant countryside. Farmers wishing to restrict the movement of animals can use other materials effectively and have no real need of barbed wire. Barbed wire is dangerous and designed to cause injury. I propose that its use alongside footpaths should be banned.  ",
