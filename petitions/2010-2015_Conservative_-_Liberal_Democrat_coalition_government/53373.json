        "additional_details": "Since vets were allowed to charge for prescriptions from November 2008, charges have continued to escalate. While it is only right that vets should make a charge for the time taken to prepare the prescription, many feel that the charge is totally disproportionate to the time involved.\r\n\r\nI am therefore calling for a national cap to be introduced for veterinary prescriptions, to legally enforce an upper limit for such charges.\r\n\r\nI am not going to propose the value of the cap, but perhaps it should be commensurate with the cost of a doctor's prescription in England.",
