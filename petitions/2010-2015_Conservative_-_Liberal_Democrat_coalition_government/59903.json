        "additional_details": "The Queensbury Tunnel is the responsibility of the Highways Agency (Historic Railways Estate team) and they are due to start work on essential repairs very soon. It won't cost any more money to shore up the tunnel in such a way as to preserve a passageway through for walkers and cyclists, thereby making it possible to extend the existing Great Northern Railway Trail to Halifax. This magnificent piece of our industrial heritage will be a major attraction for visitors to Bradford and Halifax. We\u2019re not asking the Highways Agency to build the cycle route - just to keep the option open. In the future, as part of the legacy of the Tour de France, funding may be found to connect the tunnel to the City Connect scheme via Bradford through to Leeds (already funded by Department for Transport). PLEASE DON\u2019T BLOCK THE QUEENSBURY TUNNEL!",
