        "additional_details": "In the UK at this time, there is a huge amount of bullying taking place in schools primarily, but also workplaces, in neighbourhoods and other establishments. This is largely due to Government inactivity in passing legislation dictating how schools, academies, universities and colleges deal with the problem of bullying. Bullies should not be given a 'three strikes and you're out' policy, nor should the problem be brushed under the carpet. Schools should be forced to face up to the problem, deal with it effectively and put students first. None of this happens at the moment, because the schools have no accountability when it comes to dealing with bullies. It is about time that they did, and it is about time bullying is kicked out of our schools for good.\r\n\r\nPlease, sign this petition, make your voice heard, and maybe we can make the government do something about one of the greatest problems faced in schools across the country.",
