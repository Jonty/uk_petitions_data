        "additional_details": "British workers are increasingly being hired under controversial 'zero-hour' contracts.\r\n\r\nZero-hour contracts are arrangements by which staff agree to work as and when required, with no guaranteed hours or benefits, effectively giving bosses a pool of people who are \"on-call\" and usable when the need arises.\r\n\r\nThe classic case is where somebody is employed on a zero hours contract, they've got no guaranteed hours of work and therefore get no pay but the employer is insisting they cannot work for other people.\r\n\r\nI believe these contracts are exploitative and there is no benefit to the employee at all. I am calling for a total ban on zero hour contracts. Employers should give all workers a minimum contract.",
