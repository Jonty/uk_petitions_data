        "additional_details": "Samoa Airline are beginning to charge passengers by weight and size for air travel. In response Airbus, is thinking of trimming window seats and widening others. It is only a matter of time before all major carriers join Samoa and in turn purchase those new Airbus fittings as a reason to charge more. Air travel and prices should not be based on how large or small you are as a person, this is in fact prejudicial to those people who are larger. This petition is to make it illegal for Airlines to charge a passenger by their weight or size.",
