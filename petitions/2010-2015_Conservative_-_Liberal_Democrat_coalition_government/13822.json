        "additional_details": "The use of Baillifs in the UK should become a thing of the past. The use of intimidation and force to make someone pay back debt has no place in civilised society. The use of mediation and debt counselling should be promoted. The Baillif system is no different than 'sending the big boys' round. They have an ethics policy to adhere to which is being laughed at. It is virtually impossible to have any complaint against a baillif upheld. I call on the government to make this legalised bullying history.",
