        "additional_details": "Thirty years ago the Conservatives closed Twickenham Swimming Pool for renovations, it was never reopened.\r\n\r\nRecently I went to Richmond pool on a sunny day. The queue was about 40 persons long and once in the pool it was standing room only.\r\n\r\nThere was no room to swim I don\u2019t know if there is a limit to the number of people that can use the pool at the same time.\r\n\r\nI have recently contacted Vincent Cable MP, about Re-Building the Swimming pool.\r\nHe told me \u2018\u2019there is nothing that can be done and that such instances are not his decisions to make\u2019\u2019.\r\nTwickenham seems to be the poor cousin despite It\u2019s council tax rates are on a par with those in Richmond & Kingston.\u2019\u2019\r\n\r\nThe old Richmond pool was demolished and the new pool built.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Richmond Riverside compulsory purchased and rebuilt.\r\n\r\nThe Theatre also got \u00a34 million upgrade.\r\n\r\nThere have been Major Building works in Kingston ever since I can remember.\r\n\r\nPlease give this matter your attention.\r\n",
