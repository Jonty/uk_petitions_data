Any fundemental change in advertised policies or promises will be considered to have misled voters. Any mandate can only be given, if voters can rely upon manifesto or verbal promises,in the same way that advertisers must be legal decent and honest.\r\n\r\nIf politicians are seen to be misleading the voters before or after their election the individual and their party will be legally accountable and bi-elections must be called at the cost of the Party that has benefitted from false statements or promises.\r\n\r\nAn independant body with statutary powers and systems of complaint and publication of such must be created.",
