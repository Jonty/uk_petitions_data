        "additional_details": "I would like to ask for a little bit of help. In my little village Knebworth in Hertfordshire, across the road from me is this beautiful house. It is 111 London Rd Knebworth.\r\nIt was built in 1912 and has been there all this time and from the out side it is still the same since the day it was built.\r\nWell it seems that Council want to knock down this beautiful bit of history that stands in the village down. They are doing this so that can built even more homes for retirement living. We already have more than enough of this kind of housing in Knebworth that is sitting with many empty rooms and apartments. There is no reason for them to Knock this Beautiful building down. They could use the building as is and make some lovely apartments within.\r\n\r\nThe reason I am writing this for you all to read is because I don't think the council should be allowed to destroy our History so easily.",
