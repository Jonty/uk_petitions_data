        "additional_details": "In early March 2013 reports came from Lahore Pakistan of hundreds of homes and possessions belonging to Christian families being burnt out and destroyed by violent mobs leaving thousands homeless and in fear of their lives. These families were attacked simply because of their belief in Jesus.\r\n\r\nChristianity is a minority religion in Pakistan with a very limited representative voice within its own government. Please sign this petition to encourage our government to give a voice to the voiceless condeming these actions and demanding measures be taken by the Pakistani government to a. bring those who are guilty of this hate crime to justice, and b. to create a safe environment where religious freedom can be exercised by all.\r\nWe enjoy religious freedom in this country, sign to promote that same right of tolerance for all!",
