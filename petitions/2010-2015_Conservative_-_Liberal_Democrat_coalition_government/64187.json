        "additional_details": "The day David Moyes took charge of Manchester United, a nation rejoiced.\r\n\r\nWe began to recover from the recession, people started spending, the nation was brighter, safe in the knowledge that David Moyes was taking Manchester United to where they truly belonged.\r\n\r\nNow our people are in grave danger. The evil Glazer family have decided that the people's champion is no longer fit to continue in a role that has made our great country rejoice. I believe, many will agree that this needs Government intervention, for the good of the people. A widespread depression could once again cripple our lands if we do not act.\r\n\r\nAll hail David Moyes, the man who defeated Goliah.",
