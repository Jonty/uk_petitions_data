        "additional_details": "Marijuana doesn't harm no-body other than when its illegal, if it was legal then there wouldn't be no crime around it just be smart with it, allow it to be smoked in private property and public canabis locations e.g open up coffee shops like amsterdam.\r\nMarijuana doesn't kill, it never has done and never will, its never hurt any body it chills people out and helps relax and it would make the country a lot better and calm and it would most probably cut down a lot of crime. You don't have to smoke it to sign it just get my point and consider it.",
