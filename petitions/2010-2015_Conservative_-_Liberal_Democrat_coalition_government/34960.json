        "additional_details": "We have so many 99P stores now and so many products are 99P, we have a 50P coin and a \u00a31 coin. That is as close as we are going to get to 99P. England is in a rescission at the moment and not many people have as much money so they are going to 99P stores so it would make sense to introduce 99P coins into England to make shopping easier. I think it would make a large difference in the line for paying at 99P stores as all you have to do is hand one coin over and don't have to wait for change. ",
