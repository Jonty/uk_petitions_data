        "additional_details": "We would like the laws on child beggary to be strengthened. We want the police to have power to take the child immediately from the street, and away from the adult(s) who are \"caring\" from them. We want tougher sentences for the adults who are mistreating these children. We want the children to be allowed a childhood instead of forced slavery. These children are often drugged, beaten, uncared for, hungry and scared. They are being forced to beg on the street instead of having an education. They need to be shown love and be given a chance to have a childhood and to grow mentally and physically into great adults.",
