        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, are appealing to Eric Pickles to prevent any further development in  the Oxfordshire villages of Woodstock and Long Hanborough. Local residents are deeply concerned about the impact the latest projects will have as both places have already been severely affected by housing development and loss of green space. We risk losing not only more green space, but permanent change to the character and community of these quiet, friendly residences. The true nature of our homes is at risk of strangulation, schools and local amenities are becoming overcrowded, and traffic will double in this former peaceful rural community. Fields are becoming estates \u2013 no longer ploughed or played on\u2026but a concrete jungle changing our local society forever.\r\nPlease act now to protect the unique identity of our precious homes, and stop any further destruction of our community.",
