        "additional_details": "If Scotland choose to be independent from UK, border checks on all migrants from Scotland entering England & N. Ireland would become necessary to prevent illegal immigration. This possibility should be debated, discussed, considered & prepared for; as part of the debate on the referendum on whether Scotland should become independent from the UK. An independent Scotland may find it difficult to fund various state affairs like civil service, embassies, including border checks, Scottish passports, etc. In addition to free NHS, prescriptions, schooling and higher education, an independent Scotland may find it difficult to also fund defence, immigration, foreign affairs, EU membership, civil service, Inland Revenue, momentary system, passports & driving licencing, policing, prisons, legal aid, welfare benefits, embassies in foreign countries, etc. Independent Scotland\u2019s economy may well be stretched. Also new RN warships may not be built in an independent Scotland.",
