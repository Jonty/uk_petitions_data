If Marine A was captured, no mercy would have been shown to him.\r\nThe Marines have been witness to some terrible atrocities committed by the Taleban, therefore it is possible this could have been partially responsible for Marine A's unfortunate action.\r\n\r\nWe implore you to please re-assess Marine A's Case and show some clemency towards Marine A.\r\n\r\nThank you",
