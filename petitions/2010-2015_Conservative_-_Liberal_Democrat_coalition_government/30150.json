Sanctions are not enough. Immediate action is needed. This is genocide and cannot be allowed to happen. Assistance in Libya was forthcoming, why not Syria? Children and the elderly are among the victims of the relentless and merciless shelling of the cities. The \"free\" countries of the world cannot sit back and watch it happen. Action is required now. We ask the Government to intervene, militarily if necessary, to unite in strength against the Syrian regime and arm the rebel forces and show the world that genocide will not be tolerated!",
