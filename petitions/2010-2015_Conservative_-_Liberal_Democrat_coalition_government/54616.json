        "action": "Re-instate heating allowance for UK Citizens living in France",
        "additional_details": "FIVE French overseas departments - all of which have tropical climates - were included in the calculation of France's average winter temperature which was then used to determine whether British expatriates should continue to receive the winter fuel allowance. These included the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, the Indian Ocean islands of Reunion and Mayotte and French Guiana in South America, which had an average winter temperature of 26C.\r\n\r\nThese temperatures were used with those of mainland France to gain an average which was then compared with 5.6C for the south-west of England. If the resulting figure was higher - as was the case with France - the country is deemed \"too hot\" and the payments stopped\r\n\r\nIs this fair ? when British protectorates are not included \"only mainland Britain\" .\r\n\r\nUnless they are then this judgment needs to be reversed and the heating allowance re-instated.\r\n\r\nPlease sign up and help those this ruling is hurting !!!",
