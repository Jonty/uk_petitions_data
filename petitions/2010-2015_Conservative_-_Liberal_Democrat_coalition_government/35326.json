        "additional_details": "The government has stopped the benefits for invalids, but have not stopped any of their benefits. I would like the government to look at the inequality of the system he has brought in.I had a road traffic accident in March 2008. A 71/2 tonne wagon reversed over me, I have been left with nerve pain in both legs, my pelvis, back and right arm and shoulder. I have been classified as 60% disabled by two examinations by independent doctors. It seems that we can lose our benefits but government employees can still receive subsidises. I think if you are going to make cuts it would be better if you started from the top and worked down, not the other way round. Cut the extra benefits you receive first and let the people see you are.",
