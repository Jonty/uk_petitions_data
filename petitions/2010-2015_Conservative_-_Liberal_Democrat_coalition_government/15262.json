Thereby making sure that all our skills bases in the UK are fully qualified and certified to do the job they were taken on to do.\r\nCurrently, there is law that stops anyone calling themselves an 'Engineer' or a 'Technician', compared to our fellow engineering fraternity in the USA. By insisting that all qualified technicians and engineer's are registered through the engineering council would ensure that ONLY qualified and certified technicians and engineer's can use the word's 'Technician' and 'Engineer' on their CV's and would enable companies to weed out non qualified prospective candidates.",
