        "additional_details": "BT' are in the process of placing large 5' 6\" high green boxes on the pavement outside houses.  This can happen to anyone - one was placed outside our bungalow this morning and since our property is some 5' below pavement level! effectively the top is in line with the eaves of the property thus blocking any view from our living room/front door as well as any daylight and will prevent us from maintaining our property/fence/hedge.  BT have been given permission to place these totally inappropriate boxes anywhere they wish with no regard to the loss of value to the homeowner.  This permission needs to be rescinded IMMEDIATELY and all boxes removed/changed to a smaller less obtrusive size.",
