        "additional_details": "We, the signatories of this petition believe that the UK armed forces should be used solely to defend the United Kingdom. We believe that our forces should not interfere with the politics and policies of other countries, regardless of their nature, unless it directly affects the UK. We do not believe that current conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya pose a direct threat to th UK which could not be addressed at home by defending our own borders. We believe that the UK Forces should be withdrawn from conflicts overseas and utilused in the defence of our own borders from terrorists who continue to enter and operate in the UK and illegal immigrants who drain our country of funds. Utiluse our forces at sea ports, rail ports, airports to protect our borders and become a real deterrent to wrongdoers who wish to enter our land. The one exception to this is that we should create a specific humanitarian force to help in areas of the world affected by natural disaster.",
