        "additional_details": "Ban road tolls in England, we all pay Road Tax and MOT fees to maintain the roads in England, so why should we pay an additional charge to use certain roads.\r\n\r\nIf the Government is to go ahead with the Toll idea on the A14, all this will do is push motorists to find alternative routes around the A14.\r\n\r\nBy increasing traffic on minor roads, will lead to more road repairs on these roads.  In turn this will increase the local councils road repair budget, which our goverment is already cutting.  Then the council will have no choice but to increase council tax. Yet again the average working person will be footing the bill.  Our Government did not ask the question what do our voters want. So I feel this petition needs to be put forward for the government to see what the people of ENGLAND say on this matter.\r\n\r\nAs it is us (the voters) who put you in power !",
