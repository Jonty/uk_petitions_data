        "additional_details": "All Police front desks in Kent will have limited or reduced opening areas, as of the 28 July 2014. This means if you need to call into a police station or  contact point, you will have to do it within the hours of 9 to 5, so if you work and you need to attend a police station for any reason, you could have major difficulties. Basically the cost cut is reducing the Opportunity to speak to someone face to face.  We are asking for a review of the cuts.",
