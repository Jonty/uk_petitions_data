This can cost the seller thousands of pounds in fees if the buyer pulls out even after they have agreed to buy. In Scotland, once you have confirmed you want to buy the property you have to complete the process, this should be the same across the UK. I am calling for the Government to change this legisation and commit to a change. Make it law that once you agree to buy a property you have to fulfil this!",
