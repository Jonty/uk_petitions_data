        "additional_details": "My brother was fatally stabbed in Tower Hamlets in 1997 and his murderer was acquitted through lack of forensic evidence and witness intimidation.  John Kennedy was a hard working father of two and a much loved family member and member of his community. The most important thing families need is justice and in my brothers case this is being sabotaged again 17 years later by the WALK ON BY attitude of British Society and misguided code of conduct to remain silent. There were over 50 witnesses to my brothers murder whom are refusing to give evidence baring one. I want David Cameron to highlight how his government can get publicity on these cases to help families and encourage witnesses to come forward and not be the WALK ON BY BRITAIN we seem to be. Without encouragement these witnesses will not come forward and we have murderers walking free on our streets. This is not Justice. ",
