What he sees as a good move, I feel is pathetic. As usual it is the students, the teachers and the parents who will suffer for this idiotic idea, by adding more pressure on an already stressful area.\r\nQuoting his recent statement \"School days are longer, school holidays shorter. The expectation is that to succeed, hard work is at the heart of everything.\"\r\nPractice what you preach Mr Gove, if you expect this of students and teachers, then surely MP's should fall in line. MP's should reduce drastically the extortionate amount of holidays that they have and fall in line with the rest of the white collared workers, take 5 weeks leave plus bank holidays. Don't forget your own words \" Hard work is at the heart of everything.\"",
