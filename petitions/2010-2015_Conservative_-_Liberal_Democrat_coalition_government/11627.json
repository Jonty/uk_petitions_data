        "action": "Free public transport for under 18s",
        "additional_details": "Currently public transport costs are a major concern for students as the cost of simply getting to school is no longer offset by EMA. We feel that as these students are doing the right thing by furthering their education it's only fair that the cost of getting to their school or college is free.\r\n\r\nFurthermore if young people wish to gain some independence the public transport system is their only way of getting around. As young people tend to be poorer in cash terms it is unfair to charge them for public transport because this takes out a large proportion of their income and therefore means they are more reliant on their parents.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call on the Government to introduce free public transport for under 18s at all times.",
