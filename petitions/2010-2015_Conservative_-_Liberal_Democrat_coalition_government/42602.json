We must deal with the causes of conflict \u2013 the long injustice done to the Palestinians, for which the British government is morally responsible.  The inequality of past peace processes allowed Israel to steal and murder with impunity. America is an unfit arbitrator. Britain and the EU have the power to end this historic injustice and create peace, by ensuring Palestinians can come to talks on equal terms. We must end the occupation by ending trade and aid to Israel. EU trade with Israel is valued at round E30 billion, including E231 million per annum of imports from illegal Israeli settlements. With trade and aid we support the Israeli military monster, whilst Palestinian civilians are denied any defence against it.\r\n\r\nThe British Government must apply and call for an EU-wide Boycott, Sanctions and Divestment against Israel.
