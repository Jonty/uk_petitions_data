        "additional_details": "The Sudanese Government, led by Al Bashir  has been carrying out a 10 year campaign of genocide against its own people who are of Black African ethnicity.They have been acting with absolute impunity even though they have been wanted for war crimes for most of those years.Their campaign centres mainly around Darfur, the Nuba Mountains, and the Blue Nile.Daily bombing raids are carried out by Migs, Antonov jets and helicopter gunships and on the ground atrocities are carried out by the Arab backed militia .Every day innocent men women and children are systematically sought out and murdered.The world is strangely silent.in stark contrast to the events in Syria and S.Sudan.We urgently request the British Government to break its silence and put pressure on Al Bashir to stop  these atrocities with immediate effect. We cannot allow this to go on any longer. Please sign our petition and add your voice to fight for those who have none.",
