        "additional_details": "Any Internship lasting more than two weeks must be subject to National Minimum Wage laws and comply with all government legislation and regulations that apply to employment and being employed in the UK. Any form of 'work experience' or attendance at/with a company for more than two weeks must qualify as work, and therefore must deserve pay. Businesses must not be allowed to continue to exploit young people by having them working for free under the guise of an \"internship\". It only promotes elitism and expands the wealth gap further. Abolish unfair and unpaid Internships.",
