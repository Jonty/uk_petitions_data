This will give them the right to soil their ballot paper to indicate their rebellion against political parties.\r\nWhere over 33.3% of the electorates who cast their votes represents rebellion votes, then independent and Non party based representatives MUST be allowed to contest a new election with ONLY party representative who gain over 33.3% of votes cast.\r\nSuch independent and non party based representative MUST meet criteria set before they are allowed to be presented on ballot paper.",
