We live in one of the most ethnically mixed societies in the world and this should be the focus. They should be learning about World History, which should be unbiased, factual and give children a broad scope of knowledge for their future. For example, Apartheid and genocide, wars indeed including civil ones, slave trade and the history behind it as well as colonial history and the impact on those countries and their culture and economies, political history too and much more depending on their learning capacity and age.\r\n",
