        "additional_details": "Supplementary or alternatively to giving overseas aid:\r\n1. Reduce the cost of UK imprisonment by inviting nations, which the UK supports with aid, to tender for building prisons in their country and providing a secure service to HMG standards.\r\n2. In 2009/10 we spent \u00a36.6 bn in aid. Boosting wealth creation & introducing transparency in aid are at the fore of HMG's strategy. Outsourcing the prison service would be consistent with this mission.\r\n3. Bangladesh, Congo, Ethiopia etc. benefit from aid & could provide this service cheaper than the UK, where it costs ca. \u00a340k per year to imprison each of our 85,000 inmates.\r\n4.Furthermore, local Community Service could offer offenders experience of local customs, living conditions etc.\r\n5. Detail to debate includes which category of offenders. frequency of visits, television channels available, diet & much more.",
