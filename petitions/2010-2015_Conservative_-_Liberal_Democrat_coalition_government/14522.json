        "additional_details": "Current planning law ignores the rights of individual householders where development is concerned, local and district councils can be overruled by the planning inspectorate despite local issues. The planning inspectorate however can only go by the rules set down by government; loss of privacy, overshadowing and loss of light appear to very low down the list of inspectorate priorities. The term \u201csome loss of privacy should be expected in a suburban environment\u201d comes to mind but if you have total privacy to start with why should you loose that?\r\n\r\nDevelopers tend to have teams of solicitors and deep pockets to get the maximum return on investment compared to an individual home owner who in the current climate struggles to pay the bills. It is about time that planning law reflected the needs of individuals rather than the developers please support this petition to protect our homes and future quality of life and community.\r\n",
