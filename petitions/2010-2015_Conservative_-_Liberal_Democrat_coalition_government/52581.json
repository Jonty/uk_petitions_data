        "additional_details": "Highly considered as unfair as we are not treated equal. For citizens with a passion and dream to join the army but are declined due to a nut allergy their dreams are crushed. Proposing that you can join at own risk and the army will not be held responsible in the event of a severe reaction, this also reduces the rate of unemployment. Is it fair that we are treated different because of something we can not choose? Vegetarian, halal and kosher are all catered for with no exception of a severe nut allergy. ",
