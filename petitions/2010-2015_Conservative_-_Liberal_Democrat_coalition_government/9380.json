If benefit recipients can somehow afford holidays, they should be taken in the UK to ensure tax funded benefits are directed back into the UK economy.\r\n\r\nInhibit all beneift recipients from subscribing to monthly mobile telephone subscriptions or satellite/cable TV subscriptions. Provide suppliers with a list of benefit recipients and make it illegal, for credit control purposes if nothing else, to ensure benefits are not directed to luxuries not affordable to many on the national average wage.",
