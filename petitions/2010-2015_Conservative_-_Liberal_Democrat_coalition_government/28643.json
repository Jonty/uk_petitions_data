        "additional_details": "What I propose is that Local Authorities, Almo\u2019s and Government funded organisations are penalised from the practice of ignoring the skills of local people and employing outside the community.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Local Authorities, Almo,s  and government funded  organisations are employing or contracting  the services of  workers or  business that are up to at least 80 miles away or more from vulnerable service users in attempt to save money putting service users at risk. They are not being made accountable for this high risk practice and petition the government to make it illegal.\r\n\r\nThis petition is a change which would establish a local connection in employment and the local economy. It would create a better and safer community, reduce traffic on the roads and boost the individual local economies.\r\n",
