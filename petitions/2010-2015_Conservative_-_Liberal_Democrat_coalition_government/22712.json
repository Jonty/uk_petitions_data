        "additional_details": "Britain is now in a state where moral bankruptcy seems to be the normal condition.\r\nMorals and social responsibility are the lynch pins on which a functioning society hangs.\r\nPolitical and corporate immorality and greed set a poor example to many in our society.\r\nIt is now time to turn this around by ensuring that politicians at all levels are above reproach, acting in the interest of those who elect them, not in the interest of lobbyists, themselves etc.\r\nCorporations and businesses operating in Britain should be encouraged by the government to pay fair taxes.\r\nThe culture of greed within financial operations requires curbing considerably.\r\nPerhaps, if we had visibility of these things, many ordinary people would be encouraged to behave in a similar fashion and we would then have a more coherent society  where funding and support for the less well off members of society was available.\r\nA dream perhaps? But a good one.",
