        "additional_details": "We would like the practice of surface dressing to end.\r\n\r\nSurface dressing is the repair of a road surface carried out by spraying bitumen emulsion on to the road surface and then applying granite chippings.\r\n\r\nWhen this process is finished, there are always vast quantities of loose material left on the road surface that seem to do an excellent job of coating the car bodywork with tar and chipping the paintwork, damaging vehicles.\r\n\r\nPlease resurface our roads properly, we pay enough to use them.",
