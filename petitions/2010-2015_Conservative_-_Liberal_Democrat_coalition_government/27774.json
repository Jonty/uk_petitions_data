        "additional_details": "The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and PROTECT IP Act (PIPA) legislation, if brought in by US Congress, could ultimately hinder UK nationals looking at information on the internet.\r\n\r\nOn January 18th 2012, Wikipedia has protested against this legislation stating that \"in its current form, SOPA would require Wikipedia to actively monitor every site [they] link to, to ensure it doesn't host infringing content. Any link to an infringing site could put [Wikipedia] in jeopardy of being forced offline\". Should Websites, such as Wikipedia go offline, UK businesses and members of the public would not be able to benefit from the use of free information on the internet. This could damage private UK businesses, and potentially affect the UK Economy.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, ask that the UK Government oppose the current two pieces of legislation, proposed by the US Congress, due to the potentially large impact it will have on non-Americans using American websites.",
