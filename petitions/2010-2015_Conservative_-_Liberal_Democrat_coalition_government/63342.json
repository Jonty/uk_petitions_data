        "additional_details": "In certain areas of the country waiting times for radiography results can be in excess of five weeks.  These include important diagnostic scans such as MRIs and CT scans.  This is an unacceptable amount of time to wait in order to receive a diagnosis, and can lead to unnecessary progression of conditions during this extended period.\r\n\r\nA realistic limit of two weeks  for patients to receive radiographic results would reduce undue suffering, pain and progression of conditions.  All primary care trusts should have to adhere to a statutory limit of two weeks in which to provide radiographic results to all patients.",
