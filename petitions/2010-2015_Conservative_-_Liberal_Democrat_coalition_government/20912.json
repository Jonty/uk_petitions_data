        "action": "Stop Cuts to Solar PV Feed-in Tariffs",
        "additional_details": "On 31st October 2011 the Department for Energy and Climate Change proposed to cut feed-in tariffs (FITs) for solar energy generation from 43.3p to 21p, a drop of over 50%.  This cut would affect retrofit installations of less than 4kW.  Cuts proposed to FITs in other generation capacities were similarly drastic.\r\n\r\nWe petition the government to withdraw this proposal and halt their attempt to cut FITs across all capacities, but especially below 4kW.  These cuts would be highly destructive to the solar energy industry, which as a new sector is highly vulnerable to drastic market changes.  If the plan is passed, it will jeopardise the 25,000 jobs directly linked to the industry, not to mention put terrific strain on at least ten times as many that that supply the industry such as manufacturers, movers, scaffolders, electricians, plumbers, web developers and stationers.",
