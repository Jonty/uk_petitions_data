        "additional_details": "For many of us buying a freehold is out of our grasp and the only way of getting on the housing ladder is a leasehold. Many leasehold contracts where written a long time ago with planning restrictions and regulations for improving your home that does not take modern techniques and solutions into account. For example many freeholders does not allow the use of wooden flooring due to noise when modern solution(e.g. a noise reducing underlay) has been developed to combat this issue and are often better for sound and heat isolation then most carpets. Some of these draconian regulations makes us feel like we are still renting in our own home. The terms for leaseholders should be reviewed and updated at regular intervals to move with the times.\r\n\r\n      ",
