        "additional_details": "The accusations against Mr. Assange (he has yet to be officially charged with any crime) do not fall inside the realms of illegality under British law; many legal minds have dubbed them trivial and, more importantly, a waste of the court's time. The original case was dropped within 24 hours whilst Mr. Assange was still in Sweden, proving also that even if seen through Swedish eyes the charges have no legal substance.\r\nThe continuation of the prosecution (and resulting persecution) of a man who has done nothing wrong under the laws of the country which imprisons him is unacceptable and must be reviewed impartially by the British government. The British government should review the accusations against Mr. Assange and come to a decision as to whether or not his continued prosecution is necessary - all of this without intervention from Sweden, which already dropped the case while it was in its hands and whose input is therefore considerably less relevant.\r\n",
