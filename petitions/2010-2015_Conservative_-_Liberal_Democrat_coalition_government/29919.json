        "additional_details": "At the moment a majority of the Early Pregnancy Units (EPU's) are only open during the weekday for a few hours a day and not on weekends.  Patients who are experiencing a threatening miscarriage/miscarriage are informed that they need to wait a few days in order to be seen.  I would like to petition that all EPU's are open at least 7 days a week so all women experiencing early pregnancy problems can be seen and be given peace of mind immediately.",
