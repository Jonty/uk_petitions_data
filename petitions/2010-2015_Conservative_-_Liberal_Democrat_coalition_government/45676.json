        "additional_details": "Loosing a child is the most heart breaking painful loss any parent will experience and i hope you will join me in signing this petition for press restrictions to become mandatory to protect any child under 18yrs of age from being named when an Inquest takes place.  The booklet by the Ministry of Justice which gives Guidance on Coroners and Inquests says.....\"All inquests must be held in public in accordance with the principle of open justice, and so members of the public and journalists have the right to, and indeed may, attend\" ......It seems unfair especially when there are automatic press restrictions on defendants who are Youths when they break the law and appear at Court.  Can i please thank you if you have taken the time to read this and sign the petition.  Can i also please ask that you share this e-petition with your family and friends, thank you xxxx  Joshua's mum xxx",
