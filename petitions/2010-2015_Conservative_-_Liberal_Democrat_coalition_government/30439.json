        "additional_details": "The House of Commons Commission has recently announced that:\r\n\r\n\"As part of the Savings Programme, Clock Tower tours should be self-financing. In order to cover costs of administering the tours, and enabling these premium tours to continue, there will be an admission charge of \u00a315.00 per visitor.\"\r\n\r\nWe believe this decision should be looked at again. As it stands, it will now cost a family of four up to \u00a360 to visit the clocktower.\r\n\r\nSurely there are other ways of saving money, such as publishing Parliamentary papers on the Internet?\r\n\r\nWe believe that Parliament - all of it - should remain free and open to British citizens. A Parliament for the many, not the few.\r\n.",
