        "additional_details": "Islam is a vile political and religious movement that preaches death and inequality to all non Muslim people the world over. The latest killing of a British Soldier in broad daylight by two Muslims showcases this fact. As do many many documented terrorist atrocities the world over.\r\n\r\nIslam should be made illegal and all Muslims should be made to leave the UK whatever the cost. I'm not saying all Muslims are to hurt people or to be part of terrorist groups, I just think them being in Britain is making things worse. Sooner or later something bad may arise if somethings not sorted asap. Their countries don't allow any other religions so why should we have to out up with is? -It's practically the governments fault for not caring about immigration in the first place!\r\n\r\n",
