This policy of cuts is like sailing the channel in a bath without a plug: it will stay afloat for only a short time before it sinks with no chance of being rescued.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon our MP\u2019s to stand up for the  impoverished in our Country and protect the citizens of our communities from these draconian cuts and vote against the spending review. And replace them with a transaction Tax on the wealthiest and cuts to MP\u2019s perks.\r\n",
