The church has no place in influencing laws which will effect people who are either not Christian or do not follow any religion. It is entirely possible for those who wish to live by the more prejudiced teachings of the Bible to do so without it becoming mandatory for everyone. Individuals should be able to make decisions concerning abortion and gay marriage/adoption on their own without being told how they should act.",
