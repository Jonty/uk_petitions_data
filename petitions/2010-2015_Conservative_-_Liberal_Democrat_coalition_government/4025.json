        "additional_details": "Bus services away from London are shocking. Either an uncoordinated free for all or a local monopoly, with very expensive fares. Franchised routes are becoming more common as long term profitability declines and private operators pull out of marginal routes. The answer is simple.  Re-regulate the industry so that local authorities and PTE's specify services and fares. Continue to franchise operations after that.  We get local accountability for service provision and growth back to a currently declining industry.",
