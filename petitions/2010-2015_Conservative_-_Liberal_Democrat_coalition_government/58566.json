        "additional_details": "We are opposed to the censorship of the Internet in any form. Responsible internet use lies in the hands of guardians rather than a web filter. Such a web filter is likely an insufficient safe guard and can be seen as a creeping attempt to censor information.\r\n\r\nWe believe the net should be neutral traffic should not be discriminated against based on content or protocol. To do so would be an invasion of privacy. Requiring users to opt-out of a web filter forces them to document their online activity. We do not believe it is the responsibility of the UK government to impose regulations of what content can be consumed on the Internet.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the Internet should remain free of any kind of deep packet inspection, the kind much like the illegal trials conducted by BT with Phorm on 18,000 unknowing users in 2006. Such implementation lays ground for further restriction ahead and increased censorship.\r\n\r\nWe do not think censorship should be delegated to the state and oppose this. ",
