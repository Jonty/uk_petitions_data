        "additional_details": "I petition Her Majesty's Government and the Parliament of the United Kingdom to reintroduce Corporal Punishment into schools. As a former teacher who left the profession owing to the failure of teacher's powers to take discipline, I would urge this. When I was at school I had an education because I dare not learn. These days, children do what they like and teachers have no effective measure to make them learn. The invisible line needs to be brought back which will see standards rise.",
