I am sick to death for example of not being able to sit within a cinema screen or in a theatre without seeing somebody either texting or checking their Facebook status and the screens lighting up the whole room. Even the so-called quiet carriages on trains are no longer safe, and then when you ask them to stop you receive nothing but abuse!\r\n",
