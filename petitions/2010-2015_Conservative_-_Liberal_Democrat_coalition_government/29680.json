All dogs should be kept on a lead in parks & public places (particularly those with children's play areas).\r\n\r\n2.The dangerous dog breeds list to be reconsidered and ammended to include Staffordshire Terriers, and these (and similar) breeds to be muzzled at all times in public places.\r\n\r\n3.The introduction of compulsory electronic dog 'chipping' and owner registration.\r\n",
