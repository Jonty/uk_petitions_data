        "additional_details": "The current CSA mandate is totally unfair.  Most fathers are not bad people and one size does not fit all.  Currently the mother is portrayed as a victim, money is taken from the father without the father having any say or any rights in most instances.  The mother can lie and refuse access to children and this is taken as fact.   No further checks are made that the money is spent on the children, or the welfare of the children.  The mother who often lives on benefit is often better off than the father who is working.  Why is it considered fair and acceptable to ruin a second family's life in favour of a woman who lies and doesn't work or contribute anything to society.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to encourage the Government to completely scrap the current system and set up a new one where every case is treated separately and means tested, and most importantly fathers are treated as people rather than cash cows.",
