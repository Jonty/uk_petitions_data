The age group already penalised by having to wait upto 6 years longer for their OAP now will only get the lower rate of pension.  We were told if we waited longer for our OAP we would get a higher rate when eligable. NOT SO.\r\nThere isnt many of usin this group, so we need to get our families to support us. Spread the word.\r\nIDS please review the double blow you are inflicting of women born between 1950 and 54.",
