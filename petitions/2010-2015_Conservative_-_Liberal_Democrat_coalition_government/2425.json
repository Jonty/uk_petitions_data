        "additional_details": "The petition is for what 99% of people want on this website, which is change from our unitary state to a federal state.  A federal state is governed in areas of around 5 million where as unitary is run from parliament in our case. IN SIMPLE TERMS YOU MOVE YOUR LAWS AND LIFESTYLE CHANGE TO SUIT YOU. FEDERAL STATES MAKE THERE OWN LAWS ON A REGIONAL BASIS SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ONES THAT ARE MADE NOT IN YOUR INTEREST. The Labour core votes exists in the north and they please these people when in power but make the south extremely unhappy and the complete opposite for the conservative party. I can give you an example in the last election across the south east Labour took 4 seats out of 84 the Conservatives took 75, clearly an extremely unhappy area. We need a federal state for all are sanity. THE REST OF THE PETITIONS WILL HAPPEN IF YOU SIGN THIS.\r\nThank you Ben",
