        "action": "Campaign to remove Owen Patterson from government before he inflicts any more damage on the environment by his intended use of GM crops",
        "additional_details": "Owen Patterson is one of the most destructive environmental ministers we have ever had. Wildlife is a major problem for him and not in his list of priorities whatsoever. He is now wanting to play God by trying to force feed the nation with Genetically Modified food. GM food is unnatural man made rubbish with myriad controversies surrounding them. The use of pesticides that go hand in hand with the production of GM food will greatly increase, damaging even further our precious wildlife and their precious habitat. We as a nation have a choice and that is NOT to follow the rest of the world into an abyss of massive, avoidable proportions. Why can't Owen Patterson see that Great Britain should be global leaders in managing without GM crops instead of being global leaders in poisoning its people?\r\nSign this petition to remove this monster Owen Patterson from government and give us all and our children a chance.\r\nMany, many thanks.",
