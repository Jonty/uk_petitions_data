        "additional_details": "Access to public transport for people using wheelchairs is essential. The space is necessary for wheelchair users because if they do not have the opportunity to use public transport as a legal right then they are being discriminated against. Maybe it is possible for newer bus models to have spaces for prams or for 2 wheelchair users to use the same bus. This will ensure that they do not miss appointments or are later for work. It is the job the if the Transport Minister to ensure that there is adequate provision for wheelchair users or indeed other disabled people who may travel walking aids or with a dog.",
