        "additional_details": "Petition stems from Government authorities imposing regulations on voluntary bodies ( in this case a Hospice ) that ban volunteers from producing ( free ) produce due to lack of control of the environment in which they ( cakes ) are produced and the provenance of the contents. Simplistically Hospices are for the dying - cakes will not exacerbate that. Cutting to the chase - please add your name to this petition to endorse the view that mindless health and safety is, at the very least counter productive, and at its worst expensive and soul destroying. This is just one example - I am sure everyone will have others.",
