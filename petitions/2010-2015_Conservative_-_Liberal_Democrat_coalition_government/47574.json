        "additional_details": "The NHS ceased to be a legal entity when hospitals were transferred into independent trusts and therefore the name is no longer appropriate.  Up until that time, the NHS could have been taken to court.  Nowadays that is not possible because the NHS does nothing any more.  Additionally, there is no 'national' service any more, which is demonstrated by the amount of postcode lottery going on over various medications and operations to treat seriously ill people. The proposed new name properly describes what it does and will serve as a reminder to anybody and everybody who uses it, JUST WHO IT IS WHO IS PAYING FOR IT.",
