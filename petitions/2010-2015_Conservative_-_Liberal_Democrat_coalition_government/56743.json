        "additional_details": "This petition calls for much tougher restrictions to be placed on the sale of OTC (over the counter) codeine containing medicines such as Nurofen Plus and Co Codamol.\r\n\r\nIt calls for a system similar to the model used in Ireland, where a database is used to restrict repeat access to these medications and stop people buying them at multiple pharmacies and thus prevent addiction to codeine, and the health problems which arise as a result of overuse of ibuprofen and paracetamol also present in these medicines.\r\n\r\nMake it mandatory for any pharmacy that stocks over the counter products containing codeine to put up a poster directing people who are addicted to codeine, onto local drug addiction help services.\r\n",
