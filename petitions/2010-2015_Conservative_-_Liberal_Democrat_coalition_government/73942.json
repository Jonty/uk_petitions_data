Modern business is doing this so as they can exploit ordinary people by using them only when they need them and not when mums, dads and families need the money. This practice must stop. Sign this petition and we will lobby to legally enforce minimum hours contracts that stipulate your expected working hours.\r\nOvertime is a privilege for the company, not for workers...",
