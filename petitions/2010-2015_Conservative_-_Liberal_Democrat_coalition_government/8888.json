        "additional_details": "Proposing basic military service for all people between the ages of 16 and 18 be introduced in the United Kingdom to tackle unemployment among young people, this would also tackle the problem of young people finding nothing better to do other than to riot in the streets of our beloved communities for no reason other than wanting to cause trouble due to proper lack of morals and any sense of responsibility. Military Service should be introduced for all young people regardless of being in employment or education.\r\n\r\nObviously the current system is not working, either parents are failing in their duty, or the education system has become far too basic that important virtues like respect are not part of their teaching agenda.\r\n\r\nYoung people need to have a sense of belonging; they require something greater than themselves to aspire and look up to and must be taught the importance of being responsible for yourself, and your actions. Nowadays most have no sense of responsibility at all.",
