Currently the UK has NO Safety Legislation in place thus permitting CE Self Certificated Hot Tubs to be imported from China, these hot tubs are notorious for poor quality & in many cases are deemed Dangerous.  Built without 'Entrapment filters' as is Law in America/Canada VGB ACT 2008 & not built to American/Canadian specific Hot Tub/Spa Electric Standard UL1563.  Hot Tubs are lethal without these specifications and someone will get hurt.\r\n-- ",
