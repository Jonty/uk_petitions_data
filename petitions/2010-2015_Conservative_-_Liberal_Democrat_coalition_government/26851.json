This faith, ie the lack of reason, has resulted in many crimes against humanity and the deaths of millions over the centuarys.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is accepted that in many cases religion is a force for good. Indeed of the value of the literature and many of the teachings should be expounded. Perhaps it would be prudent to be clear about what can happen when faith is followed blindly and be clear about it in the appropriate place and time.\r\n\r\nThe exact form these warnings should take must obviously be discussed. but to give you the essence of my idea lets pick an example from food safety. Have you ever seen the warning \"may contain nuts\"? ",
