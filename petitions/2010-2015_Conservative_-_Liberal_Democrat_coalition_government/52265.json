        "additional_details": "Over 200,000 Chinese lanterns are sold in the UK each year, yet many people are unaware of the deadly consequences their release can have for animals. When fallen parts are accidentally eaten by animals their frames can cause internal bleeding and a slow, painful death.\r\n\r\nOn 1st July 2013, a Chinese lantern caused a massive fire at a recycling plant in the West Midlands, injuring 10 firefighters.\r\n\r\nLanterns pose a risk to the countryside, houses, animal AND humans. This petition calls for an immediate ban.",
