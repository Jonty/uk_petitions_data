That is 'encouraged' in a biased sense of such open technologies to allow personal informatics to be demonstrated, as in government, in general life, that systems do not, by some sysadmin security sense, divide work from life [control the dataflow - rule the numbercrunchers], rather encourage connectivity and personal contributions to IT as used in such everyday .life. ]\r\nTo see MP's using Kindles [eg TM] rather than scraps of paper should be good - and for home IT to be personal while with connectivity to organised systems - should not seem so strange?",
