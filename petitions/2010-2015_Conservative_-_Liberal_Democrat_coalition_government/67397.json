Having lived in Oz for a year where people pay a contribution towards their healthcare ( generally the treatments no better than here!), I have a renewed respect for the NHS. How on earth is still standing?\r\nI feel in order to save NHS from going under and failing more people, that everyone using its services pays a reasonable/ fair contribution towards their treatment. E.g in Oz a $30 'gap' for each GP visit (you make sure you only go when you really need to!). Each treatment has a different 'gap' but it was never unreasonable, and those on benefits had reduced gaps or none. Also many took out health insurance which paid for most 'gaps'.\r\nTo become a healthy service again where those needing help get it and where staff feel valued and motivated, the NHS needs more money. I would be happy to contribute fairly if it means my family get the help they need when they need it.",
