        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, petition to prevent Michael Gove's suggested 'reforms' of the A-level system back to how it has been previously. We believe that A-levels have NOT become easier, but the examination system has become more fair, in that it gives maximum potential for students to demonstrate their knowledge of the specification, and not on less relevant points. Over time, progress has been made, and the examination system has been improved. We strongly oppose any changes intended to take the system back to how it was before.",
