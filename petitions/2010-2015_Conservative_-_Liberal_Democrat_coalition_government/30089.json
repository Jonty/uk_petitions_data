        "additional_details": "Hello, my issue that I want to address is the affect that humans are having on the natural climate.  We have mistreated earth's will and disregarded the health of our planet for our own greedy needs. None of us are exactly alike and we have our disagreements, but I think that for once, we should stop thinking about ourselves and begin to think about she who gave us life. For she has done nothing to harm us nor given us reason to destroy her, and yet we do such things so ignorantly.\r\n\r\nIn order to help I want the government to:\r\n\r\n- Demolish all fossil fuel energy plants\r\n- Replace these with wind farms, solar farms and operating stations for wave energy generators\r\n- Give the public a cheap option to generate their own electricity ( including farmers and rural householdings where wind turbines are an option )\r\n- LOVE THE EARTH\r\n\r\nIf you sign this I would be eternally grateful and my dreams would come true...\r\nTogether, We Can Make A Difference!\r\n",
