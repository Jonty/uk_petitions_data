        "additional_details": "Urgently enshrine in law that people struggling to pay the 'spare room subsidy' also known as 'The Bedroom Tax' and who can clearly show they are taking steps to try and downsize should be protected from eviction for rent arrears that may accrue as a result. As well as this make it a requirement that a housing provider cannot refuse a person seeking to downsize to avoid payment of this dreadful 'tax' a move if they have arrears of rent. At present some landlords require a clear account before allowing the move and nobody should find themselves trapped in the vicious cycle that this could create which then leads to massive debt and eviction.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue that I have heard from some people in my own area, as well as news stories of people losing their homes over this issue.\r\n\r\nNobody should face homelessness over this all the while they are at least attempting to avoid it by moving.\r\n",
