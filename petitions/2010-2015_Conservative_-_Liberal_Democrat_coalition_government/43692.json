        "additional_details": "Corporates in the UK are holding \u00a336bn in overdue payments, let alone those being held within terms up to 90 days.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of England has been trying to force banks to lend \u00a340bn to SME's to get the economy moving.\r\n\r\nHowever will SME's borrow to invest when confidence is low? Investment and growth are more likely to happen if they have their own cash.\r\n\r\nWe need to adopt payment terms such as those in Germany. We need 30 day mandatory payment terms.\r\n\r\nThis will benefits SMEs, increase confidence, employment and the corporates also see the benefit as more is spent on the high st, invested in capital equipment etc. The whole economy will speed up.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Germany has consistently out performed the UK, is 30 day payment terms. They use, spend, invest their cash at 2-3 times the speed the UK does. It can be no surprise they have grown quicker and stronger over the decades.\r\n\r\nThis should be the No1 priority for government to get the economy moving.",
