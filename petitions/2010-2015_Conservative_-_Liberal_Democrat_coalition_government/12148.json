        "additional_details": "There should be a breast feeding facility/cubicle on every high street...\r\n\r\nSimilar to that of public toilets, however every new registered mother should receive a key/card to enter the facility to prevent violation and vandalism of the premises, that she may replace under certain circumstances if lost.\r\n\r\nThis would be highly beneficial for breast feeding mothers who struggle to find somewhere suitable to feed their infant in public.\r\n\r\nIt would also encourage mothers of all ages and backgrounds to breast feed, as it is EVIDENT that there is an increasing decline in women choosing to nurse their babies in Britain. This is such a shame as it is such a natural thing and has so many benefits compared to using formula milk.",
