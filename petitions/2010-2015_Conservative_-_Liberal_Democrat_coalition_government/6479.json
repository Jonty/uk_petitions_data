        "additional_details": "This is a petition to ask the government to revise the hours of drinking. 24 hour and late night drinking is not benefiting the government, the country, its people or the economy. Pubs are closing down everywhere, peoples health is in decline and it is costing the police and the NHS millions. Drinking times should be revised to 11am to 12am aka midnight. This would all but eliminate pictures of young people lying in the streets and getting their stomachs pumped in A&E at 4 in the morning.",
