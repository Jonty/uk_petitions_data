        "additional_details": "We have proven the school is viable to keep open although the County Council still want to pursue with this. It is a 'good' school with 'outstanding' features and is a sporting hub for the community. Children are to be dispersed into two other schools that are already over subscribed. The Deanes students find the inclusive and personal ethos very important in a smaller size school and would no doubt find the transition very difficult. I bring about this e-petition to raise awareness of this unfair and unthoughtful decision and for the Government to look at the evidence we have, support from neighbouring councils and a scrutiny group report, that are being ignored.",
