        "additional_details": "Thousands of monkeys and apes die everyday from the trade known as bush meat. This horrible trade is spreading rapidly, as it is one of the only source of income for most people who live near monkey habitats. Sometimes the hunters will get 'two for the price of one' if it is a female with a baby, these animals don't have much meat and can demand far greater money on the black market. Such infants are pulled away from thier mother's body, put in a basket and taken to a local village until an animal dealer is found. Many of the current monkey pets in Britain are products of this horrific trade. I demand that the  goverment takes immediate action to stop this or at least introduce new laws protecting primates.",
