        "additional_details": "Currently the human biology curriculum in secondary education includes the main bodily functions of digestion, excretion, reproduction and growth and repair.  I would like the Department of Education to include the structures of the breast, how breast milk is made, and its components (both nutritional and hormonal).\r\n\r\n50% of all students have breasts and if they become pregnant, these will produce milk regardless of the choices these females make about how to feed their child.  To exclude breasts and breast milk from the curriculum is a barrier to these students learning about the realities of their own bodies.\r\n\r\nIncluding it on the curriculum will also support the drive towards encouraging breastfeeding by allowing people to learn about breastmilk BEFORE they are faced with the pressures (and politics) of parenthood.",
