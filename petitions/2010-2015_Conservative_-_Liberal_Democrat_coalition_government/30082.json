The rules change every year.  There are a plethora for forms that need to be completed to strict deadlins and hefty fines for being late.\r\n\r\nSelf employment increased to 4.41 million, being 14% of the employed population (CIPD).\r\nThe number of retired people starting a business grey in 2011, with a 19% increase in people aged over 65 going it alone (Business Zone)\r\n\r\nWe find ourselves in a world where:\r\n1. More people are out of work than ever before.\r\n2.  Lack of salary increases plus high inflation requires second incomes.\r\n3.  Low interest affecting retirement incomes.",
