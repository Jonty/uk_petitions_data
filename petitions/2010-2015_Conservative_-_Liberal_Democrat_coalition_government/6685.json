Front line staff provide a necessary and essential service as the hospitals could not function on a daily basis without there support. The parking prices are extortionately high as many of these car parks are now owned and operated by private companies, and many nurses, carers and other front line staff are suffering.\r\n\r\nTherefore we ask for free parking",
