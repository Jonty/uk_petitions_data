It would also be useful if the email confirmation of signed petitions actually worked instead of telling you \"Whoops! It looks like you tried to access a page that is no longer available, sorry about that. Please click on the button below to go to the home page\" or \"Sorry if you're experiencing problems accessing e-petitions. There is currently a much higher level of demand than we expected.\r\n\r\nYou could try refreshing your browser (press F5) to complete what you were trying to do\r\n\r\nWe are very sorry, but we were unable to complete your last action.\r\n\r\nWe have been notified about the problem and will resolve it as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nPlease click on the button below to return to the home page\".\r\n\r\nAnd this is from HM Govt IT.\r\n\r\nWas it ever meant to work properly?",
