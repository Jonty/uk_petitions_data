        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call on the Government to stop local authorities killing dogs who have no home and to scrap the statutory local authority kennelling period, currently set to 7 days.\r\n\r\nLast year an estimated 8,903 homeless dogs were killed by local authorities (Dogs Trust Stray Dog Survey 2012).\r\n\r\nTo allow the continued breeding of dogs whilst there are not enough homes for all is completely irresposible and to allow the death of 'surplus' dogs is morally reprehensible.\r\n\r\nWe urge the Government to set initiatives in place to end this killing. Neutering and spaying as well as microchipping dogs and providing funding for currently homeless dogs in local authority care is the only way forward. We urge you to make this change.",
