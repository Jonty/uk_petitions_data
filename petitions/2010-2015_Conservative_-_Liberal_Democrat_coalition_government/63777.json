        "additional_details": "There are many problems in the car insurance market. Britain pays far above the odds for car insurance for example a quote for a 23 year old driver of a \u00a3200 car in the UK is ca \u00a33600 (compare the market), it is almost impossible for a non EU drivers licence holder to get insurance (\u00a36200 as a second driver) and the market is unfair. Why does it cost over 18 times as much to insure a car per annum than to buy it?\r\n\r\nWe propose that either:\r\n-insurance is capped at no more than 80 % of the value of the vehicle insured.\r\n-vehicle only insurance is brought into the UK (as is common almost everywhere else) where a cheap car is cheap to insure and the age of the driver cannot be considered.\r\n-or that insurance is no longer mandatory allowing free market forces to take over.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis problem should not be ignored for it is a significant one and stifles our nation and our citizens.
