UK Citizens should only pay tax based on current laws, not worry about HMRC changing laws in the future and issuing tax demands for the past. Stop HMRC from changing the tax laws retrospectively.\r\n\r\nSection 58 of the UK Finance Act allowed HMRC to introduce back dated taxes based on existing laws that were changed and applied in the past. This makes previously law abiding citizens tax evaders and has been widely criticised by accountants, the law society, civil liberties groups and other interested parties. This behaviour is illegal in many countries including Russia and Iran. ",
