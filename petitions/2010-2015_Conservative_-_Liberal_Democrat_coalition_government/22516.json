        "additional_details": "I think it is about time that somebody stepped in to control the amount of charity advertising on television. The money spent on advertising for some of the major charities such as Cancer Research is more (according to their annual report) than the amount they receive in donations. At a time when disposable income is low for most, why should we be continuously brow beaten in to donating money. At best these adverts are emotional blackmail and should be banned. I call on the whole charities structure regarding advertising to be regulated and put an end to the continuous never ending cycle of charities spending more money than they collect",
