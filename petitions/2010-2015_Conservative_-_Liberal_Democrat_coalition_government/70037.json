        "additional_details": "The organisation Fertility Fairness recently conducted a survey that found widespread variation in the availability and provision of IVF across the country. Over 80% of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) do not provide the nationally recommended number of 3 IVF cycles. At least 45% do not use the nationally recommended definition of a cycle of IVF, instead using local definitions to cut costs. Additionally a variety of restrictive access criteria are also used that appear to have no clinical justification.\r\n\r\nWe would like to request that the Department of Health:\r\n\r\n1.\tDiscusses with NHS England how to ensure full implementation of the NICE Guideline for 3 cycles of IVF.\r\n2.\tDiscusses with NHS England and NICE how to ensure CCGs standardise the definition of a full cycle of IVF.\r\n3.\tDiscusses with NHS England the enforcement of standardised eligibility criteria, in line with the policy in the devolved nations.\r\n",
