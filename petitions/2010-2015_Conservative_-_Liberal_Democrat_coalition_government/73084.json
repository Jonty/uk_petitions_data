        "additional_details": "\r\nThis petition is for a Mosque to be built in the Roehampton and Putney Heath Area. Currently there are no mosques in the immediate vicinity for the 11.10% of Muslims who reside in the area. A mosque will provide a community hub for the local area. A place for both Muslims and non-Muslims to meet and integrate. Roehampton and Putney Heath Area is undergoing a major regeneration project that is due to start in 2017. We would like the Government and LA to include a mosque within its regeneration plan; ensuring its plans to reflect the needs of the local people.",
