This in turn gives the chance for the F.A and football clubs to increase prices because there is a high demand for them.\r\n\r\nHowever, the recent inexplicable climb in ticket prices is a complete exploitation of the consumers. Football fans should not have to pay a sizeable amount of the salary to see their beloved team play every week.",
