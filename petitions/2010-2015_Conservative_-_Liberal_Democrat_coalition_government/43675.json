        "additional_details": "Millions of British workers, reportedly 1 in 4, suffer from workplace bullying, an epidemic form of abuse which is directly linked to severe anxiety, depression, and debilitating physical harm and sometimes suicide. The vast majority of these targets are unprotected and have no legal recourse. For many, the only hope is to quit and face chronic unemployment.\r\n\r\nWe respectfully demand that you set up Task Force of union, business, and lay experts to recommend legislative and/or regulatory solutions to address this problem. British people at least deserve the same level of civil and health/safety protection as workers in other industrialized countries, many of which acted more than decade ago to address workplace bullying.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for helping millions of British employees and their families who currently suffer with little or no recourse -- as a result of abusive workplace environments.\r\n\r\n",
