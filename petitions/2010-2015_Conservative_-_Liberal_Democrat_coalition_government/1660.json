Most people who pay using a meter key are poorer and rent the property they live in so they should not have to pay more for their energy as they are not in the best position to afford it. The Goverment should set the pre-payment rate so that it is equal to, or cheaper than, the non-pre payment rate and legislate so that energy companies are bound by this ruling.",
