        "additional_details": "The publication of the Chilcot enquiry into why Britain went to war in Iraq, is being deliberatly delayed due the risk it's contents pose to individuals and political parties.\r\n\r\nIt is unacceptable to delay publication until after the general election, as the contents will have a direct impact on voter choice.\r\n\r\nThis petition demands that the full unredacted enquiry is  published at least one month prior to the general election.  It is untenable to run an election without publication.",
