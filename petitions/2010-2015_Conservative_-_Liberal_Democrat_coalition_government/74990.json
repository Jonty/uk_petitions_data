        "additional_details": "Isnt it annoying how everyone seems to think its ok to park in child and parent spaces!! Even if they dont have children or a child that is 10yrs +. So its my aim and i need all your help and support to make it a government law like the disabled badge system to get a permit type system going where when a child is born you have to apply for a permit which enables you to park in child/parent spaces up and until the child is 5 and if you are found without one then you get fined just like if any one parks in a disabled space. So please please help me kick this once and for all. Thank you ",
