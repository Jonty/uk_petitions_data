        "additional_details": "Staffordshire Bull Terrier's (SBT's) have the highest tendency of any legal dog breed to be involved in a severe mauling. Many jurisdictions around the world that regulate Pit Bulls also regulate the SBT- but not the UK.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the SBT was selectively bred to stalk and take down bulls. They were bred to attack without provocation or warning and have a unique \u201chold and shake\u201d bite style that can leave victims with permanent and disfiguring injuries. Even in the hands of responsible owners, SBT type dogs have been responsible for savage attacks.\r\n\r\nChildren, small dogs and guide dogs are particularly at risk. By signing this petition, I call upon the government to add SBT's to the list of regulated breeds in the UK. Doing so will mean that owners of this breed need to apply for a court exemption to keep these dogs and that they have to be kept on a lead & muzzledin public as well as be insured, neutered and registered.\r\n",
