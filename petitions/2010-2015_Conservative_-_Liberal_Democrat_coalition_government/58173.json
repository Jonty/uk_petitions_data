        "additional_details": "Currently there is an epidemic of companies storing user's passwords incorrectly (plain text/encrypted), which is putting UK citizens information at risk. This is not confined to small organisations but large multi-nationals like Adobe, Sony & Stratfor. Recently the UK bank Santander has also been identified as storing user's passwords in plain text (http://satal.me/1fhrtnX).\r\n\r\nThe widespread news about the user data loss and any punishments imposed have not lead to the adoption of appropriate password management policies by many organisations. Therefore we are petitioning for stronger action to be taken against organisations with UK subsidiaries that are found to have substandard password management policies and for the ability for organisations to be reported to the UK Government when they are in breach.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this will help to bring it to the attention of other organisations who will look at their password management policies to ensure they are up to standard.",
