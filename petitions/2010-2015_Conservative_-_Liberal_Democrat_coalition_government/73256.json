        "additional_details": "Leon Wong has TEN previous convictions, varying from common assault, Heroin possession and perverting the court of justice, combined with the fact he tried to flee the scene at 'Parklife' festival once he'd RAN and kicked an innocent man in the head as if it was a penalty kick.\r\n\r\nThe judge gave him 18 months, which will be reduced to just around 9 with 'good behaviour'.\r\n\r\nI'm asking, does someone so violent deserve the right to walk our streets with such a violent history, and after committing such an act as this, that could have killed Jordan Holmes?\r\n\r\nEven the full sentence of 18 months is a disgrace, as the victims will forever remember what happened that day.\r\n\r\nWe sign here, to enforce the department of justice to re think the sentence for something more severe, or risk him hurting other people.\r\n\r\nHe's shown no intent on rehabilitation and deserves to be punished correctly.",
