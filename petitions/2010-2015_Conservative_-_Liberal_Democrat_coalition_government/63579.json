        "additional_details": "Maria Miller MP has been found to have defrauded the Taxpayer by her Expenses claims. She has confessed to the fraud by her 'apology' so the trial should be short. I believe that she should be sent to prison for at least the same time as as a Benefit Fraudster would be. No easy ride for her just because she's an MP, in fact she should be treated harshly for abusing her position of trust. This might just start the re-emergence of a certain amount of trust in our political system, although it has a long way to go yet.",
