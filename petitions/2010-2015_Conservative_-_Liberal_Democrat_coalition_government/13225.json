        "additional_details": "I feel it aborant that tax payers should pay for people on benefits , who have large families , get housed in Large costly houses. A more recent example being a Samalian family , moving to a house in Kensington worth \u00a32m at a cost of \u00a3900 a week because they didnt like the area they were in . How many working , taxpayers would love to move into bigger better hoses in better areas, near better schools , but cant because they dont earn enough. It's just wrong on every level and needs to be adressed if the Government are serious about cutting its benefits defecit.",
