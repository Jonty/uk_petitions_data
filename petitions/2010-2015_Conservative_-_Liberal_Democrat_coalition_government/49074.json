The following article (LINK: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2310797/Samantha-Brick-Joan-Collins-right-Any-woman-wants-stay-beautiful-needs-diet-day.html) contains extremely damaging content which promotes anorexic behaviour and other attitudes linked with eating disorders. 40% of people with an eating disorder relapse; 10% of people with an eating disorder die.
