        "additional_details": "We owe this gift of life to our parents who sacrifice a lot to raise us. It is only proper that in their old age - we return their love and care and be there for them when they need us most.Home office has made it almost impossible for dependant parents (who are not EU citizens) to live in Britan with their children who are British Citizens.\r\n\r\nHence we appeal to the UK Home office to make its policies for sponsoring such parents less restrictive. In order to avoid misuse of the system - UK  can introduce safeguards such as a)No access to public funds for parents b) Sponsoring British Citizen to be fully responsible for financially supporting parents (In Australia sponsoring children provide a $5000 bond c) Compulsary private medical insurance for 3-5 years so that there is no reliance on NHS for expensive treatment d) User charges to access NHS for non-emergency treatment.\r\n\r\nSupport right of family of British Citizens/ Taxpayers espeically if it does not burden the exchequer.
