The Sun and it's then editor, Kelvin Mackenzie stood by what they said causing years of hurt for the families of those who died and tarnishing the survivors with a reputation that can never be undone. The only way that any of this can start to be repaired is by The Sun not printing any papers in the future. Please sign to help shut down The Sun!",

That is why the government does not interfere in what a newspaper or magazine chooses to publish. However, with this freedom comes great responsibility.\r\n\r\nNewspapers must, of course, abide by the law, but they also sign up to a Code of Practice, overseen by the independent Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The Editor's Code of Practice sets a benchmark for the standards the press is expected to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you would like any more information on the PCC and the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice, it can be found on the PCC\u2019s website at: http://www.pcc.org.uk."
