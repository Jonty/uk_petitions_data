        "additional_details": "At the moment, smear tests are only available to women between the ages of 25-64 years. Over the last few years there has been an increasing amount of younger girls having cervical cancer and even more alarmingly the number of deaths due to the cancer has risen. Cervical cancer is symptom less, and is a deadly killer. There are plenty other services on the NHS which could be reduced or dropped to make way for smear tests to save the younger generations future.",
