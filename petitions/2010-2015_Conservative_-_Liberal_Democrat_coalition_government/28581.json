Beaches in public places have become an haven for those who like to harrass, alarm and distress innocent members of the public, whether clothed or not.\r\nChildren must be protected. We need to make public nudity come under Indecent Exposure, despite the act not to offend or alarm and distress the public. Persons can commit 'Outraging Public Decency' in these places and the safest bet is to actually close beaches and places where social nudity is accepted. ",
