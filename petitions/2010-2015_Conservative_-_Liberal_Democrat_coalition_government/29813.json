        "additional_details": "Although the current criteria for being awarded the Queens Diamond Jubilee medal would seem to indicate Police Staff (Civilians) working in Police Control Rooms who deal on a daily basis with emergency calls (999) and Command & Control should be eligible for the medal we are not. The Government does not appear to believe that our jobs are worthy of this recognition. No, we are not out on the street facing danger on a daily basis, but we deal with stressful and distressing situations every day as part of our jobs. We often sacrifice our family and personal lives to provide this service working long and unsociable hours. We provide a first response to spontaneous crime and disorder incidents, riots, terror incidents and every day emergencies. Please support this petition to force a change so that our contribution to the safety of the public is recognised.",
