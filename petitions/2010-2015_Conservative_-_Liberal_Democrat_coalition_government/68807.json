        "additional_details": "I as a British citizen am concerned with the growing support that this Islamic radical organisation ISIS is gaining, I feel that the Government office should take an extremely hard line, it must make it il eagle to support or join this organisation.  Any one doing this is obviously willing to destroy our beliefs and way of life, they are also willing to bring the jihad to this country, to me this is Treason, punishable by death, but we don't do that so deportation to the country the are fighting in, or exciled to an Islamic country is our only option. So to avoid bloodshed in our land the Government MUST take this stance, there is growing unrest in the White Asian Christian community, please approve this petition, so that we may have voice.",
