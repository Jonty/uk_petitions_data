        "additional_details": "This petition calls upon the UK government to introduce legislation to compel car manufacturers to provide a spare wheel and tyre, with appropriate storage, in all new cars sold in the UK.  Ideally, provision should be made for a full size spare with the same speed rating as the standard wheel and tyre, though the option of a space saver wheel and tyre may be permitted as an interim measure.",
