Politicians have today proven that BBC managers and Trustees have run rings round them and they simply CANNOT be relied upon to understand WHY the BBC should no longer be funded by the taxpayer.  Taxpayers are seen as a cash cow for individuals who are far, far cleverer than our electeds are and therefore our politicians should NOT continue to impose the BBC Licence Tax upon taxpayers.  The BBC should NOT be taxpayer funded.",
