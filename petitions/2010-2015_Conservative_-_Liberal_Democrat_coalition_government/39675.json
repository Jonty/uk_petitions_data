The Secretary of State for Justice who is responsible for improvements to the justice system so that it better serves the public needs to re look at this as an option. The Secretary of State is the Government Minister responsible to Parliament for the judiciary, the court system and prisons and probation. Our prisons are over crowded and most people despise their hard earned tax being used to protect and keep murderer's alive, which is a privilege that their victims no longer have! Let's debate this option once again and put it to the vote!",
