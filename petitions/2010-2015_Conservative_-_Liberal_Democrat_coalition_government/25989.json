        "additional_details": "The job seekers allowance paid to people looking for work, should at a small rate have to be paid back to the governement once you have a job.  This could be done at a minimum rate, or a higher rate set by the person paying it back.\r\n\r\nRename job seekers allowance to government work loan.\r\n\r\nIm sure this will completely change the way that job seeking is viewed, it will reduce the strain on the government and allow people to pay back what they have borrowed and feel proud about it.\r\n\r\nIf u have proven that you can pay your loan back, next time your out of work maybe u can claim a higher tier for the first month? im sure there are many ideas linked to this concept, its exciting to think that something so simple and fair could become reality.",
