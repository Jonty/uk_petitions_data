        "additional_details": "Those active on the Twitter politics scene may be familiar with an individual named Greg Cook, a far-right UKIP member. It recently came to light that Greg was not in fact a career comedian like he had claimed to be, but is shockingly a Police Constable in the Lancashire Constabulary. Greg has been utilising social media to promote UKIP's politics of fear and hate for many years and does so in a vitriolic and bullish manner which can be perceived as intimidating. Evidence we've gathered suggests he has broken hate speech laws on at least six occasions. Taking all this into consideration and the day-to-day interaction with a diverse community and the Police forces equality and diversity code, we believe this make his position untenable. Say no to racism - sign and share the petition.",
