        "additional_details": "This petition is in response to the Panorama programme regarding our NHS shown at 9pm on BBC1 on Wednesday 3rd October 2012.\r\n\r\nWe, the tax payers and legal residents of Britain are appalled by the findings of the above programme.\r\n\r\nWe are already being denied crucial drugs and non life threatening operations regardless of how much pain, stress and misery the symptoms may cause.  For example, joint replacements, cataracts etc. and now the government wants to make even further reductions to our NHS funding.\r\n\r\nWhy should we the tax payers and legal residents of Britain pay for treatment, drugs and surgery for tourists, visitors etc. when they are being denied to us?\r\n\r\nSo we say \u2018NO\u2019 to any cuts and reforms to our NHS, at least until the problems highlighted in the above programme have been rectified, and only people who are entitled to NHS services receive these services free of charge.\r\n",
