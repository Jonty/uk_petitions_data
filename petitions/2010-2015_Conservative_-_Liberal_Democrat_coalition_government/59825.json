        "additional_details": "The e-petition aims at correcting one error. Upon arriving in India British Ruler representatives of our British Empire decided against any valid grounds that Tantra was a pagan religion reminiscent of primitive religion and decided to Out law the practices. Further into it the Rulers decided the Images represented immoral sex.  Labelled as  tantric sex the term continues to misrepresent tantra and the Images. Is time we apologise and allow public debate about the Truth to Our Images our Methodology of life it's significance  then which is still that of today. ",
