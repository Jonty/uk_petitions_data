This would involve setting up schemes and local community projects that the unemployed should work on.  The schemes could also provide training to those attending to ensure that people have the skills to transfer into work when they are successful.\r\n\r\nNo one should be able to take from society without putting back into society. No longer should anyone be able to stay at home all day every day, unless ill or incapacitated. Everyone should be doing some work or education otherwise society should have the right to withdraw benefits.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure more people would feel it fairer if they knew that their taxes were going to pay for people that would work in their local community running projects or services that benefited the wider community.\r\n",
