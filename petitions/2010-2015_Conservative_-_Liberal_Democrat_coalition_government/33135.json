This is the most draconian act the State can take against an individual. All efforts must be made to ensure the State gets these decisions right.\r\n\r\nWe ask the Government to act to implement the following measures:\r\n\r\n1. All child protection decisions to be made on evidence based fact.\r\n\r\n2. Parents to be informed of the case against them and the evidence relied upon.\r\n\r\n3. No family to be assessed by experts who have not met them.\r\n\r\nThese measures will reduce the number of children wrongly removed from their families, freeing up Local Authority resources for the most vulnerable ",
