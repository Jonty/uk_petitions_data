        "additional_details": "Currently, around 12.2 billion plastic bags are given free to the UK public each year. These plastic bags take up to 1000 years to decompose. It is currently estimated that  there are 46,000 pieces of plastic in  each square mile of ocean. This has contributed to the 1 million sea birds and 100,000 sea animals being killed every year by waste in the sea. Also plastic bags have currently used 0.2% of the worlds oil.\r\n\r\nWe want to raise awareness of the damage caused by plastic bags to the environment and to us in the future.",
