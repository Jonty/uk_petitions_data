        "additional_details": "Women perform 66% of the world's work and produce 50% of the world's food yet they earn only 10% of its overall income and own a shocking 1% of property. Even in Britain, at the current rate of progress it would take two centuries to achieve 50% female seats in Parliament. Violence against women globally causes more death and disability in women aged 15-44 than war, cancer, traffic accidents and malaria combined.\r\n\r\nThe institution of a national bank holiday in the UK - following the good example of Russia - will show the world that the UK is actively committed to gender equality and women's rights. A national bank holiday is a form of celebration with no gender divide.",
