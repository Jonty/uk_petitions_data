        "additional_details": "HM Government should use its powers of persuasion to get England national football team manager Roy Hodgson to call up Micah Richards to the Euro 2012 squad.\r\n\r\nMicah Richards is a remarkably good football player - a Premier League winning defender no less - and would deserve his place in the squad ahead of others selected.\r\n\r\nThe petition acknowledges that Roy Hodgson and not a Government Minister picks the squad, as is right, but contends that given the gravity of his mistakenness in this matter, a word in the ear would not go amiss.",
