        "additional_details": "It is absolutely disgraceful that unscrupulous landlords are able to charge an exit fee on retirement homes - some as much as 10% or more of the sale price of the retirement home.   My poor father in law has ended up paying 28KGBP to a landlord upon selling his late mothers retirement home. My father in law thought his mother was legally bound by the unreasonable terms of her lease and has paid the landlord the exit fees without any challenge. Such landlords are cheating the elderly and unless we do something about it, there will be more and more unscrupulous landlords out there taking full advantage of the elderly. ",
