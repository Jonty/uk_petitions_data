So, treatments tested and shown to be effective in the PACE trial do not address the infection that may have started CFS, but do help patients address particular barriers to their recovery, which are often nothing to do with an original infection.\" If there is the slightest thought that CFS/ME  has any infectious root please would you find the appropriate statistics to see if it is epidemic and undertake urgent research to find out if it IS of infectious origin and if so treat it.",
