        "action": "Compulsory use of Fresnel Lenses on Heavy Goods Vehicles",
        "additional_details": "Every year, hundreds of accidents occur on our roads and in particular our motorways caused by blind spots on lorries. Many of these result in injury and sadly, some in death.\r\n\r\nIn the same way that the introduction of the compulsory use of seat belts significantly reduced the incidence of death and serious injury on our roads, the introduction of compulsory use of Fresnel Lenses to lorries would eliminate drivers' blind spots thereby further reducing needless injuries and deaths.\r\n\r\nLeft hand driver lorries are significantly more likely to be involved in such incidents on our motorways.\r\n\r\nFresnel Lenses would also eliminate blind spots in relation to cyclists.\r\n\r\nI therefore call on the government to implement legislation for the retrospective fitting of Fresnel Lenses to all existing UK based lorries and make it a requirement for foreign lorries to comply as a condition of use within the UK. Manufacturers should be required to ensure they are fitted to new lorries.\r\n\r\n",
