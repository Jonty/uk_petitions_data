Fully funded giving the children caring homes and foster carers an income and a respected job.\r\nI would ask the government to please debate 'Room to Care' - to assist the elderly in need to be cared for in relatives homes / other private homes in their communities.  Could funding (as is appropriate) be provided for care in an ongoing home environment and the carers (to be registered/assessed) an income for a worthwhile job. The carers allowance as it is does not encourage care for the elderly. I would like to ask if the government will lead in raising the standard of 'Caring for the elderly' as a career choice and make it a respected role as is fostering children?",
