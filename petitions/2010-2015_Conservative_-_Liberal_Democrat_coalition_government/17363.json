        "additional_details": "We assert that the growing number of Special political advisor's who are chosen to undertake a cabinet position, e.g. Minister, Secretary, Under secretary,  Prime Minister , etc has grown at an unacceptable rate. We are concerned that potential cabinet members should be able to display at least 10 years work experience which should not include work as a political / special advisor of any kind not directly employed by the Civil Service. We would seek the introduction of legislation to implement the 10 year prior work experience rule together with a minimum age of 40 for such positions and a minimum educational requirement of equivalent of 5 O Levels 2 Higher Level including English and Maths.",
