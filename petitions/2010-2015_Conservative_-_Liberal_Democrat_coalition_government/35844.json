        "action": "Ban private cars from UK roads",
        "additional_details": "The roads are filling up. Private car use has caused over 30 thousand deaths and 3 million injuries over the past decade, polluted our cities and is a major contributing factor to lack of exercise and the obesity epidemic.\r\n\r\nWe propose to ban the use of private cars on UK roads. Public transport, taxis, commercial vehicles and Blue Badge holders will be exempt. Legal modes of transit  will include public transport, travel on foot, by horse, taxi or cycling, This will immediately solve the congestion problem on major roads, massively reduce the expense incurred in maintaining roads and highways and transform our cities into cleaner, healthier spaces and encourage citizens to become more active.",
