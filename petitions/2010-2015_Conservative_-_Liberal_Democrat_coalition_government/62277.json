        "action": "Formation of independent body to investigate complaints against miscarriages of justice in civil court proceedings",
        "additional_details": "There is sufficient evidence from a number of cases stemming from decisions of Circuit and High Court Judges sitting as appeal judges, that judges are using CPR 52.3(4A) to argue applications for permission to appeal are totally without merit. Litigants and thus Litigants in-person are thereafter unable to appeal such decisions. Evidence shows judges of appeal are making errors in law, dismissing applications for permission to appeal even where there are grounds for appeal. This petition seeks investigation into the use CPR 52.3(4A) and calls for the formation of an independent body to look into decisions of judges of appeal which use CPR 52.3(4A) to bring to an end valid claims.",
