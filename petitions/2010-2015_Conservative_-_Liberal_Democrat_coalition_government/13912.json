        "additional_details": "We feel that having to pay for two separate licences to play a radio in our salons is extremely unfair. Our reasons:\r\n1. The radio station already pays a licence to play the recordings.\r\n2. Clients come to our salons for treatments, not for the \"entertainment\" of listening to the radio in the background.\r\n3. As a recording artist, one would assume that airplay and exposure is everything. Surely they want their music played and heard by as many people as possible in order that they might then buy the cd.\r\n4. It is impossible to enforce fairly...taxi cabs, etc, play their radios and passengers can hear but no licence fee is demanded. Drivers, workmen, etc play radio in their vehicles which is effectively playing music in the workplace but again, no licence required.\r\n\r\nWe believe the licence for playing commercial radio stations should be abolished as is unfairly penalises small businesses in particular.",
