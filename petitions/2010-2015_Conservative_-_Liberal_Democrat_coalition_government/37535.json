        "additional_details": "We would like to introduce a unit on Mental Health into the PSHE curriculum (or similar subject) within secondary schools across the UK. The unit should educate the young people on what mental health is, what mental illness is, how it can be helped/prevented and what help and support is availible to the young people.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no focus on the issue of Mental Health within schools, because of this there is a lot of stereotyping towards people with Mental illnesses, stereotyping which is not always true. We feel that if young people were to be educated on this subject within schools, not only will they be more understanding of people who may have mental illnesses but they will also be more open to seek help if they feel that they have a mental illnesses.
