        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the UK government to support the growing public interest in intelligent extraterrestrial lifeforms by presenting this petition to The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CSETI), founded in 1990 by Dr. Steven M. Greer, as a sign of International solidarity to our brothers and sisters abroad and 'elsewhere' in this New Age of so-called Advancement.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the UK would greatly benefit by having a similar organisation committed to the thoughtful long-term development of bilateral ET-Human relations based on Dr Greer's vision.\r\n\r\nDr. Greer is the director of CSETI (The Center for the Study of Extraterrestrial Intelligence). He is also the father of the world-wide disclosure movement, which has recently led to governments around the world releasing hundreds of thousands of previously-classified documents on UFO and ET-related matters, emphasizing the reality and importance of this issue.",
