        "additional_details": "Faith schools segregate children based on the religion imposed on them by their parents. Not only is a young child incapable of making an informed decision about which faith they wish to follow (you would never label a child based on their political beliefs), but isolating children from those of other faiths encourages ignorance and intolerance. Multiculturalism can only work if people from different backgrounds are encouraged to integrate.",
