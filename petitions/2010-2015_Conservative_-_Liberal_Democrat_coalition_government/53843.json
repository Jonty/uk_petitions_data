        "additional_details": "The vast majority of people living on benefits already struggle to feed their families and heat their homes, with no disposable income to pay for additional costs. But there is support available while they are looking for work. While it is standard practice to inform jobseekers of what is expected from them, informing them of all available financial assistance is not.\r\n\r\nSupport for out of pocket expenses includes but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n- Help with fares to job interviews\r\n- Help with health costs (free prescriptions, free NHS dental treatment, vouchers for glasses, fares to hospital)\r\n- Free school meals for children\r\n\r\nIf jobseekers are not made aware of these positive and vital payments, they are ultimately pointless.\r\n\r\nSteps include:\r\n\r\n- Re-training staff\r\n- Amending employee guidelines\r\n- Making this information easily accessible to the public\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call on the Government to ensure every jobseeker is informed about all available support.",
