All signatories were offered Euro 50 million but [Italian Prime Minister] Berlusconi was insulted by the low amount that could buy an Italian PM so the payment went up to Euro 75m. Blair then paid nearly half of his share into his wife Cherie\u2019s offshore account at H. Ansbacher in the British Virgin Islands.\u201d Outgoing Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King also has an account (in his mother\u2019s name) in the British Virgin Islands with H. Ansbacher, MI5 says.\r\nHMMM, What do you think?",
