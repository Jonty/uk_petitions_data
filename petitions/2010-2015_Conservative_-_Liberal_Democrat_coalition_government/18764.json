        "action": "Campaign to have all babies screened for hip dysplasia at birth",
        "additional_details": "Some NHS trusts offer screening for hip dysplasia as routine at birth, however many do not.  Hip dysplasia is as common as 1 in 100 and if found at birth the pavlik harness can be worn for a short period and surgery can be avoided.  Sadly if hip dysplasia (CHD DDH) is picked up later in life, after six months, there is nothing that can correct this deformity other than major surgery. This petition is designed to campaign to have all newborns screened at birth as routine and avoid the heartache of deformity and surgery in later life.",
