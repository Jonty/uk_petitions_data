Explicit compulsory teaching of the subject 'Violence', in schools, explaining the nature of violent acts, such as rape, would enable countless millions to cope better with their own risks and responsibilities as potential victims and perpetrators and thereby lead happier, healthier lives.\r\nThe syllabus could be drawn up after wide public consultation, helpful in itself, with guidance from experts such as neuro-scientists, psychologists and clinicians.\r\nViolence has always been a part of human experience; its impact warrants the fullest and widest understanding.
