        "additional_details": "It has come to my attention that there is a loophole in the disability and carers allowance paid which makes it possible to claim both disability benefit AND carers allowance. While I accept that some people are disabled and others do genuinely care for disabled people, I can't accept that as it stands, someone can claim to be disabled and that they can't walk far or get dressed by themselves and they get a mobility car along with disability benefits. That same person can then claim to be looking after someone, helping them to wash, get dressed etc and for that they would get carers allowance. This to me isn't right. If you get money for not being able to look after yourself, why the hell are getting money for looking after someone else.\r\nThis was bought to my attention by my local benefits fraud office and I think it's a loophole that costs this country and it's tax payers millions.\r\nPlease sign this and share if you would like to see this reassesed.",
