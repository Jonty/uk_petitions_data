        "additional_details": "Children need a good start in life, they will be happier and healthier if they're not hungry.\r\n\r\nA report by The Child Poverty Action Group states, 'the current system of entitlement to free school meals, whereby children are only eligible for free meals if both parents are out of work, means that many children living in families who are working but on low wages are missing out. The Children Society estimates that across England, a third of families living in poverty are not eligible to receive free school meals.\r\n\r\nThis is what some children say who get free school meals,\r\n'people say things because we get them,'\r\n'it makes me feel sad, lonely and depressed,'\r\n'it makes you feel different, and like you are poor.'\r\n\r\nI think this highlights the fact that some children have more than others; which can effect all areas of their life. If all primary school children had the right to a free school meal, it would create equality among them.",
