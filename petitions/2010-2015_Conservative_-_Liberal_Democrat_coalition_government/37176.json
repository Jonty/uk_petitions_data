That is why the government does not interfere in what a newspaper or magazine chooses to publish.\r\n\r\nNewspapers must, of course, abide by the law, but they also sign up to a Code of Practice, overseen by the independent Press Complaints Commission (PCC). The Editor's Code of Practice sets a benchmark for the standards the press is expected to maintain.\r\n\r\nIf you would like any more information on the PCC and the Editors\u2019 Code of Practice, it can be found on the PCC\u2019s website at: http://www.pcc.org.uk.\r\n\r\nDetailed decisions on television programme content and scheduling are matters for the broadcasters. It is a long-standing principle that the Government does not interfere in programme matters, either on arrangements for scheduling or on content. It is important to maintain the principle of freedom of expression which political interference could undermine."
