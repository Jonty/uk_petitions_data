I believe if you want to breed from your animals and make money, you should have to apply for a license, and pay taxes as you would any other income. Because every other pet is spayed and neutered Germany don\u2019t have the kind of stray animal problem other countries have and their taxes are not spent on euthanizing helpless animals. They have things so under control that they are able to adopt rescue animals from other countries.",
