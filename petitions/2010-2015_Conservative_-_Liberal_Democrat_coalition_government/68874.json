        "additional_details": "A guarantor is an individual, often a close relative, who undertakes to assume the financial liabilities of a tenant, including paying the rent in the event that they fail to do so. The solution I am proposing would be a guarantor system for individuals making a claim. Not only does this mean payments can be given straight away by the benefits department but that back payments can also be guaranteed in the event of either a failure to meet the benefit requirements, or an overpayment that needs to be repaid.\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1nfKbReEfN1N3EyNVpnd2I1ZWc/edit?usp=sharing",
