        "additional_details": "The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) are proposing to remove statutory supervision of Midwives, claiming that it is an unnecessary level of Midwifery regulation. They also call into question the fundemental purpose of supervision - the protection of women and babies - because supervisors conduct investigations into the practice of their peers and therefore cannot be objective.\r\nSupervision is an important and vital service. It provides a level of support for Midwives, encourages best practice, identifies deficits in practice and keeps mothers and babies safe. To remove it would be detrimental to our profession and the women in our care. We must not allow the nurse dominated NMC to exercise this level of control over our profession. Please support this petition to keep Midwifery supervision and support the regulation of the Midwifery profession by Midwives and NOT nurses. ",
