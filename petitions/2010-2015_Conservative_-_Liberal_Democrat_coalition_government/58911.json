        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister David Cameron has \u2018sympathy\u2019 with calls to scrap a law banning farmers from using more than two dogs to flush out foxes, Downing Street said. It would mark a first step towards the coalition fulfilling its pledge to stage a free vote on repealing the controversial law altogether and follows reports of a surge in fox attacks on sheep flocks.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether foxes need to be controlled or not, there\u2019s no doubt that sending great packs of dogs and horses after a terrier-sized animal is hardly an effective, humane or non-destructive way to reduce numbers.\r\n\r\nBritain does not need this bloodthirsty hobby resurrected. With even members of the Tory party now coming out against the hunt, it\u2019s time for Cameron to take a firm stance.\r\n\r\nDemand the Conservatives not abuse their precarious position as a minority government to push through wildly unpopular changes to existing legislation or make any amendments to the existing legislation in favour of hunting foxes",
