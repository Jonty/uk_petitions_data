        "additional_details": "I would like the government to take a serious look at the way different television companies, including the BBC, keep televising Stoke City FC matches whilst they continue to play the most boring brand of football the world has ever seen. In the last 4 seasons Stoke have spent just under \u00a340,000,000 on attacking players (Reference Stoke City FC Official website) whilst, in comparison, Everton have spent just over half that (\u00a325,000,000 - Reference Everton official website) and play a more expansive, attacking, and, most importantly, watchable brand of football. So the excuse of 'having to play that way' just doesn't wash with Stoke anymore. They have the resources to change their style of play and give their fans and the rest of the UK something decent to watch of a weekend.\r\n\r\nIf they decide to play the sport they seem most naturally suited to, Rugby, then I'd be happy to watch them every weekend on all television networks.",
