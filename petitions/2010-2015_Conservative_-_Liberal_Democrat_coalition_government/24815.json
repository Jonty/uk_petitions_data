        "additional_details": "Bonfire night represents the saving of a monarch, justice, anti terrorism and the saving of what should be/is a democratic place that is the houses of parliament.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ensure bonfire night is recognised as a bank holiday, not only giving families a welcome weekend between August and Christmas, but also to celebrate what should be an important date in our calendar each year. Many pubs and councils put on spectacles and bring communities and small businesses together.\r\n\r\nThe date should fall ON 5th November. If the 5th falls on a Saturday or Sunday then it is the monday after.",
