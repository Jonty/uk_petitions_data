        "additional_details": "A cornerstone of any democratic society is a system of law that regulates the behaviour of its members. Those charged with a crime are entitled to defend themselves and legal representation but in recent years these basic rights have become subject to abuse. The chief instrument of this abuse is the Human Rights Act. Under this legislation serial killer Peter Tobin has been reportedly granted over \u00a3300,000 of legal aid and the Yorkshire Ripper continues to use taxpayers\u2019 money to launch spurious appeals.  At the lower end of the scale petty criminals are suing the police for alleged breaches of their rights. The Act needs change. It has to be amended to adopt a \u201cResponsibility Clause\u201d under which  anyone who is found guilty of a crime takes personal responsibility for the suspension of their rights under the Act. These rights would of course be reinstated on completion of sentence.  This Petition calls for the present Act to be amended to the Human Rights and Responsibilities Act.",
