It should be a sign of shame that the sixth-richest economy on the planet has people who are essentially retreating to a Dickensian world. It's shocking how quickly it's been normalised.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a all-party debate on the reasons we have had a dramatic rise in the numbers of people using food-banks over the last few years and what practical actions can the state enact to ensure that there is not a need for foodbanks for anyone in this country.",
