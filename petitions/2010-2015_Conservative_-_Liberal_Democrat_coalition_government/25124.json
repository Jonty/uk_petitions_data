        "additional_details": "Please give thyroid disease patients the options that ARE available to them for treatment!!!! Natural Thyroid Hormone is, for a vast majority of thyroid sufferers, the treatment of choice to help them get their life back to some type of normality. Once the thyroid is removed or destroyed, there is no way it can be replaced. Laboratory made thyroid hormones ARE NOT SUFFICIENT!  i.e. Levothyroxine and Liothyronine (T4 and T3). People are dying without the correct medication. Natural Thyroid Hormone is the closest thing to a real thyroid and it is not licenced in the U.K. , apparently not enough evidence to back up its benefits. It was used for over 100 YEARS before generic hormone was formulated. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE licence this medication, and make it available on an N.H.S. prescription!!!!",
