        "additional_details": "Business rates petition\r\nThe current system for calculating business rates in England is iniquitous.  The nationally set rate discriminates against enterprises based in the regions outside the South East of England as elsewhere property values have stagnated.\r\nThe delay to the scheduled revaluation of rateable values will only make things worse for hard pressed businesses in the Midlands particularly.\r\nThe delay to the revaluation may be motivated by electoral expedience but this is of no concern to a business community in the regions desperate for relief from the burden of this blunt Westminster tax.\r\nTherefore we call on the Government to freeze business rates at the 2013 level until the revaluation takes place.\r\n",
