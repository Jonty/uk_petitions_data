        "additional_details": "I urge you to take action to ensure:\r\n\r\n1. That the Children & Families (C & F) Bill is amended to ensure all existing essential protections and entitlements for children with special educational needs are maintained. Specifically the Government should address the points of concern raised in IPSEA\u2019s detailed analysis of the C & F Bill.\r\n\r\n2. That the Bill is amended to introduce a single assessment process and a single plan across\r\neducation, health and social care with equal duties to / enforceability by individuals across all\r\nthree elements. Until this is done, the system only covers education. Without this amendment,\r\nonly children or young people with special educational needs will be entitled to a new Education, Health and Care plan. Those children who are disabled but do not have special educational\r\nneeds will not be covered.\r\n\r\n3. Explain clearly why these amendments cannot be made (if they are ignored). Transparency is\r\nessential as parental confidence in the system is low.\r\n",
