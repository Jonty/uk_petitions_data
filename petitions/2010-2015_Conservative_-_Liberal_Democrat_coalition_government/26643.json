        "additional_details": "Too many young people in the United Kingdom are becoming victimised, upset, resorting to harming themselves, feeling alone and even committing suicide due to attacks on their race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability. Bullying is a hate crime and needs to be made illegal. The United Kingdom is a world leader in equality but there is much more that can be done. The youth need to know that their lives are worth sticking around for and they can help society prosper no matter their differences.",
