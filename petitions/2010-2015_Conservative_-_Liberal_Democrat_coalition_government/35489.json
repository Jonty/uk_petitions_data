        "additional_details": "On 7-7-2005, 52 people lost their lives when bombs exploded in London's public transport networks.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent report from the House of Commons is inadequate and has since been discredited due to factual inaccuracy as acknowledged by Dr John Reid MP in parliament.\r\n\r\nOther, uninvestigated concerns include:\r\n1. Peter Power admitting on live TV that he had been \"running an exercise\" which simulated bombs going off on that day at \"almost precisely\" the same time and locations as the 4 bombs that claimed the lives of 52 people,\r\n2. Numerous media reports of a major incident at Canary Wharf that day (as collated by Dr Rory Ridley-Duff),\r\n3. CCTV footage which is inconclusive, missing/unreleased and inconsistent with the government's current 7/7 narrative.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call for the UK government to consider holding a public inquiry into the events of 7-7-2005 which fully addresses these concerns. Such inquiry to be conducted outside of the terms of The Inquiries Act 2005.",
