The cost of the EU is too great to bare and it has become a power/money grab by neighbouring countries/people and therefore we wish for a Referendum on the future of our membership.\r\n\r\nOur Nationalist Party(UKIP) has seen a raise in vote therefore its only fair to debate such an issue with our country is facing massive cuts and becoming closer to bailing out other countries through our membership of the IMF.\r\n\r\nI myself a University Student whom is studying Computer Science(Year 3, Aged 21) support a referendum and have hope this petition will gain the 100,000 votes it requires.",
