        "additional_details": "The Royal Navy is the greatest navy in the world, yet we are becoming one of the smallest. Our force of Frigates and Destroyers is at an all-time low. We operate a mere thirteen Type 23 Frigates (which may be replaced with an even lower amount of Global Combat Ships) and six Type 45 Destroyers (we had more than twice that amount of Type 42s). I suggest that the government ensure that the Frigate and Destroyer force be at a minimum of 25 ships in total, as our current amount is simply too small! ",
