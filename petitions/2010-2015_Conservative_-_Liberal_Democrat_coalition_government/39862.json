Some will argue that life in prison cell is punishment enough....for the family & friends of the victim,it is not.\r\nThe bible states,an eye for an eye. If you take a life,then yours should be taken also once it is proven beyond doubt  that you are guilty. Murder rates have soared in the last few years and I believe it is because there is no real deterrent, help make our world a safer place - BRING BACK HANGING",
