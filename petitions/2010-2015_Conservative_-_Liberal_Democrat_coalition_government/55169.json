His presence would inspire people in a time where many feel disenfranchised with the government and frustrated with the recession.\r\n\r\nHe has also donated one million dollar to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. He became the first artist to support ArtWorks, an artist engagement program to raise awareness of fundamental rights at work, including freedom from politicianry and from child labor. Cage has also honored with Humanitarian award from United Nations for his works and appointed as an UN ambassador for Global Justice. ",
