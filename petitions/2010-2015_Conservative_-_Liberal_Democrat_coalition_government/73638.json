        "additional_details": "The increasingly successful attempts by terror groups to frighten those in the west are driven by our, and our partners, weak response to the threats shown by cults such as ISIS, Al Qaeda and Boko Haram.  Sending two or three fighter jets to Iraq, while avoiding Syria, is a political response not effective against these terrorists. An invitation to attack the UK and our allies. This current form of war will come to us if such weakness continues to be shown.  Our response does not show intent to combat this threat, it is an unacceptable a tick box exercise.\r\n\r\nMuslim countries should be heavily involved in dealing with this threat, but the UKs noncommittal response is only showing that we\u2019re not prepared to respond, giving them more reason to carry on.\r\n\r\nWe should put \u201cboots on the ground\u201d immediately in Iraq, Syria and Nigeria to deal with the immediate risk and in Yemen to shut the training grounds.In the long term dealing with these threats will improve the economic outlook",
