        "additional_details": "It's quite simple if you don't know already the bank of England is a privately owned company that prints money and then loans it at interest. if the government printed the money they/we wouldn't have to pay interest on that money that dosnt exist anyway its imaginary and dosnt physically exist. Ask yourself why dosnt the government print the money and why they feel its better to borrow paper issued from a private bank at interest so our unborn children are born with massive debts owed to the private banks and have to work all there lives just to pay back the interest that previous governments have borrowed.No to interest we as the people create all wealth so why do the bankers have it and not us.Its time for a new fairer system.",
