        "additional_details": "As the Act stands in Section 213 & 214 and due to the Appeal rulling of Tiensia v Vision Enterprises Limited, it can be interpreted that landlords don't have to put  a tenant's deposit into a tenancy deposit scheme unless they have proceedings issued against them, which in essence means that tenants deposits won't be protected.  The ruling was given due to bad wording on the legislation which should be corrected.",
