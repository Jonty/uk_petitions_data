        "additional_details": "Place age restrictions on the purchase of caffeinated carbonated products, including but not limited to: Red Bull, Monster and Relentless Energy Drinks.\r\n\r\nChildren under the age of 16 are both able and motivated to access easily available addictive and behaviour-altering drugs in the form of caffeinated and carbonated 'energy drinks'.\r\n\r\nInsufficient research has been carried out to date to rule out any harmful effects that caffeine and taurine consumption can have on the physical and mental health of a developing adolescent. This is pertinent given that the brand image of several notorious energy drink manufacturers has led to a substantial rise in the number of children accessing these products at least once per week.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition would seek to place these drinks in the same category as gambling products, which can similarly be deemed to promote addictive behaviour.",
