        "additional_details": "In December GE Hitachi (GEH) offered to build a IFR fast nuclear reactor within five years which could use up the waste plutonium at Sellafield, and if it doesn\u2019t work, the UK won\u2019t have to pay.\r\n\r\nThe UK is progressing too slowly in cutting CO2 emissions and Nuclear power is the only sensible answer. IFR reactors are more efficient, and safer, they simply can't melt down.\r\n\r\nIf you truly believe in protecting the environment you must support new developments in safe nuclear power.",
