        "additional_details": "Single parents wishing to take their only child abroad are missing out on 'free child places' because they aren't travelling with another adult.  Many single parents are isolated and don't get any support. With work commitments and a constantly busy homelife a holiday abroad is an ideal opportunity to spend quality time with their child and have a well deserved break. It is unfair that a family with two parents are given the 'free child place', however a single parent isn't given the same discount.\r\nThe government needs to change this and make this offer available to all parents regardless of their circumstances.  A single parent must currently pay the full adult rate for their child who would otherwise be free in the 'average' family.  This results in single parents paying over the odds or going without a holiday each year.  The government must review this.",
