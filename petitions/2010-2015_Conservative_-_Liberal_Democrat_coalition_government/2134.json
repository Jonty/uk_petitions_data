        "additional_details": "I would like the government to create not one, but two high speed railways. One being between London and Edinburgh via the East coast. The second being from London to Glasgow via Birmingham and Manchester.\r\nNot only that, but rail fares in this country are ridiculously priced and need to be DRASTICALLY reduced to encourage people to use public transport (something that the government always encourages). Fares need to be brought in line with our European neighbours. ",
