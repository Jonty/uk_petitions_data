        "additional_details": "It appears that a lot of people with Fibromyalgia are finding it difficult getting the benefits that they need and the help they need. Hopefully when there is enough support we would like the government to accept Fibromyalgia as a real disease  when applying for benefits like DLA and the new ESA. I hope that in the future we will not have to go through degrading tribunals which are supposed to be independent and have to recognize that what they are doing at the moment is making disabled people feel alone and confused.",
