        "additional_details": "I would like to see the police, CPS and courts have the ability to charge and prosecute drivers who kill someone whilst committing another offence (eg driving under the influence or dangerous driving) with manslaughter. I feel this would be appropriate as they are aware that their behaviour is dangerous and a potential risk to the lives of others. I also believe that as a prosecutable offence the sentence available for manslaughter would be more of a deterant than the current sentence for death by dangerous driving.\r\nMany thanks for taking the time to read this.
