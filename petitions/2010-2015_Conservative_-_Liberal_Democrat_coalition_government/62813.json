The ONLY way to put a stop to this sort of activity in this sort of organisation is to nip it in the bud and make it plain that execution is the only option for anybody caught doing this in the NCA again.  Failure to do this will cause the deep rooted corruption to develop in the NCA which is endemic in all our police forces in the UK.  And if that transpires just what is the point of them being there, apart from use by its leaders to make themselves and others HUGELY rich at the taxpayers expense, as is the way in taxpayer funded organisations from the Palace of Westminster right down through to the sewerage system in our country.",
