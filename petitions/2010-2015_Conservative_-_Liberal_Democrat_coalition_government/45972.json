        "additional_details": "Despite previous assurances from the Government to the contrary The Post Office has announced that it intends to sell off Burnley`s Crown post office on Hargreaves Street.  This post office known to most locally as the General Post Office currently provides a full range of services to individuals and businesses. It is a well used and much appreciated facility and is therefore an attractive prospect for a potential franchisee. The `sell off ` is scheduled to take place in November of this year and will not only result in the loss of services to the public but will mean the loss of skilled jobs in the town and will have a devastating effect on Burnley town centre.\r\nWe the undersigned urge The Post Office to re-think these proposals and consider the future of the network, the communities it serves and the services it provides.",
