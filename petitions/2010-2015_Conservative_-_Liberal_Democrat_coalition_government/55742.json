        "action": "Castrate known paedophiles to prevent them abusing any more children",
        "additional_details": "Every day we hear stories about the horrific sexual abuse of children by paedophiles within our local areas. Whether you are a parent, a grandparent, an aunt, uncle, brother, sister or friend we all fear the worst for our children especially when we hear about cases close to home. Paedophilia is an illness which cannot be cured by prison. The only cure is to remove the urge. This petition seeks that all known and/or convicted paedophiles are castrated to remove that urge and that risk to our children when they are returned to society. Please take the time to sign this petition so we can get regulation in place to protect our children now. We need at least 100,000 UK signatures to start the Government debate so please share this petition with as many parents, family and friends as possible. Our children and their loved ones will thank us if we can protect as many of them as possible from these predatory beasts.",
