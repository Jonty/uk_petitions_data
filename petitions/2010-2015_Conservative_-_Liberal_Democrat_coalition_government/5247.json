        "additional_details": "We believe that the government should Ban the Burka in the UK.\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent poll 66% agreed with the statement \u2018the burqa should be banned in Britain\u2019\r\n42% strongly agreed\r\n27% disagreed with the statement,\r\n68% of men and 65% of women think it should be banned.\r\n\r\nWhy should the Burka be banned?\r\n\r\n\u200e1) It's a threat to national security (the terrorist responsible for one of the 21/7 bombings was able to flee in a burka)\r\n\r\n2) Fairness (we cant wear a motorcycle helmet or balaclava in a shop)\r\n\r\n3) We should not go out of our way to appease foreign ideologies. This isn't even just a religious symbol, considering some Islamic countries have bans.\r\n\r\n4) It damages social cohesion by being a divisive block on communication, something vital in our society and causes unease amongst a lot of the population.\r\n\r\n5) It is a symbol of oppression of women in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to Ban the Burka immediately.\r\n",
