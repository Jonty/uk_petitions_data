They should be given absolute preference - even if they charge a bit more, at least that money is remaining in our economy.\r\n\r\nBombardier's bid for the Crossrail project is a prime example of this not happening.\r\n\r\nThe Guardian even reported that the Government asked how much would be made in the UK, but said that it wouldn't factor into the decision! It absolutely should have!",
