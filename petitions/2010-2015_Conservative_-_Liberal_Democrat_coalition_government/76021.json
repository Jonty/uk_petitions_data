        "additional_details": "Petition to save this wonderful nursery. It provides an invaluable service to the community. One of the best nurseries in the area, children thrive in this nursery and are well prepared for school when they leave. This is an outstanding educational and care facility for younger children. The staff are kind, helpful and generous, nothing is ever to much for them. The NHS has chosen to close the nursery at the end of July under the reason of it making a loss. No evidence of this has been provided to parents and it coincides with the hospital it is adjoined to making planning applications to develop the surrounding site for housing. This petition is to ask for the review of the NHS decision in the hope that the nursery will remain open. In turn this will prevent redundancies of the staff as well as keep the children in a safe and stable environment that they are already use to.",
