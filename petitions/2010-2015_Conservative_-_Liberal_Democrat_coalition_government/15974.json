        "action": "Withdrawal of over 60 concession fares for Coach operators",
        "additional_details": "The 50% concession discount on coach travel is to be withdrawn in October. This concession allows an affordable option for people to maintain contact with family living over longer distances and is beyond practical use of the bus concession.The coach concession is NOT being withdrawn in Scotland, in fact there, the concession is a 100% discount. I propose that in order to reduce the cost of this concession rather than its total withdrawal the qualifying age should be 65 (ditto for the bus concession) I suspect that if the concession is withdrawn it will also have an impact on the coach companies resulting in yet more unemployment and for those that can actually afford it, previous concession travelers will resort to using their cars, yet more congestion.",
