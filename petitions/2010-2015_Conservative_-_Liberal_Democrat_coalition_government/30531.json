        "additional_details": "This e-petition is to urge the government to stop the proposed demolition and sale of parts of Elliott School in Putney.\r\nOnly a decade ago, Elliott was one of the most successful and diverse state schools in the country with consistently high value added results. \u201cPerhaps the finest of the large comprehensive schools\u201d (Elain Harwood, English Heritage), the grade II listed and critically acclaimed Elliott School should be a treasured part of the country's architectural, educational, and cultural heritage.\r\nWe insist that any demolition of the listed buildings or original landscaping must be ruled out entirely and that none of the land is sold for any other use. The school buildings have a well documented historical significance and the necessary refurbishment must be led by appropriate people who have a real interest in the schools preservation. This could include The RIBA, English Heritage, The Twentieth Century Society, the UK\u2019s best architects and current and ex staff and pupils.",
