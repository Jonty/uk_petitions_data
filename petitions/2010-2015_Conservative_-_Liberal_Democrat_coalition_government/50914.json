        "additional_details": "Hendon Station enables access to St Pancras International, Luton Airport, Gatwick Airport with services  every 15 minutes across London from Bedford to Brighton. It links to the new West Hampstead Station, City Thameslink, Blackfriars Station and London Bridge Station. It is in Zone 3/4 Oystercard with good road access (A5,A41,A1, A406 and M1 all nearby) and an adequate car park. It is the key to West Hendon Regeneration. Yet it lacks disabled access - something which could be included at very low cost in an essential upgrade with 'Kiss and Drop' facilities for able bodied people. The overall site has plenty of space since it used to be a major refueling depot for the Midland Railway with a Victorian station (now demolished) which John Betjeman loved. A relatively simple widening of a bridge on the A504 over the M1 motorway would enable the creation of suitable places for cars and buses to stop and allow disabled people to easily get onto the London train and underground networks.",
