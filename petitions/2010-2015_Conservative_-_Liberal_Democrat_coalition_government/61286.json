        "additional_details": "Please act quickly to ban all TV/radio/media advertising of e-cigarettes Although they purport to contain no tar or tobacco, the addictive element (Nicotine) is still present, and so will inevitably lead to people moving on to the real thing in the same way that soft drug use leads to harder drugs, (especially among the young or those who have not had any prior experience of smoking. Also, these so called \u2018e-cigarettes & e-lites emit the same elements within the vapour, thus exposing other people to the hazards of nicotine. In the same way that cigarettes release invisible toxins and unhealthy elements into the atmosphere Even if you disregard all of that, I don\u2019t think that people in our modern society want to see or be sat close people smoking in restaurants/cinemas etc. And definitely don\u2019t want to go back to the days when any pub was full of people smoking.  Let\u2019s avoid the countless deaths and/or serious illness that cause huge detriment to NHS resources.",
