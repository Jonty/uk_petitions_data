        "additional_details": "This petition is to request an increase in the threshold for 3% stamp duty at the \u00a3250,000 level to \u00a3450,000 at least in London.\r\n\r\nIt almost impossible now to find a property in London which is below \u00a3250,000. Due to the 3% stamp duty being applied to any property over \u00a3250,000 this means there is a huge amount of money needed to buy a property in London on top of the deposit already required.\r\nThis is a huge restriction for many young people in London who are trying desperately to save and get onto the property ladder. Meaning that they need a minimum of \u00a37,500 extra on top of their deposit.\r\nI feel the current stamp duty thresholds are unrealistic. Especially when it comes to London I believe it is unfair to have the same threshold as elsewhere in the country where properties of the same size are generally significantly lower in price.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
