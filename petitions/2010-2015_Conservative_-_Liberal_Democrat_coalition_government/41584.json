My life has become a living hell unable to find work since being laid off from yet another company doing badly in august of this year. Not being able to earn a wage means certain debt and decline of my wellbeing is suicide my only way out. Have sent letters to the MOD and number 10 for help but they will not read the everdence given. Please help as I can not go on for much longer my life and honour is at stake. ",
