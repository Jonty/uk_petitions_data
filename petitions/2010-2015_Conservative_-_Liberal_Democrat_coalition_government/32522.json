It would enable intelligence officers to identify who an individual or group is in contact with, how often and for how long. They would also be able to see which websites someone had visited.\r\n\r\nThis move is key to tackling crime and terrorism and will make Britain a safer place - safe, for example, from people who want to keep their online activities private at all costs.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, implore the Government to proceed with its plans. We have NOTHING TO HIDE.\r\n\r\n",
