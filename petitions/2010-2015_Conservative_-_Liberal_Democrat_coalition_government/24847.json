        "additional_details": "In the current financial situation of our own country would it not be prudent to suspend aid until we sort our own finances. Our giving of aid is very controversial at a time when domestic priorities are constantly being cut.\r\nUK doles out more aid than any other G8 country despite the savage cutbacks at home. We are told the British bill for foreign aid will be \u00a38.7bn in 2011-2012, rising to more than \u00a312bn in 2015\r\nThe Prime Minister announced plans to funnel \u00a3110million of taxpayers\u2019 cash to Egypt, Tunisia and Middle Eastern countries over the next four years to develop democracy.\r\nGovernment defends \u00a31bn of aid to India with  \u00a3280m a year and yet this nation spends \u00a320bn a year on defense\r\nWhilst I agree we should help the less fortunate surely we need first to secure our own position before we can guarantee consistent help to others. If our country goes bankrupt we will not be in a position to help.\r\n\r\n",
