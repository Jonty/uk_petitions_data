So why do we get ripped off with BT line rental, they started this after they lost the monopoly back in the 80's when people could buy their own phone instead of renting from BT, so BT changed from phone rental to line rental. Now anyone can rent from BT, and pass the rental on to the public.  The line rental should be abolished.",
