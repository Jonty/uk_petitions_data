What i have come to realise is that some schools, such as the one i go to now, do harder boards such as OCR salters as opposed to AQA . This is very unfair as it gives students unfair advantages and therefore the results can not be used as a comparison betwen schools. As well as this, there are no advantages to doing harder boards as universities do not look at the boards, so getting an A from a very hard board is the same as getting an A in a really easy board. It's just not fair.\r\n\r\nONE BOARD= FAIR = REFLECTS THIS COUNTRY'S TRUE EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nAll we need is one universal board so all students are studying at the same level.",
