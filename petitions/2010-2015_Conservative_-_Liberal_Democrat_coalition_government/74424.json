Also signposting to organisations, government help and advice; but it is meant to be a very important and overdue group with an aim top act in the intrerest of volunteers, as their prime purpose.\r\n My own experiences in one of my volunteering posts where very detrimental: You 'stand on your own' if things go seriously wrong. After my Employment Appeals Tribunal hearing two weeks ago, I want to turn all the pain I went through into something positive, and give volunteers their own union.",
