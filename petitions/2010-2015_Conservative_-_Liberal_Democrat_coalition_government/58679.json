We live in England but my dad went over to South Africa as a holiday with my two older sisters and brother. They were able to come back, but my father wasn't. Because the South African home office thought my dad was living in England with us illegally. We have been living here for 14 years. They told him he cannot come back to England for a year, but this still means no promises. We are all missing him so much and my mother is so heartbroken. Please help him to come back, please. We need our Dad and my mother needs her husband back.",
