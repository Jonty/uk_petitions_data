        "additional_details": "The TFL Bus Network Controllers often instruct their drivers to terminate buses before the destination stated on the front of the bus.\r\nIf buses are meant to be a serious form of reliable TFL commuter transport then to ask passengers to leave a bus, sometimes in to bad weather, because they have terminated a route early should not be allowed.\r\nMany people are not aware that you require a 'transfer ticket' when this happens to stop being charged again, which takes more time, and it is very rare for a driver to actively volunteer to do this.  This kind of disregard for passenger needs is very rare on the underground, and certainly not common on overground routes, buses should be no different.\r\nThis petition is to force TFL Bus Controllers to always reach the destination on the bus unless the bus has broken down or an accident/incident has taken place.  Without this action, passengers should be encouraged to remain on the bus until the bus is reinstated as an act of protest.",
