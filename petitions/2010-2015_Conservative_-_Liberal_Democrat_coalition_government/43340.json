Any new laws that would be introduced would be as ineffective as the present laws.  THE REASON?  We have stopped punishing anybody for committing crimes in this country (except, of course, those who hurt somebody while reacting against a crime being committed against them) and Mr Miliband would be better to rail for criminals to be punished properly.  For instance, start by jailing any pharmacist found guilty of selling prescription drugs without a prescription on a WHOLE LIFE WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PAROLE tariff.  Just how many pharmacists do you believe would have to be jailed before we saw the illegal sale of prescription drugs being curtailed?",
