        "additional_details": "A 24 hour airport serving the interests of the whole of the United Kingdom should go ahead as planned. We the people petition for the project to go ahead . With the high speed rail links to all parts of the country it would serve business and the interests of the population for many years to come. NOTE: The strategic location of the project means noise abatement does not need to be considered in the same way as London Heathrow or any of the existing South East airports.",
