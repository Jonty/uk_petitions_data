        "additional_details": "Prevent company directors claiming benefits or paying themselves a p/t minimum wage, accessing tax credits & other benefits for working families, while the company reserves increase. They are not paying any tax/NI contributions due to the stated low income; they are making a profit out of the benefit system & making a mockery of honest people. Some directors also avoid paying child maintenance by paying themselves no/low wages. They repeatedly sever employment with their own company once the CSA contact them, then reclaim JSA. This avoids CSA, tax & NI payments, then the cycle restarts. Meanwhile their own company builds up cash reserves. They can continue to live as normal using company assets. A more rigorous system must be implemented for the sake of the majority who act with fairness & integrity, to stop diversion of income & avoidance of tax, NI & child maintenance & to prevent benefits, designed to help people in need, being used to prop up avoidance schemes for the greedy rich.",
