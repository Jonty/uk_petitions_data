        "additional_details": "I\u2019m writing to you today to request you consider an ordinance that would outlaw the use of wild animals in circuses and traveling shows in Northern Ireland.\r\nThe handling and confinement of wild animals for use in entertainment creates potentially dangerous situations.\r\nIt takes a tremendous amount of cruel training to break the wild animals to get them to perform the tricks seen at circus performances.\r\nTo dominate and create fear in performance animals, they are bound and beaten into submission, a process so traumatic that they will certainly obey their trainers the rest of their lives or suffer the consequences. Performing wild animals will then spend eleven months out of every year confined, on the road, and traveling from town to town. Circuses that only use human performers prove that the humane, non-animal circus model can be successful.\r\nI urge you to outlaw the use of wild animals in circuses and traveling shows in Northern Ireland.\r\n",
