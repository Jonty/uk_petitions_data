        "additional_details": "I propose that all serving personnel and their families leaving the armed forces are housed in suitable accommodation, and are placed at the top of the housing lists on leaving the forces. At this present time and has been for many years, our armed forces have not been prioritised with any part of housing and accommodation  and this needs to change. Our soldiers, airmen, and naval men  have all dedicated their lives to this country, and its about time our country gave something back.\r\nPlease show your support.",
