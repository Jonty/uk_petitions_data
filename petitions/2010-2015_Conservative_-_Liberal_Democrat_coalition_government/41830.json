        "additional_details": "The Zionist 'state' of Israel has already suppressed Palestine for several decades. They constantly collaborate with anti-Palestine terrorists, engaging in acts of violence themselves, and reaping the natural resources of its Arab neighbours. The Arabs had lived in the lands long before Arthur Balfour decided the Jews could occupy this land. Britain are undoubtidly the author of this violence yet we distance ourselves.\r\nIs it not the entire purpose of the UN to stand up to bullies?\r\nYes, it is but along with other disillusioned western governments, they seem to collaborate with Israel and classify them as allies?\r\nCountries have stood up to bullies in the past: (Nazi Germany, Bosnian Serbs etc) so why not now?\r\nWith tensions flaring yet again, and Israel-Gaza making the news, it's time to stand up and consult the UN, before a major humanitarian crisis unfolds in the most volatile region on earth.\r\n",
