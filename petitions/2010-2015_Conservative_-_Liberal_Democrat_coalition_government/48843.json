        "additional_details": "In an era where few people have a single employer for life and Governments constantly fiddle with state schemes, a single pension statement would be a useful, some might say essential, tool to help understand retirement position and potential income.\r\n\r\nQuaterly, or more frequent, statements would include all income in retirement including every personal, company and state scheme. The risks of each scheme including state ones would be clearly outlined. Increasing Government debt and aging populations mean it's essential to understand that state provision is far from risk free.\r\n\r\nThe statements would clearly explain the inflation proofing of each scheme. This is particularly important as Governments now seem unwilling or unable to control inflation.\r\n\r\nThis will create more awareness of the need for retirement planning and self provision and act as a focal point for educating and informing people about the huge number of schemes that make up the overly complex world of pensions.",
