        "additional_details": "Sex education is essentially non-existent in the UK. Children are only taught on a basic level and this does not prepare them for the real world. On the other end of the spectrum you have the soft pornography that is in every music video. Young people are educating themselves about sex through pornography. We need to teach young people about sex, what it is and what are the risks. About pregnancy and how this can affect their lives both physically and mentally. Sexually transmitted infections, how easily they are contracted. Rape- children are becoming desensitised about the issue and it\u2019s time we stopped treating the subject as an elephant in the room; pornography and how it is not household sex, how it is not what young boys should expect from their classmates and we must eradicate all the myths that surround sex, only this week did Britain\u2019s youngest mother, aged 12, give birth. She was unaware that she could get pregnant as it was only her first sexual encounter. This needs to end.",
