        "additional_details": "Teachers should get tax relief for job expenses \u2013 reducing the tax they pay\r\n\r\nMany teachers have to buy specialist clothing to perform their contractual duties, and are not reimbursed by their employers. An example would be a PE teacher who buys sports kit. Tax relief can be claimed on some of these items. A basic flat rate expense worth \u00a360 per year for the laundering of uniform and protective clothing is currently available, but this is not specific to the industry. In reality it doesn't take into consideration the real costs incurred. When compared to an Electrician who can claim \u00a3140 per year, the need becomes more obvious.\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe costs that teachers incur because of their profession justifies a flat rate expense being agreed by HMRC. With salaries that don\u2019t leave much money spare, a flat rate expense would give teachers some help, and the tax relief they deserve.
