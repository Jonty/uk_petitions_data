        "additional_details": "I am currently in the process of taking GCSE exams, and was horrified and frankly disgusted at seeing an article describing how Michael Gove has supposedly removed all the classics of American Literature at GCSE in his newest reforms. Of Mice and Men. To Kill a Mockingbird. Both axed simply because they were 'non-British'.\r\nI strongly believe that students at GCSE should be exposed to a full range of authors from all around the globe. I realise that we will study 'one Shakespeare play, a 19th century novel written anywhere and post-1914 fiction or drama written in the British Isles', but I think this just won't suffice. Do NOT remove any authors/ works from the syllabus. ",
