        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, would very much appreciate it if the House of Commons would use its influence to help improve the standard of British football punditry. We feel that the best way to do this would be for the government to convince ITV to relieve Andy Townsend of his duties as Clyde Tyldsley's co-commentator, and have the role assumed by Bolton Wanderers midfielder Jay Spearing. Whilst we are certain that Mr Townsend is a very nice man, we are of the opinion that British football broadcasting is in need of a figure in the co-commentary position who is more insightful and better at providing useful analysis in football matches. We feel that Mr Spearing, with his inspirational nature and boyish charm, would be perfect for this role, assuming he can perform it without failing to fulfil his duties to Bolton Wanderers FC. ",
