        "additional_details": "Thousands of people die needlessly due to the current 'opt in' system for organ donation. No one wants to think about donating the organs of a loved one when tragedy occurs, however if we had an opt out system there would be a huge increase in available organs without having to put families through added trauma at the point of death. This would end the situation where hundreds of people die each year needlessly because of the lack of available organs. It would also give hope to both the donor's families and the recipients and their families.",
