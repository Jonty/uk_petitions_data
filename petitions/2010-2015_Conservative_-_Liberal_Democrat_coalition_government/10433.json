        "additional_details": "Unsolicited telephone calls cause distress to many people, both by their frequency and by the techniques used by the caller.  The telephone preference service presently only seeks to reduce unsolicited sales calls. Many organisations engineer their unsolicited telephone calls so that they can be classed as surveys, research, offering consumer advice etc.  Yet many people don't want to be contacted in any of these ways.\r\n\r\nAllow an option under the telephone preference service for any unsolicited business calls from any organisation to be barred.  Genuine surveys and calls may still be allowed if specifically licensed.\r\n\r\nAn unsolicited business call is any call by a business for a purpose that is not part of an activity already agreed with the person being telephoned.",
