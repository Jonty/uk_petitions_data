        "additional_details": "Day after day i see drivers, one hand on steering wheel and anther with a mobile phone in their hand, either texting (head down) or chatting away. As a father of 2 young children who like to get out and about and go for walks, it is very concerning at times seeing some of these ignorant drivers negotiating a tight corner or just driving far too fast whilst on a phone.Something has to be done. 3 points and a fine is not a deterrent ! most legal representation can argue a clients case in their favour and they escape any punishment. Any voluntary impairment whilst driving a lethal weapon should carry an appropriate punishment surely?",
