I would like to see Chris Moyles remain as the breakfast show host along with his team of Comedy Dave, Dominic Burn, Tina & Aled.  To say that the main Radio 1 station should be focused on 15 - 25 year olds when its main audience is well above this why try to change the station why not promote and increase the size of one of the youth stations and leave the back bone of breakfast radio alone.\r\n",
