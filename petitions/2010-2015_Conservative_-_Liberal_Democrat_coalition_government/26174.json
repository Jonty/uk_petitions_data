        "additional_details": "The Violence against Women act protects women from such crimes as Domestic Violence, abuse and rape. However it dose not protect men at all despite the fact that according to home office figures 40% of domestic violence cases are that in which the man is a victim, a fact that is always ignored and distorted in flavour of a lie which depicts only men as abusers.  Not to mention the fact that the rape of men is fully ignored by the government and today's society.\r\n\r\nThe violence against women act also makes the arrest of the man compulsory in all cases of acts covered under the act, even when the man is the victim.\r\n\r\nThe violence against women act is a direct attack at men and should be replaced with a law that is equal in its protection of both genders and treats both genders as equals.
