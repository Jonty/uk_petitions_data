        "additional_details": "This petition is to encourage the Prime Minister to reduce the number of Members of Parliament as promised in his pre election speeches.\r\nAs approx 80% of all legislation is now generated from Brussels the number of MP's should be reduced proportionally, as they are only now rubber stamping these EU laws.\r\nThis can easily be achieved by changing the proportion of MP's to the population from 100000 to 250000. So the present 635 would reduce to 260 MP's and saving millions of pounds every year.  At the same time the Electoral boundaries will need changing and an Independant Group should be established outside the influence of the Political Parties to review and revise these accordingly.\r\nI call upon the Government to act and make these savings.",
