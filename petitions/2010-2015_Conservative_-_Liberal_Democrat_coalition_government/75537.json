        "additional_details": "A National Guard could benefit the UK massively especially in this day and age. If a UK National Guard was to be created they could assist the police in anti- terror operations, civil unrest and natural disasters. The Armed Forces role would be to protect Britain and her interests abroad, while the National Guard's role will be to protect Britain from within her own borders. But can be called up to assist the Armed forces if needed. If a National Guard was to be created it should take it's model from the U.S National Guard but with a few differences, like all members being volunteers who are either serving in the Armed Forces or are Civilians. All should get military training and public order training with the entry requirements being taken from the British Army.                   ",
