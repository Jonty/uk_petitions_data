He's Tony Blair in Tory clothes ! A total disgrace ! Would we \"let our neighbours house burn\" No! but neither would we let them tell us what to do with our wages or borrow loads of money we can't afford and give it to them knowing they will never pay it back putting us in financial proplems for the reast of our days. David Cameron must be removed and reduce or outgoings by stopping payments to the EU. This is the voice of the people !",
