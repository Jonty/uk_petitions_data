        "additional_details": "Recent research has identified extreme anti-Semitic & racist attitudes from significant numbers of fans on the terraces of Ukrainian & Polish football clubs. Allowing England to play in this tournament & encouraging British fans to travel to watch Euro 2012 is dangerous, irresponsible & ignores this key issue  that needs to be tackled by the Ukrainian & Polish Governments & the UEFA. I not only agree with Sol Campbell that English fans should not travel to the Euro 2012 tournament, but would go further in saying that the England team should also stand united against racism by staying at home for this tournament.",
