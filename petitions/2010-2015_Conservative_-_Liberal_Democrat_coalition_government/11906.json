        "additional_details": "Many of the rioters being brought before the courts are first time offenders. Rather than giving short sentences to these people, they should be made to wear orange boiler suits and forced to clean the streets, scrub grafiti from buildings and clear children's play areas. By humiliating these youths and in some cases adults in public and at the same time cleaning areas destroyed by them will be more effective than handing out fines that they will not pay or from cutting benefits which will then lead to increased crime due to theft.",
