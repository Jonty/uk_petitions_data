        "additional_details": "Chronic Crohns; morphine drips, A and E, ICU admissions, medication, feeding tubes, injections.\r\nNo immune system; Arthritis, osteoporosis, scurvy, hypo tension, hypoglycaemia, heart problems, brain problems, hair loss, gum disease.\r\n\r\nHere is the definition to provide clear clarification as to what a disability is: ''a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities.'' Now, with Crohns not being classed as this, a 18 year old girl with the body of an 80 year old is being forced to work despite constant agony. Do you think this should change? That this girl I am writing about should face stigma, misjudgement and so on.\r\n\r\nThis girl I am writing about, deserves a life. Not this one she has of pain and suffering, getting Crohns classed as a disability will not solve all problems; but it is a start. Please sign if you agree with what is written and believe there should be a change.\r\n\r\n",
