        "action": "Put effective drugs education on the National Curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Wide consumption of 'legal highs' and club drugs place young people at risk of long term harm and even death. These substances are often regarded as safe because many are legal. However, they are often a combination of Class B drugs and toxic chemicals. There is a lack of awareness and education, not helped by the fact that drugs education is not currently on the National Curriculum. We therefore petition to urgently get effective drugs education on the National Curriculum in Schools throughout the UK, with particular attention to the implementation of proven programmes like Climate and Preventure which have been shown to significantly reduce the use of drugs, alcohol and legal highs.",
