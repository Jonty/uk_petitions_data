Greed is ruining the festive season by stretching it out too long.\r\n\r\nIn the US, they don't advertise Christmas till after Halloween. Here, we should use the 5th Nov. as the cut off date. So:\r\n\r\nThe government should make it illegal for retailers to do any of the following between 1/8 and 5/11:\r\nUse the words \"Christmas\", \"Xmas\", \"Yule\" or any synonyms thereof in advertising material;\r\nDisplay or sell any of the following: Xmas Trees/decorations, Xmas Cards, Tinsel or other items connected entirely with Xmas (exemptions could be granted as they are for fireworks.)\r\n\r\nThis is within the government's remit - there are already laws restricting what can be advertised or sold. Fireworks, for example - without a license, you can't sell or advertise them before a month or so prior to 5/11. A similar law should be passed restricting the sale and advertisement of Christmas merchandise",
