        "additional_details": "MP's are on a reasonable wage and they also receive large holidays from Parliament. The summer recess should be reduced to four weeks maximum, and the Christmas and easter recesses to one week each. If an MP wishes to extend his holiday period he should do as the private sector does and take unpaid holiday. If it is a matter of being present for a vote and he cannot be there due to holidays then in this modern world of technology a secure e mail vote surely can be arranged.",
