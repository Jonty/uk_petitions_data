        "additional_details": "As a trainee BSL interpreter,it pains me every time a bus driver just shouts down the bus about a particular stop or traffic jam,while still facing forward and sometimes still driving, and expects/assumes everybody to have not only heard what s/he said,but to have understood it.\r\n\r\nDeaf people do not have the means to know what's been yelled like everyone else. How are they to know the driver isn't going to stop at the next stop? Or is going to go a different route? They can't,it has to be Signed to them,and yet none of the drivers seem to possess even the basics of this skill. This is an ignorant act on the bus company's behalf,and needs to stop now.",
