If we are 'all in it together' they must surely accept 1% for as long as the same is to be applied to benefits.\r\n\r\nThey must have an appreciation of the impact of the effective cuts made upon us by them.\r\n\r\nIf there is fear of MPs leaving the profession, I can assure them plenty of us will be more than happy to step into their places.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition, they must be made to walk away from this rise or we face another summer of riots.",
