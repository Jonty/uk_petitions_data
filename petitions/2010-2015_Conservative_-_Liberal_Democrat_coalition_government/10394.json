I propose a bill that means any term issued by a court should be served fully and not half for good behaviour, Any bad behaviour should then allow the prison governor to increase the term and good behaviour means they get out on time. I think a life sentance should mean a life sentance and 10 years should be 10 years and 6 months should be 6 months not 3!",
