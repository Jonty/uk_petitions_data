        "additional_details": "In February 2013 NICE re-iterated it's guidelines that 3 rounds of funded IVF treatment should be provided by the NHS, yet there are still areas of the UK where couples are being denied any access to funded IVF treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, many couples where one partner has had children from a previous relationship are excluded from funded treatment, as are those who require donor eggs or sperm. Regardless of the medical reasons why this is the case.\r\n\r\nWe are calling for the government to take action to ensure every couple in the UK who requires IVF treatment and do not have a child together already should be entitled to at least one NHS funded attempt, including where donor eggs or sperm are required.\r\n\r\nThe emotional impact of Infertility is devastating, but many couples choose not to share their struggles, for a variety of good reasons.\r\n\r\nWe cannot continue to ignore these individuals simply because many choose to suffer in silence.",
