If the present Government and the rest of the political community need to move the date of the next election, then they can easily change the date and if necessary change the constitution.\r\nThe public, and more importantly the soldiers and families who sacrificed their lives for the country, need closure. This report surely overrides the need for a regular election. Otherwise, shame on all the parties and none of you deserve my vote.\r\n",
