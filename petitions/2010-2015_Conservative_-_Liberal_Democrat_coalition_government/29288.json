        "additional_details": "Living in rural Northamptonshire, it is difficult to find an easily accessible Nando's restaurant. The one's at Kettering, Bedford and Northampton are just too far away - especially for non-drivers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition is to get a Nando's restaurant opened up in Rushden, Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\nRushden and neighbouring Higham Ferrers are becoming home to a number of people that work in London and Milton Keynes. Residents of both towns are requiring more diversity and choice in their local amenities. Adding a Nando's restaurant to this list would be a big step forward and may attract more custom and businesses into the area, stimulating the local economy.",
