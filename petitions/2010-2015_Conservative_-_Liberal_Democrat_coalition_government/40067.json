        "additional_details": "We know that party politics has degraded and virtually destroyed democracy in this country but there has been a recent upsurge in the statement that MPs should vote in accordance with their conscience.  THAT IS WRONG.  MPs should be legally bound to vote in accordance with the opinion of the members of the electorate who put him/her where he/she is SPECIFICALLY TO REPRESENT THEIR VIEW.  MPs and the officers of government seem to be bent on denying their electorate in the business of running the country and this must be stopped.  DEMOCRACY WILL VERY SOON BE DEAD IN THIS COUNTRY.  Any existing MPs who would find difficulty over this are invited to leave their post and give somebody who has committment to the people a chance.",
