Please do not sully his memory nor his funeral by attending and pretending that you stand for the same things he did.  You don't,  and you do NOT deserve the right to stand there and say that do.  Those who sign this petition do not want to see you there claiming to represent us BECAUSE YOU DO NOT.",
