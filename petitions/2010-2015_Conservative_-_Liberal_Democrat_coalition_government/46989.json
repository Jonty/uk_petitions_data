We think that the time has come to think and enforce an Exit door . According with currently laws, rules and regulations, even a military dictatorship can be part of the EU .\r\nThe only punishments that could be enforced are the right to vote and the EU funds. There is no way to exclude a Country from EU, yet.\r\n Some measures could be enforced  to help the member states who fails to respect the rule of law .Here are our proposals.\r\n\r\n",
