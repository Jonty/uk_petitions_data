        "action": "Complete overhaul of the Foreign Aid Policy",
        "additional_details": "With the recent news that the target for spending all of the foreign aid budget has been met (\u00a312,6 billion for 2014) but not one NHS hospital has managed to hit target on patient treatment, I believe it is time for the government to address and  change its policies.\r\n\r\nI propose drastically reducing foreign aid spending.  A sum of \u00a32.5 billion maximum while we sort out our affairs, this is roughly what Canada and Australia pay in foreign aid.  Create funding for the NHS, new schools, jobs creation, and many other urgent and important matters such as the rise in the homeless population. Make targets, meet those targets and only then the foreign aid budget should increase.\r\n\r\n(Petitions are only allowed 1000 characters, I have written a slightly longer petition where I raise my points.  Please visit http://freepdfhosting.com/c6f2361c1f.pdf to read in full)\r\n\r\nPlease do not remove this link from the petition as the link and its contents do not go against your terms and conditions.",
