This excludes tobacco, alcohol and non essential other products such as holidays, gym membership and dine in restaurants.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that tax payers money is used to support benefit claimants living needs to \"live\" and prevents the purchases of non essential luxuries in which many workers indeed struggle to benefit from themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means degrading or belittling and should only be seen as a health benefit to many that may be either dependent on alcohol/drugs/tobacco.\r\n\r\nEarning money entitles people to have the choice in which they wish to spend \"their\" money yet money given to assisting one to live and not essentially not to die should not be owned by the end user but by those who provide such an assistance/free service.",
