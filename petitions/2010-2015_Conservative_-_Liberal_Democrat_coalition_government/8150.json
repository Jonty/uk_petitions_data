        "additional_details": "With the recent riots throughout the country, it's become evident that there is a sickness at the heart of many of today's young people. We need 2 years national military service for all 18 year olds. It will instill a sense of discipline and self worth so lacking in this day and age. A strong work ethic is needed for a youth so long estranged from society. They will leave the service with employable skills and something to give back to the nation. Please sign this petition and help save our country from itself!",
