        "additional_details": "The Secretary of State should keep the duty to \u201csecure and provide comprehensive health care for all\u201d.\r\n\r\nGP commissioning consortiums-clusters will  introduce charges, insurance fees, and contract commercial companies. These reforms are based on the privatised U.S. system: the most expensive and highly inequitable healthcare system. The  existing NHS is  almost the least costly healthcare system, with one of the best levels of access to care. (US Commonwealth Fund 2010 survey of 11 industrialised countries). The NHS should remain a Public Service.\r\nCompetition law should not apply to the NHS: healthcare is a collective public good.\r\nPeople created NHS free health care for all,in 1948. to replace private medicine only for those who could pay. Britain was then officially bankrupt.  Scotland and Wales have retained  publicly funded NHS and improved them. Proposals by RCN and BMA members would save money and improve care, without drastic cuts or privatisation.\r\n",
