        "additional_details": "The government is currently planning to exempt shale gas exploitation (fracking) decisions from local authority control, as proposed in the Growth and Infrastructure Bill.\r\n\r\nThis means that local people would not have a say in decisions which would have a huge impact on their local environment. This is an attack on local democracy.\r\n\r\nThe government should abandon these plans and keep powers to control local planning decisions with local councils. Fracking has signficant environmental risks and local people should have ability to object to plans if they wish to.",
