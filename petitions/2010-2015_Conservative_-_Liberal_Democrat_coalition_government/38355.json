I would further like to see a common office space there for the staff they need to help run their office.\r\n\r\nThis would\r\n- eliminate the need for the MP to claim expenses for housing whilst in the capital thus getting rid of any second home allowance (saving vital time of someone calculating the expenditure)\r\n- remain fair to the tax payer\r\n- reduce the security needs by having one security team to control one building rather than individual locations\r\n- create jobs to build the building, helping to kick start a current poor job market\r\n- allow MP's to share pooled staff rather than employing individuals themselves, further cutting expense, allowing for sick leave / holidays of staff / again reducing claims they actually had to submit as could be controlled centrally\r\n- Allow the MP to walk to work, saving vital cost of travel.\r\n",
