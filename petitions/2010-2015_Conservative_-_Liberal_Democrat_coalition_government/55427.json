        "additional_details": "We the undersigned wish for the use of the MID ( MOTOR INSURANCE DATABASE) system to be regarded as a standing \"owners request\" of all vehicles involved in road traffic incidents that are NOT of police interest. ( statutory removal or P.A.C.E.) As this enactment is already in law under section 99 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984.\r\n\r\nthis would reduce the costs and inconvenience to the motoring public and motor insurance companies as they would be free to use recovery operators of there choice at a reduced fee.\r\n\r\ncurrently the police services of the united kingdom are inclined to utilise there own contracted operators out of habit and a lack of education in this area.\r\nthe downside is that the paying public are then required to pay the STATUTORY RATE prescribed by law.
