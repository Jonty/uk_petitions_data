This is disgusting. Everyone who has served since the Queen ascended the throne should be eligible. For those who have sadly died, their loved ones should receive the medal in their honour. I want the Ministry of Defence and the Government to overturn the current eligibility criteria to include ALL armed forces members, both current and past",
