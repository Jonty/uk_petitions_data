This is because people can get \u2018acclimatised\u2019 & habituated towards the daylight hours available to them during various times of their usual daily routines, like going to and from work, school, shopping, etc. What is accepted as the chronological time at any fleeting moments in time, interacts & affects people\u2019s idiosyncratic & varied lives. Therefore it is important to have a bottom-up approach by having proper debates and consultation on whether UK time should be kept constant all year; either at GMT, BST or continental time (2 hours ahead of GMT).",
