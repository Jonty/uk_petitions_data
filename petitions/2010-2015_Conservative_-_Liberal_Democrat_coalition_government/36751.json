It simply would be alot better if they wern't around, they are practically useless now anyway, you used to be able to buy penny sweets now that seems like an impossible task you always use them to make up a larger amount when paying for goods and they always get lost or stored away and its estimated that \u00a365 million of pennies are now out of circulation due to storage or losing them. Please sign today to wave the penny away.",
