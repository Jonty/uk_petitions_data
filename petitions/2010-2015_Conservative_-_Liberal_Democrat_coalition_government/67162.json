There is nothing to hold them to account bar another equally wriggly politician who didn't win the election. They can promise champagne and deliver flat lemonade. Well i say that they are held accountable. If we vote them in, they are fired and prosecuted if they don't abide by pre-election promises. If times change when voted in, then don't promise it before.
