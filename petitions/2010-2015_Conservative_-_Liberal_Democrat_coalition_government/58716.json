        "additional_details": "High unemployment has been a major problem since 2008. This is mostly due to a slow economic recovery (GDP is lower than in 2008), which has been exacerbated by government austerity. Public sector jobs have been cut and have not been replaced by equivalent full time jobs in the private sector.\r\n\r\nApprenticeships are fully funded for 16-18 year olds -  But the government has no effective policies to help the rest of the unemployed population into work. According to the BBC poll of polls on 15/12/13, the opposition party is 4% ahead of the Conservatives and is on track to win the next election.\r\n\r\nTo restore the public's confidence in the government, the government should implement policies to reduce unemployment now - and aim to reduce unemployment by half if they are re-elected. Investment in major projects, public sector investment or private sector subsidies would all increase employment. Allowing people to remain unemployed is unproductive and unfair on society and individuals.\r\n\r\n",
