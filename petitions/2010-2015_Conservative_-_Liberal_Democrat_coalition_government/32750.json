        "action": "Stop the proposal for a waste management centre in Brunel Newton Abbot",
        "additional_details": "Devon County Council have earmarked Brunel Industrial Estate including a popular housing community of 50 houses at Brunel Road as a possible site for an 'energy recovery facility,' due to it's close proximity to the railway. This will have a huge negative impact on this community, local businesses and the wider community of Newton Abbot bringing with it increased traffic, the possibility of an incinerator which hasn't been ruled out, unpleasant smells and the possibility of compulsory purchases for the householders in the earmarked area. These houses were built over 100 years ago. Please add your signature to this petition to put a stop to this ridiculous proposal before it reaches the consultation period. Thank you",
