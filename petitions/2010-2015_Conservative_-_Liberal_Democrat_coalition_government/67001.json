It is also surely dangerous when driving a car, and anyone going into a bank with a helmet on is required to remove it to see their face.  How can we expect people to integrate, and truly become a citizen of the country they have chosen to be part of, when the niqab is part of the culture they have left behind, so why do they want to come here?
