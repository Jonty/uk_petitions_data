        "additional_details": "This petition is to raise as many signatures as possible to stop the Express newspapers writing ridiculous, inaccurate weather forecasts to sell papers with front page headlines. The Express papers are scaremongering the British public by over dramatising forecasts that are totally inaccurate, so much so that seasoned TV forecasters, newsreaders are even starting to notice it, and drop hints into their news bulletins. The so-called forecasters used are seemingly fake companies who have been caught out by investigators in the past and they change names, but using the same people. It is nothing more than a joke, and it must be stopped.\r\n\r\nMetWeatherUK (Weather Community)",
