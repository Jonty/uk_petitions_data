        "additional_details": "The right to particular religious dress is enshrined within the Human Rights Act 1998.  Any such ban has been condemned by human rights groups, who say it infringes on religious and personal freedom.\r\n\r\nThere were also strong signs the ban led to an increase in Islamophobic attacks and will increase tensions between the Muslim community and right wing fundamentalists.\r\n\r\nThe Home Office itself stated, \"It is not for government to say what people can and cannot wear. Such a proscriptive approach would be out of keeping with our nation's longstanding record of tolerance. Accordingly we do not support a ban on wearing the burka.\"\r\n\r\nWe do not believe in banning any person of any religion from expressing their religion.  We do not adhere to the rise in right wing politics to quench the thirst of power hungry politicians willing to disregard the views of the majority of the country and thereby create a melting pot for violence and create an increase in ignorant hate crime.",
