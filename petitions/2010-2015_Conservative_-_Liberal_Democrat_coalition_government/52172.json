        "additional_details": "The last non-royal hereditary peerage was awarded to Harold Macmillan in 1984. Since then no new titles have been created and as a result the British peerage, some titles in which are over 800 years old, is in danger of dying out.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords Act 1999 ensured hereditary peers do not get automatic seats in the Upper House. Therefore there is no longer any reason to hold off granting these titles, which are part of our heritage and convey great honour on people who have made an outstanding contribution to public life.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to restart granting hereditary peerages to rescue one of Britain's oldest and greatest institutions.",
