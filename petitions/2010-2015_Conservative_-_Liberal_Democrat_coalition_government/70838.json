People suffer from Compulsive Cleaning Disorder have a serious mental issue. however people say they have OCD all the time over nothing e.g. \"I have sooo much OCD my carpets MUST be the same color as my walls LOL\". This is like saying you are retarded because you can do A-level maths. you may be a bit dim but not retarded. I suggest that schools teach children the difference between OCD and overreacting so people with the condition are better understood.",
