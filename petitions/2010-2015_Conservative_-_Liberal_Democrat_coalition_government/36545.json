This is a breach of our basic human rights (Universal declaration of Human rights, article 3; Every person has the right to live. Every person has the right to be free and the right to feel safe wherever he or she may live)\r\n\r\nThe Lord Ashbourne should have his title removed, his heirs stripped of the honor, and the title of Baron be given to someone who recognizes the basic human rights that should be enjoyed by all.
