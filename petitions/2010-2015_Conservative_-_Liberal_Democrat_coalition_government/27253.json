        "additional_details": "At the moment the driving theory test is only available in 20 languages as well as English. These are: Alabian,Arabic,Bengali,Cantonese,Dari,Farsi,Gujarati,Hindi,Kashmiri,Kurdish,Mirpuri,Polish,Portuguese,Punjabi,Pushto,Spanish,Tamil,Turkish,Urdu and Welsh.\r\n\r\nI think the government should make the DVLA theory test available in more than 20  languages because it will stop impersonator's taking the test's on behalf of fellow immigrants.In addition this will stop other road user's lives being at risk. Furthermore many immigrants want to learn to drive but because English is not their first language they find it hard to pass the theory test.\r\n",
