        "additional_details": "As tuition fees that universities are allowed to charge will be increased to (up to) \u00a39000 per annum in 2012/2013- up from \u00a33375 the year earlier- I suggest the government considers reducing annual fees, or introducing them more gradually. This allows potential students to prepare accordingly for this otherwise sudden increase of costs that would undoubtedly create a lot of financial indebtedness before students even begin a career. ",
