        "additional_details": "Every year on the 12th July, the annual Orangeman's Day parade takes place in Southport.\r\n\r\nThis parade, it's associated drunkeness and the mess left behind is awful for the residents of Southport.  Many people feel intimidated and unable to go into the town centre.  Children should not need to witness drunken people, sometimes vomiting and urinating in the street.\r\n\r\nMany businesses have no option other than to close for the day which greatly affects the business owner's income.\r\n\r\nThe cleanup cost to the local Sefton council is excessive and unnecessary especially during this time of austerity.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to ban the event taking place in southport, like it has been banned in almost every other town in the UK.
