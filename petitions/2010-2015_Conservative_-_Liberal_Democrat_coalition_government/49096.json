        "additional_details": "It is becoming evident that bankers are adept at covering their illegal activities and hiding the truth about what they are doing and what is going on in their banking organisation and simply cannot be trusted with the wealth of the nation.  What is worse than them being granted an honour is having that honour removed for dishonesty, and criminal activity years into the future when their criminality has been uncovered.  If any award is to be given to a banker then it should not be handed until at least 20 years have passed since he was employed in a bank, and only then if nothing 'untoward' comes to light about his activities as a banker.",
