        "additional_details": "That repatriated troops pass through the front gates of Brize Norton so that the dead may be properly mourned.  The MoD plan to avoid Wotton Bassett or preclude the opportunity of  another town to enable the community to mourn and pay their respects to the fallen is unseemly and pathetic.  This is about supporting the families and friends of brave men and women not about politicians or the MoD.",
