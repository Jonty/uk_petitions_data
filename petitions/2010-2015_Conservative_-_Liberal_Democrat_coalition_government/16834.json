        "additional_details": "Before 19th April 2006 there were two schemes for compensating victims of miscarriage of justice; the statutory scheme under Section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 and the ex gratia scheme.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th April 2006 without any consultation or prior warning the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke made a written ministerial statement announcing the abolition of the ex gratia scheme for miscarriage of justice with immediate effect.\r\n\r\nThe decision effectively means that many victims of miscarriage of justice will have no remedy for their wrongful imprisonment.\r\n\r\nWe request the government to restore ex gratia compensation for those wrongly convicted because such victims are recognised as having suffered what may be a great injury at the hands of the State and it is accepted as just that the State, representing the public at large, should make fair recompense.",
