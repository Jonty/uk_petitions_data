        "additional_details": "in recent yrs the number of household pets esp cats killed after ingesting antifreeze has dramatically risen. I ve lost two cats in the way and its heartbreaking whether intentional or accidental the only way to stop this is replacing the main ingredient ethylene glycol with a less toxic propylene glycol. Though still not completely non-toxic it is far less deadly as it doesnt form the oxalate crystals which lead to renal failure after ingestion like ethylene glycol does. ",
