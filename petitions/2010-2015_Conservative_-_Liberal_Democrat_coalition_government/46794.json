Staff and governors can wear trousers if they want to - all schools should be told by the Government to allow pupils to have the same uniform choices. Telling girls they cannot wear trousers is sexist and old fashioned and serves no educational purpose. If that means giving the boys the option of wearing skirts, so be it.",
