It didn't work and very little got through to the SMEs that are the engine room of UK industry. This ePetition is to ask MPs to review a radical but guaranteed method of re-floating many parts of the UK economy, especially the high street.\r\n\r\nSimply put, the Government should issue each household with a voucher for \u00a33,000 it can spend anywhere in the UK (on a defined list of items, preferably UK products & services) within a short term; say 30 days. Vouchers would only be issued to those primary households currently paying council tax. Cost, around \u00a375 billion.",
