If this means them working in a chain gang to help build British infrastructures like roads, railways, even so far as clearing up dog mess from a childs play park or pulling ragwort along the sides of roadways - then so be it.\r\nThey should not be allowed to sit on their backsides in relative comfort surrounded by luxuries such as games stations and TV's etc which in the end cost us decent taxpayers far too much.\r\nThey need to pay for their crimes and by doing community work like this, is the way to do it.\r\nThey all need to do serious hard work instead of sitting about in luxury.  It's time to get tough on these lazy self serving cretins.\r\n   ",
