        "additional_details": "The recent change in Marks & Spencers policy, allowing Muslim staff to refuse service to those buying pork or alcohol is outrageous.  We do not live in a Muslim country, and it is in OUR right to buy what we choose, and should not be refused service for someone elses religion.  If Muslims choose to work for M&S, they abide by British trading standards.  This policy should be reversed for the good of the company.",
