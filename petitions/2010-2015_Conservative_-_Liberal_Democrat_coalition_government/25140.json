        "additional_details": "We petition the Government not to remove work-related learning from the statutory Key Stage 4 curriculum in England.\r\n\r\nYoung people attending maintained schools currently have a statutory entitlement to work-related learning during Key Stage 4 (age 14-16). This helps them to: see how knowledge learned at school is used at work; develop employability skills such as self-management, problem-solving and how to work with customers, clients and colleagues; decide what courses to take post-16; and, find out about jobs and careers.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Wolf Review of Vocational Education, the Government has announced plans to remove work-related learning from the statutory Key Stage 4 curriculum. With youth unemployment at record levels, we believe this decision is wrong and should be reversed.\r\n\r\nYoung people need help to prepare for employment. This should be seen as a vital element of every young person\u2019s education, and should remain a protected part of the Key Stage 4 curriculum.",
