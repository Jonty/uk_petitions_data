        "additional_details": "On the Gili Islands motorised transport is banned. Pony carts with a single pony are used. On one occasion there was a pony pulling a cart, driver, four passengers and their luggage. I don\u2019t need to express how inhumane this is, how unfair on the pony and how completely outrageous that it is allowed to happen. Temperatures reached around 35 degrees Celsius whilst I was there, the sun so hot that I needed to have a cold drink continuously to cool down, however, not once in my four days on the Island did I see a pony be watered. I want the Government to put pressure on the Indonesian Foreign Office to effect change for these ponies.",
