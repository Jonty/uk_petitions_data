Every child deserves the right to see their mother and father, correct? Family law courts are preventing loving fathers from seeing their child/children. Fathers have no rights.                                                        Mothers and fathers should be treated as equal and have the same equal rights, correct?  In the UK in 2015 men are not treated equal in family law.                                                                     A mother or father breaking a child access court order should face punishment, correct? At present women breaking court orders are not punished, a court order in family law is not worth the paper it is printed on.                 Sign this petition and lets change this out of date, sexist, child harming family law in the UK.  ",
