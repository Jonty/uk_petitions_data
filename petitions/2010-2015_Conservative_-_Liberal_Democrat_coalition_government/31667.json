        "additional_details": "People who fail to attend an ESA (sickness benefit) medical or return their questionnaire on time are often left for months on end with no statutory entitlement to any income.  Often their illness has stopped them from doing so.  They can appeal against their benefit stopping, but cannot receive ESA while waiting for the appeal to be heard.\r\n\r\nPeople who do attend the medical and are found 'fit to work', and appeal, do get ESA while appealing.  Those who cannot make it to the medical are often far more ill; it is unfair and irrational to leave them with no support and obviously makes their health even worse.\r\n\r\nWe request the DWP changes the ESA regs and allows people who are appealing their benefit stopping because of failure to attend the medical or return the questionnaire, to continue receiving ESA at the assessment rate.",
