Yet, they are forced to attend to 16 year olds who pass out through excessive drinking, frequent callers who refuse treatment, middle aged woman who have stubbed their toe. They also attend people who could quite easily drive to A&E or go to a walk in centre etc. This needs to come to an end, by calling out Emergency Ambulances to very minor incidents they are pulling Ambulances from the road putting lives at risk.\r\n\r\nAmbulances should somehow be able to fine people for abusing the 999 system.",
