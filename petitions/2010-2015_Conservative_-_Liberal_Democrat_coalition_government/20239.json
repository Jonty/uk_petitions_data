I beleive it's time to abolish Political Parties so that when you vote, you vote for an MP who's going to represent you and give you a voice, not follow what their Party, and more importantly their rich financial contributors, want to do. We want a referendum on membership to the EU, the parties have told us we don't. Let's show them what WE want, let's abolish the parties and make our own choices.",
