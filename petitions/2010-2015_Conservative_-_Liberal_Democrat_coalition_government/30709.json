        "additional_details": "I suggest that the 20th anniversary of the death of the late Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna be marked by the Bank of England with a special commemorative ten pound note (or \"Ayrton\", as such a note is currently known in cockney rhyming slang) to be issued in May 2014.  I realise that he's not British, but he lived here in his early career, and all four teams he raced for were British. Such a move may foster improved relations with Brazil.",
