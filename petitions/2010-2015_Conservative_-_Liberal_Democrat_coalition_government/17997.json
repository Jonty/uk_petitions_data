        "additional_details": "We need to stop the erosion of Christianity from our society due to legislation, policial correctness, and the European human rights act! A individual or small group of ethnic non-Christians who are offended by the wearing of a crucifix or the letters AD or BC being published for instance, should not have the ability to change policies either corporate or political to suit their request. Policies should only change for a majority rule. This kowtowing to minority groups is offensive to me and i suspect, millions of other Christians within our country, which only makes our nation and policial system look weak and submissive. I strongly urge you all to stop this apethy & write to our political / religious leaders to defend our national religion that has surived here since St Augustine brought it to our shores in 597AD, and reverse the disestablishment of our Christian faith.
