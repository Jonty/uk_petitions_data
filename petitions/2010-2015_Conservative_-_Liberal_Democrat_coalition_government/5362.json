        "additional_details": "Ban bonfires in the UK. They are anti-social, often toxic, dangerous, they damage the environment and are the cause of many neighbour disputes due to the ignorance and general thoughtlessness of the perpetrator. Garden waste should be chipped for mulch or composted. Plastics and other items produce toxic black smoke and are illegal to burn but the authorities are either too slow to catch them burning or too complacent. Bonfires ruin the enjoyment of people's gardens and the smoke seeps into the house. Why should anyone have to put up with this on a regular basis. We are not cavemen who need to create fire.....we have hopefully evolved into considerate people who care about the environment. A blanket ban cannot be too difficult........if smoke is seen on the horizon, fines are handed out. All this talk and expense on climate change and our carbon footprint.....why do bonfires not count?
