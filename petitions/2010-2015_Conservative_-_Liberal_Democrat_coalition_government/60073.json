Dimbleby controls the audience like a public school teacher. While the French, German's and Greeks, bring their country's to a standstill if their Government\u2019s try to change things.\r\n\r\nWe've had the same free market system for so many years, since the 80's, the general public know no different, even the positives of Europe are kept from us due to the right wing press and right wing biased BBC news.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any working class solidarity in Britain.\r\n\r\nWe want Question Time to be taken off the air.  Or privatised.",
