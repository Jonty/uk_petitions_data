        "additional_details": "Let\u2019s ensure criminals start to take accountability for their crimes through true consequences.\r\n\r\nI propose we introduce COMPULSARY PHYSICAL LABOUR in all prisons, a modern equivalent to old school \u2018hard labour\u2019. Prisoners should work a full working week of non-paid labour as part of their sentence, providing a service or goods to benefit society and the economy; there should be no exception.\r\n\r\n Luxuries to be removed from everyday living, this is prison, not a holiday camp; rewards may be offered for exceptional positive conduct, but LIMITED.\r\n\r\nThis will give prisoners a work ethic & motivation for positive behaviour, the best kind of rehabilitation a prisoner can hope to be given.  If prisoners learn work brings rewards, they are far more likely to succeed once released back into our society!! ",
