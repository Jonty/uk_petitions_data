        "additional_details": "I believe the best solution to the West Lothian question is the creation of a seperate, devolved, English Assembly with equal powers to the Scotitsh counterpart. Such a body would allow for greater legitimacy for Westminster, as then the Scots cannot accuse it of being biased toward English only issues when it would not discuss such things. The SNP would also be completely incapable of voting on English issues as they would not be a part of the body responsible for these. Such a move would avoid the issues levied against the current Tory proposals (that a Scottish PM would be impossible) whilst allowing the Prime Minister and the UK government to focus on issues that affected the entire Union. As such, the legitimacy and quality of Executive decisions should be greatly improved.",
