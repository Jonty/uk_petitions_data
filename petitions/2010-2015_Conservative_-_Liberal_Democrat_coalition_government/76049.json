The only one descent program they did have is top gear and with the sacking of Jeremy clarkson top gear is not worth watching, so I find my self asking why am I paying for a licence to watch BBC channels when there's nothing good on the? We need to stop paying to licence until Jeremy clarkson is re enstated.",
