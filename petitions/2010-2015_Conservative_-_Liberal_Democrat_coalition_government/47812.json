Yet the people of Nepal live in poverty and hardship. This is not the way they should be treated.\r\n\r\nThe people of Nepal deserve better! They deserve free modern health care, modern education for everyone, clean water and food, modern transport, better trade and agriculture, and homes.  What kind of friends would we be if we continued to give a blind eye to these people which have done so much for us while we allow thousands who do nothing into our country?\r\n\r\nI feel that the British government should talk with the Nepalese government to discuss and negotiate a way for Nepal to become part of the UK. Some may find this outlandish, but just because they are not right next to us does not mean nothing can be done.\r\n\r\nTalk to the government of Nepal, and arrange a referendum whether or not the people of Nepal wish to become part of the UK.",
