        "additional_details": "The BBC currently pays Sky TV \u00a310,000,000 annually to have their channels broadcast through Sky's system. The BBC's channels are consistently the most-watched on Sky's network. Thus, Sky should pay at market rates to broadcast these channels; without them, Sky would lose many of its subscribers.\r\n\r\nWe propose that Sky should pay \u00a3320,000,000 per year to broadcast BBC programmes, thus making up the cuts in the BBC's budget since the last general election and the costs of broadcasting the World Service.",
