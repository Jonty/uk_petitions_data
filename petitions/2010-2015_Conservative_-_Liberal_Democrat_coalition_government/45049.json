People are being murdered, raped and the worst part is, we are paying for them to survive. Yes there are debates against the death penalty but I'm not saying in every case it is required, but in some cases where it is certain that the party is guilty, why should they live? They have invaded someone else's human rights. Listen to the people. Listen to what we want.",
