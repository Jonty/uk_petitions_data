        "additional_details": "There appears to be a justifiable outcry towards the demise of the NHS in England, and the standard of nursing. I have nursed for over 30 years, and maintain ours is the best job in the world. We are, however, being perpetually demoralized by our governing body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council. We used to pay \u00a312 per annum for the privilege of working ourselves into an early grave. This suddenly shot up to \u00a375 / year, and this year, to fund \" an increase in fitness to practice referrals,\" we are now being invoiced for \u00a3100. That is a 25% increase for errant colleagues whom I do not feel inclined to subsidise. Our pay has been frozen now, effectively for 4 years.We cannot pay in installments, or pay a little until after Christmas to lessen the impact this bill is having. What is our union doing? Nothing. Mr Cameron, this is a disgrace, why do we not as a nation treasure our nurses? PLEASE can you challenge the NMC as to the moral & legal right to demand this money from us. Thank you",
