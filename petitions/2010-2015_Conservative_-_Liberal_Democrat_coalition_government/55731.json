        "additional_details": "Full time students currently are counted as unemployed for tax credit purposes, removing a significant amount of support from the families of mature students, especially childcare. The grant from student finance is only available to extremely poor families leaving those on incomes just above the limit struggling to pay nursery or childminder fees. I feel this is a significant barrier to education and aspiration and risks leaving people trapped in low paid jobs because they cannot afford to retrain. I urge the government to count study as work for tax credits and help those who are trying to help themselves.",
