(he's ok now)\r\nNot only is it unfair on the dog which will give their life for thier handler but also if a dog was to be injured so badly it could not work again on the front line it would be expensive to replace that dog and would be a waste of the dogs training.\r\nAll we ask for is for some protection for Police dogs against missiles, stabbings and bullets in the form of a vest as this country becomes alot rougher!",
