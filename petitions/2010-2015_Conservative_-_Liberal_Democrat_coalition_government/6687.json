They should face the consequences of their actions if they can't face them then why commit the crime in the first place? The public should be allowed to identify them so that they know whos who and who to stay clear of to protect themselves and to stop the criminal commiting other crimes. E.g- John Vennables- Not knowing who they are or what they look like after being given a fresh identity only creates worry for people and makes people feel unsafe. ",
