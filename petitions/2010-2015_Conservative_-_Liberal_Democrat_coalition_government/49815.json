However any working family including low income who are entitled to working tax credit top ups cant have a free place until the first term after the child is 3 years old and still have to go to work.\r\n\r\nI feel great give every child a chance, However I feel that it would be more beneficial to the parent if they could only have the free place if they used this time to get some education or sufficient traning to help the parent in the future get a job and lead by example. Unless they have a child under 2 or is disabled in their care which they need to care for.\r\n\r\nI feel the scheme is giving the child a great start, however giving the parents a better chance to get into work would be far more beneficial to the child in the long term.
