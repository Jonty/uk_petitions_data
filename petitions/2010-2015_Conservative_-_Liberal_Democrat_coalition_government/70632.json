        "additional_details": "The idea of ID cards was raised by Labour in 2004 and dropped due to the one off cost of \u00a36Bn. I was against this as I was worried about human rights. Things have moved on as our NHS is swamped, we have insufficient housing and jobs, we are threatened with terrorist attacks and are deluged with immigrants, many of whom are illegal but still can access all our services free of charge. The total cost of the above could easily be \u00a320Bn per year and I want the government to look again at introducing a fair system that is technologically sound and means that all law abiding citizens can only access benefits / NHS/ housing etc, by producing a card at point of service, This will ensure the needy who have paid in get the benefit which is how it is in most countries in the EU and the developed world. Carrying a card is a small price to pay even if it meant a one off cost of \u00a3100 to fund the project and would make me feel safer on our streets.",
