        "additional_details": "As many people may be aware the rules regarding students resitting the QTS tests have recently been changed. It is unfair to change the rules for trainees who have already started their courses. Now thousands of trainees are facing the possibility of owing thousands of pounds for their degrees but not being able to teach. Passing the test the first time does not make you into an outstanding teacher.\r\nAll we ask is that the government do not move the goalposts for trainees already engaged in training programmes.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of fair play we ask you to sign our petition so that thousands of outstanding trainees can progress to be outstanding teachers.\r\n",
