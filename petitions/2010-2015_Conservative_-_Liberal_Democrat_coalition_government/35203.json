        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe that an Inquiry should be opened into the tax affairs of the current elected Government ministers and the Conservative Party donors. It is widely reported that the current members of the Cabinet and donors to the Tory party may have exploited tax reductions schemes.\r\n\r\nThe current Prime Minister's father reportedly developed his wealth in offshore tax havens from which the current Prime minister inherited some of his wealth.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the extent of \"tax reduction\" schemes used by the current Conservative members and donors should be investigated and made public, so that the public are fully aware of the Moral financial standards of this Countries elected members and their supporters.\r\n\r\nThis will then help define the \"Moral Compass\" for the rest of the country.",
