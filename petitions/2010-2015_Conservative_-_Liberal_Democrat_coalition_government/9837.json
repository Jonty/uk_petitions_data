Car owners will only have to have their vehicles MoT tested once every two years instead of annually if new plans proposed by the government get the go-ahead.\r\n\r\nAccording to some car experts 'car technology has come a long way since the 1960s when the MoT regime was introduced. That\u2019s why we think it\u2019s right to check whether we still have the right balance of MoT testing for modern vehicles'.\r\nThe changes are also said to be an attempt to reduce the cost of motoring for drivers, with fuel prices soaring to record highs throughout 2011. I think this is a welcome change proposed by the government and should be full supported before we are priced off the roads completely.\r\n\r\nWe fully support the government want them to go ahead with the changes proposed to the Mot schedule from the current yearly to once every two years.
