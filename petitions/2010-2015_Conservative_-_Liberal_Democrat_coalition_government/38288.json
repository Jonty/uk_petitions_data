The denial of prisoners\u2019 pension rights is an issue about which we are increasingly out of step with the rest of Europe.\r\nThe only other exception used to be pensioners in hospital, but that has now been removed - leaving prisoners as the only section of society that has their pension right removed.\r\nThe NPC considers the state pension to be a right rather than a benefit and as it is currently based on a contributory principle, should be paid to prisoners according to their contribution record in the same way as to any other contributor.\r\n\r\n",
