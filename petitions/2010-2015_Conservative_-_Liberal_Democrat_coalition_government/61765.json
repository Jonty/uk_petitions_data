First Leeds fans got stabbed, then Arsenal fans, then Chelsea fans... Not to mention the trouble they caused for Manchester United, and a host of other teams in Europe.\r\n\r\nUEFA continues to let them get away with this appalling brutality, despite the fact ALL English teams were banned from playing in European competition as a result of Heysel. Galatasaray have received some very small fines, which have proved to be ineffective. UEFA need to act, or they are effectively condoning murder. Help us get the justice those dead or injured fans deserve!",
