        "additional_details": "Petition to make short selling of UK stocks illegal. Short selling of stocks in the UK causes instability in companies share prices. In many cases \u00a3millions can be wiped off the value of a company by coordinated groups of short sellers spreading misinformation and rumours, causing investors to panic and sell their stock.\r\n\r\nShort selling is already illegal in Germany, who pushed for a Euro wide ban in 2011.\r\n\r\nThis matter needs to be investegated, the current arrangement of the FSA investingating these issues simply doesnt work, infact the FSA has become largely redundant in protecting investors against illegal   rumours / misinformation posted on numerous investing websites.",
