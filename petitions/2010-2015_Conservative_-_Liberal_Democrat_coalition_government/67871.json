        "action": "Increase spending for the Army Cadet Force in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The Army Cadet Force, like all other Cadet forces around the UK, offer cadets (aged 12-18) a broad range of exciting, challenging, educational and adventurous activities, help them develop physically, mentally and socially. Some activities have a military theme, others have more of a community focus. The Cadet force has helped many children from deprived areas link with their community in a positive way and has allowed them to engage with their peers in a variety of team building exercises. Cadets work towards their Duke of Edinburgh's award, BTEC award and a number of First Aid certificates.\r\nNo young person should miss out on such a positive experience and with an increase of spending given to the ACF and RFCA would help ensure the future of the organisation and allow for more activities and opportunities for cadets.
