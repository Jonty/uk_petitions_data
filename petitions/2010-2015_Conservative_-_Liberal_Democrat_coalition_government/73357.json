        "additional_details": "When veterans are discharged from HM forces, unless they are allowed to return to the parents home, or for those serving for 12 years plus and for HM families, they often have nowhere to call home or in fact stay.  Many return and finish up living on the streets or some in fact turning to crime.  We want the govenment to allow the use of Sealand and other disused barracks for accomodation and also half way training facilities for veterans.  Barracks for the singles and ex married quarters for families.  The accomodation and units will be fully maintained by the users and volunteers and a charity will be set up to purchase materials and employ specialists.",
