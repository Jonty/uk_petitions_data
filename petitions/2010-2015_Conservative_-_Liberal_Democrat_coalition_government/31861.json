        "action": "Fair child tax credit for single income families",
        "additional_details": "Under the March 2012 budget, a family with joint income where both earners under \u00a350k will keep their child tax credit in full. Whilst single income families earning over \u00a360k will have theirs taken away.\r\n\r\nThis means some families will have a joint income of \u00a398,000 and keep their child tax credit in full whilst other families earning \u00a360,000 would lose theirs completely.\r\n\r\nThis just is not fair.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned request the government address this blatant unfairness by basing the assessment of child tax credit entitlement on entire household income.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is not fair that families with a larger combined joint income will keep child tax credits when single income families earning less will have theirs taken away.\r\n\r\nIf you feel strongly that both taxation and welfare should be based on fairness please sign this e-petition.
