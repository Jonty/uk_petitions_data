        "additional_details": "We call on the Ministry of Defence to prevent BAE Systems closing the Portsmouth shipbuilding yard. The yard is the last complex surface warship builder in England and a key national asset vital to the future of the Royal Navy. Government should place orders now for Offshore Patrol Vessels that the RN needs and would keep the yard working in the interim before work begins on the Type 26 Frigates. An order of AT LEAST 13 Frigates spilt between Portsmouth & Glasgow would then maintain the Royal Navy\u2019s surface fleet and would guarantee the yard\u2019s future.",
