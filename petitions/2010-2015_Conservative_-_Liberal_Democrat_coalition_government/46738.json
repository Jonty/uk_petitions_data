        "action": "BAN OF PLASTIC BAGS",
        "additional_details": "I think we should ban all free plastic bags at supermarkets, like many other countries have done, and leave the public no option but to bring their own when they go shopping. I believe in this strongly because plastic bags are extremely harmful to the environment, in production, in decomposing (over the course of THOUSANDS of years), and in the mean time disrupting countless habitats killing countless wild animals. Bags have the ability to be re-used endlessly, so there is no reason why harmful plastic bags should be produced on such a huge scale, used on such a large scale, and thrown out on such a large scale. It is such an easy way to contribute to setting the world back on the right track. Thank you. ",
