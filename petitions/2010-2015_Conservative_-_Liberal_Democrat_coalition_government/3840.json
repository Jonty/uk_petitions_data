        "additional_details": "Many would argue that the current government is doing a poor job. With a coalition in place and many M.P's back-tracking on promises (e.g: university funding) and a party which finished third in the elections with its leader as 'Deputy Prime Minister' change is needed.  There have been multiple spending cuts which have negatively affected the majority of the population and, as proven by numerous government polls, the current party in power is no longer in favour with the public. Therefore, I call for an election to be brought about earlier than 2015 as circumstances in Britain have changed since 2010.",
