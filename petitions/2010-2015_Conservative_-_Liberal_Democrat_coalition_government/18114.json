        "additional_details": "The Government should lift the ban on unsharpened Iaito/Iaido-style practice swords being owned in the UK without a specific licence\r\nI have been speaking to many enthusiasts in Iaido and Iaito, which are both martial arts that focus on the use of a sword. Many practitioners make use of -unsharpened- Iaido/Iaito swords. Also, people such as myself who more enjoy the sword itself than the arts, have thus found themselves unable to purchase an item that will often be ruined by sharpening it, and yet perfectly able to buy a legal full-bladed Katana sword. It is exceptionally difficult to hurt someone with one of these martial arts swords, and yet you ban them, on account of them being 'dangerous'. If someone were to kill someone there are any number of weapons they could use around the house i.e.: knives, screwdrivers, broken glass, all of which would be much more dangerous than one of these swords.\r\nThank you\r\n",
