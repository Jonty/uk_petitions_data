He drugs the boys and forces them to become child soldiers, he forces them to mutilate faces and limbs of his enemies. He uses the girls as sex slaves and forces them to kill their own parents. We want the UK government to take action and issue an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for his crimes against humanity. ",
