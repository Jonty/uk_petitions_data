        "additional_details": "In the face of grief unimaginable to most, Tariq Jahan demonstrated incredible dignity and stoicism in his message of calm, peace and unity after the tragic death of his son, Haroon Jahan. His powerful words, which helped to alleviate tensions not only within his own local community, but throughout the country, have hopefully averted the significant further pain and suffering that would result from a descent into senseless retaliatory violence.\r\n\r\nWe, the citizens of the United Kingdom, request that Tariq Jahan receive appropriate recognition from the government and parliament for his actions.",
