        "additional_details": "I am a law student who feels the law is very unjust in this area. I am tired of reading/hearing in the news every single day about the cruelty and abuse going on in our society.\r\n\r\nCurrently for animal cruelty the maximum fine is \u00a320,000/6 month prison sentence. I want to see this increased to an unlimited fine/2 year prison sentence.\r\n\r\nWe are supposedly a nation of animal lovers and thats why I am confident that we can come together and reach 10,000 signatures.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share this on Twitter/Facebook/Tumblr and get the word around.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
