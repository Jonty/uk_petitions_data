        "additional_details": "As a result of budget cuts local councils have began reducing general waste collections from 2 weekly to 3 weekly in Scotland which is not sufficient! Families with young babies and children in nappies do not currently qualify for an extra bin unless there are at least 2 children under the age of 3 within the same household.\r\n\r\nMost families who currently recycle already struggle to have their general waste collected on a fortnightly basis. Changing this to three weekly from March 2015 onwards as proposed would become a health hazard with nowhere to put additional waste! Please sign and show your support!  ",
