        "additional_details": "Many health professionals are not being rewarded for or able to utilise their experience in caring for patients in a senior clinical role, as the roles either do not exist, or are very sparse.  Some roles are also on a different pay band depending on what area/trust you work for- this is wrong and should be reviewed.\r\n\r\nDue to the current structure of the professions, those who wish to provide direct patient care are effectively 'stuck' at the entry level pay band.  This should be reviewed and those who bring with them experience, expertise and a true desire to provide direct care should be offered a genuine career path that fosters these attributes that are so central to providing an excellent standard of knowledable, experiential and dedicated patient centred care.\r\n\r\nThis is not a petition to increase pay, merely to make caring for patients a satisfying role, something to aspire to and something that Health Professionals are proud to say they do.\r\n\r\n",
