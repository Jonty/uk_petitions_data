        "action": "Stop government agencies from being able to claim overpaid benefits",
        "additional_details": "The government needs to give government departments  a maximum deadline of 365 days  to claim back overpaid benefits or monies of any kind, including child tax credits and working tax credits and DVLA fines for lack of insurance or tax registration regardless of the amount. They also should be banned from passing debt collection to private agencies as this costs the tax payer further amounts.\r\nIf at the time of asking a person or persons is deemed to be in hardship which would mean paying the fine would be difficult it should be scrapped entirely.\r\nIf the government can't issue money correctly then they should be punished for it and learn their lesson like everyone else does. Punishing the people for the mistakes of the government is wrong and unfair. It is just another way to punish poor people for being poor.",
