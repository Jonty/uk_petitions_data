        "additional_details": "Halton Borough Council (HBC) does not appear to represent its twin towns equally.  There is a heavy bias in favour of Widnes over Runcorn.  On its website, HBC highlights its successes in order as: the Widnes waterfront; 3MG; Daresbury Science centre; Stobart Stadium (Widnes); The Brindley (finally Runcorn!).  HBC are responsible for delivering a new shopping centre to Widnes, and a waste incinerator to Runcorn.  The two towns should be allowed to compete and go their separate ways adminstratively.",
