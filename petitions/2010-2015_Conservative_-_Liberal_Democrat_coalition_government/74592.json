        "additional_details": "\r\n\r\n The Yazidi women captured by IS are facing terrible situations as sex politicians of war. Over 3,500 women and children are still being held and abused.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes they brought girls back who had been beaten, injured. When they recovered, they were sold again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Janar\", aged 20, tells me: \"There was one 11-year-old girl. They beat her a lot. They gave her to one fighter and then to another one from Mosul. We heard that she killed herself later, in Mosul.\"\r\n\r\n \"The world has forgotten our women and girls. Where is the international military operation to free them?\"\r\n\r\nWe want our government to prioritise working with other global leaders to help free these women. We want our government to take action in helping these women and children as a matter of urgency. ",
