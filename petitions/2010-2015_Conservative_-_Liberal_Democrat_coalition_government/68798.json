        "additional_details": "The NHS is having their resources stretched, due to less and less funds every year, meaning they are dismissing more staff, paying the remaining staff less.\r\n\r\nMP's are being paid more just to argue, debate, tell us what to do and make laws.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand NHS staff are being stretched to the limit, being asked to do more for less, and they are saving lives, which surely means they deserve more. They should have the pay rises and be paid more, not the MP's.\r\n\r\nWe want the government to give the NHS more funding, so their staff can have pay rises like they deserve.",
