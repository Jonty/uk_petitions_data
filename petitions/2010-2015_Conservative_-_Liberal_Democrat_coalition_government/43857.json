        "additional_details": "A person over 21 outside London earning the minimum wage of \u00a36.19/hour and working a typical 37.5 hour week will earn \u00a312117.\r\n\r\nUnder current rules they will pay around \u00a3800 in income tax. If the minimum wage really is the minimum needed to live on then they should not pay tax.  This petition is to get the personal allowance increased to  \u00a312,120 so that everyone is only taxed on income in excess of the minimum wage. ",
