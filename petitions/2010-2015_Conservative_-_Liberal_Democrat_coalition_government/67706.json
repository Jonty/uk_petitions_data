        "additional_details": "The global rainforests are slowly dying. We consume materials from the UK in sickening quantities. The UK market is responsible for most of the global import trade in mahogany, which is in danger of going extinct. If this tree disappears, so to do hundreds of species. This includes species we still haven't even discovered. Do something to prevent this. Sign this petition and help us",
