        "additional_details": "We hereby request HM Government recognise Somaliland\u2019s (SL) independence for the following reasons;\r\n1. The union between the states was invalid because the treaty was not ratified.\r\n2. The Somali state perpetrated human rights abuses, illegal detention, torture, disappearances, extra judicial executions, & genocide which created the entitlement of a people\u2019s remedial right to self-determination under international law.\r\n3. In a referendum 66% of eligible voters participated & 97% supported dissolution of the union.\r\n4. SL satisfies the conditions of statehood & is entitled to the procedural right to self-determination.\r\n5. SL has had 2 internationally observed presidential elections declared as free and fair.\r\n6. On 7/7/10 PM David Cameron said \u201cI welcome the peaceful & credible elections in SL, it\u2019s an example of genuine democracy in an area of the world not noted for it\u201d.\r\n7. SL is stable but in a volatile region, recognition is the only way to safeguard that stability.",
