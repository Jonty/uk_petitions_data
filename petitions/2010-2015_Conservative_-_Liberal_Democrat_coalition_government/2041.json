Entry level workers are trapped in low paid jobs, and trying to survive on low wages whilst costs rise.\r\n\r\nWe would like the government to increase taxes for high earners to subsidise the NMW and look at other options which won't upset the fiscal balance - low wage workers are the backbone of our society - care workers, waiting staff, factory workers, cleaners etc.. do essential work which high earners benefit from so why should they forced to live on wages they cannot survive on.",
