        "additional_details": "There are plans to close the midwife led unit at Bournemouth Hospital.  Poole has inadequate provision for the extra women it will need to accommodate.\r\n\r\nDespite promises to give women choice this government are consistently standing by and watching Chief Executives of NHS trusts undermine midwife led units and then close them.\r\n\r\nMidwife led units have equal if not better safety statistics than consultant led units.  It is also cheaper for women to deliver at midwife led units.  So why are these units closing?\r\n(See the Birth Place study by Brocklehurst P. et al 2011 BMJ343:bmj.d7400.)\r\n\r\nWe as women ask the government to\r\n1. stop the NHS targeting women's services like this and to provide a safe comfortable surrounding for women to birth in.\r\n\r\n2. stop the closure of Bournemouth Hospital midwife led unit.\r\n\r\n3. Honour the promise for women to have choice, in Bournemouth.  (Maternity Matters, DOH 2007)",
