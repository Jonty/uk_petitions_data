(ESC)\r\n\r\nOur donation is taken gladly, yet we receive little or no thanks for it, to the point of abject humiliation. Donation ensures our automatic qualification, only for 90% of the voting countries ignoring their collated votes and giving accolades to their closest neighbours and those they're most closely affiliated politically with.\r\n\r\nThe ESC is no longer a 'song' contest. It's political back-slapping and party favours, to the point that EVERY commentator can easily predict who will favour who. The contest is a joke, and we desperately need the money at home",
