        "additional_details": "John Terry is to stand trial on a public order offence, related to racism. Although he has the right to be innocent until proven guilty, his general behaviour has shamed the nation and as captain, the circus surrounding his trial is distracting and unacceptable. With a European championship coming up, there is the real risk of many England fans turning on their team. Therefore, John Terry should be stripped of the captaincy and should not be allowed to go to the Euros. ",
