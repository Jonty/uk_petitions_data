        "additional_details": "The Price of travailing to work is to high and is only getting higher.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy the working public we should be able to add the cost of travel as a tax free deduction from the tax free allowance, meaning that only tax will be paid on amount. I believe that this the best solution as the high demand of travel prices is making it hard for hard working people to travel to work.
