This is very unfair !\r\nGold is valued over 1000.00/ounce, but silver is a viable option for people on lower incomes. Although industry uses silver, there's no VAT on copper pennies or two-pence, copper also used in industry.\r\n\r\nBoth gold and silver coins should become legal tender.  British currency has historically been known as 'Sterling' for good reason, and should be returned as such in addition to current coinage.  Germany is replacing Britain as the European home of 'silver'  with 7% vat and attracting local silver trading.\r\nFood and energy costs are rising higher than general CPI rates, and the tiny rates of bank interest available erodes British savings.  We need additional currency with intrinsic value and no charges.",
