We are campaigning to make sex education classes more frequent and make sure that teenagers and children are informed about sex.\r\nHere are some statistics and facts about the surveys we have done:\r\n-81% of the public agreed that more detailed sex education lessons would decrease the amount of teenage pregnancies.\r\n-On a scale of 1-10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest, on average people rated their sex education as a 3.7 in terms of sufficiency.\r\n-69% agreed that introducing the idea of sexual orientation in sex education would help deter homophobia.\r\nWe are hoping that by getting people to sign our petition the government can make sex education lessons compulsory in schools.",
