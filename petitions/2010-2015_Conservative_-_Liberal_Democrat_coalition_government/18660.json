        "additional_details": "I propose that research be made into putting people who are long-term benefits claimants, and who are able to work, be put to work in the local community, if they are unable to find work independently.\r\n\r\nI believe the advantage of this is that it will mean people are giving back to the community at no cost other than the benefits they already claim.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if people have been out of work for extended periods, I believe they become less employable. This scheme could be used as a means to give people the skills and motivation to find work.",
