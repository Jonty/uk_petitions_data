        "additional_details": "I am campaigning to raise the National Minimum Wage for Apprenticeships in the second year. I am doing this because the wage is currently not enough to live on - the Government do not understand that not every family has the money to support their child if they happen to become an apprentice. I am campaigning only for the second year to be raised - this is because by the end of the first year you should be trained in your role and there is no reason for you not deserving a wage. I am also doing this because if you have shown the commitment to stay within an establishment for a year, whilst earning \u00a32.65 per hour that you have proven your dedication to your position and you deserve enough money to be able to live.\r\n\r\nFrom personal experience - being an apprentice it is very difficult, more often than not I have to skip meals because I cannot afford to eat!\r\n\r\nThe Government has offered no support to apprentices, I think it's time to make a stand!\r\n\r\n",
