This is potentially unconstitutional and illegal under international law. The right to trial by one's peers is being eroded in the name of national security such that a politician can effectively render someone stateless on the basis of suspicion without going through due process.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government should ensure that any plans to remove citizenship can only happen to those with dual citizenship following the conviction of a serious crime and not merely based on suspicion.
