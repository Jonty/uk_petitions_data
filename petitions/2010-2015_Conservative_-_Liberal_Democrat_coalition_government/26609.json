A person claiming benefits for over 6 weeks will be listed with this department and placed were ever possible with with a local business in line with there skill set. Placements will be free to the local business on a short term basis with only travel cost of the claimant to be refunded by the business and placement should be compulsory to A claimant in order to receive benefit.\r\n\r\nI believe this would benefit local small businesses in the uk.\r\n\r\nI believe this would benefit claimants by keeping a work patern in their lives and dispelling the something for nothing generation.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.
