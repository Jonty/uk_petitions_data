We believe that this will\r\na) Significantly improve congestions around schools by reducing the use of cars at the start and end of the school day.\r\nb) Make the home to school journey safer for those children currently expected to walk down dangerous roads.\r\nc) Help family budgets in these economically difficult times.\r\nd) Enhance the freedoms of young people by allowing them to learn independence and become better citizens.\r\ne) Reduce the cost of family travel at the same time as increasing the use of public transport and consequently reducing pollution.\r\n ",
