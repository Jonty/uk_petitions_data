        "additional_details": "I the undersigned believe that HM Government should fund the purchase of a new royal yacht to mark Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee to celebrate Her Majesty\u2019s service to the nation., Who has led us through all the challenges that this nation has endured since Her Majesty\u2019s coronation. Through austerity and crisis in war and in peace Her Majesty has been a symbol of calm reassurance around which our great nation has rallied no matter the challenge. I believe that we must honour that sacrifice in this moment that tests each and every one of us we should remember that austerity is no stranger to us we met that challenge and we will do so again. As we prepare for London 2012 we will show the world our very best. We did in 1948 and we may yet do so again. The diamond jubilee is a singular opportunity for this moment will never come again not in 4 years or 40 years, no matter how much we spend or cut we have one opportunity to leave a lasting legacy.",
