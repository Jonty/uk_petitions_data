One has even threatened me with arrest for trespassing if Jobcentre Plus sends me to them. I am calling for the government to sanction Work Programme providers who refuse to accept persons sent to them by ending their contract to provide the Work Programme. There cannot be one rule for the unemployed and another for Work Programme providers.",
