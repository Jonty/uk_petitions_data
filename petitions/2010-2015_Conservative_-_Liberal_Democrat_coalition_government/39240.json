Currently the voting cards simply state how to get to the voting station. We the undersigned believe that voting cards should contain more information on how to take an active part in the political process.\r\nAt a minimum, this should include details of how to stand for election yourself. It should also include links to a website where, once the list of candidates is known, details of candidates' manifestos, biographies and prospective public appearances will be available.",
