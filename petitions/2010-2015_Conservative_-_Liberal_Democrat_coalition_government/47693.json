        "additional_details": "The Government passed the responsibility for the rules regulating sheltered housing to local councils, and gave them the authority to charge their own rents and service charges. The first action all the providers did was to withdraw resident wardens, and leave the tenants having to pull cords attached to a local emergency office. We want the authorities to return to the previous arrangement as tenants are falling ill, and in some cases dying due to the lack of a warden on site who can deal with the problem on site. This is what the tenants were promised on moving in to this type of housing. ",
