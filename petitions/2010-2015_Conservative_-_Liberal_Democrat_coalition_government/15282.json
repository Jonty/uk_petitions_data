        "additional_details": "Dealing with noisy neighbour complaints places a substantial strain on police, local authority and housing association resources. This is due to people playing music and televisions at excessive volumes. This petition requests that all TV and audio equipment for domestic usage (excluding nightclubs etc) have a maximum volume not exceeding 60 decibels. This will make it impossible for people to subject their neighbours to obscene amounts of noise",
