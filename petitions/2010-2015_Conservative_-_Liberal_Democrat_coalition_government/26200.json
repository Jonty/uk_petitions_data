These numbers are exploiting us and there is no refund availability. Parcel delivery services leave cards and when the number is called, you are charged a lot of money on your telephone bill. If you reply to an advertisement with an 0900 number, the print is too small to read how much we are being charged. Protect your public - Government!",
