        "additional_details": "Spend more on stopping illegal immigrants entering the country (maybe out of the aid budget?). Increase border patrols and get more manpower and better equipment for border police. And spend more on catching illegal immigrants once they have entered the country. Make new laws that allow illegal immigrants to be deported immediately and not allow them right of appeal unless there is a probability that they will be harmed, and then examine this thoroughly. Repeal the law that says illegal immigrants are allowed to stay if they have been here 10 years.",
