        "additional_details": "The state of IT education in the UK is diabolical. As a 13 year old, I shouldn't have to teach a lesson because the teacher has no IT education. Most of my year don't even know any fundamental IT skills. Also, I have personal friends and peers who are given IT lessons, which they have spent 16 weeks making a PowerPoint about the history of computer games. NOT VALUABLE!\r\n\r\nThis is not OK. I have been trying for more than half a year to get this sorted and it is ridiculous that not 1 thing has happened. I need something to happen.\r\n\r\nWhat Do I Want?\r\nI want EVERYONE to have better IT knowledge and maybe even qualifications.\r\n\r\nPolitical parties such as UKIP have mainfestos that aim to create more jobs.Here's an idea, give the 95% of people that will have a job involving IT skills those skills. It's not all the foreign people. It's Education that is to fault.",
