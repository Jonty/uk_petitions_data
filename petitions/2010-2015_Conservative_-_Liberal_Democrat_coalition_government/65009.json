Government should put pressure on any council found to be not implementing actions to raise the number of properties in their area. This would have a considerable effect in stemming the current trend in house price rises and drive down private rent costs.\r\nIf this doesn't happen soon we will have three generations of a family living in one property. In other words, we will go BACK 70 years in living standards!",
