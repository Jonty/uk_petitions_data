        "additional_details": "A requirement for the equalisation of local authority grants based strictly on the head of population. For example there is a disparity between the central government grant paid to different London councils.    The annual budget for some East London boroughs is made up of two-thirds grants from central government and the remainder is made up from Council tax revenues.  Conversely, the opposite is the case at Kingston where about a third comes from central government and the bulk comes from local residents.  This means that Kingston residents are taxed at a higher amount because the council receives a lower subsidy.",
