        "additional_details": "Danny Hulme was one of the gang who targeted Sophie and her boyfriend in a park in Bacup in 2007. The couple were attacked because they were goths. He is now out of prison and allowed to visit Rossendale, where the attack happened.\r\n\r\nSylvia Lancaster exclusively told ITV News that an official broke the news to her last night. She is incensed because she was assured that Hulme would not be permitted to return to the area for at least 10 years.\r\n\r\nSophie died after two teenagers stamped repeatedly on her head, as she tried to protect her boyfriend from an assault.\r\n\r\nHulme was convicted of grievous bodily harm against Sophie's boyfriend.
