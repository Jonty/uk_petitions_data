        "additional_details": "Current internet access to many public records, such as marriage, birth, death certificates, etc is via third party organisations that charge a fee to the public for such access. Public records are already paid for and maintained by public taxation; they belong to the general public; the general public should not have to pay again to see these records. I propose that all such records should be freely available to the general public via the internet and that the current profiteering by third party organisations should be made illegal.",
