        "additional_details": "In the USA there seems to be a great movement that may undermine womens' basic human rights to health and safety and alarmingly, it is much ignored by the media.\r\n\r\nI would ask that Mr Obama, Mr Cameron, and other ministers to now draw up a law - one simple law - that will protect women in this area.\r\n\r\n(If it's not that simple, then of course as many laws or clauses as are necessary).\r\n\r\nAs an example:\r\n\r\nOne state recently ruled that women should miscarry a dead baby in the womb naturally, as farm animals do - they will not be granted an abortion.\r\n\r\nThere are also concerns that the new US Personhood bills will make a situation where women who are raped or are medically unsuitable for pregnancy will not be granted an abortion. Campaigners have spread to the UK.\r\n\r\nIf the situation is not as grave as underground media reports suggest, then I request a public announcement from our leaders on this issue and a strong commitment to keep an eye on the situation.",
