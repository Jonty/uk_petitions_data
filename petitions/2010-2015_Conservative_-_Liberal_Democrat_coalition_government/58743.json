        "additional_details": "Change back the motorcycle restriction laws back to how they were before 2013.\r\n\r\nThese laws have put a lot of new motorcycle riders down and have turned a lot of potential motorcyclist away as it will cost even more to get their test.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the matter is why are they stopping motorcycle riders from getting on bigger bikes and not stopping car drivers ?\r\n\r\nWhat's the difference?\r\nWell if you got onto a 1000cc motorcycle and crashed, 9/10 times it'll be the rider that gets injured the most. But you would allow a new driver to go out and buy a 4 tonne landrover that when colliding with another vehicle could potentially kill someone instantly, or they could go out and buy a Bugatti vayron which tops out at 255 mph, where as a 1000cc bike on average weighes 175kg and has a top speed of 195 what's going to cause more damage ?\r\n\r\nAll I'm asking Is for the laws which were set in January 2013 to be taken off and put back to how they were or to make it fair and restrict car drivers.",
