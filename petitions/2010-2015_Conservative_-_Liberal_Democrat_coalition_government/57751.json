The dedicated staff there are trying their best to be successful but with a profit driven company in charge they have no chance.  It's time to admit as they have with the South Yorkshire cluster and HMP Wolds that it's ownership should be returned to public control.  Termination of the contract and return to public control should commence immediately.",
