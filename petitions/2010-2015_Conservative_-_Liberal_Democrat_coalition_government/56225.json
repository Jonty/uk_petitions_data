These fame hungry, celebrity wannabes and their followers are ruining it for the silent majority.\r\nAt the last home game against Liverpool on 19th October, 2013, a small group of about 120 people caused major disruption in the City Centre. This organised protest not only caused public highways to be closed off to the general public, but they also had to be policed at no doubt, great expense to the tax payer.\r\nThe group have since gone on to say on their Facebook page that this is only the beginning, and further disruption is planned ahead of future home games.\r\n\r\nWe, as real fans, call on the Government to prevent these people from causing further harm to Newcastle City Centre and NUFC, by not allowing the protests to continue, or at least send them the bill for policing the events.\r\n\r\nMuch Appreciated\r\n\r\nOn Behalf of Real Fans\r\n\r\n",
