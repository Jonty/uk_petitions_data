        "additional_details": "We must also remember that most humans gladly eat animals and harvest the by-products that derive from their slaughter or cull. Animal protesters must recognise the importance of the need to study and understand in detail the effects of potential new drugs on a multitude of complex biochemical and pharmacological processes on appropriate animal models.  Utilising animals bred and kept alive for the development of potential new drugs, may be even more essential than having to slaughter or cull animals for food. Animals bred for the sole purpose of experimentation are often kept in less cruel conditions than if these animals were to be living wild, fending a living for themselves.",
