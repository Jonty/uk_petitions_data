        "additional_details": "Barry George's recent bid for compensation was quashed by the Appeal Court affectively suggesting that he was not 'innocent enough' of the murder of Jill Dando despite the fact he was acquitted in 2008. Police took all his possessions, which have never been returned to him, & Barry lost his home & all trace of his life after he was convicted in 2001. He has been hounded by the police ever since & has had to make a new life away from the harrassment. Barry deserves compensation. He is an innocent man & was just a scapegoat for the investigations due to his vulnerable nature. Police are still not looking for Jill Dando's killer!",
