        "additional_details": "Only 36-38% of the public voted in the recent local & euro-elections which is frighteningly low, despite a slight increase since the last one. I believe changing voting days from a Thursday to a Saturday or a Sunday to allow people easier access to get along to their polling station and vote. The UK are the only EU country to vote on a Thursday & most other countries have much higher turnouts. ",
