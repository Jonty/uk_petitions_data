        "additional_details": "We are concerned with the fall in 18-24 year olds voting in elections.\r\n\r\nMany young people leave school without understanding the basic principles that our political system is based on in the UK. Many feel disenfranchised and alienated from Westminster.\r\n\r\nVoter turnout is dropping since 1997 and no action has been taken to halt the decline.\r\n\r\nWe propose that secondary schools should teach politics at a basic, unbiased and impartial level. But what should be taught? :\r\n- The role of Parliament\r\n- Voting for the first time and the right to vote\r\n- The political parties\r\n- How Governments are formed and operate\r\n\r\nThe Government should implement a policy for Years 10 and 11 (15-16 year olds) to spend one hour every other week learning about the British political system.\r\nPerhaps then the next generation may leave school able to participate in politics and political debate.",
