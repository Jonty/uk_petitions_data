We are british citizens, we refer to british trade, talent etc. team gb olympics but we are defined as living in the united kingdom. Its not united anymore, we have devolved scotland, wales so why cant we either  refer to our country as britain or just go back to england. How can we have national pride when we dont even know what the name of our country is. Politicians refer to britain all the time. How can we be taken seriously on the world stage when no other country knows how to refer to us? Britain or United Kingdom, what are we?",
