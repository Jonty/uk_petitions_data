        "additional_details": "In attempting to tackle the 'corroding' influence of online pornography and the misogyny it allegedly creates, David Cameron plans to coerce every household in Britain connected to the Internet into declaring whether they want to access pornography. \u2018Extreme pornography\u2019 is to be outlawed also.\r\n\r\nAside from obliterating online privacy, David Cameron is equating child pornography to that of legal (but non-mainstream) material online. While child abuse online should be completely removed, an indiscriminate filter is not the right idea. David Cameron is cynically using paedophilia rhetoric to gain support for the filter and ban without understanding what he\u2019s actually proposing. There has never been any evidence of a link between violent pornography and the sexual violence David Cameron thinks he\u2019s tackling. The move is an empty gesture, allowing Cameron to appear as though he\u2019s handling the issue of misogyny, but without actually addressing the real problems or causes.",
