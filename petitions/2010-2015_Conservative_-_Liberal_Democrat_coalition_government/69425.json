All rehoming centre's must have a staff member that has been trained up to a national standard in order to carry out assessments on dogs before rehoming can take place. Home visits must be made before potential adoption applicants can be considered.  Personal information regarding employment, financial situation and family members with special measures put in place where children are concerned.  Rehoming centre's must have dogs for a period of one month before adoption can be considered in order to fully check out the dogs background along with  national guidance in dog temperament assessments.
