        "additional_details": "Compulsory, Selective Housing (to-let) Licence schemes run by Councils claiming to reduce Anti-Social Behaviour, drunkenness, dog mess, poor housing, Health & Safety breaches, illegal car parking etc.,etc.\r\n\r\nThese compulsory \u2018Licences-To-let\u2019 allow Councils to compel landlords to evict accused tenants, or loose their \u2018Licence-To-Let\u2019.\r\n\r\nAdequate laws and regulations already exist to cover infringements. However, duplication does not stop Councils imposing \u2018Licenses-To-Let\u2019 schemes and charging hundreds of pounds for each \u2018Licence-To-Let\u2019 they impose.\r\n\r\nSo far, no positive reports of success have been reported.  But, more and more Councils are getting in on the Selective Housing Licensing act, as it produces extra income for Councils. Also - it pushes up costs and rents of  rented accommodation. Plus, creates Anti-Authoritative, attitudes and behaviour.\r\n\r\nPetition The Government Now\r\nto repeal Selective Housing Licensing.\r\n\r\nThank you for your support.\r\n",
