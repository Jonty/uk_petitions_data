        "additional_details": "Each year, seriously ill people die because various sects of evangelical churches tell them to give up their medication and trust in God for healing.\r\n\r\nMost recently, six people have died from HIV after the  Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in London told them that God had healed them. To quote from the recent article on Sky News:\r\n\r\n\"The healing process involves the pastor shouting over the person being healed for the devil to come out of their body, while spraying water in their face.\"\r\n\r\n(Source: http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16117269)\r\n\r\nWe who have signed this petition want the outright ban of this dangerous practise, and from any section of the church or churches from performing these healings anywhere in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nPeople die each year because they have their faith used as leverage to get them to give up necessary and life-saving medication in favour of church-based healing.",
