If the expat leaves the work, without securing another sponser and a new situation, they must leave the country within one month with the sponsor being responsible for the repatriation costs.  The sponsor must pay for housing requirements, education of children, if any, and other than basic health services. It is my considered opinion that such a system should be evaluated by the Government for non EU citizens and introduced in the UK.    ",
