        "additional_details": "A United Nations report in 2006 found that livestock cause 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. However, the environmental group World Watch says this was an underestimate and the figure for meat and dairy's share of total greenhouse gas emissions is a staggering 51 per cent. The digestive processes of animals and animal slurry both release methane gas, which is 23 times more powerful at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. Huge areas of the Amazon are cut down, which releases carbon dioxide, to grow animal feed crops. Animal manure decomposition, and fertilisers for the vast amounts of animal feed crops, create nitrous oxide gas, which is 296 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I would like the government to subsidise animal-free food as it is more ecologically sound than meat, dairy and eggs.",
