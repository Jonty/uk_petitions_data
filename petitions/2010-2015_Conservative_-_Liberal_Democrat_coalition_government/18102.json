        "additional_details": "Our government is being forced by the EU to abandon procedures that keep our island rabies free.\r\nEurope insist that, from January 2012, pets can enter the UK from 26 EU Member states just 21 days after vaccination. The incubation period is approx. 35 days. 9 of these countries are classified as HIGH RISK. THE CHANGES WILL AFFECT US ALL AND OUR PETS - NOT JUST PETS COMING FROM ABROAD. Change is good - this is madness. Why are so few aware that this is happening? We are a group comprising of worried Vets, Professors, Doctors, Rescue & Quarantine kennels, animal lovers & owners who are hoping to lessen the impact.\r\nOur government has twice fought, and won the right to \u201copt out\u201d of the new regulations. Why has it stopped fighting? We call on our government to rekindle the fight so that all concerned parties may be consulted, all options explored and the public made fully aware of how any changes will affect them. KEEP RABIES OUT OF THE UK\r\n",
