        "additional_details": "There has been recent widespread discussion (in newpapers and ex-pat websites) about the government's intention to deprive early retirees to France, of the limited period of Health cover currently obtained via the S1 scheme. This change is considered likely to come into force as early as April 1st, 2014.\r\nThis is (like the recent changes to women's State Pension entitlement dates), just another example of \"moving the goalposts\" and will, if it is allowed to go ahead, cause real hardship.  People who have actually paid in for years to a system, in good faith,  should be allowed to benefit from it, wherever they are living in the EU ! Healthcare contributions should be fully portable once one reaches the age of 60.",
