Many cyclists are berated for a riding practice that is endorsed by both Government and road safety campaigns (eg Bikeability, National Standards and IAM Cycle training).\r\n\r\nI propose that drivers should be taught more about how to drive around cyclists (how to overtake safely and why, how to read the road more effectively, not overtaking on blind bends or into oncoming traffic, that cycle path use is not compulsary etc).\r\n\r\nThis will lead to better drivers and safer cyclists.",
