        "additional_details": "The court system must not be allowed to become private. Under these plans they would be funded by big business and the financial sector. What protections would there be against abuses by big business if it funds the court system? If privatised, courts would lose all authority and so operate as private tribunals. An independent court system is one of the cornerstones of a free and fair society. These plans threaten us all and must be opposed to the very end.",
