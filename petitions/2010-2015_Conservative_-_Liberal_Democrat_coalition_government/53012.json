        "additional_details": "The right to free and independent legal advice at the police station has somewhat been corroded recently. In many police stations legal represententatives are prevented access to the custody area, which in turn prevents legal representatives makiing representations to the custody officer and prevents individuals having legal advice on charge or when answering bail. More worryingly legal representatives are now being asked to have consultations in rooms which are divided by a glass window, these rooms are not sound proof and prevent legal advisors from having proper access to clients or obtaining instructions.\r\n\r\nThe ministry of justice is urged to take action and allow legal representatives access to the custody area in all police stations and allow consultations to take place in consultation rooms which do not restrict access to clients.",
