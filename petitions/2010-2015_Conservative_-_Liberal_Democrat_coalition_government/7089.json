        "additional_details": "The new fee structure planned for 2012 means that the large majority of students will lose 40% of income  above \u00a32100 pa (20% income tax, 11% NI, 9% loan repayments) for most of their working lives And they are being pressured into saving more for their pensions.  This is unsustainable, and when it becomes apparent, young people will opt out of university education.  If the country needs graduates, its taxpayers should pay for them, just as they pay for schools, roads, police etc. etc.",
