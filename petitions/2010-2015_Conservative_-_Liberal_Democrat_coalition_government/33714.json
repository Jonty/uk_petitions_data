        "additional_details": "The Early Years Foudation Stage is a curriculum for the under-fives. The goverment has made changes to the EYFS, by setting less learning objectives for children to achieve, in order to minimise paperwork.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no set way of doing paperwork. Every setting does their planning and observations in a very different way and some methods can be very time consuming. In many settings carers are spending less time with children, and the governments efforts to reduce paperwork may well be in vain.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose a standard format for planning and observations, covering the planning for individual children, and for whole class activities.\r\n\r\nOne piece of paper a week for each child, and one for whole class work, is all that's needed, and time consuming linking is unnecessary and can be vastly minimised. A nationwide planning format will reduce the work carers have to do and cause children to have more time with their carers. Everybody wins.",
