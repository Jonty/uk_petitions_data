        "additional_details": "I find it very shocking that you have applied a rule for certain uk citizens who travel to Syria with certain charities or those that feel the plight of the people and go to fight with rebel groups should be charged with terrorism offences on their return to the uk. I understand the British govt is allies with bashar al Assad regardless of his barbaric torture and murder of the Syrian people.\r\n\r\nHow is it possible then that Britons who enlist to join the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) under the Mahal programme are not subject to the same legislation when they return to the UK.\r\n\r\nLord Carlile said the law did not prevent British nationals from fighting for regimes Britain is friendly with.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the same rule applies to UK citizens who go to fight with the IDF  and the immediate intervention of this uk govt on forcing the Israelis to stop this slaughter.\r\n\r\n",
