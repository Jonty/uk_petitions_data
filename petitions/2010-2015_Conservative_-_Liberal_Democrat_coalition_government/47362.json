        "additional_details": "I have 23 years\u2019 experience as a senior nurse and a charge nurse; I mentored student nurses. I qualified as a group analyst and hold an MSc Psychology and a BA (hon.) Counselling. In 2012 I was fired and was told that I failed to meet the minimum requirements of a junior nurse. I worked to a high standard but I also advocated for better nursing standards, patients\u2019 safety and better treatment of nurses.  I am not the only confident, experienced nurse to suffer such a fate but others  fear victimisation. The fear is real because I have not worked since being fired and I am in danger of having my house repossessed because no one is willing to employ me as my reputation has been tarnished.\r\nSo, I am calling on the government to investigate any private Health organisation that victimises its employees for whistle blowing, and by investigating my current situation the government can use it as a case study to learn about the short falls in the current system.\r\n",
