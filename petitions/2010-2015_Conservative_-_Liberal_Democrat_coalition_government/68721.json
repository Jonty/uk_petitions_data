        "additional_details": "Next year train fares are set to rise by 3.5%. Rail companies have an option to increase this by an additional 2%, meaning some fares may rise by up to 5.5%. Since the coalition government gained power in 2010, rail fares have increased by over 20%, whilst wages have risen by just 6.9% in this time.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is this extra money being spent on? Rail infrastructure and train services are as unreliable as ever. I don't see how this money is improving services. I would like the government to actually let us in on the secret of what this extra money is being spent on?\r\n\r\nI am proposing a cap on rail prices. Why should they rise even more when services are standing still, trains are increasingly congested and wages are not rising to reflect the increase in prices?\r\n\r\nMillions of us rely on trains so we have to pay whatever price the government sees fit, but if we take a stand against this we can stop these ridiculous price increases.",
