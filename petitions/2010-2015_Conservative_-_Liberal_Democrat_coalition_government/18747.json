        "additional_details": "I am a recent graduate with a strong computational science degree, I also have two diplomas and no criminal record living in one of the poorest areas of Britain.\r\n\r\nI refer to the enterprise allowance scheme.  I want the red tape to be removed for graduates so job seekers (those forced to claim JSA) need not wait 6 months for financial help starting up a business when faced with grim job opportunities and low morale.\r\n\r\nFor those of us who are motivated, we need not wait six months and it is evidently counter productive for those of us who are genuine.\r\n\r\nIf you the government want economic growth, remove this regulation and give me and others like me the stability we need.  You'll get it back in tax, just give us the chance to innovate.",
