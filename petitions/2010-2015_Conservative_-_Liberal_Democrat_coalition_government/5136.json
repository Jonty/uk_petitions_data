        "action": "Require All Dog Breeders To Have a \"Licence to Breed\"",
        "additional_details": "This petition is inclusive of individual dog breeders & large organisations, such as Puppy Farms. There is presently little to no legislation requiring dog breeders be trained, educated and monitored in the breeding of dogs. Many dogs are breed purely with profit in mind, often at the detriment of the mother's own welfare and the puppies she produces. Many breeders do not understand that they are inbreeding (pedigree), and often the overall welfare of these dogs is not looked after; constantly in pup, under nourished, their psychological & physical wellbeing is ill regarded, & they are used as cash generating \"machines\".\r\nBy requiring all dog breeders to obtain and pay for a license, we must require them to undergo (& pay for) a mandatory training and education route in dog breeding (leading to the aquirement of a licence to breed), helping them understand *all* the issues of dog breeding (specific to the dogs and wider issues for the community).",
