        "additional_details": "As a representative of a large community of motorcyclists we have often pondered as to how the accident rate of motorcyclists can be reduced without creating additional budgets or funding for the local departments\r\n\r\nThe driver theory tests for new drivers lack information and education which could prevent motorcycle and indeed cycle related accidents. The implementation of a few extra questions into the test which are contained within the Highway Code would give new drivers the ability to become aware of motorcyclists and cyclists, more so than the current questions, which contain very little or no reference to motorcyclists or indeed cyclists.\r\n\r\nWhilst motorcyclists appreciate they only account for 1% of vehicles on the road they are far more likely to receive serious injuries or be involved in a fatal accident due to a drivers ignorance.\r\n",
