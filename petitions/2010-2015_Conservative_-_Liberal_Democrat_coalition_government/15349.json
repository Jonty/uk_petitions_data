        "additional_details": "The British Government is making a number of proposals to reduce immigration to the UK via the family route.  One of the proposals is to introduce a minimum income threshold for sponsoring a spouse or partner to come to or remain in the UK. Simply put, if someone does not earn enough money they cannot legally have their wife/husband and thus family join them to live in the UK. This policy would privilege wealthy applicants, while discriminating against low-income/unemployed UK citizens.\r\n\r\nThese proposals set out to challenge Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, by making wealth a priority over love and  the respect for family life.\r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to bring to an end such proposals, and consider the devastating impact such income based forms of discrimination have upon all family members.",
