        "additional_details": "I wish to petition the government for excessive taxation of company car drivers.  I intentionally chose a low emission car to reduce may tax bill, but it is still increasing.  The government must stop INCREASING the tax on company car drivers when the value of the asset they are taxing is actually DECREASING.\r\nMy cars list price was \u00a327,000.00.\r\nIt will sell after 3 years for \u00a311,00.00 (est).\r\nA loss in value of \u00a316k yet the tax in the last week of ownership will be substantially more than it was on the first week.\r\nPlease sign this partition.\r\nThank you.",
