        "additional_details": "While it is illegal to urinate in the street, there are not enough public toilets in most areas, their opening hours are not sufficient and they often charge an entry fee. This situation is unacceptable. It is also unfair on those people with medical conditions who need to use the toilet more frequently than others.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n1. Public toilets will be numerous, situated conveniently, regularly cleaned, free to use, and open all hours.\r\n2. Toilets in public buildings (for example those in train stations, coach and bus stations, shops, pubs and restaurants etc.) will also be free to use.\r\n3. It will be illegal to charge a fee for use of any public toilet.\r\n4. All newly built public buildings (such as those listed above) must include a free to use public toilet.\r\n5. All toilets must have disabled access.\r\n\r\nUsing the toilet is a natural act and should be treated as a human right, not a privilege!",
