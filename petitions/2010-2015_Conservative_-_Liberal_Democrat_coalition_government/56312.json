        "additional_details": "The students of England petition for the government to re-asses and debate Student Finance England and how it is run. There are many issues in the running of the company that consistently effect student life. Delays in payments, losing of paperwork, inefficiencies caused by poor data handling, misinformation passed on by poorly-informed staff, constant failures in the web page, premium rate phone numbers for students that cannot afford it, lack of email contact for the company, uninformed staff, lack of consideration of personal circumstances, no follow up from staff, lack of staff, no emergency funds for students even though the delays are student finances faults. These only cover a few of the issues with the running of Student Finance England. We urge the government to discuss in depth the future of Student Finance England and to action new initiatives to fix a company that is clearly not fit for purpose.",
