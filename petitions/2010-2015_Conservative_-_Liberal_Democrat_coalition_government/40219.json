        "additional_details": "I believe that pedophiles should be given longer sentencing, for the sexual offences they commit against young children. I want the ministry of justice to look into starting a review to look at they way pedophiles are sentenced. I am a victim survivor of sexual abuse as a very young child, and the man that abused me was only imprisoned for nine months to me that's not justice at all. When i think of my case I dread  to think how many other pedophiles have fell through the system and got away with what they have done to young girls and boys. And because of this I think that all child sex offences should be reviewed again and a change be made in the law.\r\n",
