        "additional_details": "Barbed or Eyed hooks should be banned for the following reasons...\r\n\r\n1. Many Anglers do not carry the correct apparatus for removing the hooks out of fishes mouths.\r\n\r\n2. It doesn't give the fish a fair chance to escape the catch therefor affecting the level of integrity in the sport.\r\n\r\n3. Hooks are not removed correctly which harms the fish and can sometimes lead to death.\r\n\r\nSo I would like the government to take action by doing the following:\r\n\r\n1. Ban the retail of barbed hooks. Any Tackle Shop found using them should be punished, a way by doing this could be by closing the tackle shop down or fining the owner.\r\n\r\n2. Any Angler found using them should be banned from fishing, TOTALLY (Weather that be Saltwater or Freshwater), have all equipment confiscated and a fine should be issued.\r\n\r\nSo please the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs take action against these in-humane hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
