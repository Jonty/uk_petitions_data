        "additional_details": "In regards to my petition, my aim is simply for the government to make changes in the health sector. Hospitals need to make alternative arrangements for parents who suffered the tragic loss of a child through miscarriage or stillbirth and not have them placed on the same wards as mothers who have just given birth. I am aware this will be costly but feel it is something that needs amended urgently as its highly insensitive and more support is needed for those who lose a child. ",
