This will then go on file and be kept there, unless the case is dropped.\r\n     This is no light matter, our DNA codes for who we are, it is our blood. Why do they need such power over petty-crime one-off offenders, caution holders or fine holders?\r\n     You wouldn't let them take your arm? Your leg, even? Surely not even a finger? So why do we accept a system that gives them more than all of the above, the code of who you are and your lineage? Stand up for the right to have pride in your coding, your ancestry and dignity as human who is equal to the authority, not below it. Always remember the phrase, nothing strengthens authority as much as silence.\r\n    Destroy all DNA samples of non-criminal record bearers and petty-one-off crime offenders.",
