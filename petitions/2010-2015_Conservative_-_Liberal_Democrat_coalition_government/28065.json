        "additional_details": "Kent county Council has decided that you must now register births and deaths in your local library or Gateway. If you have just lost a loved one the last thing you might want to do is wait in line with people wanting to take out a book, scream and shout about a benefit claim or sit amongst a large open area full of screaming parents and children, or worse. Births are generally a happy ocasion but deaths are generally a time of terrible sadness. How calous then that KCC have no thought for peoples feelings at this, their most vulnerable time. STOP IT NOW and go back to the humane approach we had before. also this change has caused a 20 day waiting time. Totally disgusting. Do KCC think so little of the people of kent?",
