        "additional_details": "Terminally-ill teenager Stephen Sutton, on learning that he was dying, did not sit around feeling sorry for himself. Instead he courageously set out to raise a few thousand pounds for other people with his illness. In the event he raised over \u00a34,000,000. He remained cheerful and optimistic to the end. He deserves a posthumous award of the highest order to be collected by his family.",
