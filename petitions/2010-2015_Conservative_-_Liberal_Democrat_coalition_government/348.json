But I object very strongly to the way in which is has developed over many years without the consent of the electorate. I do not believe anyone expected it to become what it is today.\r\nWe should have a referendum on our continued membership now, offering a choice of:\r\n 1. not changing anything\r\n 2. leaving and determining our own future\r\n 3. completely renegotiating the Treaty of Lisbon after extensive consultation of the British people.\r\n",
