        "additional_details": "That on behalf of the English Majority in the British Isles the present Government for the British extend to the people of Ireland as a whole an apology.  This should be an apology of a general nature and not only for all the iniquities and injustices perpetrated by the English on the Irish over the years but also for failing to do what any Government choosing to call itself a British Government must.  This is to deliver Government for the British in a form with which all the British can be content. Irish violence towards the English and those others of the Irish who are perceived to be the allies of the English has always been reactive violence and the longer it takes for the English to confront and acknowledge their culpability in and responsibility for the difficulty in Ireland the longer will its resolution be.",
