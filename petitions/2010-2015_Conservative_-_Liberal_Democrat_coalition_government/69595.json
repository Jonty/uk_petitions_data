Scotland already gets more government expenditure per head than other parts of the UK. This to a country that its own government claim is prosperous enough to go it alone.\r\n\r\nCreated in the late 70s, even its creator says it is now unfair: In The Scotsman in January 2004 he wrote, \"It was never meant to last this long, but it has gone on and on and it has become increasingly unfair to the regions of England. I didn't create this formula to give Scotland an advantage over the rest of the country when it comes to public funding.\"\r\n\r\nSo - this should stop now.  There are parts of England, Wales and Northern Ireland more deserving of the money\r\n",
