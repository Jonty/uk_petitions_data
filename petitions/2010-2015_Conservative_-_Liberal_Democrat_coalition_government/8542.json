        "additional_details": "Following the disgraceful scenes across the UK, the police should be armed with paintball guns to control rioting and disorder.\r\n\r\nThis would allow them to \"mark\" trouble makers, whilst offering a deterrent less dangerous than plastic bullets. The paint or ink inside these paint balls should be of similar stuff to the dye contained in securicor boxes ie cannot be cleaned off and unlike any recreational paintballs the public could purchase.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has been paintballing will know you can get a fair few bruises and welts from being hit. But the main consideration should be a means to clearly flag up trouble makers to arrest ie the ones covered in the paint / ink at the time or when the crowd starts to disperse.",
