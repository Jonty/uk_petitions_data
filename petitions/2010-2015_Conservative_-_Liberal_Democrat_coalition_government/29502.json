        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe that the system of Taxation and Tax Credits should be overhauled to make it fair and equal for all families. The current system where there can be vast differences in the tax burden depending on whether just one or both partners work is totally unjust. It penalises families with only one parent working as well as single parent families. The tax system should be changed radically so that it is based on taxation of Family units rather than individuals, to provide more equal taxation for different family circumstances. ",
