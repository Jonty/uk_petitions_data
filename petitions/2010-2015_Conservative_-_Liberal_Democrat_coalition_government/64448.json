        "additional_details": "Many people in rural situations are experiencing extremely slow, broadband speed and some of these people also work from home and rely on the internet for their business. It is appreciated that BT are currently working on installing fibre optic lines  but some areas will not have this service for a further two to three years but in the meantime we are expected to pay the same broadband costs than our town cousins. Surely it is not unreasonable to expect a reduction in charges for a reduction in service. We would petition that broadband charges should be in line with the speeds received ie@ up to 5mbs one price 5-10mbs another and over 10 another. The government should impose restrictions on the monies allocated to BT until this matter is resolved.",
