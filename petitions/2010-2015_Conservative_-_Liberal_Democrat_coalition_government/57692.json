        "additional_details": "Over the last few years there have been disturbing cases of the hounding, bullying and murder of vulnerable adults and people with learning difficulties.  The most notorious cases have included those of Fiona Pilkington and her daughter Leicestershire), David Askew (Greater Manchester) and now the murder of Bijan Ebrahim (Bristol).\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Department of Communities and Local Government to ensure that vulnerable adults and people with learning difficulties are housed in safe accommodation where they can live without fear of harm and free from anti-social behaviour.  We also demand better support in the community for vulnerable adults and people with learning difficulties and tougher sentences for those who harass, bully or make them subject to physical or mental abuse.  We further demand that all complaints of such behaviour be taken seriously by the police and acted on immediately.",
