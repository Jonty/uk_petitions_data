        "additional_details": "Lorry and truck drivers often hold up traffic and are a major cause of congestion on our motorways. How many times has a lorry just pulled in to the middle lane you are in  and as a consequence you have either had to jam on your brakes or pull over in to another lane? By imposing  an extra tax on the middle lane for vehicles of over 3 tonnes in weight the numbers of slow moving vehicles in these lanes will reduce and will also help to pay for the roads that they are ruining. It will also alleviate the congestion on the motorways and make them far safer.",
