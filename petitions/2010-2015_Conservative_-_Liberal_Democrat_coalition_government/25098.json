        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, propose that a multiple of the national average wage be established as a fair maximum pay level. A tax rate of 100% should be applied to income levels beyond that threshold.\r\n\r\nInsititutions have consistently failed to regulate excessive pay to their executives.  The govermnent says that legislation is not the way to control excessive pay; insititutons and shareholders are responsible.\r\n\r\nAs these positions are failing to prevent executive pay increasing to obscene levels, the goverment should control pay by the tax system.\r\n\r\n",
