        "additional_details": "Nurses and midwives have to pay a fee (currently \u00a376) to the Nursing & Midwifery Council every year to maintain their registration to practice their chosen occupation. Although this is an allowable expense for tax relief, I believe that the fee the NMC charges is too high currently.  The Department of Health should ask the NMC to reflect upon the fees charged, look internally and see if there are other ways of cutting costs.",
