Positions within the College would be appointed by ballot among its members, on a 5-year electoral cycle.\r\n\r\nThe remit of the College would be to represent the interests of children through the professional development of their teachers. It will champion and disseminate evidence-based research, advising teachers on ways of implementing and adapting practice to ensure the best educational outcomes for pupils. It will form policy in line with these findings and manage the accountability structures of inspection and reporting to parents.\r\n\r\nThe leadership of the College would be democratically accountable to its members and to the Secretary of State. However education policy decisions should remain the remit of the College.",
