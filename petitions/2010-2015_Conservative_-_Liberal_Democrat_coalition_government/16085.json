        "additional_details": "Latex allergies are becoming increasingly common. One of the often ignored side-effects of this is the inability to use Latex Condoms. This means that sufferers and their sexual partners must use other, often less reliable methods of protection, refrain from sex altogether(even when in committed, long term relationships), or run the risk of STIs and pregnancy by not using protection at all if they are unable to afford Latex free condoms which are often prohibitively expensive for young people and those on low incomes.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, would like to ask the department of health to take measures to ensure that poly-urethane condoms are made available to people with Latex allergies on an equal basis as Latex condems by, for example, regulating the price to the same range as Latex condoms, making them available on prescription, and making them available through sexual health clinics and sexual health teams for free where Latex condoms are available for free.",
