This petition therefore calls on the Government to:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tImprove brain tumour diagnosis by integrating guidance on identifying the symptoms and patient referral into General Practice and Emergency Medicine Practice guidlines\r\n\r\n\u2022\tincrease the proportion of cancer research spending on brain tumours beyond its current 0.7% and ensure that at least 7.5% of adults with primary brain tumours are enrolled in randomised, controlled clinical trials.",
