        "additional_details": "Facebook is now regularly allowing graphic posts on its site of people who are alive, being beheaded. It appears to be a South American thing and the scenes are extremely graphic and very disturbing. The content would never be approved for adult viewing, however young people are regularly viewing this material on Facebook. Unfortunately it appears to have been targeted at young people who use Facebook, in particular. Facebook has a history of not bothering about the content. LET\u2019S STAMP OUT THIS VIOLENT GRAPHIC BEHEADING PROMOTION THROUGH FACEBOOK BEFORE MORE AMAGE IS DONE TO YOUNG, VULNERABLE PEOPLE!",
