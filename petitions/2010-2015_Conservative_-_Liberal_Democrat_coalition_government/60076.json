        "additional_details": "In professional football why can one individual come into a club and change, a club\u2019s colours, name and general identity? Football clubs, in part, belong to the people who support them, take the supporters away and you have nothing. The business morals of modern day professional football do not take into account the needs of the supporters or the communities they serve. Football business should be played the same way as the game is intended to be played, which in turn the supporters are part of. Therefore, this e-petition has been put forward to ask the government to support the protection of the rights of supporters. When a club is sold, supporters and the club should be protected against changes to name, colour changes or any other area of the business that leads to a fundamental change in a clubs identity. When a club is sold supporters should have the right for a refund on season tickets purchased. Any takeover of a club should include consultation with its supporters.",
