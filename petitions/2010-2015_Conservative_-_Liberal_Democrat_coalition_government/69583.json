        "additional_details": "Insurance for younger drivers (under 20) is outrageously high for example a 17 year old will have to pay on average \u00a33000 a year for just third party fire and theft. This is in turn is demotivating younger drivers from taking there test or even taking out insurance which is a criminal offence. Many young people are driving cars without insurance and being penalised for this however what can one expect with such high insurance premiums? This is an important issue that needs more attention I would like to see the government campaign to the insurance companies to reduce the cost and possibly subsidise part of the cost. ",
