        "additional_details": "Hattersley situated near Hyde has been without a decent internet connection for at least 7 years now, with the same speed throughout.\r\n\r\nThe exchange for Hattersley is at least 3.5 miles away (Asda in Hyde) which is an extremely long way for ADSL to travel.\r\n\r\nWe receive 1 - 1.5 mbps on a good day, which in turn means we have to share the internet, one at a time. This is rather ridiculous when people can be receiving up to 100 mbps in other nearby areas. We feel this is a good enough reason to need fibre optic.\r\n\r\nIf you receive similar speeds, live in Hattersley and desperately want a quicker internet connection. Help support this E-Petition.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
