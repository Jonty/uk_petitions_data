My Aunt, for example, wants to send money to every charity because they send pens, address labels, cards or raffle ticket books, which, although not requested by her, she feels she must pay for.\r\n\r\n\u00b7\tCompanies monitoring purchases pass on information to third parties, who ring, speaking very quickly, and not allowing the recipient to ask questions or clarify the purpose of the call, trying to sell goods or services.  My Mother thought she was being watched, or that her finances were being stolen 'on line', as a result of such a call about wills.\r\n\r\nGovernment Action: Legislate against unsolicited sales phone calls;\r\n                                  Regulate contents and appearance of unsolicited mail.\r\n",
