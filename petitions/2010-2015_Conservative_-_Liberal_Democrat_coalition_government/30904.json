        "additional_details": "The VED costs should be reviewed and adjusted for rural UK. Nearly all people who live in rural areas have difficulty getting to or from Doctor's, Dentist's, Hospitals and Shopping. Public transport is not sufficient or cost effective to serve everybody, All journey's made are essential which will usually include  a weekly shop and other errands. These are  planned to maximise fuel efficiency. The average journey to and from work is around 30-60 miles a day. We don't buy 4x4's for a status symbol but a form of transport for the winter months whereas the city dwelling versions. Of 4x4's are used mainly to  take the kids to school less than a mile away. Yet we still pay the same VED and Fuel. The measly 5p a litre is an insult to people who rely heavily on their vehicles as a lifeline. especially as at today's date the duty is sitting at 58 pence per litre on both Unleaded petrol and Diesel. how can you charge both Tax and VAT on fuel.
