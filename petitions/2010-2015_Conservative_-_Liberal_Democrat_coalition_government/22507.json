        "additional_details": "For the collective wellbeing of the nation, Sunday should be returned to a 'day of rest'.\r\n\r\nThe way that modern business operates makes the term 'weekend' meaningless for a significant proportion of the population, and can make it extremely difficult to spend quality time with friends and family at home.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, many salaried employees are, in practice, compelled to work beyond their contracted hours, and this can often mean working for less than minimum wage, with no significant time for rest and recuperation.\r\n\r\nThe government should consider passing legislation that discourages all businesses from operating on Sundays. It should also legislate to allow all employees in both the public and private sectors to have Sunday off work by default, except where doing so poses a risk to our national infrastructure, national security, or law and order.\r\n\r\nWe believe that the economic costs of such legislation would be far outweighed by its social and health benefits.",
