The Labour government promised to re-nationalize the railways but nothing happened and the Conservative government is happy to watch commuters suffer the rising costs and over crowded carriages and instead be greeted with unwanted high speed railway lines.\r\n\r\nI state that we should persuade the government should re-nationalize the railways so companies such as Virgin World cannot exploit the public to enjoy company values of  a predicted 2.2 billion pounds. This will eventually give us a more enjoyable and affordable method of transportation.",
