If ISIS are to continue in their acts then surely it would seem logical to increase the size of the regular service personnel so we can stop threats that are right at our doorstep. Saying that we are facing a \"troop shortage\" and then increasing the recruitment age of the reserves to 50 is unacceptable, and surely we should stop ISIS from killing more civilians across the world. Increasing funding and pay will not only increase incentive to work for the armed forces as well as decreasing the unemployment however, then we can protect our people from outside threats, Europe is not the biggest issue outside of our borders. Long live the Queen.",
