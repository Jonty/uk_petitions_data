So that other more deserving shows might get a chance. It gives people false hope of a singing career when they cannot sing and has got to stop. The only winner is Simon Cowell and even he doesn't want to be on it anymore. Bring back 3-2-1, or the Price is Right. Something! Anything even YouBet, I liked that. Not this rubbish please do what you need to do. You know it makes sense.",
