        "additional_details": "Teenagers who want to drive should pay car insurance like every other driver. The problem is that they have to pay in excess of \u00a35000. This is far too much for a very large majority to afford. All teenagers should have to pay normal adult premiums which are around \u00a3350 - \u00a3450. If they even have a small accident because of dangerous driving the the limit should be lifted but teenagers that respect the law and drive carefully should not have to pay the price.",
