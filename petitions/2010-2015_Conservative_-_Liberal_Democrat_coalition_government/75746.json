As the form stands: Part 4 of the Children Act 1989 states:The grounds for the application are that the child(ren) is suffering or is likely to suffer, significant harm and the harm or likelihood of harm is because the child is:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tnot receiving care that would be reasonably expected from a parent, or\r\n\u2022\tis beyond parental control\r\n\r\nI want a new entry box in Section 4:  has complex medical and/or psychological reasons.\r\nThis is a neutral and no blame approach to the breakdown where parental love and devotion are not the issues.\r\n",
