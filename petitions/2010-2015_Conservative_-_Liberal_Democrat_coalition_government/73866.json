If he has any balls he will put it to the electorate whether he should attend or be empty chaired.  In my view his contribution will be the same, whether he is there or if he is not there, TOTALLY IRRELEVANTLY and this is because NOBODY with a brain in this country CAN believe anything which comes out if his mouth.",
