        "additional_details": "Since the cuts to Legal Aid, fathers and mothers alike have been put into a situation where they cannot afford to fight for contact with their children, meaning millions of children will go without a relationship with their father.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons as to why legal aid should be brought back to support absent parents (Fathers) in making applications to the court for access and/or to reinforce a court order. Some FACTS:\r\n\r\n> 95 per cent of people think fathers are important to children\u2019s wellbeing.\r\n> 1 million children have no meaningful contact with their fathers.\r\n> Extensive research conducted for Rules of Engagement 207 showed that 76 per cent of children and young people in custody had an absent father and 33 per cent an absent mother\r\n>Analysis of 4,000 young offenders by the Youth Justice Board found that 70 per cent were from non-intact families.\r\n\r\nChildren need fathers and fathers NEED legal aid to assist them in gaining and reinforcing contact.\r\n\r\n",
