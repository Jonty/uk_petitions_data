        "additional_details": "I would like to see more bins on the streets of London. Since 1988 bins have been kept to a minimum in the capital as they are seen as a risk for hiding bombs. I would like, 24 years on, to think we can come up with a way of solving this? For example; a erected metal ring with a transparent plastic bag for rubbish, so all waste can be seen?\r\nI urge the government to spend some of our money on providing the capital with more waste disposal options. Litter is a continuing problem in the capital and I find it a disgrace that money is being spent on sending people out to fine those littering, rather than provided them with the resource to stop.\r\n",
