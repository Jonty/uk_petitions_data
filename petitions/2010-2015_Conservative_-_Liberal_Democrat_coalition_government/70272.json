        "additional_details": "The People's History Museum in Manchester faces a \u00a3200,000 gap in its budget due to government funding cuts.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reasons for the cut it is crucial to sustain funding for this museum. At a time when the government is keen to tackle extremism with a focus on the importance of liberty and democracy, the People's History Museum provides a rare example of a museum representing the fight for these values in Britain itself.\r\n\r\nFunding for museums already disproportionately favours London, it is vital that we ensure that a vibrant, informative regional museum which offers key educational insights into the lives and struggles of ordinary British people can continue to operate at its current level of excellence.\r\n\r\nFurther information:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/people-s-history-museum-funding-settlement-letters\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/museum-says-pacifist-exhibit-on-first-world-war-led-to-funding-cut-9763339.html",
