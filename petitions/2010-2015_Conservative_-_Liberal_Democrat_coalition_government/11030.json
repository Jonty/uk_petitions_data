This is totally unfair to at least 65% of the population. As a \"Non Guardian Reader\" l am totally unhappy about my licence fee going towards all these Journalists and Reporters large wages and pensions. I want a debate in the commons about \"BBC Journalists and Reporters to represent the whole of the TV licence paying public\". I do not buy a Guardian newspaper so I do not contribute to their wages or pensions.\r\nI hope the outcome would be that the BBC are forced to employ Journalists and Reporters from all sides of the political divide.",
