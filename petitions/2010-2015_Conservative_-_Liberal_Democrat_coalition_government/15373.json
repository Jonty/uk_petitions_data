The EEA is for free movement of: goods, services, people and capital. EFTA countries run their own: agriculture, fisheries, home affairs and justice. The EEA is economic not poltical. Britain is already part of the EEA, so switching could be done in weeks. EFTA countries include, Norway, Switzerland, who have unemployment rates of around 3%. New regulations per year would fall from 1000 a year to 300 as an EFTA member. The EEA does not cover taxation, so any new EU taxes would not apply to Britain as a member of EFTA/EEA. EFTA has free trade agreements with other countries, including Canada. EFTA has an office in Brussels and a website.",
