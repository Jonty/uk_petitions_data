Ministers have listened to local government and removed the ring-fencing of grants, which will allow local authorities greater freedom to direct funding in the most effective way and give local people the best service possible.  Removal of ring-fenced funding is designed to increase local flexibility by enabling authorities to respond to local needs and priorities.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition remains open to signatures and will be considered for debate by the Backbench Business Committee should it pass the 100 000 signature threshold.",
