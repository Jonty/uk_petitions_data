        "action": "Proposal for union with France including shared citizenship",
        "additional_details": "On 10 September 1956 French Prime Minister Guy Mollet arrived in London for talks with his British counterpart, Anthony Eden. He proposed a union with the United Kingdom. This was quickly rejected. I want the government to consider unifying with France to create a strong nation which would be economically, militarily and culturally resilient. The union would benefit both countries, and would make a new great power. The combined economies of the United Kingdom and France would be able to drive forward environmental progress and renewable energy, as well as improving assistance to the developing world. I strongly urge the government to pursue all avenues to achieve this goal.",
