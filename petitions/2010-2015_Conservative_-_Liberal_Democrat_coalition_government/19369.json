        "additional_details": "Under the Road Traffic Act 1988, section 170, it is a legal requirement to report any road accident which causes damage to any animal which is not on or in the vehicle involved. The definition of 'animal' however does not include cats. Currently only dogs, horses, sheep, cattle, pigs, goats, ass and mules are included.\r\n\r\nNew Start Cat Rescue, a Gloucestershire based cat re-homing charity believe that this Act should be amended to include cats.\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that cats hit on the road can be dealt with appropriately and perhaps in some cases, prevent fatalities. Cats are peoples' possessions, their loving pets and part of the family. We strongly believe that this Act should be amended.  ",
