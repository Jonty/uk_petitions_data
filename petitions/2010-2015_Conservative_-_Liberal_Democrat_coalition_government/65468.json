        "additional_details": "amyl nitrate, butyl nitrate and isobutyl nitrite also known as poppers are sold in many bars around the uk mainly gay bars and clubs, This stuff maybe like fun at the time but can cause serious damage and mixed with alcohol may result in a visit to A&E especially if a person has an unknown heart problem, They are sold as an aroma to get around the laws but as many people know they are abused and sold easily in bars and clubs\r\nI want to petition to get the sale of them from bars and clubs to reduce the risk of self harm under the influence of alcohol.",
