        "additional_details": "Tougher jail sentences and larger fines must be introduced for people who perform the most heinous crimes against animals and deliberately cause them unnecessary suffering. A minimum term of 5 years imprisonment should be introduced for the most serious crimes against animals, such as torture, inflicting serious physical harm, causing prolonged suffering or for causing death due to mistreatment or neglect.The maximum limit of \u00a320,000 for fines should be increased to \u00a350,000 so that the severity of the crime can be reflected in punishment of the criminal. The recent story of two men who inflicted the most horrific injuries on Maggie May highlights just how inadequate the law is in terms of protecting animals.
