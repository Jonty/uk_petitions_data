If need be call the police for back up. Better communication between all departments, less red tape, but more clearer understanding of their duties. This must be country wide, not different in each county. If need be contact people like myself with experience in the foster care system to help with planning new procedures. The rules must be the same and stronger punishments for the criminals. ",
