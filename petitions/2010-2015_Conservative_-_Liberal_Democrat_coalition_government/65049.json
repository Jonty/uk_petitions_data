        "additional_details": "Ever since Nick Clegg fell back on his pledge of not raising university fees, students have felt disheartened by the colossal \u00a39000 per year rate.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this petition is to ask for a review on the real changes these fees have made. Many students feel that these fees are extremely unjustified; with most universities charging 3x more, however the quality and delivery of courses remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe government regulates large firms, like the heavily scrutinised 'Big 6' within the energy market, to avoid price collusions and maintain customer welfare; whilst allowing universities to triple prices without any justification.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you feel it deserves some recognition.
