        "action": "THREAT TO PRIVATE SECTOR PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS - EDM: 2446",
        "additional_details": "A decision made by the previous Government in April 2009, to allow the Post Office to provide digital ID pictures for Driving Licences, and possible future plans for the Post Office to be able to provide digital ID photos for Biometric Residence Permits and passports, is putting 5000 private sector photographic high street jobs directly at risk at a time of economic uncertainty. The result of this action is not only the loss of the professional service provided by the professional private photographic networks, but ultimately the closure of private sector high street photography shops. The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons reconsider this decision and allow co-existence for the provision of printed ID photos, through the use of scanners in the Post Office, which would allow a sustainable business model to develop for the Post Office whilst also being compatible with the private sector professional photographic networks and the petitioners remain.\r\n",
