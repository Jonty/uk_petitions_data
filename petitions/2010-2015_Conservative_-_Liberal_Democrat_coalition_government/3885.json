        "additional_details": "Seeking the repeal of the relevant legislation that allows private (for-profit) companies or organizations to issue penalty charge notices and undertake other related activities (such as wheel clamping and the removal and impounding of incorrectly parked vehicles).\r\n\r\nThe police should issue fines and carry out the activities mentioned above in place of the current system where private companies are contracted to do this work.\r\n\r\nThe role of the traffic police will be extended to fulfill this purpose; their numbers will be increased. The overriding objective of traffic policing should be to keep the traffic moving safely, NOT to bring in revenue. Fines should be issued as a last resort.\r\n\r\nThe government will bring in legislation to terminate all contracts with private firms engaged in parking enforcement activities. No compensation will be paid to the companies presently under contract.\r\n\r\n",
