        "additional_details": "Parents deserve help to be able to afford school uniform for their child.\r\n\r\nThe Government should make school uniform more affordable by introducing a salary sacrifice scheme where parents exchange a small part of their monthly salary for school uniform vouchers.\r\n\r\nThis will not only help parents to budget for back to school time, it will make uniform more affordable because salary given up will be tax exempt.\r\n\r\nThe scheme will be available to all employers and employees who wish to opt in, with vouchers redeemable at all participating retailers, in much the same way the childcare voucher scheme works.\r\n",
