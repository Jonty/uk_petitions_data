This is to be achieved by:\r\na. separating out retail banks from investment banking arms;\r\nb. investment banking profits to be used to reduce the national debt;\r\nc. increasing the number of retail banks and running them as mutual societies where profits are equably shared by all staff and customers\r\n",
