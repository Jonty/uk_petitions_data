With an ongoing trend happening, and the children continuing this and never working, as they copy their parents, this behaviour is growing exponentially.\r\n\r\nIf child benefit was limited to two children, the number of CSA claims a female can have is limited to one; this way of life would not be made so easy, reducing anti-social problems and government costs.  As there would be less CSA claims and less benefit payouts, without infringing anybodies human rights.\r\n\r\nNo other country has such a generous benefit system!",
