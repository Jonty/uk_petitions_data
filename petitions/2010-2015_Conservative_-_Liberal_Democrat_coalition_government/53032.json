        "additional_details": "Due to the government deciding that online porn should be blocked \"by default\" by our ISP's, we would like see that the Daily Mail website is included in this blacklist, as its website depicts hundreds of images and articles that are unsuitable for children.\r\n\r\nThe side-bar of the Daily Mail website is packed with nearly naked women in revealing bikini's, and stories of a sexual nature. These images and stories are easily accessible by our children and to allow the block to come in to place without the Daily Mail website being on the blacklist would undermine the whole idea behind the block in the first place.",
