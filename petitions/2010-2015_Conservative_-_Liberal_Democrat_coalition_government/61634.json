        "additional_details": "Public space is no longer a place of democracy but is instead oversaturated with mis-informative adverts that invade almost every aspect of our daily lives.\r\nThe wealthy elite buy up urban spaces in the form of billboards and present to us their own corporate interests, to  continue consuming. Adverts will often use images that attach unrealistic ideals of happiness to commodities and present them as factual. This is a form of manipulation to consumers as it creates desires for products they do not need. This encourages people to spend money they do not have, thus causing unnecessary debt.\r\nBuy legalising public art, this will spark an increase in artistic activity that is both democratic and arguably more aesthetically pleasing to look at. Moreover, some of Britain\u2019s best architecture is being hidden beneath huge billboards such as the majority of Piccadilly Circus in London which has buildings dating back to the eighteenth century covered in chaotic adverts.",
