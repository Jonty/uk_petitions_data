        "additional_details": "I feel that positive discrimination is racist. All people should be treated equally based on merit not on quotas for hiring or because they are part of a section of society. If a person is hired because the are transgender or otherwise, not because they are the most suitable candidate then that is racist. If a caucasian person is arrested and fined for making a comment about a religion and yet an asian man can walk free for the equal comment then that is also racism. Instead of encouraging resentment and envy make all laws and rules apply to each person eaqually.",
