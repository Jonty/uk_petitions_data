        "additional_details": "The reporters writing articles on the BBC website repeatedly use the term \"The Gulf\" to refer to the body of water south of Iran. They claim this is because it is the only neutral term they can use, given the name of the body of water is in dispute. Given that every single document and map recognised by an international organisation refers to the body of water as \"The Persian Gulf\", it is clear that the correct term is \"The Persian Gulf\". Surely the infinitely neutral term is the correct term?\r\n\r\nThe BBC should be made aware of this gross oversight and be pressured to use the correct term: this is not a matter of politics, but a mere case of knowing one's geography. Afterall, how many of us cross the French Channel to get to Calais?",
