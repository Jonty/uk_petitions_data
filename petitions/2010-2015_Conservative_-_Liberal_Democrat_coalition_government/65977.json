        "additional_details": "The Government plans to remove this popular and academic A-Level as they feel it is too similar to Theatre Studies, despite the fact that since film was introduced in 1895 it has become a vibrant and significant art form. Despite the need for modern students to engage with visual media this reductive measure will harm their potential to develop analytic skills relevant to modern society.\r\nThis petition is designed to make the Government reconsider and recognize the value of studying one of the worlds most significant art forms and media.
