        "additional_details": "Classical Studies (encompassing Ancient History, Classical Civilisation, Latin and Greek) has been a cornerstone of education for many years. The subjects create an appreciation of a number of different disciplines, including politics, philosophy, linguistics, drama, Religious Studies, analysis of source material, art, architecture and literature. The studying of Classical Studies, even at a rudimentary level in schools, will help foster a more autonomous approach to learning and help display the links between subjects across the curriculum.\r\n\r\nI propose that the government seek to impose a simple framework for Classical Studies in the National Curriculum in a trial run initially, before extending nationwide.",
