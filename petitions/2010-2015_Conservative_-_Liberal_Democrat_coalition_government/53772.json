        "additional_details": " in July 2012 my sister was killed by a landslide in Bridport, Dorset whilst on holiday with her family had they seen the sign they wouldn't of gone and she would still be here at the time there was only one small mention of rock falls on the main sign showing other information  and this sign was near just one of many entrances to the beach. thus not being the entrance my family used\r\npeople are un aware of the danger and are constantly walking past the signs  under the constant falling cliff. there was at least 5 rock falls from august to September of 2012.  on a recent visit we visited the beach and from the main entrance of the beach  you could see  new piles of rocks I am petitioning for more and clearer signs around the beach and the surrounding areas to warn people of the dangers. that way if people choose to take no notice of the signs then that is their choice but at least there will be enough signs to make sure they are at least will of seen them.
