        "additional_details": "Charlie and Megan who built their roundhouse in Pembrokeshire have been issued with a two-month demand to demolish the building by the planning authorities on the basis that, bizarrely, the home \"benefits of the development did not outweigh the harm to the character and appearance of the countryside\" which is quite strange because many modern industrial developments take place in the countryside and are not refused on the same basis. As can be seen from this picture http://naturalhomes.org/img/charlie1.jpg it is far less of an encroachment on the countryside than many modern developments and therefore the objection is unfounded. We would like to see the demolition order withdrawn.",
