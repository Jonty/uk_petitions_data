Propaganda and to drown out the voices of smaller parties and individuals.\r\n\r\nCurrently, most  \"donations\" are given to the only 2 parties that have a chance of forming the government.\r\n\r\nForcing parties to spend according to their means, i.e. income from their membership fees (which should also be limited to, for example, \u00a310), would mean party funding would be more proportionate to membership/popularity and allow other parties to challenge the big 2, or at least keep them on their toes:\r\n\r\nwhat would we say if we only had 2 supermarkets to choose from? or 2 banks? or 2 utility suppliers?",
