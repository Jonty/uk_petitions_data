Changing the curriculum for schools.\r\n\r\nI am a year 10 student in my last term until year 11 and I do health and social care at school as one of my options but me and other class mates have been stressed as we have to re do the whole course again because Michael gove keeps changing the curriculum.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that Michael gove is changing the English curriculum AGAIN!  That has been hard on everybody.\r\n\r\nAlso Michael gove has only given students one chance to get a c grade or higher in their GCSE's that is unfair and puts a lot of pupils under stress.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition is based for Michael gove (conservative education minister)  ",
