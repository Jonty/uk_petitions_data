        "additional_details": "A law to make politicians and civil servants who fail to manage public money competently,\r\nsubject to personal surcharges payable to HM Treasury. This will address the rewards for\r\nfailure, and absence of consequences for failure, in the public sector, which has contributed to\r\nmassive waste \u2013 e.g. the Fire and Rescue control centres (Cost \u00a3469 million); scrapped NHS\r\ncomputer system (Cost \u00a312 Billion); many public sector IT projects; defence expenditure\r\noverruns, and so on. This will not recover the huge sums lost to UK taxpayers by public\r\nsector failures, but will begin to change the extravagant and irresponsible culture of the\r\npublic sector, because the individuals concerned will be personally liable for a cash surcharge\r\npayment. A Public Surcharge Commission (not including MPs or civil servants) will decide\r\non surcharges.",
