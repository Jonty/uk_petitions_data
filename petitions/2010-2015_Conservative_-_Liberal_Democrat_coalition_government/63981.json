        "additional_details": "From 1 January 2012, most single young people aged under 35 are only entitled to housing benefit at what is called the 'shared accommodation rate' \u2013 the same as you can get to help pay for the cost of a single room in shared accommodation.\r\nBefore January 2012, the shared accommodation rate only applied to people under 25. Changes to housing benefit rules also affect most single people aged 25 to 34 already living in privately rented self-contained accommodation. Reductions in housing benefit result in a shortfall between the amount of benefit paid and the rent.\r\nWe are calling for the return of the cut off age to 25.",
