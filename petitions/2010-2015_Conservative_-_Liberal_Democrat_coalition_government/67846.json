        "additional_details": "Barbed wire is a primitive and indiscriminate method of keeping animals in or out of various places in the countryside. Often it is left lying around and could seriously injure a wild animal or indeed a human. Because it is so easy to obtain it is also routinely included in the range of security tools used by companies and other organisations.\r\nIt's intention its to cause harm and I think it is time it was banned as there are other equally effective ways to enclose fields which do not cause injury.
