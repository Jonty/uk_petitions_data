        "additional_details": "Recent events have demonstrated the need for Britain to 'return to core values'.  Britons do not, traditionally, cover our faces in public.  It would help the authorities identify criminals, terrorists and trouble-makers of all types if we prohibited face-coverings in public - for ANY reason.  Government should take immediate steps to introduce a law making it illegal for people to cover their faces in public.",
