Society should by no means ever have the right to decide when it is time for someone to die, or the power to prevent the reformation of a criminal, no matter how severe the crime committed. I strongly believe that the government, as a prominent champion of freedom across the vast expanse of the globe, should pass a bill effectively blocking any future referendums to reinstate the irreversible, ultimate punishment; the death penalty.
