        "additional_details": "Varicose veins is a serious condition which can cause extreme discomfort, pain and even disability within its suffers. The government has recently removed varicose veins from being treated on the NHS considering it a cosmetic condition. However, breast enlargement surgery is still available for free if it is causing emotional distress. This is hugely hypocritical as young suffers of varicose veins are also subject to emotional problems due to the visual implications of the condition.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to call for a reform into this rulling to allow consideration for free treatment of varicose veins on the NHS. Please show your support for this cause and for the suffers of this condition by signing this petition. Thank you",
