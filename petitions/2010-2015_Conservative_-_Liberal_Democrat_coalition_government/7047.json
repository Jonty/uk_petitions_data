        "additional_details": "The next general election should be held in May 2013; the earliest date permissible under the Septennial Act 1715.\r\n\r\nIn order to form a stable Government, in 2010 the Coalition agreed to hold the next general election in May 2015.  The rationale was that the Coalition could only work in the context of a fixed term of Government.  So the Fixed Term Parliaments Bill was submitted, calling for this Government to remain in authority for the maximum period allowed by law.\r\n\r\nGiven that neither party achieved a majority vote it is irrational that the Bill should permit them to remain in authority for the maximum tenure, rather than the minimum.  We the undersigned believe the fixed period proposed for the current Government is undemocratic, and a perverse response to very problem it claims to resolve.  In order to form a more stable Government, the next general election should be held as soon as legally possible, so that we may once again seek a Government which represents the majority.",
