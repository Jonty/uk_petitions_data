        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister keeps talking about making Britain a fairer society. What is more unfair then when the poorest in society are forced to pay much more then the richest when buying a property / starting a business / going into higher education?\r\n\r\nInterest makes the rich richer and the poor poorer, it isn't a fair system at all! Interest is a form of oppressing and exploiting the poor and promotes greed.\r\n\r\nI would like the Government to consider pressuring banks (especially those bailed out by taxpayers), to provide interest free mortgages and loans to the poorest in society.\r\n\r\nMy proposal:\r\n25% of all mortgages and loans given out each year should be interest free to the poorest of those that apply for them (this could be extended further).\r\n\r\nPoorest could be defined as those earning 40000 or less a year.",
