        "additional_details": "The government should review simple cautions. For a first 'offence' a person should be dealt with in such a way that does not ever show on any record. People should be allowed to make 1 mistake  in life without it blighting their career choices and future .  A person of  excellent character,is physically attacked,uses self defence, approaches the police , reports the incident. Then discovers a law that brings football hooligans to justice means they are then guilty of threatening behaviour (even in the absence of other people, which is evidenced by cctv).for responding. You can chance it going to court however, you are at mercy of whoever is presiding that day.\r\ncharacter references should be taken and good character considered at the point of the report and this should ensure that a caution is not applicable. Decent young men and women pay the price for the real thugs who often escape justice.please add your name to this petition and protect their future.",
