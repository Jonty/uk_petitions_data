        "action": "alternatives to telephone job interviews for deaf people",
        "additional_details": "Most organisations now do compulsory telephone interviews prior to face to face ones without any adjustments or alternatives for Deaf and Hard of Hearing people. As a result, Deaf and Hard of Hearing people are struggling to secure employment as if they do not attend the telephone interview, they do not get offered the position and when explained to organisations they are told it is compulsory and would not be able to offer them a position if they do not do this. This puts Deaf and Hard of Hearing people at a disadvantage and somewhat discriminates against them. There needs to be implemented an alternative format in order to accommodate Deaf people such as an online chat system so that they can be treated equally to those who can hear on a telephone and do not have an hearing impairment.",
