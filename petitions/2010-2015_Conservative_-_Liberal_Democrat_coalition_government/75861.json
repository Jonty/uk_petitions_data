There is very limited help for this age group and this needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nMore money needs to be funded into the NHS for all types of mental illness but especially for the ages of 16-18. Just like me, many other teenagers have taken another episode in their illness and have got worse due to the lack of help out there for us. ",
