        "additional_details": "We call upon The Foreign Secretary to uphold international law and restore democracy in Syria and Germany. Syria has an election planned for 2014 and the Syrian People deserve a peaceful opportunity to choose their government at the ballot box just as the People of Scotland will do. United Nations Peacekeepers need to restore order in Syria by disarming the Al Qaeda affiliated terrorists that have been smuggling weapons across the Syrian border. In Germany Angela Merkel lost the election with only 311 seats in the Bundestag while we the SPD Green Left have 319 seats. Bribing the SPD leadership is not acceptable practice in a genuine democracy. Brothelkeeping is illegal in the UK so Interpol needs to be called in to investigate the Berlin regime.",
