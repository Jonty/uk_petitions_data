        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, are concerned that Bersted Cricket Club will not be allowed to continue playing cricket on The Green in the heart of Bersted due to restrictive Health and Safety Regulations and Planning Legislation.\r\n\r\nCricket has been played continuously on The Green since 1749 and protests from local residents should not stop this activity at the heart of village life from continuing.  If these protests are allowed, cricket and other sports shall be restricted from village greens throughout the country.\r\n\r\nWe call upon Her Majesty's Government to make a specific exemption to the Health and Safety Regulations and Planning Legislation that would not allow restrictions of this nature to be the basis of protests on these grounds;  instead they should be taken into account only in the case of proposed new buildings.",
