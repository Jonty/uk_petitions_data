        "additional_details": "This petition is aimed at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to take serious interest in the issue between Israel and Palestine, and work towards resolving the problem - which is to end the continuously ongoing conflict in Palestine. The people of Palestine have suffered enormously for the past seven years by Israel's inhumane and horrific actions.\r\n\r\nThose whom are brutally injured are told to wait weeks (sometimes even more!) before crossing the border to receive proper medical treatment and surgery. Some are left to die! Mortality rates are rising, relief tunnels are blocked and violence continues. Al-Shifa, the only main functioning hospital in Gaza, has been threatened to be bombarded so how does Israel justify it's actions? Is there really no hope for humanity left?\r\n\r\nThis is not war, this is genocide.\r\n\r\nThe Israeli occupation is destroying a nation that has no army or artillery weapons to fight back with.\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of humanity, regardless of their race or religion!",
