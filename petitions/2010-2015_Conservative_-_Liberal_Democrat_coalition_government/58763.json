        "additional_details": "I would like the government to investigate BT as I feel they use their position as a big company to cheat ordinary people. For example ,I have just moved to a new 12 month contract in nov 2013 and now they want to increase the price in January 2014. This is what they always do. Whenever I call them they tell me it's happening to all their customers and BT is a very big company. On the other hand I cannot make a change to the contract without being penalised.",
