I don't even need to give examples of the brutal times.\r\n\r\nMost cild protetion agencies have failed to prevet these cruel deaths and a more dramatic approach needs to be taken!\r\n\r\nLive CCTV footage around the home which should be monitored daily and nightly could prevent these horrible things from happening, and in some cases provide evidence and proof about the living conditions.\r\n\r\nTake action now, sign the e-petition!\r\n\r\nThis action would be costly, but life saving!!\r\n\r\nChildren are innocent, they can't fight back!!",
