        "additional_details": "We have banned using mobile phone is cars, but isn't smoking whilst driving just as dangerous if not more? If you are smoking whilst driving you do not have both hands free and complete control, if you dropped the lit cigarette, not only could you burn yourself but also cause a major accident. In addition, smoke from drivers in front of you, can make it's way into your own car which one has to breath in.This petition is to therefore ban smoking whilst driving.",
