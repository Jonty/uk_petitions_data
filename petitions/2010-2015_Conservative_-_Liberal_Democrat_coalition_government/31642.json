People are becoming discouraged to apply and take time to complete application forms because they know that they will NOT get a reponse. If WE the people can take time to apply then YOU the employer should be made to reply. It is common decency.  Doesn't have to be a huge reply a simple sorry you were unsuccessful would do. Or even a Thank you but No not this time. At least we know where we stand.",
