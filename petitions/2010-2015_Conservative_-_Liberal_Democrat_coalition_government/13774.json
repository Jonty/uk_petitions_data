        "additional_details": "Not 100% sure which department this fall under but seen as its to do with animal health i chose this one.\r\n\r\nwhen we dial 999 we have an option of emergency services. if we dial and ask for police we speak to the police, if we ask for an ambulance we get an ambulance come to us.. we need an option for pets, they are part of our families we need to treat them better.\r\n\r\ni want the government to introduce an animal services to the 999 emergency services so that if i phone up and say my dog as just been run over and is in really bad shape, some one from animal services will turn up and take them to a vets where they can recieve treatments.\r\n\r\ni'm not asking for the government to pay for the vet bills just to introduce a service that will pick up the animals, check them over and send them to a vets saught of like an ambulance service but for animals\r\n\r\n(if i have placed this in the wrong department let me know which one i should and i will correct my mistake)",
