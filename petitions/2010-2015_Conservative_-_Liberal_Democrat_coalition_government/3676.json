        "additional_details": "It's becoming a joke how there ARE jobs out there and people are thinking they are too good for them. There is almost no incentive when people are provided houses, money and are paid to watch TV and surfing the internet.\r\n\r\nPeople on benefits are earning more than some people who work, There seriously needs to be a re-think over the scheme and get people working. There are almost always jobs avaliable and even council jobs could be provided to clean up the cities or construction work to re-surface roads (so we won't have 51/52 weeks of the year with motorway maintenance lasting 5 months a piece).\r\n\r\nEnd of the day, I'd be 3000 worse off a year If i went onto the benefit scheme. What is the motivation to work? One holiday a year overseas in comparison? Hardly worth the 51 weeks I work for.",
