Why should they pay for the minority that seem to think cars are there for rallying on the roads of britain.\r\n\r\nThe high insurance costs are just proof that insurers have no faith in the Driving Test system in the UK.\r\n\r\nWhy not have a cheap insurance quote but have to pay a high excess in the event of a crash that is your fault.",
