They are money entoriented. To many shelters are over run by specific breeds causing them to be put down. As not everyone will rehome a rescue dog due to stereotyping. A lot of the puppies & dogs go to untrustworthy homes in this case causing more over breeding, unsocialized dogs & mistreatment. Which in turn causes dangerous dogs. It is a vicious circle & we live it everyday or see it! This needs to happen to help resolve some of this issues. That is my held belief along with others. ",
