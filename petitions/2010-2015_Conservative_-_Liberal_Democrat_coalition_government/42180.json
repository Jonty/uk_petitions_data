        "additional_details": "Geoff Plaxton has dropped the bombshell that at the relatively young age of 65, he is planning on retiring from football on 28th November 2012. Whilst it is recognised that Geoff is perhaps approaching his twilight years with regards to his football career, the late great Stanley Matthews continued to play competitive football until the grand age of 70, and Geoff is fitter than Stanley was (probably). As a Hull City fan, he will be used to low standards of football, and this is precisely the level of Wednesday football at Longhirst all-weather pitch each and every Wednesday night. Geoff still has the pace, the stamina, and more importantly the enthusiasm to continue playing for at least the next few years, so I implore the government to take action, and persuade Geoff to keep going! If even Mrs P doesn't have any beef with him continuing, then why not?!?!",
