        "additional_details": "It is wholly wrong and inapropriate for the government to seek to change the pensions of serving police officers who signed 30 and 35 yr contracts respectively.  Families have planned for the future and their retirement and are now being asked to work longer, pay more and recieve less. Police Officers uphold the law and the police pensions act is law and says no changes should be made that are detrimental to a serving officers pension.  Not to challenge this would be neglect and this needs to be stopped now.",
