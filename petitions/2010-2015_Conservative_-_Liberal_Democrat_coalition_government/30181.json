        "action": "Remove alcohol licences from supermarkets and convenience stores",
        "additional_details": "I propose that the licences to sell alcohol should be removed from supermarkets and returned to premises specifically licensed for the sale of alcohol for consumption off the premises.\r\n\r\nThe benefits are:-\r\n\r\n1. Children shopping with their parents will not view alcohol as the norm as they do in the current supermarket model.\r\n\r\n2. Independent \"off licenses\" will not be in a position to sell alcohol at either cost or below cost as they will not have the purchasing power of the supermarkets.\r\n\r\n3. Off licensees will be more vigilant in who they sell to as their personal livelihoods will be at stake.\r\n\r\n4. This will help to regenerate the High street, prevent the ongoing closure of pubs, automatically increase the price of alcohol without minimum pricing legislation, which will in turn reduce binge drinking and the associated consequences and costs.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition.\r\n",
