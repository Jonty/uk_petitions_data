He has been a fine servant to sport in this country, providing much entertainment to many millions of people. His tireless commitment in helping our successful Olympic bid should be rewarded with a place in the football squad.\r\nI would like the goverment to intervene in this matter and immediately contact the management of Team GB and demand that Mr Beckham is added to the squad.",
