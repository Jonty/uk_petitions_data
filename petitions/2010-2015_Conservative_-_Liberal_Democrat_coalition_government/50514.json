        "additional_details": "On 22nd January 2013 a British serviceman was brutally murdered in Woolwich in a terrorist attack.\r\n\r\nUnarmed Cub Scout leader Ingrid Loyau-Kennett approached one of the perpetrators and tried to talk him into surrendering his weapon. When interviewed, Ms Loyau-Kennett stated \"He was covered with blood. I thought I had better talk to him before he starts attacking somebody else.\"\r\n\r\nMs Loyau-Kennet acted with the utmost bravery and courage, placing the well-being of others above that of herself and risking her life in the process.\r\n\r\nJust as we cannot allow evil to go unopposed, we equally cannot fail to recognise those who stand against it.\r\n\r\nI propose that Ms Loyau-Kennet be considered as a recipient for the George Medal, the highest decoration for bravery available to a civilian in the United Kingdom.",
