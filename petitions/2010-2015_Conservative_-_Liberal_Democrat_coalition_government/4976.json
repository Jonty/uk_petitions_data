Not only will this reduce litter, and protect the environment but it will save the local councils money on having to clear the streets. If supermarkets want to maintain a healthy brand they would agree to this.\r\n\r\nIf there  is more than one supermarket in the given radius the stores should come to an agreement themselves ",
