        "action": "We should use more nuclear power in the UK",
        "additional_details": "There are currently 16 nuclear power plants active in the UK. However we still import 3252 kilograms of equivalent per capita and in 2012 we used around 27000 kilos of oil.\r\n\r\nThis cannot continue. We estimate that if we carry on as we are the oil will run out in 40 years.\r\n\r\nThe solution is nuclear power! France relies on nuclear power, with 74% of there energy coming from this source.\r\n\r\nI hope to encourage the use of more nuclear power in the UK and would love it if you could show some support for the cause.\r\n\r\n",
