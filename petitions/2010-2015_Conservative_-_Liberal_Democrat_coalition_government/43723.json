        "additional_details": "i would like the scottish goverment to rethink the new air guns laws and possible introduction of air gun licenses for all air guns. however i would like to have the parliment consider a comprimise on these issues. i belive that if a 3 day waiting period was introduced for gun shops to do back ground checks that gun crime would be reduced. i also think if details of gun sales were kept by gun store as well the owners details then any gun crimes there were would be more easily traced. if gun shops took peoples detail and the buyer had a co-signer to say the person was trust worthy then this again may reduce gun crime but allows a popular sport and past time (shooting and hunting) to remain intact.",
