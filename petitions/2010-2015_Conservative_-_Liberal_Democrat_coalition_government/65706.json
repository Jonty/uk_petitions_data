        "additional_details": "We are setting up this petition in order to make the use/sale of prong collars illegal.\r\n\r\nThese collars are cruel and barbaric which in our opinion should be banned from general use/sale throughout the UK. We think anyone caught using these on their dogs should be prosecuted, fined and put on the animal abuse register.\r\n\r\nThe metal spikes pinch the skin around dogs\u2019 necks when they pull and can scratch or even puncture their skin!\r\n\r\nProng collars are used to stop dogs from pulling on the leash, but they are only a quick fix, not a training aid, and will not teach the dog not to pull or lunge on the lead.\r\n\r\nDogs may well interpret the tightening of a prong collar around their neck as a stranglehold (which it is, after all!) and become fearful and/or aggressive.\r\n\r\nWE WISH TO MAKE THE USE AND SALE OF THESE COLLARS IN THE UK ILLEGAL!",
