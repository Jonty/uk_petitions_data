What kind of government secretly spies on it's citizens? Oh yeah, we can't forget the ridiculous excuse \"it's for your security.\" I, and many of the other British people WILL NOT give up freedom for your promise of \"security.\" We do not wish to live in an Orwellian society, we do not want to be monitored or have anybody take over-interest in our personal activity!\r\nKnow that by monitoring Facebook, google searches, they can literally understand the way you think. Yes, we are capable of such a thing. I can't remember the last time anybody was under threat of a terrorist attack. Why? Because it rarely ever happens, it happens so little that there's 0 need to spy on people without even telling them. So, if you are a person wanting justice to prevail, please sign this petition! ",
