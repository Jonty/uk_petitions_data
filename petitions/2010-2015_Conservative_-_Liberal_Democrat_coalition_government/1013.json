        "additional_details": "We the undersigned would like to see an end to the BBC licence fee. This may well have once been a good British organisation but it now does not offer anything that other wise is not availiable else where. The cost is not fair in a modern world where services such as Pay per View and selective channel services are availiable from other suppliers. Even though there may be no product advertising in its programs there is certainly enough advertising of its other services to annoy us. We do not care if it is an advert for BBC services or any other paid for product. Please pass on to all who will support this.",
