The amount of money made through taxation far outweighs the cost of treating smoking related problems through the NHS.\r\nWhy not give us a choice? Give pubs, bars or restaurants the choice whether they will allow smoking on their premises or not. Therefore giving people a choice whether they choose to go there or not.",
