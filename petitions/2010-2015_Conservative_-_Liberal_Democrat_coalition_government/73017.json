        "additional_details": "The new over 65 savings bond does not offer a monthly income option. It should.  Pensioners who have managed to save during their working life have seen their savings eroded over the past years.  They need extra income now - waiting to have interest added at maturity does not help in addressing an immediate need.  By adding a monthly income option, those who often have only the state pension as their sole income, would receive an immediate benefit.",
