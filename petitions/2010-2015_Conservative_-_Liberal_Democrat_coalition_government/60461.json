        "additional_details": "Due to recent storms an old argument/debate has been reopened regards the continuation of the South Devon Railway sea wall (Dawlish) section of the South West Railway.\r\n\r\nA large section of the Sea Wall has recently been destroyed due to the storms. However many feel this damage could have be averted had more long-term defenses been build along the South West Coast Path.\r\n\r\nBy all means create a new alternate highspeed option north of the Dawlish Sea Wall.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the continuation of the Dawlish Sea Wall segment of the West Country line, improvements to said line in terms of longterm defenses as opposed to repairing damage as and when damage occurs and would also like it guaranteed that the section of the line will not be removed for purpose of property redevelopment.\r\n\r\nThis segment of our history should be given protection under law regards cultural heritage and protected status!",
