        "action": "Adopt a \"Sergey Magnitsky\" Act in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The United States recently adopted the Sergey Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act. The Act imposes visa and financial sanctions on the corrupt Russian officials responsible for the detention, torture, and death in prison of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who discovered a $ 230 million tax fraud they perpetrated.  Not a single person was convicted in Russia for Sergey's death.\r\n\r\nThe furious response of the Russian government, which reacted to the Magnitsky Act by outlawing the adoption of disabled Russian orphans by American families, clearly demonstrates both the cannibalistic nature of the ruling regime in Russia, and the effectiveness of the US measure.\r\n\r\nCorrupt Russian officials spend millions in dirty money on UK real estate and luxury goods and services. It is imperative that the UK follows the US in adopting a Sergey Magnitsky Act to hold them to account. Keep corrupt Russian officials and their money OUT of the UK!\r\n",
