        "additional_details": "The best way to reduce the current crises in A&E & primary care is to advertise self-help advice & good health-seeking behaviour on TV.  Despite the massive amount of health information in the public domain these days, patients don't know what they should do & who they should turn to if they have a health problem.  TV adverts are known to be a very effective way of promoting public health campaigns.  The government needs to act now to ensure that patients know how to get the most out of the NHS without mis-using it.",
