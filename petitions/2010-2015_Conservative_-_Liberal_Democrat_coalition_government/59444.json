        "additional_details": "Whilst all businesses qualify for goodwill payments, GPs do not have this privilege at the time of retirement. They are expected to develop a business, spent their time and money and then give it to someone else for free.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question of discriminating against GPs but also depriving the Treasury of very much needed Tax Revenue, especially at a time when the National Debt is very high at 1.3 Trillion and that is still rising.\r\n\r\nI therefore request the Chancellor of Exchequer to consider removing this anomaly and make the GP practices in par with other medical businesses like Dental and Ophthalmic services. This will not only enhance the competiveness and standard of patient care but GPs will also be encouraged to invest more leading to high standards and value for the NHS.\r\n\r\nLet GPs receive what they rightfully deserve at the time of their retirement. This is very unfair for GPs and the Treasury alike and must be rectify immediately at the next budget.\r\n",
