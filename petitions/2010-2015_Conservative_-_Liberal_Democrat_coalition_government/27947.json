        "additional_details": "We the undersigned petition the government to allow the people of Great Britain to vote on the future of the monarchy. There is a growing feeling among the populace that a British Republic would be preferable for both financial, political and social reasons.\r\n\r\nMonarchy represents an archaic remnant of a feudal system of government that is little more than an unneeded expense in the modern day. Monarchy is also incompatible with a true democratic system as it allows the potential for the desires of the people to be overruled and for new legislation to be passed without a vote.\r\n\r\nA British Republic would bring Britain in line with modern times, save untold millions of taxpayer money and reduce class divides in society.\r\n\r\nWe want the ability to decide whether we wish to be a Republic.",
