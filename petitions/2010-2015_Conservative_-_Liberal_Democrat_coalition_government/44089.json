        "action": "Officially Recognize Zimbabwe Gukurahundi Genocide",
        "additional_details": "The 22nd of December 2012 marked 25 years since the Zimbabwe government halted its 1980s Genocide against the Matebele people found in the Southern western parts of Zimbabwe. Over 20 000 people were killed during this Genocide.\r\n\r\nThis petition is a call on the UK to:\r\n\r\n1. Officially recognize the Gukurahundi Genocide and support the Matebele and all victims of injustice in Zimbabwe to campaign for truth and justice.\r\n\r\n2. Arrest the perpetrators of this Genocide found in the UK borders and hand them over to The International Criminal Court at The Hague.\r\n\r\n3. Declare the denial of the Gukurahundi Genocide a prosecutable crime in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe continued Gukurahundi Genocide denial threatens the Matebele surviving victims and emboldens the perpetrators, the denialists and the supporters of this Genocide to commit future atrocities against the Matebele and other groups in Zimbabwe. The white farmers have been the latest victims f ethnic cleansing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
