        "additional_details": "If David Cameron, as Prime Minister -and therefore the face- of this country is to live up to his promise of \"the greenest government ever\", then he should be focussing on the green debate more frequently. Since the UK agreed to targets of 10% renewables by 2010 and in 2012 has only 9.5% of its electricity generated by them, we have no hope of achieving our 15% by 2020 target unless we hasten to maximise our output from these sources. By recycling the materials from old wind turbines/solar panels and with help from the UK manufacturing industry to produce new ones using more efficient designs; in addition to the removal of any fossil fuel subsidies and increasing investment in these technologies, the UK could, without criticism, both exceed this target, getting 20% of all electricity from renewables and lead the world into a greener, brighter future.",
