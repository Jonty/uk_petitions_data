        "additional_details": "This year thousands of A level students' exams were marked much lower than they would have been last year, or any year before that. They have done this by raising the grade boundaries after the exams were completed, which of course is incredibly unfair on students who have worked to a particular standard throughout their school year. As a result of the Edexcel A level history marking even 'A' grade students have had their futures turned upside down. If this petition is successful, it will hopefully lead to the investigation of all subjects and examination boards of which papers were marked down and further government action. ",
