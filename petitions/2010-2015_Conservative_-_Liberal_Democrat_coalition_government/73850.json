During my last 50 journeys alone, southern railways failed to arrive on time 80% of the time. In my last 17 journeys, it failed to arrive on time on all 17 times.\r\n\r\nIt is our request that the 'Department of Transport' does something about it as the southern railways don't even take our complaints seriously.\r\n\r\nIt is our request to force 'southern railways' to improve its service or bring it under the umbrella of TFL.
