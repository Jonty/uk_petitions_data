        "additional_details": "In 2011, a survey of 800 schools in the UK found that only 40 schools had a specific eating disorder policy.\r\nSchools are legally bound to have safeguarding policies. A specific eating disorder policy would sit appropriately with such safeguarding responsibilities, ensuring early intervention for pupils and students at risk of an eating disorder.\r\n\r\nConsidering the rise in the number of young people being diagnosed with an eating disorder (HSCIC, 2012); the knowledge that eating disorders are complex (sometimes fatal) illnesses, and the role that teachers undertake in promoting the welfare and safety of children in their care (in loco parentis), this petition calls upon the government to make mandatory eating disorder policies in all schools.\r\n",
