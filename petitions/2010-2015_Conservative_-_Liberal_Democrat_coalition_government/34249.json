Common frauds as identified by the Schools Adjudicator are: pretending a relatives address is your own; short term rentals or tenancy agreements; using an address owned by the parents but not their home address; swapping addresses with friends.\r\nEvery school place obtained by deception deprives another child with a legitimate claim to that place.\r\nThe government must take action including tackling fraud robustly by\r\n-imposing fines and custodial sentences on parents found to be fraudulent or misleading even after term has started;\r\n-where families move from properties they own to a short term let, the presumption should be that this was for the school place unless the family can evidence an alternative reason;\r\n-sibling policies should be modified for families who move away from their short term let or other arrangement without good reason.",
