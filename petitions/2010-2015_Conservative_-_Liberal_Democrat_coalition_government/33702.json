        "additional_details": "One of the important original reasons behind democracy was \"no taxation without representation\". At 16 you can get a job and pay taxes, and it is undemocratic that you have no say in who sets those taxes. Areas such as the minimum wage and benefits also affect you directly and you should have a say in these policies.\r\nIn today's society, 16-year-olds are more mature than ever before and there is no significant gap between an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old's ability to vote.\r\nMany 18-year-olds do not make informed decisions. In fact, many 40-year-olds do not also make informed decisions and this does not mean we deny them the vote. So 16-year-old college students will be more determined to vote and would use their vote wisely.",
