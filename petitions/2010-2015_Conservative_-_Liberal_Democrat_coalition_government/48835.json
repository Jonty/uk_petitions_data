The planes are now distinct, often with 4 jet nozzles.\r\n\r\nResearch suggests these planes are spewing out toxic metal pollution into our atmosphere.  Chem-trail blanket spraying is not only damaging our land, but also our health, and a public enquiry is needed immediately.  Nano-particulates are mutating the very genes of our plants, and insanity rains in our skies.",
