        "additional_details": "As we have seen in recent times, there is a lack of respect for authority in schools, the workplace, and on the streets. The recent ITV series \"Bad Lad's Army\" showed that an experiment in using national service on modern youths does indeed instil such respect, despite fears to the contrary. This petition respectfully asks for national service to be reinstated altogether, thus providing a social service, as well as providing assistance to our forces abroad.",
