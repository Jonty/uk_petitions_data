        "additional_details": "The government must stop the drastic cuts Sheffield Council are proposing. They are aiming to demolish Don Valley Stadium and closing Stocksbridge Leisure Centre. This is added to drastic cuts on funding for Sheffield Theatres and festivals such as Tramlines. However they will not stop the \u00a32.2M renovation of Town Hall. These cuts will severely damage Sheffield's part of the Olympic Legacy and the culture and make the overall satisfaction incredibly low. Please stop these cuts and make the council rethink what they do.",
