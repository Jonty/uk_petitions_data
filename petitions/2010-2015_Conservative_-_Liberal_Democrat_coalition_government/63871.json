        "additional_details": "Criminal sentencing needs to be focussed & cost effective. The Attorney General should draw up a list of sentencing terms eg. 6 months, 1 year, 2 years etc. & set a Cash budget for all the costs of the prosecution. So if a prosecution would lead to an estimated sentencing of 6 months a cash budget of maximum \u00a36,000 would be set. This would mean that millions could not be wasted on a case that would lead to a sentencing of only 6 months. When the country is suffering from a cash crisis & austerity the government must cut waste. It is not in the public interest to waste millions on a case that would result in only a small sentence. The savings could be spent on keeping serious criminals in prison till they did not pose a threat to society.   ",
