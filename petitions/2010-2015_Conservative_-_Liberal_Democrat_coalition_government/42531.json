We need this to ensure people who breach the Malicious Communications Act (2003) can be brought to justice.\r\n\r\nIf you find something abusive, disturbing or something that is inciting racial hatred, the police can only prosecute if that person has information on the parts of their profile that identifies them. There are people who use social media to bully, hound and threaten others. If there is no identifiable information on the bullies profile, the police need to spend \u00a31000's to get a subpoena from the US. Due to this, people can write whatever they like without repercussion.\r\n\r\nIf Facebook has a registered office in the UK, the police will be able to prosecute those who use social media to bully, intimidate, threaten and spread hate.",
