This so that Oyster fares can be applied to their journeys.\r\n\r\nThere are many who get inconvenienced by travelling to Ewell, instead of their nearest railway station- which is Epsom.\r\n\r\nAlthough Southern trains have introduced a smart card it does not fulfil the need of commuters for end to end, economical city travel.\r\n\r\nGovernments and businesses are for the people they serve. And this is a very valid demand of residents of this area which should not be neglected.\r\n\r\nThe issue has been dragging on for too long- which should not be the case.\r\n\r\nPlease include Epsom into Zone 6. Advise citizens of a time bound plan.",
