In a response to a previous petition to ban all sharia law, a government spokesperson responded:\r\n\r\nThis Government will challenge behaviours and views which run counter to our shared values. Promoting fairness in society is one of the Coalition Government's core commitments. This is everyone's responsibility; it is only together we are able to develop a stronger and more cohesive society.\r\n\r\nIf these legal principles were to be integrated into the British legal system, then it would no doubt be a massive step backwards in the fight for gender equality in the UK.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that we as a country do not allow such misogynistic legal principles to be integrated into legislation.\r\n",
