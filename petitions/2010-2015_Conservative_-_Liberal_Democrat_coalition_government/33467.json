        "additional_details": "The BBC licence fee was frozen at the October 2010 level of \u00a3145.50 for the next six years, a 16% cut in real terms.  We request the 16% cut to be restored.  We didn\u2019t queue up to ask for it \u2013 we didn\u2019t ask to cheapen and degrade BBC broadcasting, but that\u2019s already happening and will get worse.\r\n\r\nIt has now been revealed that Murdoch\u2019s lobbying was behind the cut, imposed by the coalition government.  But the licence fee has no connection with Treasury deficits.  Instead the cut benefits Murdoch and BSkyB and damages BBC broadcasting.  The government should restore the BBC revenue stream and make Murdoch pay a hefty fee to the BBC in compensation.",
