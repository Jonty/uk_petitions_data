        "additional_details": "Strikes are something which affect each and everyone of us. They can and usually do great damage to our country, the cost of which has to be borne by all of us.\r\n\r\nIn the 21st century the idea of causing damage and hurt to innocent people simply to make a political or financial point is not acceptable and as such strikes should be made illegal.\r\n\r\nThis is not an attack on democracy or human rights but an attempt to remove from society something which is archaic, destructive and often fails to benefit even the strikers and their families.\r\n\r\nThere are too many instances of strikes being called for political reasons and this must end.\r\n\r\nGrievances should be settled by arbitrators, agreed and appointed by both sides and whose decision is binding under the law.\r\n\r\nStrikes benefit no one, damage the country and are something we cannot afford and should not have to suffer.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition.",
