        "additional_details": "Companies and individuals are sometimes crippled by charge-backs 6 months prior to the date of purchase of physical goods online, paid via PayPal mainly.\r\n\r\nPurchase of service may require more time and 180 days is acceptable.\r\n\r\nPurchase of goods online should not however use the same time frame. On PayPal if purchasing with real funds or balance, the limit is 45 days, why should this loophole be available for fraud to take place on a 180 day, 6 month time frame.\r\n\r\nFraud is very high upon goods supplied in the electronics and high value goods industry and fraudsters rely on the 6 month time span to create a blanket of (I didn't see the transaction) cover.\r\n\r\nAll responsible credit card owners should check statements monthly and I propose a 45 day limit on chargebacks for goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
