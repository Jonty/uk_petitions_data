        "additional_details": "During the recent London (and other cities) riots there have been a lot of calls to bring the army onto the streets to \"keep it safe.\" This is exactly the type of thing we are fighting in other countries to stop happening. The police can deal with the issue just fine if they are given the resources to deal with the problem and the army should not be an option.\r\n\r\nAn escalation in force will bring a different type of rioters and it is only a few short steps from the army been on the street to giving them permission to use their weapons.\r\n\r\nTherefore want we need is an increase in policing resources and even an increase in their powers not such drastic action as bringing in the army.\r\n",
