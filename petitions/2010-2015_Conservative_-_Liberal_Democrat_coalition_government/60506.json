        "additional_details": "Ban the tv licence after the corruption of the bbc protecting paedophiles like Jimmy Saville as well as their total discrimination on many crimes that are committed where there is a ban on reporting these to the British public because of the crimes being committed by non white people, these crimes are hardly even given any airing also it is not right to pay for this when the bbc gives airtime to such evil people as Mr Choudary for example who would not even condemn the killing of Lee Rigby, evil men like this should never be given airtime to preach their sick and twisted views and after this sickness of the bbc they  should find their own money. Then they also can't steal it to use themselves which they have done in the past.BBC these days stands for Biased broadcasting company because it does not say the real truth.",
