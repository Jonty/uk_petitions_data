        "additional_details": "The Mayor of London has designated Park Royal an area of interest to site a new waste disposal site near Willesden Junction station in very close proximity to residents and a conservation area.  There is already one site called Powerday and a smaller one, Quatto causing health problems.  This is unjust and unfair.  Ealing has not consulted properly to residents affected on border with Ealing and Brent.  The Mayor should think about siting these things out of London where there are less residents living.  He would not want something like this where he lives!",
