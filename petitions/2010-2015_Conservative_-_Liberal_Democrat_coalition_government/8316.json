        "additional_details": "There appears to be no respect for law and order among many in our communities. Prison does not seem to deter and we hear all too often from people trying to blame \"The system\" for these mindless acts. We want to see much harsher sentencing eg Life for just carrying a gun, 10 years for carrying a knife. Other punishments, expulsion from all benefits including NHS, refusal of a passport for life, no right to council housing. These are punishments which should make people think twice. Finally arm the police so that they can deal more effectively sooner rather than too late and certainly not a last resort.",
