        "additional_details": "In the light of recent retail store failures, most notably Comet, section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act should be  amended to protect consumers holding shopping vouchers.\r\nCurrently, it is up to the administrator of failed stores as to whether vouchers will be accepted. The law should be amended to:\r\n1) prioritise voucher-holders to the top of the creditor list.\r\n2) make it a criminal offence for Company Directors of these stores to authorise the sale of vouchers knowing that they may not be in a position to redeem them.",
