        "additional_details": "\r\nFoxes are meant to be wildlife they are not domestic animals. Which means they shouldn't get so comfortable that they walk streets and end up roaming into people's homes. I've had one come into my home garden and it scared the kids who were playing there. If no adult was around, no one knows what could have happened. There's also been a lot of cases of children who have been attacked by these ferocious animals so I do not understand why the government has not done anything about it yet.\r\n\r\nDo we want our future children to live in fear of being attacked by foxes while they walk home in broad daylight? I'm not proposing to kill all these animals as that would be inhumane. However some sort of regulation should be done to contain them to stop them from being the pests that they are. There is no place for foxes in domestic lifestyle. ",
