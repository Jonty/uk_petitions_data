        "additional_details": "Funeral payment decisions need to made to the Funeral Director before the funeral takes place. Funeral Directors are not being paid in the event that a claim is rejected. Many have now resorted to taking large deposits to cover themselves in the event of a rejected claim. Most people do not have the funds available for these deposits. The payment should be made available to everyone prior to the funeral. If the claiment is not entitled to it, then claim it back from them. Why should the Funeral Director lose out. Please review the current system to speed payments up.",
