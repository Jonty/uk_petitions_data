        "additional_details": "As adults and familys money is getting smaller and smaller and childrens pocket money in getting less and less people dont have a large amount of money to spend on luxuries. Therefore people should not have to pay 20p for a piece of chocolate such as a freddo bar. Years ago freddos were only 10p now they have DOUBLED in price, can you name any other sweet related item that doubled in price? i know its not much but its the principal that just because this is a more moderner society it does not call for the goverment to raise the price on this bar of chocolate. I am asking for people to sign this petition in order for the goverment to decrease the tax on the freddo bar back to were it had originaly started. Thankyou.",
