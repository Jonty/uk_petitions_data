        "additional_details": "I Work in a local nursing care home for the elderly where the government pay for residents to stay and be cared for. The money they pay compared to the wages we earn are insufficient and an insult to the care staff in this sector.\r\nI would like the government to stipulate as they are paying for the care in private homes a suitable minimum wage to be paid to care staff. More so now as the cost of living is rising. This would also help filter out non caring staff and keep hold of better staff as paying a higher wage will mean better care for the residents. Not everyone can do this job, so why should it be less pay than working in a supermarket for example. How would you feel if your parents or grandparents where being cared for by people who didn\u2019t care..\r\n",
