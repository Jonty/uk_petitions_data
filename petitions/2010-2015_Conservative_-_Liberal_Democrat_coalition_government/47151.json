        "additional_details": "Emergency services attend road traffic collisions involving motorcycles regularly and injuries tend to be serious. Riders wearing safety clothing: armoured jacket and trousers tend to fare better than those in jeans and jumper. Helmets are a legal requirement; so why are armoured clothes not? Even at 30mph Tarmac hurts skin.\r\nI petition the government to make it compulsory for all powered two wheel vehicle users (over 50cc maybe) to wear BS approved armoured clothing on public roads, thus dramatically reducing injuries in RTCs involving motorcycles.
