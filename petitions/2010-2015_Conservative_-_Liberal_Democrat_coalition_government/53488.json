With no guarantee of work or pay, staff are completely at the mercy of their employer. At a time of economic crisis and high unemployment, people willing to work need a guaranteed minimum amount of hours and pay written into contracts.  Make zero hour contracts illegal and give the unemployed a viable option for getting back to work. ",
