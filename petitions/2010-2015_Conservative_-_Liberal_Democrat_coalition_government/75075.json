        "additional_details": "In 2011 Wycombe District Council disposed of vast amounts of Public Open Space land to a private company called Red Kite, without notifying local residents.  Many of the residents are still unaware that the land around their homes has been transferred into private hands.\r\nThis open space land is protected in law.\r\nWe believe that this land was transferred by stealth and without the appropriate notice to local residents as laid down in law.\r\n\r\nTherefore we demand the land be returned into public ownership.",
