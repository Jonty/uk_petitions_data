All pay little or no tax in the UK yet benefit from making profits in the UK.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved by using legal but morally wrong schemes that turn these profits into losses - for instance Starbucks pay a license fee to Starbucks head office that equals it's UK profits, therefore minimising what they have to pay. Amazon Europe operate in Luxemboug, paying taxes in that country rather than in the UK where it operates 9 huge depots. Should Vodafone be allowed to bid for a 4G network if they don't pay taxes?\r\n\r\nMany will threaten to leave the UK losing jobs. Really? I doubt it - if they do then other businesses will replace them. Where there is profit to be made in a market a company will exploit it.",
