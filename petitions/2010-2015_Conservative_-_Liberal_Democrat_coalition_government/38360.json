        "additional_details": "Sign today to force the government to stand back and take a look at the war on cannabis and see that it is un-winnable and unjust, and that legalisation, taxation and regulation of the plant in all forms is not only the safest solution but also the fairest for those who require it for medicinal purposes, those who wish to smoke it recreationally and peacefully in the privacy of their own homes, or for those who simply admire the plant itself. They must also recognise that it is the most cost-effective solution, which is a crucial factor in this nation's time of economic depression. Put in place due to racial discrimination and scaremongering nearly 80 years ago, it is time that this vindictive and unfair law was finally abolished.",
