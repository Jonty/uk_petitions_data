        "additional_details": "I propose that students be given the automatic right to remove items of uniform at any time when they see fit, due to climate and or personal reasons.\r\n\r\nNo one can control the temperature in all school buildings and particularly individual classrooms.  Occasions arise where students are over warm and feel the need to cool down. Overheating can cause serious medical problems, let alone headaches, fractious behaviour or lethargy.   Many schools allow the removal of jumpers and blazers in classrooms alone, and no where else in the school.  There are still schools who do not allow the removal of clothing at all.\r\n\r\nAll employed people (with very few exceptions) have the right to dress appropriately according to their needs and I feel students should also be given the same rights, and as schools have a duty of care, I do not feel it is right they should inflict such terms on a child.\r\n\r\n",
