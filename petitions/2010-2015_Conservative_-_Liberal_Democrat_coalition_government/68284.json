        "additional_details": "Slips, trips and falls are particularly dangerous on stairs.  There has been much published on stair safety and \u201chold the handrail\u201d is a common workplace instruction.  One frequent omission which is necessary to ensure that a handrail is available is the \u201cWalk as you drive\u201d orderly use of stairs.  This aligns with footway safety etiquette which keeps pedestrians with their back to the traffic away from the kerb (Highway Code para 1).\r\n\r\nI propose that H.M. Government supports and encourages a \u201cWalk as you drive\u201d initiative to improve safety on workplace, school and public stairways.  I believe it is better than the \u201cfree for all\u201d (every man for himself) approach.\r\n\r\nI propose that any documents which make recommendations on stair safety for the UK, include the phrase \u201ckeep left\u201d.\r\n",
