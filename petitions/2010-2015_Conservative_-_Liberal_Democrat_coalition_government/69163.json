        "additional_details": "Our national identity is a fluid concept, changing continuously depending upon countless factors.\r\nHowever, one static definition of our national identity is our national anthem, a song which is near ubiquitous around the Earth.\r\nIf a foreigner were to attend one its performances with no idea of the culture of the United Kingdom, what impression would they get of our country?\r\nRegal splendor?\r\nGlorious Liberty?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWe propose that we change the national anthem to a more suitable song, one which reflects the fullness and beauty of our islands. A song which invokes involuntary feelings of optimism and pride for all Britons, such that we can't help but rattle windows with gusts of patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe \"Match of the Day\" theme tune from the BBC is one such anthem. Imagine the feelings a foreigner would gain from hearing thousands of people give a rendition of this cultural landmark of dated synthesisers rendered in laddish grunts.\r\nAwe.\r\nWonder.\r\nEnvy.\r\nSign the petition.",
