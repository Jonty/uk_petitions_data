In the spirit of the Big Society, at least the people of this country should have, at least a partial say in this matter into which countries and which funds these monies are directed.\r\nI propose that 50% of this figure should be given back to the people of this country in voucher form only to be used for International Development.\r\nThe voucher then can be sent to whichever overseas aid the owner deems fit, eg , Water aid, East Africa, Oxfam ect\u2026\u2026.and to which end the Country or charity can \u2018cash the voucher in\u2019. I propose the Government nominate 100 or so Countries/Charities and then it is up to each of those organisations to promote themselves enough for the population of this Country to send their given voucher, thus the \u2018owner\u2019 of the voucher has had his or her say into the direction of the funds and maybe also gets a better understanding of the system.\r\n",
