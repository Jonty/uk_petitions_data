        "additional_details": "The government must change immigration policy: Introduce compulsory health insurance to visa applications, NHS complete & return forms, save \u00a3millions in unpaid health tourism bills.  Stop child benefit & tax credits to a partner who lives in UK, but kids & spouse live in other EU country.  Introduce spouse visa for non EU spouse of UK citizens eg. Morocco who have strict procedures, allow travel & work so they pay tax when in UK.  Positive immigration of entrepreneurs where married to UK person allows integration into community can help UK out of debt. New salary rules are unfair, if government policed it, no one could claim benefit when on a visit visa.  Deport all those overstaying visas. My husband is Moroccan, has his own business, works for 2 UK charities, we have a 3 year old son but in July 2012 the UK refused him a visit visa,  despite 3 prior visit visas,  5 trips + friends & family in UK.  Overhaul the system stop penalising genuine people like us for decades of abuse.",
