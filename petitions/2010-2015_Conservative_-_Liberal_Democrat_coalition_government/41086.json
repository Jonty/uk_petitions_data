        "additional_details": "The amendment to Section 47 of the Health and Safety Work Act 1974, has been added to the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill at the eleventh hour.\r\nThe amendment would mean:\r\n- Employers would no longer have a strict liability for the health and safety of their workers, for the first time since 1898.\r\n- Workers could not rely on an employer's breach of health and safety law to win a personal injury claim, they would have to provide proof of negligence.\r\n- Enforcement of health and safety law would be increasingly left up to a significantly weakened and less effective Health and Safety Executive.\r\n- Employers will increasingly hide behind the defence that complying to health and safety regulations was not \"reasonably practicable\".\r\nPlease rescind this amendment and preserve workers' rights to a safe workplace.
