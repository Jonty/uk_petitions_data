        "additional_details": "The new rules being implemented on 1st October 2014 will mean that Tax Discs don't need to be used anymore, which is obviously a lot easier.\r\n\r\nHowever, these new rules also come with some issues, they state that when a vehicle is sold, the tax does NOT carry on.\r\n\r\nThis means that when purchasing a second hand vehicle, with 8 months tax for example, you MUST tax it there and then before departing.\r\n\r\nWe feel this is quite frankly, pathetic. If someone has paid to have tax on their vehicle and they sell it, it should NOT mean that the new owner must pay extra tax.\r\n\r\nWe urge everyone to sign this, so that we can all save ourselves a bit of cash. Fair, right?",
