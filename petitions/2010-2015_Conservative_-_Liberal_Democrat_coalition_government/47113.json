This reflects the fact that we came into this crisis with fiscal policy on a path that wasn\u2019t sustainable and a correction was needed. May 1997, public sector net debt was \u00a3351 billion, by April 2010 it more than doubled to \u00a3893 billion.\r\n\r\nIt's criminal how they wasted our taxes, they have left us a broken nation and yet: not 1 single person has been brought to book for this savagery on our countries finances, they should be brought to justice once and for all!",
