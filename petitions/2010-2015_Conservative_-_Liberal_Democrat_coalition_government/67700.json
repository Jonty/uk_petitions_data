Also  we should be allowed the same privilege of withdrawing 25% tax free at 55.  These pensions have been paid for through the service of our ex spouse, and we have paid by supporting them while they were serving.  All we ask is where has the monies disappeared to, and is this tantamount to theft.  Mine alone is over \u00a323,000 after tax ",
