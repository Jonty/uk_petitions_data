The NSPCC is calling for a clear new offence that would always make it illegal for an adult to intentionally send a child a sexual message.\r\n\r\nOver 70% of people believe it\u2019s already illegal for an adult to send a sexual message to a child, but shockingly it\u2019s not.\r\n\r\nNow is our opportunity to change this. The Government is currently passing the Serious Crime Bill, where there is an opportunity to make this illegal once and for all for an adult to send a sexual message to a child.\r\n\r\n",
