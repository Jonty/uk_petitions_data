        "action": "Stop discrimination of tall people and make all public transport seating big enough for upto 6'7\" / 2 metres",
        "additional_details": "Public transport has seating which is often to small for those over 6'4\". Trains and planes do not have enough legroom in order to sit in a seat without having to put legs out in the walkway. Seats do not have high enough backs to sit comfortably and sometimes have bolstered head restraints that physically stop someone taller from being able to sit in the seat at all. This seating is unsafe and virtually unusable by the large amount of tall people in the population. This petition calls for all seating on public transport meaning; buses, planes, trains, ferrys etc to be regulated and made for those up to 2 metres tall to be able to fit comfortably including when the seat in front is reclined.",
