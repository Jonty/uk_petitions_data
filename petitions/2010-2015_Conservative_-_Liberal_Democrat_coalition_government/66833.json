        "additional_details": "With over two centuries of changes in the electoral process and the representation of people since 1800, none has taken into consideration the right of the people who fail to cast their vote because they do not believe in the people on the ballot papers or the political party they represent.\r\nThis petition is to call for a process that allows the voice of the many who don't exercise their political civil right to be heard. This will give them the right to soil their ballot paper to indicate their rebellion against political parties.\r\nWith enough signature to our petition for change, the govt. MUST debate this constitutional change for amendment the 2000 Representation of People Act allow this right within our electoral process.",
