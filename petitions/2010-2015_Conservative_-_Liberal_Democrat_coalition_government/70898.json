        "additional_details": "I would like to see some legislation put in place that ensures companies like kwik fit can't charge whatever they like for their goods, and have to have a standard price per item. With kwik fit you pay a different price depending on where you shop, whether you've made a phone call first or whether you have looked at prices on the internet. Recently purchasing a tyre from them and got charged \u00a3288.50, when going on the kwik fit website for the exact same item it was \u00a3199.50, making a phone call to the same shop it was \u00a3277. Speaking to quick fit customer services this is perfectly acceptable. Companies like this target the old/poor, who have no access to internet/ don't know how to use the internet,and the needy that have an emergency. Since when did Britain loose its morals and pricing depend on the individual or whether you are good at haggling or not.",
