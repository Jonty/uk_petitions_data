        "additional_details": "Government action could wipe out Internet fraud - showing that they are concerned about all of us rather than special interest groups. Britain needs to restore its tattered reputation for financial probity and the rule of law. The Government must make Western Union and the other cash transfer companies more transparent. The Government must stop UK telcoms companies profiting from the supply of the \"portable numbers\" which allow the fraud criminals to pose as British residents.\r\n\r\nWithout attention to these points, Britain will continue to attract foreign criminals and allow them to further sully our international reputation.\r\n\r\nWe can all become vulnerable to the advance fee fraud criminals but simple action by the Government could protect us. Please take a moment to sign this petition - putting the fraud criminals out of business would automatically reduce the amount of spam mail you receive.\r\n\r\n  ",
