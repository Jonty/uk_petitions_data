        "additional_details": "Llloyds Bank are transferring many of its customers to a new bank to be called TSB which will be a much smaller business and does not provide the branch coverage that customers in England are used to.  Many people joined Lloyds and left their account in one location despite moving many times during their life.  They are now faced with  losing their account /credit history to remain with a local Lloyds branch or a long drive to a new bank to retain that history.  Once again the loyal customer is treated with disdain.  The Government should enforce Lloyds to offer a branch transfer to remain with them if that is the preferred option for the customer.",
