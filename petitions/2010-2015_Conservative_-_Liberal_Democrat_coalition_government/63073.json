        "additional_details": "It is grossly unfair on all those who buy modest houses immediately and have to take out 95% mortgages, that others who have been lucky can have a superior financial position a number of years later.\r\n\r\nHow can it be right if someone for example has a \u00a3100k house, with a \u00a395k mortgage, who after five years on current rates may have paid off \u00a35-6k, be in a worse position after 5 years compared to someone lucky enough to get to play the system\r\n\r\nIf you get a council house, after 5 years you will get a 35% discount.  So the same house could of been bought for \u00a365k\r\n\r\nMaking the person who was lucky enough to have a council house be in a position where they have equity of \u00a335k.... compared to the mortgage payer of \u00a37k\r\n\r\nWho probably in that time has spent more in mortgage payments compared to the council tenant & probably spent money on renovations etc, that the council tenant had paid!\r\n\r\nTherefore, any discount should be massively reduced, and only be done at 1% per annum!",
