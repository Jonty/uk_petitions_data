        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned want the individual needs of young adults with special educational needs to be considered in terms of life long education, long term health and future emplyment opportunities.  At present the provision for supporting these young people and their families is totally inadequate.  These people and their families deserve and need a much better quality of life. Services vary greatly depending on need and for many there just aren't any options.  Parents need life long support as well, therefore a united approach from health, education and employment is essential and action must be taken now, before the doors close for yet more young people and their families.
