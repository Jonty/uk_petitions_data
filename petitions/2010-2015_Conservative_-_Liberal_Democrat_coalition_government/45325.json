        "additional_details": "Mr Cameron is planning to cutting the budget which will see the end of the Red Arrows Display Team.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons we can be proud to be british is because of our Red Arrows Display Team. It is made up of ex-service personnel and heroes. They are world renowned and show the world how great our armed forces are. The Red Arrows are also used to help with new recruitment to the RAF and other armed forces.\r\n\r\nWe can not let the government take away out world renowned Red Arrows.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you agree that the government should not take away the funding that keeps this great team in the air and in the worlds focus.\r\n\r\nIf this petition gets enough signatures I (like every person that signs) want to government to continue with the funding of this great service that brings focus on our amazing armed forces.\r\n\r\nThank You.",
