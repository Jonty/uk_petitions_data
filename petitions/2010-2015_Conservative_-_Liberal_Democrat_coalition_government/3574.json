        "additional_details": "The Act of Settlement is a major piece of anti-catholic legislation.  In 21st Century a country like ours should not enshrine religious discrimination in law.  I appreciate the difficulties that are involved in repealing this law  but it is a major insult to loyal British people who are also Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of this law would finally show that our country is serious in having a genuinely equal society.  There is no room for  religious discrimination in law in this country and it is shameful that anti-catholic legislation is still acceptable in the UK.",
