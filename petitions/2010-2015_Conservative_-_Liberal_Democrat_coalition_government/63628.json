New theories are being developed that suggest that this may be due to the damage to our guts as a result of glyphosate residues in plants - grains and cereals especially (http://sustainablepulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Glyphosate_II_Samsel-Seneff.pdf). Another study (http://sustainablepulse.com/2014/04/06/worlds-number-1-herbicide-discovered-u-s-mothers-breast-milk/) found glyphosate in mothers' milk.\r\n\r\nDespite these articles, research that can prove any links between cereal proteins, glyphosate and autoimmune disorders, is weak or absent. A first step to identiying any problems would be to test for glyphosate levels in UK foods. ",
