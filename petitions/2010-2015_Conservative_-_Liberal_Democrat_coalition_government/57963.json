        "additional_details": "In 2012 I lost someone close to me because they were affected by a Brain Tumour, the reason I have made this petition is because this type of cancer does not get as much funding as other cancers, please sign this petition so that I can raise awareness.\r\n\r\nBrain tumours kill more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer, including more children and life expectancy for people with brain tumours has not increased for 40 years; they are responsible for an average loss of life of over 20 years and up to 40% of all cancers which initiate outside the brain lead to a secondary cancer in the brain, though many secondary brain tumours are not recorded. This petition therefore calls on the Government to:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Improve brain tumour diagnosis by integrating guidance on identifying the symptoms and patient referral into General Practice and Emergency Medicine Practice guidlines\r\n\r\n\u2022 increase the proportion of cancer research spending on brain tumours\r\n",
