        "additional_details": "It is a basic tenet of human rights that everybody is entitled to equal treatment.  PAYE is discriminatory against employees and favours the rich, entertainers, sportsmen, company directors, the self employed etc who are entitled to receive their remuneration outwith PAYE and make their own advantageous arrangements for the payment of their income taxes taking full advantage of government sponsored tax avoidance schemes.  Those tax avoidance schemes are NOT available to employees who MUST have PAYE operated on their wages and salaries and are denied the opportunity of the advantageous treatment afforded by the government to those outside of PAYE.  That means employees are not being treated equally by our government THAT VIOLATES THE BASIC TENET OF EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1998.",
