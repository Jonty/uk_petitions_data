This will create safe communities and resulting revenue from parking fees, congestion charging, car tax, road tolls, etc. can be spent on the NHS and Public Services ensuring no cutbacks are required and more bus services will be available so nobody needs to waste their money running a car. This will create millions of local UK public transport jobs and more prosperity for local economies. All we need to do is STOP RISK.",
