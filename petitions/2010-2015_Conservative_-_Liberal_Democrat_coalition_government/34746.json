However, it is undemocratic to allow Scots to vote on this matter and not for English Nationals to have the same opportunity. The referendum should also include whether to be independent from Wales and Northern Ireland.\r\nThe referendum should be held on the same day as Scotland votes in the referendum to end the Union with England.",
