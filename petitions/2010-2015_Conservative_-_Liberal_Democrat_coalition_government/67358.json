        "additional_details": "Throughout Northern Ireland the construction and burning of bonfires has become an annual event with in many community's, predominately the Unionist/Loyalist community.\r\n\r\nThe burning of bonfires has a negative impact upon the environment with gases contributing to the 'Greenhouse Effect' produced. Furthermore the burning of tyres located within these bonfires produce much smoke, which often carries toxic chemicals from the breakdown of rubber compounds.\r\n\r\nAnother disadvantage of bonfires is that they lead to sectarian tension, and in extreme cases, violence. We believe that The Northern Ireland office should make the construction and burning of bonfires illegal. Replacing the current grants for bonfires with grants to encourage community's to express culture in a positive way for both the environment and Northern Ireland's residents.",
