As a youth myself I am aware that many are unaware of respect and laugh at elders as frails waiting to pass away. If we start now we can inspire generations and generations to work hard and show the English spirit which once lay so dearly with many of us.  Help support this petetion and save yourself some money in your back pocket. Or will you fork out money for the next riots? I know I won't.",
