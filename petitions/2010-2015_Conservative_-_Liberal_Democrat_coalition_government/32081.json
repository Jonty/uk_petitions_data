        "additional_details": "A reduction of fuel duty to keep prices below \u00a31.10/litre is required to support the economy. Many house holds rely upon their vehicles to earn a living, and have no other financially viable option to attend their workplace. If duty were reduced, more money would be spent in the shops, which would in turn help businesses to remain trading and increase growth. Failing to do this will only ensure that homes are strapped for money, and that the economy remains stagnant.  ",
