        "additional_details": "As many people are aware there's a lot of Stores & Supermarkets that have specific aisles to help people watch what they eat.\r\nThere's Low Fat, Kosher, Halal etc\r\n\r\nThere is also a lot of people suffering from Eating Disorders who are trying to recover and need High Calorie Food. If there's labels stating low calorie for people trying to lose weight, why can't there be high calorie branding for people who are trying to gain weight?\r\n\r\nIf there's High Calorie branding on food packaging it could help Eating Disorder Sufferers to recover by still eating small and often (helping not to make them sick) but as the food will have a much greater calorie intake it will help them gain weight much easier without having to rely on just supplements at a huge cost.\r\nIt could also help parents who are starting to see the early symptoms of an Eating Disorder in their child by  ensuring they are provided with the nutrition needed for a healthy young person.",
