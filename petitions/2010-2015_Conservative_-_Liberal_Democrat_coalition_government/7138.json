We would like to see an increase in funding towards renewable projects, and more information to be published by the government on renewable energy to encourage individuals and cooperatives to invest in this area.\r\nWe would also like to see a reduction in planning applications which are rejected for wind turbines, and a more united approach by county councils to support wind turbines. We would like any objections to wind farms on the grounds of \u201cruining the look of the countryside\u201d to be excluded from any part of the planning consent process because if we don\u2019t install them now, our countryside will not last much longer!\r\n",
