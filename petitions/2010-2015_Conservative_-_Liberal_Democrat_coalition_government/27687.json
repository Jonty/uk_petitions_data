        "additional_details": "Abu Qatada must be deported to Jordan. The EU court of human rights has again ruled against his deportation and if the final appeal fails then he will be released. Not only does this man pose a massive threat to our nation if the final bid fails it will set a precedent for other deportation cases and our already weak government will be less likely to challenge them. It is our own courts, and not Strasbourg, who are best qualified to balance the rights of defendants against wider national security.",
