If you go ahead with a referendum on whether the UK should stay as a member of the EU, something that the majority of British citizens do not understand, I ask that you please hold a referendum stating that people of all backgrounds should have the right to a full marriage in both name as well as rights. This is something that I understand and believe should happen. Together we can make this a better world.",
