        "additional_details": "This is a petition asking that television adverts for Dolmio are banned due to their racial content towards the Italian community in Britain. They portray Italians as dimwitted and the characters accents as well as their slogan \"Whensa You Dolmio Day\" is most offensive, can you imagine if this was an advert for a Chinese sauce, Indian sauce or Jamaican sauce and they portrayed the characters with their accents, this would not be allowed, so it should be teh same for Dolmio Adverts too.",
