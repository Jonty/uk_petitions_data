I say no! This is wrong!\r\nI think if tenants sign a agreement that they would clean up after their dog and make sure it doesn't cause nuisance it should be allowed to live in a flat.\r\nWhere I live there are dogs in flats and there is no mess and you never hear barking or howling.\r\nI think it's time that councils give people a chance.",
