        "additional_details": "The Occupiers Liability Act 1984 makes provision for the own and/or occupier of a property to be prosecuted where a trespasser suffers death or injury.\r\n\r\nThis means that a law abiding person trying to protect their own property could be open to prosecution by the police or to claims against them by an intruder who, by all rights, had no business entering or trying to enter their property.\r\n\r\nThis law also places the onus on the occupier to make sure others are warned of a potential hazard.  This is perfectly correct with invited guests, but intruders who have no right to be there should not be afforded the same.\r\n\r\nAn amendment should be made to protect the law abiding occupier, or the law should be repealed altogether.  It is understood that the law needs to protect against people taking the law into their own hands but this law as it stands is blatantly one sided and needs to be rebalanced so that people can feel safe in securing their property using reasonable measures.",
