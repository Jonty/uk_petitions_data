They are not allowed to leave school site to go to Mosques to pray, which automatically makes it the schools responsibility to provide them with something else. There should basically be two rooms - one for boys and one for girls - and these room should NOT be used for anything other than prayer as places where shoes have been in contact with are not seen as 'clean' and so are not valid places to pray.",
