Over recent years this freedom along with many others has been denied.\r\nWe demand that all smoking laws should be repealed.\r\n\r\nThe duty percentage should be reduced to the levels set in 1971. Cigarette advertising should be legalised and the minimum age for buying cigarettes removed.\r\nSmoking in all public places should be permitted with specific areas designated non-smoking.\r\n",
