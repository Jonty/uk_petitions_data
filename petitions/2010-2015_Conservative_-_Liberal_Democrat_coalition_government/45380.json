        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the abolition of Bedroom Tax.  Not only is this an invasion of privacy for many UK Citizens, but also a security risk to those who are disabled, housebound, eldery, have children, a single parent.\r\n\r\nThe audacity of the Government is nothing to be surprised over.  This austerity measure is targeting the poorest people in Britain, while the fat cats of Amazon, Google, and other global monopolies pay only a fraction of the tax they should be paying.\r\n\r\nI call for the Bedroom Tax to be abolished, and in its place a high tax band for corporations that don't have their headquarters in the UK or blatantly use strategies to avoid paying tax.\r\n\r\n",
