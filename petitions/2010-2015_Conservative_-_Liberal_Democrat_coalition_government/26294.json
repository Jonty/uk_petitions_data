We would argue that those living on benefits who have refused to seek work should not have the same entitlements as those who are working to better themselves and contribute to the UK economy.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this petition is simple: that those refusing to work should not be given benefit payments in cash. Instead they should receive vouchers to provide necessities such as food and clothing. This would create an environment where not working truly does not pay.",
