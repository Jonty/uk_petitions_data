        "additional_details": "The current tax code is complex, onerous and inefficient.\r\n\r\nThere is no valid reason why the tax code cannot be simplified to a flat rate of tax over a certain base.\r\n\r\nOne can see the amount of debate created surrounding tax and the avoidance of it. If tax was seen as being fair and cheap then no one would bother avoiding it.\r\n\r\nAnybody earning below \u00a315 - 20,000 per year should not be taxed at all, and everything about that amount can be taxed at a flat 15%.\r\n\r\nYou only have to look at Singapore which has a fantastic social security net and yet has low rates of flat tax.\r\n\r\nThe big benefit in this is of course the reduction in bureaucrats required to administer a complex tax code and the added cost of constant investigation of so called \"tax dodgers\"\r\n\r\nThe impetus to growth would be great, having a high threshold of 15 - 20k before anybody is expected to pay tax benefits the most needy in our society and at the same time is a boon for business.
