        "additional_details": "To Mr Cameron,\r\n\r\nWith recent extreme nationalist movements overseas, and the radical Extremists 'Islamic State' provoking a terror act and threatening much of the West over interference within there countries, the British Government wants to yet again send our forces to 'intervene' with the our US Allies out in East / Syria, when a large percentage of the UK would rather not be involved! The consequences could face terror and threats on our own soil, we are basically asking for trouble by showing ourselves in there territory, when we could be securing our own boarders, and protecting our own country! We DO NOT as British citizens want to be involved in another war!\r\nStop our hard working Men and Woman loosing their lives in a war that we should have no involvement in!\r\n\r\nThank you.",
