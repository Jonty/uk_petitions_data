        "additional_details": "How to reduce electricity consumption, environmental pollution and CO2 emissions simple and cheap?\r\n\r\nGovernment should put ban on selling some electrical appliances with standby mode function.\r\n\r\nManufacturers will have to upgrade these appliances (TV's, computers, tuners etc.), to remove standby mode function from them, to be eligible to sell them in the UK.\r\n\r\n18 million households in UK waste about  6,6 billion kWh a year just to hold our home appliances on a sleep. For example, nuclear power station Hinckley point B in Somerset produced 6,1 billion kWh in year 2012.\r\n\r\nAnd all this electricity is lost when government is rising electricity bills to build new nuclear plants in UK, when expected electricity shortcuts by 2018 due to supply shortages.\r\n\r\nAs a result government wont need to cut manufacturing to reduce emissions and build more nuclear plants.\r\n\r\nUK will be first in the world to made radical decision to stop manufacturers produce and sell these outdated products.\r\n",
