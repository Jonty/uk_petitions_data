Are we an ungrateful nation that we tax people who are feeding us?\r\n\r\nTaxation should be abolished for all our farmers, then they can put the money saved back into the farming business and thus supply more food to the nation.\r\n\r\nAs for 'subsidies' these if any, should continue at the same time to allow farmers expansion capital and the latest machinery for faster production as well as to employ more people. V.A.T. should be abolished for farming equipment and other essential goods farmers need, 20% vat is outrageous.",
