        "additional_details": "There is currently an ever growing list of male to female transgender patients awaiting surgery via the NHS. There is currently only 1 surgeon availabe for the whole of the UK to perform the surgery. The use of private surgeons to clear the increasing backlog should be implemented. Many patients are becoming increasingly frustrated at the longer waiting times and some will no doubt contemplate suicide before this is sorted out.",
