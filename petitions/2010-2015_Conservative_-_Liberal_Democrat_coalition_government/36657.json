        "additional_details": "Following the death of my son, Harry, I would like to see the inclusion of scanning for vasa previa and velamentous cord insertion into the 20 week anomally scan.\r\nThis condition affects one in 2,500 babies and costs the lives of 400 babies a year, and puts the families through utter devastation.\r\nThe equipment is available for this scan, it is simply a case of adding a further 3 minutes onto the anomally scan for those women presenting the risk factors.\r\nSurely, the cost of neonatal care, bereavement counselling and subsequent increased antenatal for future pregnancies for those losing their babies would outweigh the cost of those 3 extra minutes for those women - and to save those precious babies lives.\r\n\r\nwww.harrycunninghamtrust.co.uk",
