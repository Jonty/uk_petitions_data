Staff employed to cook meals for care home residents usually lack training in terms of what residents need nutritionally and also what they may like. Food is a daily important aspect of care that is fundamental to enjoyment and medical care as an important contributor to skin integrity. The requirements of Care Home residents of non-Caucasian ethnic groups is invariably overlooked. It is high time that we addressed this often overlooked aspect of older peoples care. There needs to be bespoke national training schemes to tackle this. Food is often the focus that breaks up all of our days. For immobile care home residents this is often moreso.  ",
