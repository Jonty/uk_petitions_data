        "additional_details": "Since Sky took over the coverage of test cricket, interest in the sport has dwindled among the public.  it was taken off our screens following the fantastic 2005 Ashes series, a sporting occasion that really captured the public's imagination.  Now if you want to watch a few overs you must pay a hefty subscription to Sky Sports (who place different days of the test match on different channels, in an effort to make cricket fans pay even more money for the pleasure of watching).  Put it back on terrestrial television and save a great British institution.\r\n",
