        "additional_details": "This is to call for the reduction in price of non-alcoholic and soft drinks in pubs, clubs, restaurants and supermarkets to at least half the price of the cheapest alcoholic drink, also to cut the prices accordingly during so called happy hour events when alcohol prices are cut. Also to offer a wider range of non alcoholic drinks so that people can make an informed choice on whether they want to drink alcohol or not .\r\nThe Government go on about cutting binge drinking but the alternative is more expensive than actually drinking alcohol, for example a pint of cola based drink can end up costing more than a standard lager and this shows in the drink drive figures and also the number of people with alcohol related problems.",
