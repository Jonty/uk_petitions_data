        "additional_details": "\r\nI recently lost my father & was allowed 1 day off by my employer & a further day off for the funeral which fell on a Friday when I don't work. I therefore took 1 day off to grieve for my father of 40+ years which wasn't enough. Any further days were expected to be taken as holiday which were already booked for the year.\r\n\r\nI find it very hard to understand that there isn't a set bereavement allowance for immediate relatives. There is a mandatory allowance for maternity leave & there should be the same for bereavement leave. It should not be up to the employer's discretion.  I would be interested if you would consider introducing this into conversation at Westminster",
