        "additional_details": "Whilst in line in Sainsbury's, I was behind young men who were obviously military. They were queuing for cigarettes, One young man showed his military ID card, but was asked for some other form of ID as that wasn't good enough, this is wrong. He is good enough to die for his country, but his ID card, Which has his date of Birth & a photo on it, isn't accepted as a legal ID in stores. A terrible thing to do to our military, I demand that you enforce the legality of businesses accepting Military ID as a legal form of ID EVERYWHERE in the UK.",
