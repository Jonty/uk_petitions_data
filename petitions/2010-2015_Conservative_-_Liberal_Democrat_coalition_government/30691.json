We know the pain of loosing relative or a friend or a known person, so I can imagine how much pain a civil society in Syria is undergoing!\r\n\r\nI am writing this petition as a concerned human being.\r\n\r\nI request leading country like Britain to involve and initiate the talk with the world leaders to safeguard the innocent lives in Syria.\r\n\r\nSincerely",
