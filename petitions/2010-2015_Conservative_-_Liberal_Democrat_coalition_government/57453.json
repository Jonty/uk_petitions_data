        "additional_details": "The city of London is currently owed \u00a374,047,592. in unpaid congestion charges by foreign diplomats who claim diplomatic immunity in regards to paying 'taxes' but the congestion charge isn't a tax it's a charge. In the petition we call for the Government of the United Kingdom to ensure that these unpaid fees are paid in full immediately and to ensure that in future that all congestion charges are paid in full. In the same way the British public would be 'forced' to pay these.",
