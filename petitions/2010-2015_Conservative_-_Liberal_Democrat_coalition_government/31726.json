        "additional_details": "The confusion is probably due to the fact that, when importing into the UK, there is a duty rate and a VAT rate.\r\n\r\nVideo games and video game consoles are duty free but they are not VAT free. VAT is calculated on the value of the goods plus the international shipping fees and insurance plus duty fees. So duty is not charged but VAT is charged on these goods. Neither duty nor VAT is charged if the value of the goods ( not including shipping and insurance) does not exceed \u00a318.\r\n\r\nBut beginning on January 4th, 2011the VAT on retail products has increased 2.5% to 20% which includes video games and video game consoles.\r\n\r\nReduce this price by signing this petition!",
