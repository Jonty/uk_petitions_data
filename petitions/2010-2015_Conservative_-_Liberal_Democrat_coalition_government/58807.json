Threatening to breakup of Pakistan is not politics but a crime against country.\r\n\r\nUK citizen is asking for breaking Pakistan this Problem should be taken seriously,why your citizen is  interfering in our national matter\u201d.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will not allow anyone to use your soil to spread hatred\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nMian Hammad Hassan\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dawn.com/news/1078153/altaf-threatens-separate-province-for-urdu-speaking-sindhis",
