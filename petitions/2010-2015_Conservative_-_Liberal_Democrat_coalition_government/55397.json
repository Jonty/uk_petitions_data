Choice can be created by allowing people to do a 'community activity' (CA) in return for support\r\n\r\nAssuming a person's JSA entitlement is \u00a3100 p/w, a top-level outline is as follows:\r\nMonths 1-2: 15 h/wk job searching (JS) for support\r\n\r\nThereafter, give people 3 options:\r\n1 \u2013 7.5 h/wk JS and 7.5 h/wk CA for \u00a3100 p/w\r\n2 \u2013 15 h/wk CA for \u00a3100 p/w (more suitable when high unemployment)\r\n3 \u2013 12 h/wk JS for \u00a375 p/w (ensures CAs are not imposed)\r\n\r\nAllow a wide variety of activities to be considered as a CA. Have a decentralised scheme with much scope for people to find suitable CA's. Evidence of completion must be given\r\n\r\nPositives\r\nThose doing CAs will increase self-confidence, develop skills and network in the community, thus improving their job prospects\r\n\r\nTaxpayers will receive better value for money, directly benefiting from CAs in their community\r\n\r\njwilkinson1977.wordpress.com",
