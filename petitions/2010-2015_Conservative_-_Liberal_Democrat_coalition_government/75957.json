Adams is incompetent at his job which will ultimately result in us becoming a part time club. If you truly love Tranmere Rovers please sign this petition. Adams needs to go, bring somebody else in who can lift the dressing room spark a bit of belief and fight into the players.\r\n\r\nTogether we can stay up. Show your support and sign this #AdamsOut",
