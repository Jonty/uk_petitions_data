        "additional_details": "Some scientists are saying the UK has too many deer and that culling is necessary. But talk of a better solution seems missing from the discussion.\r\n\r\nA BBC report explains that the UK has more deer now than any time since the last Ice Age, and expanding populations threaten woodland vegetation and birds, as well as crops. The recommendation to cull comes from a study by Journal of Wildlife Management, which suggests as many as 750,000 be shot yearly.\r\n\r\nWhile researchers at the University of East Anglia suggest the culling can be done \"ethically\" if the meat is used for food, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals wants to be sure \u201cstrong science\u201d supports such an action.\r\n\r\nSome say culling in Scotland is already too aggressive. But if population control is necessary, shouldn\u2019t all alternatives be exhausted before such drastic steps are taken - like contraception, for example?\r\n\r\nPlease reconsider this drastic action and consider this option.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n",
