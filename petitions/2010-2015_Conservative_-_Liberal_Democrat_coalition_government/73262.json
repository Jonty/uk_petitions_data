(2014).\r\nChristmas Eve in particular was dire.\r\nThe schedules are full of repeats, animated films one after another, Compilations/out takes cobbled together to fill an hour of TV; and films only recently shown before Christmas.  There are increasing numbers of people spending Christmas alone as well as many older people for whom TV is, sadly, their main interaction.  The quality of TV programmes, with just a few hours exception, is woeful and needs addressing.",
