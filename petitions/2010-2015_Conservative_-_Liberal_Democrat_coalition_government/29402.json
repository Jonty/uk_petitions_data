        "additional_details": "The current Diagnosis period for brain Tumours is on average 4 months. In most cases it is in excess of 9 months. This is costing lives. There is a reluctance in the NHS and in Europe to offer timely MRI's due to the cost. The financial managers don't feel they have the budget/capacity to offer freely an MRI to patients. The current cost of an MRI to the NHS is about \u00a3250, This is not that expensive when compared to cost of revisits to the GP. Economy of scale would reduce this cost.It is stongly believed that the earlier you detect a Brain tumour, the more chance there is of curing it. The current system has no definitive time scale for a Doctor to comply with initial diagnosis. MRI is the only absolute way of detecting a tumour. Legislation should impose one month max to detect a tumour via MRI.",
