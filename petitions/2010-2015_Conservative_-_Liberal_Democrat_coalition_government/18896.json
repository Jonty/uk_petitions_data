However, it is illegal to listen to these frequencies due to an outdated law.\r\n\r\nThese frequencies can provide essential training to General Aviation, and Commercial Aviation, pilots on the safe and correct use of Radiotelephony.\r\n\r\nWith the above in mind, I would say it is a matter of good safety practice that the laws in regards to listening to these frequencies should be relaxed immediately.",
