        "additional_details": "The Ownership of Pistols was repealed after the Dunblane tragedy by New Labour as a knee jerk reaction to the devestating occurence. The idea was to rid society of gun men. The law has done no such thing and yet has taken away the liberty of law abiding users of pistols. Reverse the law and allow those of us who enjoyed our sport to regain one of the liberties taken away from us under New Labour. The law was not thought out in the first place and we still have gun crime in this country. No one needs the use of fully automatic weapons but the use of pistols for sporting purposes was a tragic loss.",
