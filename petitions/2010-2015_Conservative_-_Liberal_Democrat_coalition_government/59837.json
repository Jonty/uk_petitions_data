        "additional_details": "NHS provides guidance as to what is displayed on the main information board, therefore sometimes due to lack of space important information about support groups/charities does not get displayed.\r\n\r\nThis information could be the support/advice/information that an NHS patient needs to help them to understand & deal with their condition alongside the medical treatment being received. Department of Health should provide guidelines that all GP surgeries should have a designated wall space for these information boards\r\n\r\nIt is underestimated how much support local independently run support groups do for the community and how charities support people with certain conditions. Being able to speak to someone else living with the same condition can be a great deal of support and not only this is some cases a lifeline.\r\n\r\nLet's petition for allocated space for these important information boards which will benefit the community in all GP surgeries around the UK!",
