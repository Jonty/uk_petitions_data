They will gain more powers that will enable them to bring further prosperity to Scotland and it's people.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to follow our Scottish neighbours and fight for more control over our own region. The Scotland Act was still in its junior days when a North East Assembly was rejected in 2004, however we have now seen the benefits of devolution and it is now time to bring those benefits to the North East and control our own future.\r\n\r\nWe can use devolution to bring in measures to tackle the region's high unemployment rates, improve education in the area and improve transport links (look no further than HS2 to see how much we are neglected in the North).\r\n\r\nLet's push for change. Let us have this conversation. Let us forge a better future for the North East.",
