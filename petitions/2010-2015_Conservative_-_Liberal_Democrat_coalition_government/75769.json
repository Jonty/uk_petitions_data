        "additional_details": "A sausage roll is typically a sausage wrapped in puff pastry, so what happens when you want to ask for a sausage in a roll (a bread roIl)? Do you ask for a sausage bap? A sausage butty? When we ask for a bacon roll,  we simply as for a bacon roll! There is too much confusion here. We strongly believe that the sausage roll should be re-named. Perhaps instead we should call it the sausage pastry or even the sausage turnover. I think this would help the issue and put customer experiences at ease.\r\nA dear friend of mine had a bad experience of receiving a sausage wrapped in pastry when all he wished for was a sausage in a roll, I really hope this petition helps to erase any future sausage mishaps.
