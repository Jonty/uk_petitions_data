        "additional_details": "Marriage is indisputably the union of a person with a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife.\r\nThe Government said that homosexuals do not have the same right to marry, but they do, because everyone (of marriageable age and who is not already married) can unite with a person of the opposite sex as husband or wife.\r\nThe wrong impression of discrimination results from irrelevant and nonsensical talk of couples marrying, which would be bigamy.\r\nThis discrimination lie resulted in the Marriage Bill, ludicrously with two implied and contradictory definitions of marriage, so the Government has not redefined marriage but ludicrously added a second, contradictory definition of marriage, so that no-one can now rightly say what the (single) definition of marriage will be in England and Wales..\r\nWe ask the Government to renounce the lie that homosexuals do not have the same right to marry and to ditch the ludicrous Marriage Bill.",
