        "additional_details": "We the people demand the Government abolish the TV licence. We do not want to pay monies to a corrupt broadcasting corporation which has been shown to cover up and ignore allegations of serious  misconduct by its emplloyees. A corporation that pays huge bonuses to incompetent executives while cutting the quality and variety in programming. The BBC makes more than enough money through its commercial interests, for example satelitle/cable tv channels requiring subscription.\r\n\r\nThe fact that you now need a licence for devices such as mobile phones and games consoles means that the licence has become an entertainment tax. A tax that the British people were not made aware of. A tax that has not been openly debated. It is time for this outdated licence to go.",
