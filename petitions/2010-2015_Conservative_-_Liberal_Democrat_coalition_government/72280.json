Legalisation would allow prostitutes labour rights. Prostitution isn't a matter that is going away any time soon. Prostitution is considered a victimless crime. Porn is a worse form of prostitution, yet it is legal and it has been made safer by regulations. Also, it could bring tax revenue to the economy.",
