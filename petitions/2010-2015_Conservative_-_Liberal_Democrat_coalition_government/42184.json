        "additional_details": "The fans of Glasgow Rangers and all who is associated with it call for a full and transparent public inquiry into the whole process with emphasis on the decision makers at HMRC and their motives. And also a full criminal investigation into the steady flow of confidential information that made its way from HMRC into the media and onto faceless online blogs.\r\n\r\nRangers have suffered great damage as a result of the chain of events sparked by a \"fishing-trip\" by HMRC - their behaviour and that of several other parties - Lloyds Bank, the Murray Group, Duff & Phelps and the SPL - should now be examined by the relevant authorities.",
