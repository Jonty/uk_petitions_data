Lack of direct funding means that there is no location suitable and with the amount of signatures involved you will see that this is a viable enterprise for both tourism and local heritage.\r\n\r\nGiving all cultures on this Isle a greater understanding of each others history and culture and how it was and can be shared when we look at the core of each others identies during the two greatest impacts of the 20th centuary i/e World War 1 & 2 leaving a lasting legacy for our future generations.",
