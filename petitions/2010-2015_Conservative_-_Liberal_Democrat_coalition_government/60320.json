        "additional_details": "With the ever more severe weather conditions that the UK, and especially the South West of England now experience, it is time to consider reopening the section of railway between Okehampton & Bere Alston in Devon.\r\nThis line would have the benefits of linking the major towns of Okehampton & Tavistock with an environmentally friendly link to the cities of Exeter & Plymouth.\r\nIt would also provide an essential alternative to the Dawlish Sea Wall route to the South West that is so prone to damage and flooding with every new storm that comes in, as seen in January 2014.\r\nThe majority of the infrastructure is still in place, and the cost would be offset from the huge losses suffered by Devon & Cornwall every time the existing line is shut.",
