        "additional_details": "The battle by the government to stop the illegal use of cannabis has been failing for generations. The sensible solution is to stop spending money fighting cannabis and start making money from taxing its legal sale. We are struggling as a country to come to terms with huge rises in the cost of living when people growing and selling cannabis are making huge tax free illegal earnings. The creation of a legal industry producing, selling and taxing the use of cannabis could help solve our financial problem with huge tax revenues, job creation and reduction of the cost of investigating and prosecuting people in relation to these offences. The market for cannabis is always growing and it's about time the government reacted sensibly to the evidence and used it to their advantage. ",
