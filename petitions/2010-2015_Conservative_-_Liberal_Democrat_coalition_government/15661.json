        "additional_details": "Type 1 diabetes is a chronic life-threatening disease. Currently there is huge variation between the level of support and care our children receive at school. Some schools do this admirably however many schools do not. There are many instances where parents have had to change their child's school, or continually interrupt their day to go into school to help care for their child when staff display varying levels of unhelpfulness.  This discrimination against children with Type 1 Diabetes must stop.  They must be treated just as fairly as other children with medical or special needs within schools.\r\nWe want guidelines submitted to Education Authorities & Schools regarding care for Type 1 Diabetes\r\nWe want these guidelines to specify adequate minimum levels care and support staff members MUST supply children to help them manage in school.\r\n",
