        "additional_details": "With all departments taking cuts it is noticeable the number of UK political jobs have not been cut. In the USA there are 100 Senators and 441 Representatives representing 311 million people. In the UK we have 650 MP's and 827 Lords representing 61 million. This disproportionate number of politicians to population is costly and reducing these numbers to say fifth, removing 520 MPs and 660 Lords would save the UK taxpayer a minimum of 34 million pounds not accounting for expenses/allowances and pensions, the figure probably being closer to a 100 million saving.\r\n\r\nSeeing UK's politicians surrender such posts would provide a moral example to the country as well provide a considerable long term saving.
