        "additional_details": "Following the recent London Riots and Looting it is apparent that there is a sheer lack of discipline in our country.\r\n\r\nGone are the days where parents weren't afraid to chastise their children, albeit safely, gone are the days the Police were respected by the community, gone are the days teachers were allowed to discipline children. We need to bring back discipline and respect. Perhaps a call for National Service to be brought back into force is in order. There are a minority of UK residents who need to be taught loyalty, honour and respect.\r\n\r\nPlease sign if you agree that Human Rights  should be taken away from criminals and replaced with a harsher punishment within a harsher envronment (for example, prisons should not be like 5 star hotels but more like the accomodation some of our Service Personnel are currently living in!).",
