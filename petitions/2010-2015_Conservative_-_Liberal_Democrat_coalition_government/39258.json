Places where they cant wander the streets. Activities, homework, shown how to, as if there was another parent there to pick up the slack from my ripped apart 24 hours of every day.\r\nAdults need to feel they have the power to control the child and guide that child through their younger years to an adult, teaching them the right and wrong and letting them grow in that knowledge, not just to let them run free with no one to guide and nurture. Give us back our power to discipline and restrain our children with the support we really need, not the support you think we need at arms length. Government funded support centres in the local community with structure and compulsory attendance for unsupervised young adults.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
