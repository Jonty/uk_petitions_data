        "additional_details": "It is a gross immorality that our government allows people who have professed a need for all of us to be destroyed as part of their raison d'etre to take money from the UK Legal Aid Fund to defend and fight their deportation from the country that they hate and wish to destroy.  This has absolutely NOTHING to do with the legality of the situation but has a huge amount to do with the morality of the situation.  Any politician who votes for paying the legal costs of people who wish to destroy us and our society using money taken from citizens under threat of criminalisation demonstratres a HUGE lack of morality on their part and should immediately resign and ask their electorate their view on the matter thru a by-election.",
