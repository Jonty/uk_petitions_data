        "additional_details": "I am writing this e-petition in the hope of creating one single Anti-Bullying policy for all schools to adopt when dealing with incidents of bullying.\r\n\r\nCurrently all schools create their own Anti-Bullying policy and these vary so much between schools in the way they are written, the way they are administered and their success as a deterrent. In any one town there may be numerous versions of Anti-Bullying policies with all schools dealing with bullying in different ways.\r\n\r\nI believe that if we had one lawful policy that all schools would use with a common tone and language then they would adopt a more cohesive approach that all parents would understand and abide with.\r\n",
