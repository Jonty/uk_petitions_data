This is cruel to the animal, and is unacceptable in a humane society.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why this needs to take place to satisfy a minority religion, as stunning is permitted under Islamic law.\r\n\r\nThe government should bring forward legislation banning ANY method of slaughter that does not involve some form of stunning before slaughter.",
