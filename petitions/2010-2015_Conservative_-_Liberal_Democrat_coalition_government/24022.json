Even a small amount will make people feel like they have more money and feel more secure, thus spend more.\r\n\r\n2) Reduce VAT. We're still on 20%. It's too much. Take it back down to 17.5% and make sure it's reflected in prices in stores. People will feel they are getting a better deal and so spend more, and companies will spend less on stock, making them feel more confident about their budgets and targets.\r\n\r\n3) Scrap sunday opening hours. Let stores open whenever they want. This will create more jobs as stores stay open longer, and people will be able to shop when they want rather than when they're able to.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile not directly putting tax into the Government's pockets, I think these measures would stimulate the economy and create jobs.\r\n",
