        "additional_details": "I believe that it is wrong that  travel agents, Theme Parks, Eataries zoo;s anywhere you have to pay admission  dictate their own age limits for tickets. Other business' must obide by the legal adult age eg pubs and newsagents. These Companies should not and can not be allowed  to charge children an adult price untill that child has reaced the legal adult age of 18 I propose that new restrictions are put in place to stop the public being over charged and all children should be treated as such., children & teenagers, which aswell as the current legal age for adults are enforced across all industries. Therefore stopping companies making up age limits and new price brackets.",
