In addition, many pets are traumatized.  Fireworks in October/November sometimes go on every night for weeks, usually in people's back gardens where they pose a fire and health and safety hazard.\r\n\r\nIn addition, as fireworks are quite often used for no particular reason it is a very anti social activity often causing noise disturbance until very late at night or early morning.  Legislation prohibiting their use after 11pm is totally ineffective and is rarely, if ever, enforced.\r\n\r\nThese are dangerous items and, as such, should only be used at organised events by people trained to use them.  This would lead to a decrease in injuries resulting from their use every year, and a decrease in anti-social behaviour.\r\n\r\nThose buying fireworks should be licensed. ",
