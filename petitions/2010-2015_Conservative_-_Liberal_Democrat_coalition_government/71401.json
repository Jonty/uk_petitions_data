In order for our economy to thrive, the Government have a responsibility to eliminate unregistered traders operating.\r\n\r\nA public register would enable legitimate business owners to 'flag' potential rogue traders to Government for investigation. It would also allow members of the public to check that the trader was properly registered to trade also. Giving some peace of mind and traceability.\r\n\r\nIt is in the business owners, would be self employed persons, the governments & the publics interests to implement an open and fair register.\r\n\r\nMany people are selling to the public without registering as self employed, putting those who are registered and do pay their taxes at a disadvantage.",
