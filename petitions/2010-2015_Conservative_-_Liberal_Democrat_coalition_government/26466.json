It is very kind of The Goverment of Uk for doing that. Mr.\r\nPrime Minister my suggetion is this Money should not pay to the Goverment of Africa rather  UK Goverment should used that Aid to set up Contruction Company In the Continent to impove  the infrastrature in the continent of Africa. Mr Prime Minister doing so the the Money will not end up in the corrupt  politicians in Africa.\r\n I know that UK and the other countries that provide Aid for Africa are trying to help the continent.\r\nMr President this is only way to move Africa forward  with your Aid.\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\nJoseph Tetteh.",
