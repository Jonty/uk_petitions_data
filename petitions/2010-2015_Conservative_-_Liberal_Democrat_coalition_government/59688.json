        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, call upon Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, The Rt Hon Mr Eric Pickles MP to abandon plans for the rearrangement of the bugle call Last Post in a project to use music and songs from World War 1 to commemorate the centenary of it.\r\nBugle calls were developed to be simple, standard, and instantly recognisable by soldiers. Far from being a relic, they are still in use in today\u2019s British Army.\r\nWhile we applaud Mr Pickles\u2019 commitment to this commemoration by the use of the music and songs of the time, it is our belief that to rearrange the Last Post would make it unrecognisable to the service personnel it is used to remember.\r\nWe believe it would destroy the meaning of it and render it worthless.\r\nWe call upon Mr Pickles to recognise this and to withdraw his encouragement for any plans to rearrange the Last Post.\r\n",
