Several women have been subjected to violent rapes. This has been considered \"socially unacceptable\" by the communities that they live in resulting in the victims being executed.\r\n\r\nWe cannot continue to give foreign aid to countries with such atrocious Human Rights.\r\n\r\nThis country should NOT give foreign aid to ANY country that carries out executions on religious grounds or \"social\" grounds.",
