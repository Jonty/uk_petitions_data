        "additional_details": "This is a petition to remove the VAT on the bomber command memorial currently payable on professional fees and services, a \u00a3500,000 VAT bill has been charged for professional services on the building of this one of a kind memorial, the memorial has been entirely funded by public donations receiving no government aid and no lottery funding, previous governments waived the tax for charities such as the Princess Diana Memorial and the Band Aid single Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? Sir Elton John\u2019s 1997 charity \u00adsingle Candle In The Wind was given a \u00a32.5million exemption, Under the Labour Government charities could claim back VAT for monuments once they had got \u00adplanning permission, in January the Coalition stopped charities reclaiming VAT, which was then hiked to 20 per cent. The Memorial has been running for five years now, with the government constantly moving the goal posts, I believe this to be unfair, do you? If you do please sign.",
