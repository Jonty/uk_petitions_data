        "additional_details": "We believe that local Councillors should continue to be allowed to register for the Local Government Pension Scheme. The role of a councillor often comes at a real cost to a persons professional life, and their ability to further a career. This is because the role is very demanding and time consuming.\u00a0These issues combined are a perticular obstacle to younger and working people becoming Councillors. The removal of the access to a pension scheme with drive more working age and younger people away from local politics. Members of Parliament and their staff have a pension scheme, so therefore Government should continue to allow Councillors to access the scheme.",
