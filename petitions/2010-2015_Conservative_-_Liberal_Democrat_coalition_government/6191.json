        "additional_details": "Background: Mobile phone companies offer blocks of data, or include data within a contract or deal, to access the Internet.\r\nThen they restrict what you can use that data on. Some block certain data types, such as SIP VoIP, whilst some say 'no tethering' (computer connected to mobile phone for the Internet).\r\nAction: With regard to data, the mobile phone companies should not be allowed to block or reduce the 'quality of service', of VoIP or other technologies. Nor should they be allowed to restrict how data is used. Put simply, the consumer buys the data and then they should be free to use that data in any way they wish.",
