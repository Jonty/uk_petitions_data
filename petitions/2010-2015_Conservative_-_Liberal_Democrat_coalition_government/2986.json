        "additional_details": "It's time to think outside the box and start to educate the driver instead of exploitation via speed cameras and the building of thousands of signs and road hazards.\r\n\r\nDriving psychologically is a philosophy in \"how to think - and why\" rather that instructing drivers in what to do.\r\n\r\nIt's certainly not dull and boring and educates drivers (especially young drivers) in how to think.  Courses are based upon British Police VIP protection for everyday drivers and the bottom line is for drivers never to trust any other road user;  always to keep a vehicle in as much space as possible and to expect to be attacked.   It's fun and turns all negative thought into positive.   All road users learn to take responsibility for themselves.  There are no losers.\r\n\r\nPlease see Web:  www.driverawareness.com and www.driverawareness.co.uk\r\n\r\nThe government need 'blue sky' thinking and to completely over-haul driver education in this country - if not the world.",
