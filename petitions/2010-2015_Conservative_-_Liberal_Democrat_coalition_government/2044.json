        "additional_details": "I propose that the UK adopt the \"Opt Out\" or \"Presumed Consent\" approach to Organ Donation.\r\n\r\nUnder a system of \"opting out\" or \"presumed consent\", every person living in the UK is deemed to have given their consent to organ donation unless they have specifically \"opted out\" by recording in writing their unwillingness to give organs.\r\n\r\nBy establishing an automatic right to take organs, when the donor has not expressed wishes to the contrary, would lead to a significant increase in the number of potential donors.  This would also mean that relatives, or those close to a person, who has not expressed a wish to donate would be relieved of the burden of making that decision at such a traumatic time.\r\n\r\nPeople who still do not wish to donate any of their organs can actively \"opt out\".",
