        "additional_details": "As the amount of traffic and congestion continually increases a radical rethink of the transport network is required. Rather than spending money on a high speed rail link that in reality benefits relatively few people, use the funds to reopen selected branch lines. If, as a country we are serious about tackling congestion and carbon emissions then a wider public transport network is required to reduce the reliance on individual transport. The high speed rail link is just the modern equivalent of Concode and will do little but save a few minutes for a minute percentage of the population.",
