        "additional_details": "We all have crossed the road while the red running  man is visible, but have you ever thought of the consequence?\r\nIf there are children next to you regardless if their yours or not, please don't cross the road while the running\r\n  man is red. You are teaching young children that is ok to cross while vehicles are NOT prepared to stop. This is a child life we are talking about.\r\n While you are running across the road you don't see the child running behind you because you made him aware that he can cross. This is what happened to me, my daughter started to cross the road as others ran over and she wanted to go too, luckily I grabbed her in time yet the people who ran across the road had no clue that they could have caused a death .\r\nWe are all teacher in one way or another, don't be the silent killer.\r\nI ask for fines to be put in place if people are caught crossing the road while the running man is on red.\r\n",
