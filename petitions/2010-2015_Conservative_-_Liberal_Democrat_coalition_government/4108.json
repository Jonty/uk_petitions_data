        "additional_details": "As you may be aware, the government has currently barred the RAFs Red Arrows from conducting a flypast at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics. They state that the flypast would demonstrate military power, and that this is not what the Olympics is about. However, the Red Arrows are a national icon, on a par with the Royal Family and the red London bus, and to prevent them from flying takes away part of our nations identity. The Red Arrows are about more than military power or skilled pilots, they are an inspiration to thousands of people, and having performed in over 40 different countries they are the perfect way to welcome those countries to London in 2012.",
