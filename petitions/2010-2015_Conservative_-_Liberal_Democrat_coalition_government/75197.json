        "additional_details": "Under the current law any dog deemed to be a \"pit bull type\" can be seized and potentially put to sleep regardless whether the dog is a danger to the public or not AND whether the dog actually even has any pit bull in their genetics. Because of this hundreds of family pets have been taken away and killed. BSL has ruined many lives. Please sign this petition and hopefully one day we will be in a place where responsible dog owners can keep their dogs without fear of them being taken away.  I wish to see non biased education programs for owners and the general public and for proper research done into the dog (temperament tests, home life, what the owners are like etc)  before any dog is seized. This petition is not to allow dangerous dogs on the streets, it is to stop family pets being killed.",
