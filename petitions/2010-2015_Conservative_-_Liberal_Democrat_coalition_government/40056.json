        "additional_details": "My daughter is 9 years old and on Sunday 7th October we were in Brighton watching the land rovers that were there. A man took photos of my daughters bottom and back, where she was looking over the barriers to watch the show. He did not take pictures of anything around her or the land rovers that were on show JUST HER BODY. Some people saw and confronted him and saw the pictures were of her only. So they took his phone, And then called the police. The police came and took him away they saw the pictures and wanted to arrest him to look in to it further. BUT they were told by their sergeant, it was not a crime to take pictures of other peoples children in public and to let him go. The officer did not want to so he took him away to the police station, then let him go later.\r\nThis petition does not seek to ban public photography but does call on the government to empower the police to be given discretion in exercising powers to arrest and investigate those who act in this way at in public.",
