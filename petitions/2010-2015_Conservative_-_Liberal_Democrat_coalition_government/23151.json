Ministers have discussed increasing the number of online signatures needed before a petition is considered for a Commons debate from 100,000 to 150,000\". This should NOT happen, under ANY circumstances. The people of this country have little enough say in Gov policy, as it is. Peaceful protest is ignored, appeals are ignored, and now this. In addition, it seems that should an opinion be one which a party-majority is required, then a whip is employed to gain the vote required by this Gov. True democracy, indeed!\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that I do not want the gov. to increase the e petitions signature beyond 100,000.  I do not understand why this was rejected originally.
