        "additional_details": "Against all reasonable arguments to the contrary, and in defiance of both of the major employment groups for doctors and nurses the Cameron government is planning to forge ahead with the selling off of the NHS and the privatization of health care in the UK. Destroying one of the world's best health care systems and erecting in it's place an American style corporate owned business.\r\n\r\nThe people of the UK must stop the government from turning the proposed \"Health and Social Care Bill\" into law. Sign this petition to tell Parliament and Cameron that the citizens of the UK refuse to have their healthcare taken over by corporations.",
