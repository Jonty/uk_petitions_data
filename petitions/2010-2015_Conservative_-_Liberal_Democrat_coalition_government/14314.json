        "additional_details": "In 2012 the government propose to remove child benefit to higher rate tax payers. It has been called 'a fair tax'.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a couple both earn just under the threshold (total income = ~\u00a375K), they keep the benefit, while a family with a sole provider earning just over the limit (total income = ~\u00a340) loses it. This is simply not a fair tax.\r\n\r\nI propose that means tested benefits are used instead, it is the only 'fair' way.",
