        "additional_details": "I Believe that we should bring back National Service for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1.\tIt would mean that youngsters will be disciplined by serving a period in the services, and they would also treat them more respect for their fellow men.\r\n\r\n2.\tI would save the money we pay out on the \u201cDoll\u201d to a lot of people\r\n\r\n3.\tIt  would give the youngsters a better chance of some basic education\r\n\r\n4.\tIt would boost the services figures of manpower at this current time of cuts, at home but not necessarily aboard.\r\n\r\n5.\tIn this time of riots and looting anybody arrested should be put back into National service as a punishment (no matter what the age) as a deterrent.\r\n",
