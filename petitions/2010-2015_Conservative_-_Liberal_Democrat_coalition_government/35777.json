        "additional_details": "The Labour government for 13 years blocked the automatic re-assessment of parliamentary constituency boundaries which caused significant demographic imbalances in the democratic vote for MP's and in a final insult to democracy in the UK allowed a minority Labour government to enter parliament with an overwhelming majority of seats.\r\n\r\nThe Lord's are currently able to maintain a fully effective role as a second chamber of revision and were able to address this issue for the period of the last government\u2019s shambolic final term.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests the Cabinet Office, and the Deputy Prime Minister specifically, to support the boundary changes before and even consider this as a pre-condition of any decision on Lords reform.\r\n",
