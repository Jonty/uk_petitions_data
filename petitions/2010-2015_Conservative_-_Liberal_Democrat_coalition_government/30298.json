        "additional_details": "In October 2010, the Equality Act came into force which protected a woman's rights to breastfeed her baby in public, without the fear of discrimination, harassment or victimisation.\r\n\r\nDespite the implication of the act, breastfeeding mothers continue to be discriminated against, not just by companies, but from members of the public and even public figures on television programs.\r\n\r\nWe ask that broadcasters write and adhere to strict guidelines for articles of breastfeeding to make sure women are not ridiculed for wanting to feed their babies, when and where they choose.\r\n\r\nWe ask that additions be made to the Equality Act that will:\r\n1. Make it an offence for anyone to victimise a nursing mother, ask/tell them to stop breastfeeding, making sexual remarks or to ridicule the woman, which lead the mother to feel she is doing something wrong.\r\n2. To make it an offence for broadcasters to allow any television/radio programs from making any remarks listed in item 1.",
