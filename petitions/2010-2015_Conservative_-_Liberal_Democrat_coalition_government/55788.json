        "additional_details": "I disagree with the new Government plans to introduce a new driver licensing scheme that would increase the age of those able to obtain a full licence with only a year's experience.\r\n\r\nIn New Zealand, a similar scheme is in place, where young people can begin driving at 16 on a Learner licence, having passed their theory test and only driving with a supervisor. After 6 months driving they can apply for Restricted licence, with a curfew and driving with no passengers. A full licence is obtained at 18, or 17.5 following a driving skills course.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nzta.govt.nz/licence/getting/cars/car-licence.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this system would work better, as young drivers are forced to get more experience, but will be able to pass their tests at near the UK current age. It will also encourage more people to take advanced driving skills courses.",
