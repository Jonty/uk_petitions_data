Current postcodes have area of the Highlands, Moray and Aberdeenshire still considered as being remote and the postal charges are much higher for these areas. The government should now look at these area ie Elgin In Moray is hit by higher charges whereas just 20 miles along the road in Aberdeenshire they can often enjoy free postage or at a cheaper rate even though they might be on the coast and more remote than Elgin.\r\nI want the Government to issue Moray with it's own set of postcodes as the IV ones we have are considered as the highlands and islands.
