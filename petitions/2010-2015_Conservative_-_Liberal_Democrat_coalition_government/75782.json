A general air of unaccountability for incompetent behaviour seems to pervade the DVLA.\r\n\r\nAs a government agency the DVLA should be accountable and able to demonstrate why decisions have been taken in individual cases without tax payers having to resort to contacting MPs or overcoming similar, unnecessary hurdles.",
