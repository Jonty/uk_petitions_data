        "action": "Stop the government changing from GCSE to English Baccalaureate",
        "additional_details": "The proposed plan is to abolish the current GCSE system by 2015 in favour of an 'English Baccalaureate.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will involve preventing any coursework, field work, lab based work or extended essay pieces from counting towards the final mark.\r\nIt also prevents modular or any form of continued assessment.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said by the welsh education minister that this is 'a step backwards for England.'\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst some reform may be necessary in school education this is certainly not it and it is strongly believed this will lower education and attainment standards in the UK, decrease attendance and attainment at university and damage innovation and the UK as a global economy.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis petition is to request that the government does not make the proposed changes to the GCSE system.",
