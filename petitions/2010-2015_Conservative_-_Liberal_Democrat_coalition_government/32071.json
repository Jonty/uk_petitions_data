Plans for airport expansion continue, despite studies indicating a shortage of aviation fuel by 2026.\r\nThe Government should:\r\n\u2022Summarise the authoritative reports available (UKERC, ITPOES, US DoE, Bundeswehr, US Joint Forces Command/JOE, Australian IoE, IEA, oil companies such as Total, and confidential sources) to assess the risks of an early peak in global oil production\r\n\u2022Critically, recognise the urgency of programming to reduce oil dependency - faster than gradual Climate Policies, but requiring decades of preparation\r\n\u2022Risk-assess policies such as airport expansion and roadbuilding according to their vulnerability to Peak Oil\r\n\u2022Devise information, identify, co-ordinate and engage with institutions capable of planning and organising a coherent Oil Exit Programme\r\n\r\n\r\n ",
