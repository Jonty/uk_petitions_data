        "additional_details": "As is stands sufferers of coeliac disease have no chance of getting into any branch of the armed forces, due to the fact that gluten free ration packs aren't provided by the military unlike kosher, vegetarian or halal packs.\r\nThey are available though, and specifically to the armed forces\r\nHere is one website i have found selling gluten free military ration packs.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.westlerfoods.com/Military-Rations.html\r\nand to quote from their homepage\r\n\"We have a close relationship with the ministry of defence and all of our meals meet the strictest requirements....\" \"Special dietary requirements catered for, including Halal, Gluten Free and vegetarian.\r\n\r\nSo if, according the nhs website, every 1 in 100 uk citizens is a sufferer of coeliac disease (and possible even more going untreated/undiagnosed) wouldn't it be better to be able to accommodate their dietary needs in the forces rather than turn them all away.\r\n\r\nBring in Gluten Free rations packs, allow coeliac's to serve.",
