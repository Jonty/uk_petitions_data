        "additional_details": "Medical marijuana has a lot of benefits and is more easily produced.\r\n\r\nSome of the benefits are that it can help or even prevent things i.e. glaucoma, epilepsy, cancer, anxiety, depression, obsession, insomnia, Alzheimer, chronic pain, schizophrenia, hepatitis C, inflammatory bowl disease, menopausal/period pain and arthritis.\r\n\r\nThere are more benefits of the drug, and different strains with higher and lower of different content of the plant i.e. THC, CBD.\r\n\r\nWhat I want the United Kingdom to gain from this is the medical advantage of it. I would like marijuana to be medically legalised and for possession and use of the plant to be legal for someone who has a medical prescription from a doctor. I would like marijuana to be grown by a medical department and prescribed to people who medically require it, making a cheaper and better creation of needed medication.",
