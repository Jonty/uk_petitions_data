        "additional_details": "Request for the government to review and amend the current law to allow for the full legalisation or de-criminalisation of Cannabis possession. Marijuana has been classified by many scientists, including ex-government advisers as less harmful than alcohol and tobacco and also has many health and pain relieving benefits. It also costs the government millions of pounds to police the prohibition of cannabis, but is still used by hundreds of thousands of people across Britain. As can be seen in countries where marijuana has been legalised or de-criminalised, use does not rise as a result. It is time for the law to change and to stop making criminals of ordinary people. ",
