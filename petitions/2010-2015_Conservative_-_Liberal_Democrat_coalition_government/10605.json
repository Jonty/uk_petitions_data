As a country we tolerate thieving, drug-dealing, violence, rape & child abuse. Proof? EVERY time a person is arrested for an offence they get treated EXACTLY the same, be they 1st offenders or with 150 previous convictions. In the case of the latter that's NOT being tolerant; it's ignoring previous behaviour which indicates a propensity for criminal behaviour. So; after three serious offences (even THAT'S over-tolerant in my opinion) the suspect gets a trial based on \u201ca balance of probabilities\u201d AND immediately on conviction gets a minimum 2 years custody which they serve every day of doing work to support themselves. For every day of work they miss....another day is added to their sentence. Following release; every subsequent offence doubles their time inside. They would KNOW the risks...if you can\u2019t do the time; don\u2019t do the crime.    ",
