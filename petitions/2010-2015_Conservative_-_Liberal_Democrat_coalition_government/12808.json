Education can/will be continued.\r\n\r\n3. A trade/career will be learnt.\r\n\r\n4.  A choice of staying in the armed forces at the end of their service.\r\n\r\n5.  For those under school leaving age, ie, 10-18 and who are persistent law breakers, will enter National Service up to the age of 21.\r\n\r\nThis will instil respect, discipline and a purpose of worth, therefore ensuring they become the desired citizens.\r\n\r\nAs a result the prison population will be reduced automatically.\r\n",
