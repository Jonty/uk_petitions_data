        "additional_details": "We seek an urgent review of the application of Code C of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE) Code of Practice for the Detention, Treatment and Questioning of persons by Police Officers.\r\n\r\nThe murder's of Sian O'Callaghan and Rebecca Godden-Edwards have shocked the nation.\r\n\r\nWhile Halliwell has been dealt with by the Court for Sian's death, no-one has been brought to justice for Becky's murder.\r\n\r\nEvidence of a confession by Halliwell to Becky's murder was ruled inadmissible by the Court on the basis of serious breaches of Code C by a Senior Investigating Police Officer. Therefore, the Court could not be satisfied the confession had not been obtained by oppression (Section 76[2]{a}) and that to admit the evidence would be unfair pursuant to section 78 of Pace.\r\n\r\nConsequently, this terrible crime remains unsolved. we call on the Government for an urgent review of the operation of Code C to ensure injustices such as this do not happen again.",
