        "action": "Change import duty rules to encourage British manufacturing",
        "additional_details": "A British-based company importing electronic components has to pay duty on those components (most are made abroad). If, however, a device is made abroad from those same components, then imported into the UK, it does not attract import duty.\r\n\r\nA company manufacturing abroad, and depriving the UK economy of employment opportunities, effectively gets a tax break over those supporting the UK economy.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very tax inefficient for any electronics company to manufacture in Britain, and is a contributing factor in the loss of so many manufacturing jobs to overseas economies.\r\n\r\nHM Government is hereby petitioned to adjust the import duty rules to remove this disparity and to encourage the return of electronics manufacture and assembly jobs to Britain.
