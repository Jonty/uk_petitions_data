        "additional_details": "We demand that the government reverses the recent increase in the amount universities can charge for tuition and reintroduces the previous \u00a33000 ceiling. The current level of \u00a39000 will undoubtedly discourage those from lower income families from attending university, and will saddle those that do go with levels of debt that will have a negative influence upon their future life decisions. It will also force people to study vocational subjects and stop people from lower income families from studying arts related degrees. ",
