With an aim to cut the number of MPs that we currently employ. The number should be reduced to approximately 1 MP for every 200,000 people. At the moment we have 635 MPs in the House of Commons, 800 members in the House of Lords, 135 members in the Scottish Assembly, 60 members in the Welsh Assembly and 108 in the Northern Ireland Assembly. A total of 1738. And this is without entering the heady world of the European Parliament, QUANGOs and regional and local government. The ERC should be aiming at  a 1000 members or less.",
