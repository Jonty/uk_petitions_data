        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, petition the government to prioritise homes available today for citizens born in this country.\r\nI believe that immigration is fine, but people who were born in the UK should be given priority to housing currently available in the country, as at the moment there are a very large number of homeless people who were born in the UK and they could have a house to live in.\r\nThis would hopefully decrease homelessness and provide people who are born in the UK a chance to live somewhere rather than being homeless.",
