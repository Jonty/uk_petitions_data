        "additional_details": "I would like all serving military regardless of the length of service to receive the Queens Diamond Jubilee medal.\r\nCOMPLETE INJUSTICE: 70,000 Olympics volunteers are to be specially honoured for being 'the true champions' of London 2012. Boris Johnson wants them presented with a gold Olympic Service Medal with also the possibility of a special award of Olympic service from the Queen. Compare this to the thousands of military having served their country in a war zone not being eligible to receive the Queens Diamond Jubilee medal. The reason - sorry you have not served five full calendar years. An utter disgrace when did donning a pink polo shirt and directing tourists rate higher than spending 6 months and sometimes more being shot at.\r\nPlease support this petition and get justice for our wonderful armed forces.",
