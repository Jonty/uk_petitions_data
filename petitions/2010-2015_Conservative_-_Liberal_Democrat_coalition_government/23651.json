        "additional_details": "Discuss abolishing cost of LEGAL safe disposal of domestic and trade waste (excl. large enterprises) to stop illegal dumping of waste in the UK.\r\n1. Illegal dumping of waste (domestic and trade) costs vast sums of money to clear up, investigate and hopefully but rarely prosecute offenders (most of whom don'tt pay for the clear up costs let alone the fine imposed and avoid prison sentences for less serious offences) all costs of which are met by taxation (including the tax on people with vans who dispose of their waste correctly).\r\n2. ABOLISH charges for LEGAL, safe disposal of waste (both domestic and commercial up to medium business enterprises (2011 EU Definition) - excluding large enterprises (20111 EU Definition)) at approved centres throughout the UK.\r\n3. OPEN MORE recycling/waste centres across the uk, open 7 days  from 8am to dusk.\r\n\r\nGoals - save money, lower taxation and improve the environment (land, coast and waterways), no excuses for failure to comply.",
