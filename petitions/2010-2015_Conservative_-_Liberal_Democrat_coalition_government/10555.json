        "additional_details": "This is a petition to ammend the human rights act for those who commit crimes and take the human rights of others. Murderer's, rapists, pedophiles, theives, and any other kind of criminal do not deserve the same human rights as decent honest, hard working law abiding citizens. Punishment needs to be much tougher and prison needs to be a place where criminals wouldn't want to go instead of it being a glorified butlins camp like it is today. The act needs to be ammended to give the power back to parents, teachers and police so they can teach kids respect, right and wrong.",
