        "additional_details": "Defence Shipbuilding in the UK\r\n\r\nIt is in gross negligence to allow the strategic building capacity of the UK to be conducted in one location.\r\n\r\nThe UK government is established to defend the UK against threats of all kinds and do what's in British interests; it does this through contingency planning. It's is a significant risk to British security to allow the Portsmouth advanced shipbuilding capability to be squandered.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore the aim of this petition to encourage the UK government along with the MoD to establish Portsmouth as a site of strategic importance and work with BAE Systems to cancel published plans to close the Portsmouth site for shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nIt must also be noted that those employed in Portsmouth are highly skilled and work hard to provide the Royal Navy with the latest in advanced warships and to lose the skilled workforce is tantamount to destroying an already small skill base. We cannot afford to lose this knowledge. ",
