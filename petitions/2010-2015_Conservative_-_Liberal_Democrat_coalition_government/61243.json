        "additional_details": " In 2010 there were 10.1 midwives per every 1,000 births within the UK. In 2010 Afghanistan had 0.1 midwives per every 1,000 birth. When the Taliban took over they stopped many women from working and therefore the amount of midwives hit a fatal low and many mothers and children died from the lack of care that was available. This situation is not uncommon in countries living in war, I propose that wherever the government feel that the army should take action in order to protect people from war, they should also feel the need to take action in helping women deliver their babies safely and as comfortable as possible. In order to do so I suggest that the army consider employing midwives who have the skills to care for mothers and babies living in conditions of war and refuge. This extension of the British Army will provide women with the care that every women in the UK has the right to access, if criminals in the UK can access maternity care then why can't innocent victims of war?",
