        "additional_details": "The board responsible for setting the grade boundaries has made changes between January and June this year. This has lead to an inconsistent and unfair grade differentiation for students in the same academic year. The boundary levels have been raised so a student sitting the same English exam in January and June this year and getting the same mark could have different grades.\r\n\r\nThis is unfair to the students, schools, teachers and prospective employers. It has created inconsistency in results for student in the same academic year.\r\n\r\nI urge the government to request the exam board to reverse the boundary changes made between January and June this year and re-grade those students who sat the exam in June.",
