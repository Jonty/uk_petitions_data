The organisation has cited lack of Government involvement in the process of IP6 uptake, noting that no Government department has moved to support IP6 on its websites.\r\n\r\nFor the UK to compete in the global economy effectively, it must be fully prepared for the global shift to IP6, or it risks being left behind as the rest of the world moves to the only protocol that can adequately support the increasing demands of the modern Internet.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned call upon the UK Government to actively promote and participate in the move to IP6 in the UK, leading first by example - upgrade all .gov.uk sites to support IP6, as a matter of urgency.",
