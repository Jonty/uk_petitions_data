        "additional_details": "Silly stupid fines such as not providing information on a council tax,does this really need to be treated as if you're a criminal such as bringing big scary bailiffs to people's door???? And not accepting payment plans bailiffs using unreasonable and unaffordable fees. If willing to repay a fine through a payment plan courts should be able to call this fine back. This sort of thing can cause a lot of stress and worry especially to the hardworking people of today who pay in to this country.  Councils should also have compassion of the circumstances an individual and take it in to account as to why someone cannot pay or why information was not given instead of fining them.....this needs to stop as it's daylight robbery probably not just in my eyes but in the whole nation. I would also like to know where these fines go aswell??? PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION BECAUSE WE NEED THIS TO STOP AND WE ALSO NEED ANSWERS ",
