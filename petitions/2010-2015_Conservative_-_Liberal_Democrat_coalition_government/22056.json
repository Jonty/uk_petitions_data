The justice system seems to favour those who abuse (rapists, paedophiles and sex traffickers) by handing down limited prison terms. These criminals are even provided entertainment in prisons! What about those people whose self respect they have violated to horrendously? Recently, there has been some consideration of extending life imprisonment sentences to serious crimes other than murder. It is now imperative for the government to ensure that life imprisonment is handed down to those criminals who violate the dignity of women, girls and children's in such a horrendous manner and leave them scarred for life.
