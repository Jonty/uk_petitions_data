No company to be exempt,as not paying taxes is a form of economic terrorism and  these people should be jailed if they fail to comply. No more private meetings with the tax office and secret deals being done as these are detrimental to the health of the nation. Its only fair that multi national companies are put on the same footing as a plumber or electrician.",
