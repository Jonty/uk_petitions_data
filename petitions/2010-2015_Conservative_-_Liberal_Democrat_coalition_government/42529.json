This is legal mugging resulting in a loss of 25-30K+ . When politicians and bankers loose that much money so close to retirement then we will. Give us our promised pension back, we have worked for it and trusted the system. It was a contract we abided by and you broke. Young people will never provide for their pension now they have seen what has happened to their grannies.",
