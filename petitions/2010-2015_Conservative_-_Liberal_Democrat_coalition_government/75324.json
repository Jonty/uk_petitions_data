        "additional_details": "Our school education system really does make our country look awful. It brings shame. As a teenager of 14 I do get to truly look at injustice of this education system. For instance why should we be forced to pay \"voluntary\" fees just as our parents have forked our hundreds of pounds on uniforms and supplies to try and fit in with the taunting peers? Someone forgets a pen? A teacher gets mad at them and puts them on a lesson monitor. I personally go for in school counselling but I have encountered getting in trouble for not being in class. When was your education more important than your well-being, health and safety? The pressures alone of exams and the expectations of having no mistakes and being perfect students WILL take a toll on your future employers and if you don't make a change now, who knows of the disasters ahead. Please change this mess of an education system.",
