This building is not an official mosque and the dome was put on with out council or planing permission this properly is a home and should not be allowed to have such things placed on the building without appropriate permission . It is also a eye saw for the town centre  . So this petition will hopefully force them to remove the dome an keep within the British laws and rules  ",
