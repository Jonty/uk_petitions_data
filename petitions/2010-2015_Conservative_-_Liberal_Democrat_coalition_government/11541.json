If it is found that they are biased I.e they would loose a monetary sum for vetoing something in our best interest they should be banned from taking part.  If a MEP or the like is found to be ineffectual they should be sacked for poor performance as would happen in the private sector.  Failure should not be rewarded monetarily regardless of the circumstances.",
