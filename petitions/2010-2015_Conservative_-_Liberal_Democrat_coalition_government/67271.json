        "additional_details": "We believe that the proposal to pass control of the strategic road network of England to a \u201cStrategic Highways Company\u201d outside the direct oversight of parliament is a precursor to its privatisation.\r\n\r\nThe network has been valued at \u00a3111bn and would be a prize capture for foreign sovereign wealth funds, as has the nation's water companies. The new owners \u2013 whoever they may be -  will inevitably want to sweat their asset by the imposition of road tolls.\r\n\r\nThe Infrastructure Bill currently before parliament would allow this to happen.\r\n\r\nThis would be to the detriment of motorists, the environment and local communities affected by traffic diverting to avoid tolls.\r\n\r\nWe reject this attempt to introduce road-tolling by the back door and demand the government do not change the Highways Agency into one or more strategic highway companies.\r\n\r\n",
