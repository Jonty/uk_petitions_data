        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, as private citizens of the UK request a pause in the tendering, procurement and roll-out of the Emergency Services Mobile Communications Programme (ESMCP) on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n1. The Emergency Services are responsible for keeping citizens safe, healthy and reassured, and we have concerns that mobile phone networks are not good enough to help them do so.\r\n\r\n2. The Emergency Services need guarantees of service, and we have concerns that mobile network operators and mobile phones will not provide those guarantees.\r\n\r\n3. That the mobile phone networks will not provide guarantees of service for the Emergency Services in the event of a major event such as a G8 conference, major sporting event, riots, New Year\u2019s Eve, or terrorist situation.\r\n\r\n4. That mobile phone networks will not work in the places where the Emergency Services need it to work, and will not provide enough backup facilities in the event of failures.\r\n",
