        "action": "Make abortion compulsory for women under the age of 16 years old unless the pregnancy has reached 20 weeks or further.",
        "additional_details": "The abortion methods available up to the 20 week stage are simple and quick. These methods include taking medicine and having a five to ten minute procedure to remove the foetus. Last year more than 48,000 babies were born to teenage mothers in Britain. They cost the taxpayer an estimated \u00a3125million in income support alone every year, apart from other costs such as assistance with rent and council tax. Women under the age of 16 years old still have to attend high school and they cannot receive a paid job therefore women under 16 cannot financially and mentally care for a child. Making abortions compulsory for under 16's unless they have reached 20 weeks will boost the economy, lower poverty in families and teach women to use contraception at all times when under the age of 16.",
