Lords,(London)  Trent bridge(Nottingham), Edgebaston(Birmingham) Cardiff(South Wales) &The Oval (London again) .. This means that the North of England is left totally deprived of  ASHES Cricket . Grounds such as Lancashires Old Trafford in Manchester,  Yorkshires Headingly in Leeds & County Durhams ground in the City of Durham which have all undertaken massive investment & improvement programmes are left out in the cold yet again . The North of England is The Hotbed of league cricket yet it is ignored in favour of  the comfortable rich south yet again. This is totally unfair on the cricket loving North of the country & it should be addressed by parliament.",
