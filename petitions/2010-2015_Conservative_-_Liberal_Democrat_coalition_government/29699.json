        "additional_details": "I would like to put forward a suggestion. The new National Anthem for Great Britain should be the theme tune for Doctor Who. There is nothing else that would do.\r\nLet me explain my reasoning. The biggest flaw in the current National Anthem is that nobody can be bothered to learn it anymore. People just hum along, trying to look enthusiastic. But everybody\u2014and I mean everybody\u2014knows the Doctor Who theme tune. I even have several versions of it on my iPod!\r\nFurthermore, there is one emotion that stirs more deeply than any other in the British heart. The Americans have their patriotism. The French love\u2014if the Americans are to be believed\u2014their cheese. But we British\u2014all of us, not just the English\u2014have the intense excitement that wells up whenever Doctor Who is back on telly.",
