        "additional_details": "Unemployment should be reduced by creating jobs. Most of our industry has moved abroad, even such trivial things like call centres, and why?, the cost. It's a well known fact that the cost of living in this country is on the rise year after year. The number of unemployed people between June and August 2011 was 2.57 million, the highest since 1994. What hope does this statistic give our children in years to come? A lot of this unemployment is because of companies going bust because of sheer greed by people further up the ladder. Ever since certain countries joined the EU, many of our jobs have been taken by people that will work for next to nothing. This HAS to stop. And if there are people out there on benefits that can't be bothered to get a job, stop their benefits.",
