        "additional_details": "Barclays manipulation (actual not attempted) of LIBOR rates represent criminal Fraud of false representation and misuse of position as outlined in the Fraud Act 2006.\r\nIt is very clear that this is the case. Mr Diamond has admitted that reprehensible behavior took place.\r\n\r\nWe believe this is just one symptom of illegality within Barclays and demand Serious Fraud Squad investigation leading to conviction of individuals and the Company itself.\r\n\r\n'Scapegoating' to allow instilled illegalities to continue is unacceptable and the bringing of serious charges and sentences will do much to help retrain the Banking Industry.\r\n\r\nThankyou.",
