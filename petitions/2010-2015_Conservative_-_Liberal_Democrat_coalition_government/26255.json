        "additional_details": "The rules that restrict running a business from social housing (\"Council Houses\") are outdated and anti-productive in this current economic climate. Originally the rules were in place to prevent people from running complex businesses that could cause problems to the local area regarding deliveries etc. However, in the 21st century, businesses can be run over the internet with just a computer and an internet connection. Many people in social housing could make a taxable second income when given the option to run a small business online. This could create \u00a3100m's in revenue, all of which would be taxable for the treasury. ",
