        "additional_details": "Balance disorders are an invisible disorder caused from multiple sources including inner ear problems, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome.\r\nSymptoms experienced can be debilitating, often resulting in the sufferer being unable to work including  vertigo, tinnitus, bi/unilateral hearing loss, migraine headache, visual disturbance, sickness, memory loss, fatigue and much more.\r\n\r\nGaining recognition from a GP that the symptoms displayed are physical is a challenge, suffers are often labelled as suffering with mental ill health, and gaining a referral an ENT or Neurologist can be a battle.\r\nEven once a firm diagnosis is achieved, ongoing GP care can be substandard as their knowledge of balance disorders is limited.It is still common for symptoms to be dismissed as anxiety or depression related.\r\n\r\nFunding needs to be granted to this area, at least one GP should be trained in all surgery's to deal with the identification and management of balance disorders.\r\n\r\n",
