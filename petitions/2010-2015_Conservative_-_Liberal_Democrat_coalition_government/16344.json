        "additional_details": "Many children with epilepsy have transport provided to and from school the escorts are untrained and have no experience in dealing with a seizure should it occur, these journeys can be lengthy and as seizures are unpredictable training in the administration of buccal midazolan and rectal diazepam should be given, there are many courses available.\r\n\r\nCurrent protocol is to take a child either back home or to the nearest hospital, prolonged seizures that last longer than 5 minutes are in danger of causing brain damage, other complications may result in death!\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to ensure children with epilepsy can access education safely..",
