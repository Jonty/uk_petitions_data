        "action": "Reverse the proposal to close 39 Regional DVLA offices",
        "additional_details": "As part of a strategic review of the DVLA, the Department for Transport is proposing closure of all 39 DVLA Local Offices by 2013. As a vehicle converter, a large number of our vehicles are unable to be registered on the AFRL system. For example, EU legislation will require us to manually register all of our wheelchair accessible vehicles beyond March 2012 -over 600 per year.  Currently, we use the local office in Exeter. Closure would require us to register all of our vehicles by post adding days to the process, delaying  delivery of cars and resulting in huge cash flow issues and dissatified customers. The alternative? A 400 mile round trip to Swansea. The Exeter office in particular is located amongst one of the largest concentrations of car dealerships in Europe. The effect on these dealers will be immense, with inconvenience to customers and other members of the public alike.  This scenario will be repeated across the country. We call on the Government to reverse this proposal.",
