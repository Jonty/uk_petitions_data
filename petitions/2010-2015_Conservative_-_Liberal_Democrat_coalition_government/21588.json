We know that alcohol marketing plays a huge role in encouraging young people to drink too early and too much. The French Government understands this link and has introduced a series of regulations to prevent children being influenced by alcohol marketing. These include a ban on marketing aimed at young people and the sponsorship of cultural or sporting events. The UK Government needs to follow suit and introduce a Loi Evin for the UK.",
