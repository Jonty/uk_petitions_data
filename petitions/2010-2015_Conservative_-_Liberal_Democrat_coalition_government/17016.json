        "additional_details": "How many people know that our own government cannot cut fuel duty unless Brussels gives it permission to do so? We have the highest rates of taxation on fuel in Europe and they don't want us to be able to cut the level of duty unless they say so. The EEC has far too much power over what our government can and cannot do. Sign this petition to force our government, who we elect, to debate this issue and claw back the ability to make it's own decisions.",
