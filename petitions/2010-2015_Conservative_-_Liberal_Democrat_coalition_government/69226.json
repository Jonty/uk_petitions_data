        "additional_details": "On 31st October 2011 my 4 year old son died due to 28 counts of negligence at stoke Mandeville hospital. I ended up reading my sons inquest results in the local paper. I had to leave work due to a severe stress reaction as I had not only not been told about my sons inquest date but warned by the local papers about the story. I made a complaint which was never addressed to the paper. I had just got myself back on my feet when I walked into the local newsagent and see a picture of my son on front of the paper with the headline \" stoke Mandeville admit to 28 counts of neglegence causing my sons death. it had been out for a few days and my family and I had not been warned yet again. I feel it is morbid and disgusting that we were not even warned yet again. surely the law has to be changed so fathers and family members are warned before stories are released in the media, please help by signing this petition so this does not happen to know one else, thankyou.",
