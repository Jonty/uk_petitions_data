        "additional_details": "Travelling fairground staff are currently operating without any acreditered crb checks,And are coming into close contact with children on a daily basis And some even sit in the rides with the children alone when parents do not want to sit in the ride with their children,or fairground management stipulate that adults can not ride on the youth rides,Yet allow their staff to climb in to a car with a child they do not know And the child has never known And may have a distrust fr that member of staff.What spurred me to create this petition.Working on the fair with a member of the staff whom in fact was convicted for the abuse of a child.It was only when I raised the issue having first consulted the guys family whom confirmed the very conviction.Sign my petition to request our government to enforce a standard law that every travelling fairground staff be crb checked like that of static fairgrounds.",
