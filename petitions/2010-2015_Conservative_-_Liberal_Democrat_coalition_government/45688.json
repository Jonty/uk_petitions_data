Rather than distort what already works well, a wiser approach allows diversity. Earthly power cannot make us all rigorously equal, but we can create a more tolerant, fairer, pluralistic society. I don\u2019t want to see the word definition of marriage, which has served Britain so well for millennia, bent to suit cultural fads. Instead, let\u2019s again be creative& respect difference with a new legal state that people can, if they really wish, aspire to& claim for their own. Already too many words, i.e. queer or gay, are badly confused. Legal distinctions between these two states would be around issues like IVF, which is costly & unnatural, esp. in austere times when many babies are terminated. Govt. should better protect& look after those already living, so redirect resources (incl from licensing of \u201cgarriage\u201d) to support good adoption agencies.
