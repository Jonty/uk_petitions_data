        "additional_details": "It is clear that many of the long term unemployed have lost the work ethic.  The government should make it obligatory that these people undertake either voluntary work or work for local councils in order to receive benefit.  This system works very well in Spain and other parts of Europe.  Properly applied this would put these people to good use whilst promoting a desire to search for more lucrative opportunities, thereby reducing the burden on the taxpayer.",
