        "additional_details": "As a working parent, I either have to arrange childcare or use some of my annual leave when my child is not at school.\r\nSchool holidays are a part of family life and I enjoy the excuse to spend time at home with the children.  I do, however, object to the 'teacher development' days that seem to be held either the Friday before a school holiday or the Monday after.  These cause disruption and add cost to my already stretched finances.\r\nEnd this practice now, hold teacher training days during the 12 weeks of each year that our schools are closed and ease the burden on working families.",
