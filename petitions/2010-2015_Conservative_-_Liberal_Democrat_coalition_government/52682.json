        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, demand that Bedfordshire Police investigate the threats of death and violence made to Tommy Robinson and his family.\r\n\r\nFailing this, the Government must query why there has been a complete failure by Beds Police to look into them.\r\n\r\nArrests have been made recently of people sending only one threat via Twitter. Mr Robinson receives 100s every week yet, although reported, the threats are yet to be examined.\r\n\r\nThis, quite simply, is not good enough considering that Mr Robinson's wife and children could be at risk of serious injury or worse.",
