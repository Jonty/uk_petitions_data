        "additional_details": "For too long now the international community has condemned settlements as illegal, without taking concrete action to prevent them growing both economically and in numbers.\r\n\r\nThe UK government describes them as \u2018the greatest obstacle to peace\u2019.\r\n\r\nIt is a scandal that while Palestinian farmers are struggling to survive on land that has been in their families for generations, there are products sold in our markets that come from the very settlements that impoverish them.\r\n\r\nThe EU imports over 100 times more per settler than per Palestinian.\r\n\r\nGoods from West Bank settlements are produced on the back of house demolitions, land confiscations, and military occupation.\r\n\r\n(Info compiled from Christian Aid)\r\n\r\nThe British Government needs to move beyond rhetorical condemnations of settlements and enact legislation that prohibits the import of products from illegal settlements and the associated perpetuation of oppression and economic deprivation of the Palestinians.",
