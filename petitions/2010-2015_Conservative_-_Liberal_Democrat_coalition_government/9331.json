My suggestion would be to look at methods used on Brat Camp, understanding the psychology of these individuals and their punishment would be to work with those affected communities under an expanded community service program.\r\n\r\nPutting these individuals into prison or borstal will only introduce more hardened criminals in the future.\r\n\r\nThose that have benefits or are in work, will need to have funds redirected to pay the communities and give back by working on these programs.",
