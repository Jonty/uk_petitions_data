        "additional_details": "Many petitions have been made concerning young drivers' car insurance not being based on gender. Insurance is, or should be, based on risk. Statistics show that young male drivers are seven times more likely to crash than other people, therefore logically their insurance should be more expensive? It is hardly fair that those at less of a risk of crashing should have to pay the same sum as a member of the aforementioned category. I would like the government to introduce a scheme where insurance is based on individual risk. ",
