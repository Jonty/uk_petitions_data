        "additional_details": "The DfE Surestart Grant given to local authorities was ring fenced and thus used for the purpose in which it was intended i.e. supporting our youngest children and families, by providing quality affordable childcare, children centres, raising the quality of the workforce, narrowing the gap and early intervention. This grant has been replaced by the EIG and the ring fence has been removed. Local authorities are now not using it for the purpose to which it was intended. The government should therefore bring back the ring fencing ",
