        "additional_details": "David Cameron should recall Parliament immediately to debate supporting the US in targeted airstrikes on IS militants in Iraq. This is of vital importance not only on a humanitarian basis, but to prevent further destabilisation of the region, which will have implications for both the Middle-East and domestically. As a result of the 2003 Iraq invasion, the US and UK helped create the conditions in which IS has been able to spread like wildfire throughout Iraq. We have a moral duty to help our US allies fix this. ",
