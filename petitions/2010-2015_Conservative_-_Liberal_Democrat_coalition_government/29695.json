It works in Two fold (1) they will think twise following a big bill after a costly day out! (2) will send a message to everyone in the UK that they will need to drink sensibly.\r\nFinally why stop there? Air ambulance to mountine climbers who receive air ambulance. Very costly yet they pay nothing at all to the charity run service.\r\n",
