The TV industry is very different today, and people consume their televisual entertainment in many different ways, e.g. Via the Internet or on DVD. It isn't right that the public are charged a punitive tax to fund this body when Media is consumed in so many different ways. It is archaic, and the BBC needs to be freed to compete commercially. ",
