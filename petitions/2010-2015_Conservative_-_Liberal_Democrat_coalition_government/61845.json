        "additional_details": "Isn't it time that consumers were more protected when purchasing downloadable item (game, add-on, apps, book, etc). Currently if you purchase an item digitally you are tied by the suppliers terms and condition and this usually means that you can not get your money back if the item was purchased in error, or if the item doesn't work, or even if your child had clicked and spent a small fortune. Isn't it time that we, the consumer were able to have similar protection to the protection given us when we purchase any other item?\r\n\r\nAs an example a child purchased a game via a console store, said game wasn't for that console and wasn't a full game but an add-on. But the company from which it was purchased said sorry but we never refund as it's against our terms and conditions, even though the product could not be used as the console it was for wasn't owned!! How can this be acceptable by law today! ",
