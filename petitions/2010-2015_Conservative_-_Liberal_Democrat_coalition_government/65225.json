        "additional_details": "The Government must take steps to ban all products that contain microbeads.\r\n\r\nMicrobeads are tiny plastic pieces found in many cosmetic products, such as facial scrubs, toothpastes and shower gels.\r\n\r\nEach product contains thousands of microplastic beads which are typically less than a millimetre wide and are too small to be filtered by sewage-treatment plants. The plastic beads are able to carry deadly toxins into the animals that ingest them, including those in the human food chain such as fish, mussels and crabs, scientists said.\r\n\r\nBan the beads!\r\n",
