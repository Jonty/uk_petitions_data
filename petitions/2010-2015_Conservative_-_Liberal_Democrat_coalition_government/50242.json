It is intolerable, that in times as desparate as these, we are continuing to fund an event which is almost entirely political in nature, through bloc voting and promoting a \"European identity\" when the vast majority of the people in this country are begging for an in/out vote on the EU, it is also clear, that despite how talented the artists we put forward are, they will never win or even come close due to longstanding animosity towards Great Britain and the British people, expressed on the European continent.",
