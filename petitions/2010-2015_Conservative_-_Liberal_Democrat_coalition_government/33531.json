It is a type of government that the people will make the decisions for themselves rather than to have the decisions made by representatives. Another term used to describe Direct Democracy is pure democracy or \u201ctrue\u201d democracy.\r\n\r\nDemocracy also requires one to be accountable. The politician that is elected must be accountable for their decisions.\r\n\r\nI believe this to be a better way for our future considering the lack of accountability and perfidious behavior seen from our current government and previous ones over the centuries.",
