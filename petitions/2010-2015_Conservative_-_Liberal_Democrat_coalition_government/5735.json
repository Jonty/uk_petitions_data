        "additional_details": "RE has been discriminated against by not including it as part of the Humanities subjects on offer for achieving the English Baccalaureate. The government has received many petitions regarding this matter, including a debate in the House of Commons. However, despite the Education secretary Michael Gove promising at the beginning of the year that he would listen to arguments to include RE in the EBac, there is no evidence to date that our arguments were taken serious.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the press explained on the 28th July 20011 that ministers\u2019 stand by their original decision to exclude the subject.\r\n\r\nThis decision is \u201cknowingly undermining RE in our schools\u201d and causing it \u201cserious collateral damage\u201d, according to the RE Council.\r\n\r\nI therefore call upon everone who feels strongly about including RE in the EBac, to sign this petition in order to remind Michael Gove to his promise: to listen to public opinion on this subject matter.\r\n\r\n",
