        "additional_details": "\"Revenge porn\" involves sexually explicit images of a person being uploaded online without their consent, usually by an ex-partner as a way to \"punish\" someone for ending a relationship. Often these images are accompanied by the personal details of the victim, and once they are out there it is almost impossible to remove them.\r\n\r\nIn countries such as Israel, revenge porn is classified as a sex crime and other countries such as Brazil are beginning to introduce anti-revenge porn legislation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are currently no laws against revenge porn in the UK. We believe that the British government should be introducing laws to protect people from what is undoubtedly a horrific violation of trust and privacy.\r\n\r\nIf the perpetrators of this crime in the UK are allowed to continue to get away with it we will simply be perpetuating a culture that takes pleasure in the non-consent and humiliation of others, especially women, and teaching them that this is acceptable.
