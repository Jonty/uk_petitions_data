        "additional_details": "The US are corrupt, greedy, and quite frankly an embarrassment to the world, they are by far the worst people I have ever come across, and they spy on their own citizens for 'national security' and 'to prevent terrorist threats', those excuses are more than lies.\r\n\r\nThe UK are too worried about 'upsetting' the US in case it damages relations with them. relations? don't make me laugh, they bring nothing to the table apart from lots of food and crappy television, their citizens are brainwashed by their own government into thinking they are so great. Latin America have already ignored everything the US has said to them and are some countries in Latin America have openly offered Edward Snowden political asylum, I think it is only right that we do the same.\r\n\r\nGrant Edward Snowden political asylum in the UK. He is not a threat, he is not a criminal, he spoke the truth about corruption in his country and he is being branded by his own country as a criminal.",
