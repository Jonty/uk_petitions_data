        "additional_details": "We want the inclusion of Pashtun category in national census 2021 and other data collection systems to be able to address the issues and challenges facing the Pashtun community in Britain including deprivation, under representation, discrimination and injustices. Such data will be used for allocation of local or national resources and services for different communities in different geographic and service areas. The demand for inclusion of Pashtuns has been raised in the context of \u2018celebrating diversity, promoting social cohesion and facilitating capacity building\u2019 which means that if differences of people on the basis of which they are discriminated against are recognised and appropriate information and support is provided to such individuals and communities who are lagging behind then they can be empowered to play a more active, healthy and positive role in the wider society.",
