Give back the Palestinian people their land and comply with all UN resolutions and international law.\r\n\r\nThe UN security council resolution 242 needs to be implemented. This cannot go on and we need to make a stand.\r\n\r\nWay too many people have died or are living in constant fear .  If we don't make a stand today there will no be a Palestine left.\r\n\r\nThe more signatures we get the more we can put pressure on the UK government to recognize and help the people of Palestine to have back what is rightfully theirs.\r\n\r\n",
