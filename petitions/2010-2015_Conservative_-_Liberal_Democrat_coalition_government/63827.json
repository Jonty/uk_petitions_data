        "additional_details": "The speed limit on Hilton Road, Etwall needs to be reduced from 40mph to 30mph, leaving it is irresponsible and unsafe for all the children using this road to walk to school. The traffic at peak times makes this route hazardous, worsened by the narrow footpath and the bus services to and from John Port School. We do not accept the prioritisation of drivers on this road over the safety of our children, as saving a few seconds by increasing the speed to 40mph is never more important than saving a child\u2019s life! Stats show that fatal accidents increase with the increase of speed, in particular from 30mph to 40mph. There has been significant development with new housing, a new Leisure Centre and Children\u2019s Centre. It is not logical, practical, reasonable or safe to maintain the 40mph speed limit on this road. Government guidelines state that speed management strategies should always aim to protect local life. Please help us make that the case in our village too!",
