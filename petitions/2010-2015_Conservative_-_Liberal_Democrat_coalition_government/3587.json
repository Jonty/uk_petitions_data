        "additional_details": "To reduce government spending on benefits and allowances I propose it would be beneficial to have a maximum number of 3 children receiving child benefit for each claimant.   Any children above that number, parents should be able to support without any extra benefits needed.  Setting this limit could also assist in reducing the benefit trap faced by some and lower the culture of generations repeatedly having large numbers of children to raise income for their households.  Having above this number without income sufficient to manage a large family is more likely to restrict the options and life chances of the children.",
