Among the suggestions, repeal the ban on handguns in the UK and re-open shooting clubs got 15,783 votes on the poll on May 31 2013).\r\nHere is the link of a screenshot: http://gunssavelives.net/blog/uk-newspaper-poll-shows-brits-want-their-guns-back/\r\n\r\nLAW-ABIDING BRITISH CITIZENS were forced to SURRENDER their firearms as some sort of panacea, but violent crime in the United Kingdom has actually gone up!\r\nPeople must be able to fight back, and to defend oneself against an attack, it\u2019s best to have a FIREARM. Millions of LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS understand that PRINCIPLE and have obtained concealed carry licenses and permits.\r\nThe right of self-defense is the oldest human right, the ten year Clinton ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d was just as INEFFECTIVE against CRIME too.",
