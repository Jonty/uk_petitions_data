The prices are usually set unfairly at prices such as \u00a32.10, \u00a33.40, \u00a35.30, etc. Many people do not carry change and even if they do it's quite unlikely that they carry the exact amount of change required for the parking meter.\r\n\r\nParking companies and councils are using this to force users to overpay. This is grossly unfair.",
