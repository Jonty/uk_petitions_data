They still have not done so or announced any date to implement this over 4 months later. This gives an unacceptable commercial advantage to the Apple company and discriminates against those who don't use their products. I call on parliament to debate this and instruct the BBC to either implement the same download facility to android users, or immediately remove the feature from Apple products. ",
