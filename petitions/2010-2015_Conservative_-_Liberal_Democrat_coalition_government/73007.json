I have a three (nearly four) year old child that I have struggled to get into nursery due to nursery's having no epi pen training. Many had been waiting months for training to be given before my child could attend. (he has an unknown allergy, so its unavoidable). Waiting for months for this to be carried out is unfair on my child to miss out on going to nursery, how many other children are in this situation each year?.",
