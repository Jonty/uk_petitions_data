Police should have the power for the justice of the children who are being put through an unlawful crime, to be able to delete the images of the children to prevent the offender from committing the crime again.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like the government to do, is to be able to change the law for sexual offenders to have the images of their victims as well as images of indecent images of children to be permanently deleted from their computer.",
