        "additional_details": "The BBC is NOW an extention of the LABOUR party and of the Guardian newspaper. I have never supported labour and never bought a Guardian newspaper. Currently i never watch the bbc news, question time or any political program because they are so bias towards the Labour party. The BBC, Labour and the Guardian seem to get together to run the same stories. We should have an investigation to see how the BBC licence can be at a lower cost for NON labour supporters or NON Guardian readers.",
