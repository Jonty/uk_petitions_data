        "additional_details": "With the rising numbers of HIV/AIDs and STIs in the UK there should be more sex education provided to the young people in schools to raise awareness. This will play a key role in reducing the amount of teenage pregnancies and diseases in the UK.  SRE is a statutory requirement for all secondary schools in England and Wales but each school is able to deliver it according to their own standards. This means that many school children are leaving at 16 with minimal and ineffective knowledge. We acknowledge that teenage pregnancy rates are falling amongst teenagers, however it is clear there is a rise in rates of STIs throughout the whole of Western Europe and the UK. With budget cuts to all government agencies this will of course lead to cuts in the services schools can provide. We believe the National Government should protect all funding for SRE in schools. ",
