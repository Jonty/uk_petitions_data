It is impossible to base somebody's suitability to a role without meeting them first. Experience isn't everything these days!\r\n\r\nIn this day and age, we have so many options for interviewing potential candidates. What about a Skype interview? It's free, quick and easy. Or how about a test for the candidate? This would at least show their ability to produce work for the company in question. We need more alterntive methods of interviews because there are too many people being knocked back for reasons that all tie up into the 'experience' umbrella.\r\n",
