Earning money and paying tax must be seen as lifestyle-enhancing.\r\nWe wish the government to introduce vouchers to replace benefits, which can only be redeemed for specified goods types.  These will be applied to any current or future claim of an individual with a criminal record or court order for anti-social behaviour or violent public disorder offences.",
