        "additional_details": "I believe that the drainage infrastructure (and in particular main rivers) has been neglected thus exacerbating flooding.  We should establish a Royal Commission on Land Drainage to examine whether the capability of existing catchment drainage systems meet both current and future needs.\r\nGlobal warming and climate change is the subject of current debate.  We have no control over precipitation in terms of timing, quantity or geographical distribution but we do have the option to maintain and/or improve the land drainage infrastructure in order to reduce the probability of flooding.\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n",
