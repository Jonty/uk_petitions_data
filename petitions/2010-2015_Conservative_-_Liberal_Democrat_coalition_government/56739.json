Only she can choose to end it.\r\n\r\nIn situations where the woman wishes to keep the child and the man does not, allow the man to sign a document stating this and releasing him from all financial responsibilities.\r\n\r\nWhy should men pay for a child they do not want? A child whose existence they have no real control over. Having sex does not mean you want children, and accidents do happen. It is not fair that the next 18-20 years of the man's life is then dictated by the woman because of her choice. The woman's wants are obviously more important than the man's? Give men their freedom back.",
