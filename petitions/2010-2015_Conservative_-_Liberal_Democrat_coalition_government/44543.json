        "additional_details": "We would like to petition against the closure of HMV stores throughout the UK. We consider it to be a significant part of the British music scene and legacy as it was opened by Sir Edward Elgar, one of Britain's most  celebrated composers. Another reason against their closure is that it will put many people out of work throughout the UK In short, we have collected over 9,000 likes on Facebook who believe in the same thing as us. Thank you for considering this, I hope we can resolve this issue and save a vital part of the British High Street.",
