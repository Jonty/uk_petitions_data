        "additional_details": "Our proposal is that the government should find a solution to the biggest scourge of motoring in the UK \u2013 rubbernecking.  We\u2019re all familiar with the problem \u2013 endless and unnecessary queuing creating frustration and stress.  Rubbernecking refers to the phenomenon where drivers are distracted from normal driving by the visual interest created by the aftermath of a major road incident.  In 2006, over 250 people died and many more were injured on UK motorways in incidents related to rubbernecking.  Furthermore rubbernecking costs UK industries billions of pounds in lost revenue in addition to untold misery of having to sit in queues of traffic for what can be hours on end. It can also be massively disruptive to holiday makers and business people alike, due to missed flights and wrecked travel plans. We know there are systems out there that can combat this problem and would urge the Department of Transport to take action to alleviate this growing and costly problem.",
