        "additional_details": "Headmasters and schools should be given more powers to remove misbehaving students from their school. Head teachers should also have less paperwork to do when it comes to removing a pupil from their school. Too many troubling students ruin our children's futures by distrusting lessons continuously without being punished for it, it's about time headmasters were able to expel a student for causing trouble around the school. In case we have some lazy headmasters, the paperwork the head must fill in to remove a student should be significantly reduced. Schools should be able to remove a student with a weeks notice, without having to go through a long painful and useless process. ",
