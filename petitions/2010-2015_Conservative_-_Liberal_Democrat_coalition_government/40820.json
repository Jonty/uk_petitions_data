        "additional_details": "The East Midlands Ambulance Service is planning to close the New Mills and Buxton Ambulance Stations and create a new Ambulance ' Hub' on the other side of Chesterfield, nr the Motorway, which would mean that the Ambulance staff, who work in the New Mills/Buxton areas, would have to travel to Chesterfield, in their own time and vehicles, to collect their ambulance and then drive back to the New Mills/ Buxton/High Peak area to start work BUT if there are any 999 calls on their way back they could be diverted anywhere to deal with these emergency calls and / or if their is bad weather they might never actually get back to the New Mills, Hayfield, Rowarth and Buxton areas of the High Peak.\r\nWe, the undersigned, call upon the Government to direct the East Midlands Ambulance Service to retain the New Mills and Buxton ambulance stations and if they still feel that they need a new ambulance ' Hub' then to create one in the High Peak area.",
