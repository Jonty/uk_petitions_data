        "additional_details": "The current law as it stands does not act as a big enough deterrent to stop people using their mobiles whilst driving. I have seen an increase in people blatantly using their phone for texting or making calls with the phone in their hand. There is no fear of being caught and even if you are caught the punishment is not severe enough.\r\n\r\nAny driver caught using or holding a mobile phone whilst driving should receive a minimum 6 month driving ban which can be increased dependant on the severity of the circumstances. These selfish drivers are worse than drink drivers as they are soberly making a decision to put their and other road users lives at risk.\r\n\r\nThe current penalty for the aforementioned offence is clearly no deterrent given the number of drivers who still flout this law, and strict new measures need to be implemented with immediate effect in order to save lives and make our roads safer.\r\n\r\n",
