        "additional_details": "We want the Department for Transport, Rail Minister Theresa Villiers and Wimbledon loop MPs to whole heartedly reject proposals that Thameslink/Wimbledon loop trains should terminate at Blackfriars, rather than continuing through central London.\r\n\r\nThis is devastating for the millions of residents/commuters who have made significant financial and personal commitments to live by the Thameslink line precisely because it takes them directly into central London, particularly Farringdon, St Pancras and City Thameslink.\r\n\r\nTo take this option away from them - their familes and neighbours - in order to provide new services for other parts of London, Kent, Surrey and Sussex, which already have better and less overcrowded services than the Thameslink, and whose populations are smaller than the Wimbledon loop boroughs,makes no sense and is deeply unfair.",
