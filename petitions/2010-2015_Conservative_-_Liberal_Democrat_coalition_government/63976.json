        "additional_details": "Children are becoming sexualised at an increasingly younger age - there is a worryingly downward trend. We believe this to be largely due to the provocative lyrics and music videos of their music idols, many of whom are not appropriate role models for young and impressionable minds. While adequate laws exist to govern the broadcast of film and TV, we believe there are no suitable protective measures in place for the broadcast of music media.\r\n\r\nWe petition for an introduction to classification of music and music videos, with associated watershed to broadcast times.",
