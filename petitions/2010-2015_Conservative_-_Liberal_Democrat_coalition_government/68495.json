        "additional_details": "To bring the DVLA operation wholly to England and close the DVLA department as it is in Wales.\r\n\r\nTo provide jobs and revenue in England instead of it remaining in a part of the UK (that like Scotland)  ultimately wants indepandance from the government in Westminster, which by its very nature the DVLA serves. Wales desire for independance precludes it from being suitable for the DVLA remaing there.",
