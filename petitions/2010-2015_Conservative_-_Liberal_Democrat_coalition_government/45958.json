In addition many people want to cycle but are too scared to do so because of lack of infrastructure and aggressive motorists.\r\n\r\nA cycling tsar should be appointed to push through an agenda for change. We need new laws and crucially, modern, high quality and consistent infrastructure if we are to see more people cycling and to capitalise on our Olympic legacy.",
