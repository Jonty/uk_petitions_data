We suggest that pyrotechnics need to apply to be a license holder and are then able to host a set number of shows a year. Only license holders can host a fireworks display and purchase fireworks. As well as being very dangerous fireworks cause much distress to many animals including dogs. We also believe that those holding the display should have to inform home owners within a 1 mile radius of the date and time of the event so that they can prepare their dog for the ordeal.\r\n",
