        "additional_details": "The residents of Eccleshill, Bradford, are petitioning to stop the development in the opening of an Asian Bazaar on an old supermarket site.\r\n\r\nMr Saeed, the owner of the illegally run 'Tradex' site, has recently been convicted and fined \u00a390,000 for the illegalities, has been granted permission to open a bazaar despite numerous underhand tactics to ensure he secured the site. Residents do not want an Asian Bazaar on their doorsteps being run by a criminal.\r\n\r\nWith 3 schools very close, (a further two within a 5 minutes walk), to the site, an already congested area will become treacherous for pupils. Parking during school hours is already difficult without the added pressure the opening of a bazaar.\r\n\r\nThe buildings use should attract all ethnicities, be useful to the community as a whole and not have an impact on surrounding properties, schools, safety, businesses and the segregation of a community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
