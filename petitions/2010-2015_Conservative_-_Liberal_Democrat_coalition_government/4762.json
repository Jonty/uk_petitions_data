        "additional_details": "Now that we are looking at bringing part of the UK digital laws into the 1990s, we need to undo some of the harm that has already been done by faceless corporations.\r\n\r\nAny corporation that has taken action against the poor or disadvantaged needs to be made to refund 150% of all fines and costs to the victim plus a 10,000% fine.  Any solicitors involved, need to be investigated as some now are.\r\n\r\nAll relevant laws, such as the Digital Economy Act, need to be reviewed for excessive bias against the public interest and changed or repealed as appropriate.\r\n\r\nFile sharing of music, films etc is illegal and if neccesary, the authorities need to be involved.  The initial seed money for this can come from the fines mentioned above.  If people are sharing things not otherwise available, it should be noted that the corporate bodies are also responsible and need to answer for it and update their business models.",
