        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that children that are regularly exposed to second hand cigarette smoke are at greater risk of numerous diseases and are more than 3 times as likely to develop lung cancer later on in life. These health risks are still in effect outdoors as a study showed that a single cigarette can pollute the air 9 meters away. Research even suggests that even very low exposure can set the stage for lung disease and cancer.\r\nThe 2007 smoking ban in enclosed workplaces has shifted the problem of passive smoking outdoors.  Outdoor playgrounds are a children environment and should not be allowed to be polluted by cigarette smoke that has long been proven to endanger children\u2019s health.\r\nThe government is obligated to take action.A ban needs to be set in place to protect children in their local playgrounds. A similar ban is already in place in Queensland and New South Wales, so why not in the UK?\r\n",
