        "additional_details": "The Armed Forces will be uniquely affected as a result of the Unique Nature of Military Service which places demands and restrictions upon those serving, unparalleled elsewhere in the Public Sector.\r\n\r\nThis, together with the Military Covenant, which states \u201cArmed Forces must always be able to expect fair treatment\u201d is in our view being ignored by the new Government in its anxiety to get things done quickly.\r\n\r\nThe change of indexation to CPI from RPI is a disgrace this should be returned to its pre April 2011 state as all MOD brochures have promised RPI indexation?  This constitutes a breaking of the Military Covenant , a promise to pay, and may be a breach of contractual Law.\r\n\r\nWE DEMAND THAT CHANGES MADE TO H.M.FORCES PENSIONS INDEXATION IN APRIL 2011 BE REVOKED.",
