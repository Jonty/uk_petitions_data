Hon William Hague MP,\u2028\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned write to protest in the strongest terms about the way Sri Lanka was deliberately erased from the agenda of the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence. This is adding insult to the injuries of the Tamil victims and survivors.\r\n\r\nTo show your good faith we request you to do the following 4 things:\r\n\r\n1.Apologise in person to the Tamil survivors of sexual violence for deliberately failing to consider their situation.\r\n2.Immediately deploy your PSVI stabilisation team to document cases of recent sexual violence survivors from Sri Lanka who are in the UK. This would send a strong signal to the rapists in Sri Lanka that someone is watching.\r\n3.Initiate an independent and transparent investigation into (a) the detention in UK asylum centres and (b) the deportation of anyone from Sri Lanka who has alleged sexual violence during any stage of their asylum claim.\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,  ",
