        "additional_details": "It is really disgusting to walk past the vile stench of both stale and fresh cigarette smoke when entering supermarkets, shopping centres, shops, local government buildings etc. Quiet often the smoke drifts into the premises violating all non smokers right to a smoke free environment.\r\n\r\nThe ban should also be extended to cover areas where the public congregate such as town centres, shopping centres, shopping villages, parks, petting farms and so on.\r\n\r\nOutside areas such as these where large numbers of people congregate always have a lingering presence of cigarette smoke and non smokers are assaulted with fresh smoke blowing in their faces from nearby smokers. The ever present stench of smoke in town centres indicates that the stuff lingers even in the outdoor air.\r\n\r\n",
