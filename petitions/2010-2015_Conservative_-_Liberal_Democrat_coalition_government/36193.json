In drought conditions we are told to stop using hosepipes and on occasion standpipes have been introduced, which suggests that there is not enough water storage (resevoirs etc) to cope.  When it rains continuously we experience floods and the associated household damage, business problems and even loss of life, with particular problems in flood-plain areas.\r\n\r\nOverall we certainly have plenty of rainfall to supply our requirements but we do not seem able to manage water resources in the correct way.\r\n\r\nThe potential increase in horticultural and agricultural production by using unlimited irrigation is immense, thus saving enormous amounts on imported food.\r\n\r\nI petition for a full Government enquiry into how water may be better managed.
