Taking your pet to the vet is not a luxury, no one go's out of choice, it can be very expensive and not everyone has an insurance company picking up the tab, dental work and other costly procedures are not covered by pet insurance. Charging VAT is a tax on vulnerable people who just want to do the best for their pet.",
