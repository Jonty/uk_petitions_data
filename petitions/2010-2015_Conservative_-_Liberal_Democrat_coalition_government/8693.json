        "additional_details": "There are over 80000 prisoners in the UK today and an average person can generate over 100 watts of power using a bicycle generator (much more for fitter people).\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to provide energy generating bicycles to prisons so that they may in part power themselves, participation could be either mandatory or encouraged by offering incentives such as better quality food or providing entertainment during cycling sessions.\r\n\r\nThis would allow a prison with a population of 1000 to produce as much power as 40 solar panels while inmates are exercising.",
