        "additional_details": "Statistics for cancer survival rates are published, based on surviving 5 years.  Often cancer sufferers live longer than 5 years from first diagnosis and are counted as survivors, but still eventually die of cancer.  Cancer often starts in one part of the body and spreads to other parts, eventually reaching a part of the body that leaves the sufferer with a short expected lifespan.\r\n\r\nGovt. has recorded statistics for decades now, so the published statistics should include survival at 10, 20 and 30 years, as well as the proportion of those diagnosed with each type of cancer, for whom cancer does not contribute to their death, however long they live after first diagnosis, i.e. \"cancer\" does not appear on their death certificate.  This would give a truer picture to the public of the real survival rates from each type of cancer, and provide a reason to focus more on long-term care for sufferers.\r\n\r\nDept of Health to publish and broadcast the statistics annually as above.",
