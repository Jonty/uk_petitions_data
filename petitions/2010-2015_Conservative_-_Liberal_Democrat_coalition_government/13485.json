This means that once again we are pandering our politics to minorities rather than to the majority.\r\n\r\nE-petitions should forthwith be amended so that a majority of 100,000 signatures is required and people can vote \"No\" to an e-petition as well as being in favour of it.\r\n\r\nOnly if a clear 100,000 people vote yes after \"No\" votes are deducted should it be debated. Otherwise we are opening the floor to debate issues that only 100,001 members of the population are in favour of.",
