        "additional_details": "We should cancel the fee GPs get for death certificates. The reason is that very often they DO NOT ACTUALLY SEE the deceased and someone just goes\u2019 to their surgery to get the certificate. Death of the person has been certified by ambulance staff. That was the case for a person I know who passed away and we never saw the GP. She did get the money though. And I had to drive several miles to get the her surgery to have the necessary death certificate enabling me to go the Registry Office. This is too easy to get money for job not even done (seeing the deceased and certify it).",
