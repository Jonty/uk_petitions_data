        "additional_details": "Public Sector employees - including Teachers, Nurses, Fire Officers, Police Officers, Council Workers etc - are typically paid less than workers employed in the private sector.\r\n\r\nA 1% reduction in the lower rate of tax for hard-working / low paid public sector employees would improve morale, reduce staff turnover and ultimately be more economical.\r\n\r\nAll the main-stream political parties have pledged to help hard-working people. You will struggle to find anyone as harder-working as teachers, nurses, social workers and civil servants and the valuable work they undertake should warrant more than the 'below-rate-of-inflation' annual payrises currently offered.",
