        "additional_details": "After the cane was abandoned in state schools from 1987 we have seen a slow and steady decline in standards of discipline in the classroom with children now free to abuse and attack other pupils and even teachers, and control of the classroom has completely broken down. Teachers are afraid to of entering the profession and the head teacher has no longer any authority over their school. There needs to be an ultimate deterrent to this behaviour epidemic and where there is a legitimate punishment in place for rule breakers and trouble makers there will not be the behavioural problems we have seen in the last two decades. I propose we bring back the cane and peace and order will again return to the classroom. ",
