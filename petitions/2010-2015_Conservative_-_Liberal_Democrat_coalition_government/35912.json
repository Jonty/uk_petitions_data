        "additional_details": "Recent leaks have shown via the Independent Newspaper, the Tories plan to cut all welfare for pensions including Free Bus Travel, Free Prescription costs, the Winter Fuel Payments that save the lives of elderly and disabled people they seek to abolish.\r\n\r\nWe seek an alternative. The People Social Freedom Movement of 4th Way Politics from the 99% demand Politicians earning \u00a340K or less take a 25% pay reduction and all Politicians earning over \u00a341K yearly should take a 50% pay cut. Politician Pensions should be in line with private sector pensions and should be frozen for the duration of this Parliament until 2015. All former PM's allowances for opening letters and doing talks must cease to exist.\r\n\r\nIf you agree that Politicians should be in the job out of love for the Nation and people and not for the profit and career motives, then please join us and support this call to save our pensioners and disabled benefits and have those who can pay, pay!!! --->>> People Social Freedom Movement ",
