        "additional_details": "Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer death in the UK, yet Pancreatic cancer has the worst survival rate of all cancers. 5-year survival is only 3%. This figure has not changed in over 40 years while deaths from many other cancers declined.\r\n\r\nPancreatic cancer could be termed \u2018The Hidden Killer\u2019. Many of its symptoms mirror other less critical illnesses and GPs often do not realise their significance. GPs may first look at other possible causes for these symptoms resulting in time being lost before the correct diagnosis is reached. By this time it can be too late to save the patient. THIS SITUATION CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.\r\n\r\nNovember 2011 is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month. However, the message is not just for today, not just for November 2011 but until the detection and survival rate for this disease is improved.\r\n",
