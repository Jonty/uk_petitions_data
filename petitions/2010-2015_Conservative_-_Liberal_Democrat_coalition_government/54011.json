        "additional_details": "Many pet sitters offer home dog boarding as a service to pet owners, to enable them to provide this service they have to be licensed by their local authority. The conditions and cost that some local authorities impose on pet sitters to issue this license makes it impossible for them to operate their businesses.\r\nThe conditions of the license vary enormously and often unfairly between local authorities; some licenses cost \u00a360.00 per year for a pet sitter to board up to eight dogs while others local authorities are charging \u00a3360.00 for a home boarder to board only one dog.\r\nWe would like the Government to unify the licensing scheme for pet sitters by giving the local authorities guidelines and conditions to work within including capping the licensing cost to make this a fairer system for all pet sitters to work within.\r\n\r\nNarpsUK\r\n",
