        "additional_details": "It is a discrace that the job as a pilot has become a  job for the rich. Many young people have ambitions to become a pilot, but are obstructed in their paths by 'money', as airline sponsorships are now a thing of the past. This quite frankly is immoral.\r\n\r\nOur request is that the government should remove taxes and VAT charges upon flight training within the UK.\r\n\r\nMathematicaly, the average cost of an integrated pilot programme is around the regions of \u00a380,000 inc VAT. At this current time, VAT charges are 20%.\r\n20% of 80000 = 16000\r\n\u00a380000 - \u00a316000 = \u00a364000\r\n\r\nThis is a dramatic decrease in the cost of pilot training, by just withdrawing the inclusion of VAT.\r\n\r\nPlease consider our request, and help the future generations of aspiring pilots succeed without adding extra costs to the already expensive training.",
