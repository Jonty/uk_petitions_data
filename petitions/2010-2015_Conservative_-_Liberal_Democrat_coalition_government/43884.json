        "additional_details": "Aslef\u2019s strike on the Boxing Day by demanding bank holiday pay was dreadful. Currently, average salary for a tube driver is \u00a342,000 to \u00a350,000 plus benefits and the drivers typically work 35 hours a week.  The total package is extremely attractive compared to majority of doctors in NHS whom perform much more demanding work, undergo long period of training (at least 7 years) and work longer hours for less salary than the tube drivers.\r\nI do not have issues with either Aslef or RMT negotiating better package but such negotiations should not be conducted by blackmailing to strike. Tube drivers have no right to give hardship to Londoners and London\u2019s visitors.\r\nDuring Olympics thousands of volunteers performed a fantastic job for London Olympics to succeed. Similarly, I request Department of Transport and Mayor of London to train volunteer tube drivers (similar to Territorial Army) so that tube drivers and their unions cannot blackmail Londoners.\r\n",
