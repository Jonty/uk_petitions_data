This is biast the reasons given to reject the lets keep page3 are JUST as relevent to the Ban page 3 petition.\r\nE-petitions cannot be used to request action on issues that are outside the responsibility of the government\r\nIn the UK, the press is not subject to state regulation. The Government believes that this is fundamental to our democracy. That is why the government does not interfere in what a newspaper or magazine chooses to publish.\r\nPAGE 3 is harmless and there is no shortage of girls who can't wait to get there kit off for the money and fame. If you ban page 3 then you should ban all great works of art that have womens breasts on display.",
