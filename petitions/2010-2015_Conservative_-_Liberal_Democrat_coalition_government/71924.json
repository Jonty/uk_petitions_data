Again, as Scotland proved, these promises are disingenuous lies - because there is no such crime as 'lying to gain public office' - and the electorate needs time to sit back and consider, without party political coercion, what would be best for the country.  Political campaigning MUST NOT BE ALLOWED in the last 7 calendar days before Election Day.",
