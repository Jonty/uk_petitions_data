The fees should be met by the parents or by the Government if the parents cannot afford it.\r\n\r\nTo improve judicial continuity the case should be reserved to the Judge who sits at the First Directions Hearing.\r\n\r\nAll Judges, CAFCASS and other caseworkers should undertake a distance learning course on parental alienation.\r\n\r\n",
