        "additional_details": "The level of duty on alchohol sold in glasses should be reduced and it should be offset by an increase for alchohol sold in sealed containers.  This would boost the pub trade which would benefit local economies with money being spent here rather than in supermarkets.  Too many young people are drinking cheap alchohol before they go out rather than spending their money in a social environment and too many other people can't afford to visit pubs at all.",
