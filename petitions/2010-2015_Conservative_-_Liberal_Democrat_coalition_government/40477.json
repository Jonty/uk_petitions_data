        "additional_details": "First the Radio 6 debacle and now this... are the BBC really so ignorant of public opinion !?\r\nMike Harding has presented the Folk Music show on Radio 2 for 15 years. His relaxed, witty style of presentation and his knowledge of and obvoius passion for the music has increased his audience from 70 000 to 860 000.\r\nHe was instrumental in setting up the BBC Folk Awards and I would venture to say that the current flowering of Folk and the vanguard of talented young musicians is due in no small part to him.\r\nIt is perfectly that Mike should be at the helm of  BBC Radio's Flagship Folk Music Programme until he or we, the Folk say otherwise...\r\nReinstate Mike Harding Now !!",
