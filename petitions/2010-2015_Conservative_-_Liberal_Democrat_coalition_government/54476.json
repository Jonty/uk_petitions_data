        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the Prime Minister and Government to commit to holding another vote on the possibility of UK military action against Syria after UN Weapons Inspectors have reported their findings and the UN Security Council has taken a vote on the issue.\r\n\r\nNo matter whether you support or oppose direct UK participation in US-led military strikes against Syria, the UK has a clear duty in its capacity as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, a defender of human rights and a signatory of the Geneva Conventions banning the use of chemical weapons to hold a second debate and vote on the matter in a timely and informed fashion.  Obama\u2019s dramatic move to seek approval from the US Congress (set to reconvene on 9th September 2013) provides a framework and timetable for a renewed debate and vote on the issue in the House of Commons that will allow the process to be undertaken in a calm and measured way.",
