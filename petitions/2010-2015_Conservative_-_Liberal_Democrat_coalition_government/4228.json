        "additional_details": "The England & Wales cricket team is entering one of its strongest ever periods. Yet the majority of young people and cricket fans are not able to watch the exploits of their national team. 18 million people watched England win the Ashes in 2005 on Channel 4, only 3.5 million watched the Pakistan series in 2006. Comparing like with like, 13.6 million watched the Sri Lanka tour on Channel 4 in 2002 while only 2.8 million tuned in when they arrived in 2006. How will young people take up cricket if they've never seen it before?\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s decision not to place cricket back on the A list of sports broadcast on terrestrial television has been totally compromised by the discovery of its close relations with BSkyB before, during and after the election. With so many channels on freeview cricket could easily be shown with minimal disruption to schedules.\r\n\r\nThis decision must be re-examined for the future of cricket in this country. Get Test match cricket back on terrestrial television.",
