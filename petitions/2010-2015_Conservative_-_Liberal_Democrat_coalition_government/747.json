        "additional_details": "The deal that will take the current BBC coverage of F1 away and off to SKY (Mr Murdoch) has been announced.  Force India, Team Lotus, McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull, Renault, Virgin, and Williams are all UK based.  The BBC has brought F1 to us all and they have built up a fantastic set up - DC, Jake, Martin, Ted, Lee, Eddie and everyone else who make it special.  Now they will only get to show 50% of races live.  I urge the Government to propose the significance of F1 to the UK and should assist the BBC in ensuring that F1 remains there with 100% live coverage for the next 7 years.  The UK is home of F1 and with average of 5+ million viewers and 67% of teams based in UK, it should not be taken away.",
