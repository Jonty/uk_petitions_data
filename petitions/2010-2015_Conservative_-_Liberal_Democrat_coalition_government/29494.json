        "additional_details": "Since the 1940's mothers have systematically been coerced into surrendering their children.  It started with young, single mothers being targetted.  The numbers of mothers being coerced dropped during the 1980's and 1990's.  However the number of forced adoptions has increased. Parents are targetted for a variety of reasons including allegations that are false or assumptions that the parents will not cope raising their children.",
