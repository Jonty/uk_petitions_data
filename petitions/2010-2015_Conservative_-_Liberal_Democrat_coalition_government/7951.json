        "additional_details": "We would like the UK Government Home office to sanction police use of water cannon to control participants in disorderly street riots characterised by arson, looting and violence aimed at both police and innocent members of the public. Use of water cannon, recently ruled out by the Home Secretary, is evidently acceptable in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and should therefore enjoy the same rights to 'consensus policing' as Great Britain. Reciprocally, law-abiding residents of Great Britain should be afforded the same level of protection  from disorderly and dangerous conduct as residents in Northern Ireland, and this should permit use of the same array of tactics and tools for establishing order.",
