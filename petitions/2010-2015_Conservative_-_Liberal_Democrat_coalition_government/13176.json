        "additional_details": "The BBC started life as a TV broadcaster at a time when televisions were created back in the 1940's and has done great shows like Morcambe and Wise, Panorama and the Generation Game etc. But lately it has been overcharging us the license fee per annum, shows and broadcasts have become lame, the admittance of their left-wing bias and is broadcasting to other countries without them paying the license fee. The BBC has now overgrown and has been out of touch with society and with new TV channels coming in, we should look to scrap the BBC and save the license fee payer money to supplement new ways of broadcasting",
