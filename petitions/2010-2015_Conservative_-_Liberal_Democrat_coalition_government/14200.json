        "additional_details": "We believe that the transfer of electronic resources produced by, amongst others, the now disbanded Becta and National Strategies to the National Archives has made life difficult for teachers to access this valuable information, at a time when the coalition government has yet to put in place many of its own alternatives.\r\n\r\nSignificant holes exist in the data that has been transferred and it was reckless on the part of the collation to close down those sites, even if the closure of the non-departmental public bodies was justified.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the government to restore all former DCSF related sites with immediate effect.",
