        "additional_details": "There seems to have been a huge increase in the use of illegal number plates due to spacing, size, font, or tampering, and I do not believe this is something that is being taken nearly seriously enough.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the law changed so as to make this offence carry an invalidation of insurance penalty.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no need for illegal registration plates to exist, yet alone be used on such a massive scale.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, it can surely not be any less of an offence as failing to display a valid tax disc.\r\n\r\nNo valid road tax = no insurance.  Please make the same true for no valid registration plate.",
