Be aware that these debts will fall upon our children and grandchildren in addition to the huge long-term debts we have already faced them with. They will feel the pain and hardship that we never did and they face this because of this generation's greed and incompetence. We must legislate to help this generation, think of it next time you look into the innocent face of a smiling toddler. ",
