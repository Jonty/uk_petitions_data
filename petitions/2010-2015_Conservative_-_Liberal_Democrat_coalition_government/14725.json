        "additional_details": "In the transitional governments of countries in the process of creating democracies, such as Libya and Tunisia, human rights already seem threatened, particularly those of women. While women were often seen on the front lines of these revolutions, they are scarcely seen taking part in the reconstruction of the governments, and are at risk of being forced back into traditional roles which deprive them of the freedom of choice and other basic human rights. These soon to be formed democracies will be in great need of international support.\r\n\r\nWe ask the British Government to withdraw this support if certain human rights standards are not met, including the rights of women, LGBT people, religious minorities and racial minorities. We also ask that the government encourage the creation of secular states where religious minorities are not persecuted and the state remains completely separate from religion.",
