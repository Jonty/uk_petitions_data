        "additional_details": "At present there is no full-time 19-25 college for young disabled adults to attend in Herefordshire. All they are offered locally is social services activities of little or no educational content and some of the disabled adults attending these are in their 70 not their peer age group. The local Headteacher is willing to set up the facility attached to his secondary school but is getting nowhere. We can send the children away to College but the expence is far greater and not every child wants to or is well enough to leave home. The distress to families to do this is massive. You are not talking masses of children and the cost is minimal. Please help us to achive our aim.",
