        "additional_details": "Schools and parents for many years now have been fighting a losing battle against NITS.  Nearly everyone I know checks their childrens hair on a regular basis but there are many still out there that are not bothered.  We need to make a stand and stamp out nits either once and for all or at least reduce the number of cases.  On a regular basis my childrens schools sends out information on how to treat head lice.  It may have been quite some time since I was last at school but the nit nurse otherwise known as 'Nitty Nora the Dicky Explorer' was a god send.  PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION IF YOU CARE FOR OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN.",
