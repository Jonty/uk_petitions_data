When using an EU MP3 player, you can hardly hear the music when using it in a loud environment with background noise. Especially when listening in the Gym when earphones rarely fit snugly.\r\nWe shouldn\u2019t have to import MP3 players from outside of the EU to be able to listen to music. Further, we should be able to decide for ourselves what volume we want to listen to our music.\r\nPlease allow us to make decisions for ourselves and get rid of this nonsense law.\r\n",
