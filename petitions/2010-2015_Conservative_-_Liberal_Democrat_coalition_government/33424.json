        "additional_details": "Filming, photographing and using a camera in a public place is not illegal, but many private security guards and Police Officers think it is.\r\n\r\nWhen filming in a public place, Police Officers try to stop persons filming, when a person has committed no crime, and the officer has not suspected the person of anything.\r\n\r\nPolice Officers abuse the Anti-Terrorism laws to try to stop a person using a camera in a public place. Private Security also think that it is illegal to film, some times they forcefully 'seize' the camera.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be clearer laws, Police Officers need to be educated, and Private Security companies should have training teaching them about human rights.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned want there to be clear laws on when a Police Officer can and should, 'seize' a persons camera, question you, suspect you of terrorism, and arrest you for filming in a public place.",
