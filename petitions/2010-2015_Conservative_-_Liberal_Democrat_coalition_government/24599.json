        "additional_details": "A petition to bring in new legislation to re-test all drivers over a certain age, example- over 75's! The cost of the re-test would be at the expense of the driver but possibly subsidised for certain cases. This would make the roads a lot safer and quieter after 'safely' removing bad drivers, cheaper insurance and more jobs for the extra lessons for those who want to stay on the road and extra examiners. Very little cost to tax payers and government in comparison to a high number of accidents which involve many emergency services!\r\n\r\n",
