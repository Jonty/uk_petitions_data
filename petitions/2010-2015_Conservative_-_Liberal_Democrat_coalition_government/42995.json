        "additional_details": "For much of its history Coventry was the major city in the county of Warwickshire. However, upon the creation of the West Midlands county, Coventry was removed and put into a different county, with which it has far fewer historical or physical links. Coventry and Warwickshire, on the other hand, share many services such as a Chamber of Commerce and a BBC local radio station. Indeed many, often local, people still think that Coventry is part of Warwickshire\r\n\r\nWe propose that the City of Coventry be removed from the county of the West Midlands and reinstated into the ceremonial county of Warwickshire, with unitary authority status to preserve the levels of independence it currently has.
