Spain for example: What is happening in Gibraltar is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nPlease call in the Spanish Ambassador and inform him, they have a week to restore normality or we will impose a surcharge of \u00a3200 on every traveller flying from the UK to Spain.\r\n\r\nThe impact on their economy will be substantial and they will want to avoid it at all costs.\r\n\r\nThey might want to take us to the European Court, but that will take years, so just ignore it.\r\n\r\nWe cannot go back through history and review each and every treaty. Gibraltar was settled in 1713 in The Treaty of Utrecht.",
