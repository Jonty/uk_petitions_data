        "additional_details": "RCVS has approved alarming practise that our pets in their hours of greatest need in Intensive Care Units can be unattended for recurring 15 minute periods, and, rejected irrefutable facts in complaints of a pet's death in a Small Animal Teaching Hospital's ICU.\r\n\r\nICU's are concentrated with special equipment/specially trained staff caring for seriously ill patients requiring immediate and continuous attention, Miller-Keane Encyclopaedia and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health 7th edn 2003 Saunders. This rule of continuous attention applies equally to an ICU in a veterinary hospital as confirmed on the website of the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia.\r\n\r\nWe ask Government to either split the RCVS Preliminary Investigation/ Disciplinary Committees from RCVS; create an independent veterinary Ombudsman; or veterinary hospitals are included in Government's series of measures resulting from public enquiry into Stafford Hospital scandal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
