        "additional_details": "Making more appointments available to people who are employed, either early morning, late night or even weekend surgeries.  My husband and I pay a substantial amount of tax and struggle to get appointments to see the GP, it is easier to access the out of hours surgery this is not what it is designed for.  GP receptionists have no medical qualifications to turn patients away requiring treatment by a GP.  EG. My husband has been very unwell for weeks, the GP's would not see him so after three loads of anti biotic s from OOH and no improvement, I demanded he be seen in the GP's, he has glandular fever and the nature of his job could have resulted in him rupturing his spleen. Not asking for a two tiered system for employed and unemployed just a one tire system with access for all.",
