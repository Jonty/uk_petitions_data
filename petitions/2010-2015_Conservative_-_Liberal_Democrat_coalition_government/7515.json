        "additional_details": "We petition the Government to make it law that any person committing a violent crime or crime that could endanger any person should have all rights stripped from them while perpertrating such crime.  This means that they are not protected from the Human Rights Act or any other such act, enabling the police to use appropriate force which could include water cannons, rubber bullets or even leathal force.  The moment any criminal surrenders, is in police custody, etc. their rights would be restored.\r\nWe feel that it is unfair that acts protecting the rights of indeviduals be abused by criminals committing crimes and with less regard for the innocent people they were intended to protect.\r\nWe ask that the Government review any applicable treaties and international commitments which may obstruct Parliament to implement such an Act.",
