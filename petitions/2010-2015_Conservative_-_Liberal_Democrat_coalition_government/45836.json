        "additional_details": "Why it should be legalized?\r\n*Slows down terminal illnesses-cystic fibrosis, cancer, multiple sclerosis etc\r\n*Helps conditions-arthritis, pain relief, insomnia,  diabetes etc\r\n*A wide variety of the population smoke it whether it is illegal or not\r\n*less conflict-people will not be bothered for street crime, assaults\r\n*Not a gateway drug- its a gateway to the fridge\r\n*Never killed anybody- Alcohol kills more people\r\n*Less likely to get lung cancer\r\n*Many cannabis smokers have succeeded! not failed!\r\nMay have side effects of anxiety, paranoia or schizophrenia which is what could come into negotiation? Over 18's could apply for a card to buy a certain amount of cannabis a week, and when cannabis is legally bought, the cashier signs the card of the date of when the cannabis was bought and how much. This can avoid people smoking too much to lead to bad side effects. It should definitely be used in medical and health care.\r\n\r\n",
