        "additional_details": "The RFU is, as the now popular saying goes, not fit for purpose:\r\nAn inability to keep a world-class coach or manager; a disappointing RWC campaign on the field; a scandal-ridden RWC off the field; leaked reports; and disguntled stakeholders at every level.\r\nMost individuals have either done the decent thing and resigned, or have been pushed.\r\nYet Rob Andrew, RFU Director of Elite Rugby, is still in post and has stated that he has no intention to resign. This is making a mockery of the sport and the Union, as he has admited fault and responsibility but will not do \"the right thing\".\r\nI would like the Dept. for Culture, Media & Sport to put pressure on him to resign, so that the RFU is able to start again with a clean sheet.",
