Consumers should then search the database by their postcode to find the cheapest local petrol more easily.  The goal is to increase local competition between petrol stations and help to reduce fuel costs for motorists.  This idea has already been implemented by the German government, so we should learn from their experience and be able to implement this quickly and cheaply.",
