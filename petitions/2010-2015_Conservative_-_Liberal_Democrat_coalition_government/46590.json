        "additional_details": "The Prescription Charges Campaign is calling on the Government to abolish unfair prescription charges for people with all long-term conditions. There is plenty of evidence that many people with long-term conditions currently struggle to afford their prescriptions, and often choose not to fill prescriptions because of the cost. For example:\r\n\u2022 An Asthma UK survey found that 34% of people who have to pay for their asthma medication sometimes choose not to get some of their prescriptions because of the cost.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Research published by Rethink in 2008 shows that 38 per cent of people with severe mental illnesses like schizophrenia have to choose between paying household bills and paying prescription charges.\r\n\r\nWe are calling on the Government to set a clear timetable for implementing free prescriptions. We hope that you will lend us your support by emailing your MP and signing our petition.",
