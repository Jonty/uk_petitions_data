        "additional_details": "The government should legislate to put a cap on the number of former public school boys and girls occupying the top positions in public institutions.  The cap should be set  close to the proportion of the population educated in public schools.  For example if 5% of the population is educated in public schools then a maximum of 7% of MPs may be drawn from a public school background.  This rule should apply to all public institutions.  Whilst this may appear restrictive I believe it will be liberating.  There are a lot of well educated people in government who I am sure can work through the detail of legislating for this cap.  Those people whose parents can and do pay for their education should not have better life chances.  ",
