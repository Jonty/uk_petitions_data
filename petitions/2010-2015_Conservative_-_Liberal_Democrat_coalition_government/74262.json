This figure would rise significantly in cases where visa applications are also made for children. This would mean for example that in order to secure visas for a spouse and one children you could need an income of up to \u00a322,400 and then additional \u00a32,400 further for each child which would for two children would make it \u00a324,800.\r\n\r\nFor example of people it affects, so you can understand what I mean:\r\nIf a British Citizen marries an Australian Citizen. Then their spouse (The Australian) can-not live in Britain if you do not earn more than \u00a318,600 a year in Britain. (Not in Australian) Then plus if you have children, this would also be the case of upping how much you would have to earn even though both these countries share the same Queen as does Canada.\r\nAlso affects our closes allies, the United States.\r\nThis also applies for all non-EU countries.",
