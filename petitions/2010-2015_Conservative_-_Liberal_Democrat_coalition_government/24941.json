        "additional_details": "In most of Europe, studying history is compulsory up until the age of sixteen.\r\n\r\nIn England's schools, history only has to be taught until fourteen - this means that too much has to be crammed into a short period of teaching time. If pupils continue studying history beyond the age of fourteen, the current structure can often mean repetition of topics rather than a widening of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe government should give history equal status to English, maths and science. Make history a compulsory Key Stage 4 (GCSE) subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
