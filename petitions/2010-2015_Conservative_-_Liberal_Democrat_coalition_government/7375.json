        "additional_details": "Policing is by public consent! London riots now spreading to other regions, we want Police to use force on these people that are rioting. They show no human rights to the public they are distrupting and buissnesses they are ruining. If Officers get involved they're branded as thugs, are hounded in the press and online, risking prosecution for doing their jobs. If they hold back in the hope that the protesters will tire themselves out they're classed as weak and criticised all over again. The public need to decide what kind of Police Force they want and accept and embrace either the use (or lack) of force that goes along with it. Police officers shouldnt have to look over their shoulders when their doing their job of protecting the public",
