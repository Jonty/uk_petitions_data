        "additional_details": "We appeal to our MPs to represent our views and to vehemently oppose this project. These plants are an uneconomical and inefficient way to produce electricity and are only pursued by the Government to secure the \"green\" vote and to keep the EU happy. Locally, they industrialise the landscape, have detrimental health, financial and other effects on peoples lives, destroy wildlife and have a negative impact on the community. These plants seem to be getting ever closer to our homes and before long will be an integral part of the beautiful landscape and views we have here in Consett. We need to take action now and force these ridiculous eyesores offshore.",
