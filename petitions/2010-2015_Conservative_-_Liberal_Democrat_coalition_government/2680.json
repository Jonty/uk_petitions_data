        "additional_details": "The government would seek to progressively phase out the permission for private cars to be used in urban environments. This would be done gradually but over a relatively short period of time (e.g. 5-10 years). The gradual period would allow businesses and society to adjust. Those with disabilities would be exempt from these rules, though still required to use less lethal transport when in urban environments.",
