Could they insist that one of these accounts is a special cheaper tariff for people aged 65 and over who do not have an annual income of more than c \u00a313,000.  I have an account like this at the moment and as a pensioner could not afford to have my gas and electricity bills to keep increasing at the level that they are now.  An account of this nature would ensure that pensioners with this level of annual fixed income are not paying over 10% of their income on fuel.",
