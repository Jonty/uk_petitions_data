        "additional_details": "Since its inception in 1999, the Childcare element of Working Tax Credit (formally Working Families Tax Credit) has been paid into the private bank accounts of parents. This has led to Billions of Pounds worth of fraud - \u00a31.9 Billion in 2004 alone (according to the Office of National Statistics). This is because some parents fail to keep HMRC fully informed of their current personal circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis e-petition is to ask Her Majesty's Treasury to pay the Childcare Providers directly to ensure that the individual child's payment of the Childcare element goes directly to fund their care and education rather than be fraudulently misused by some parents.\r\n\r\nI propose that Childcare Providers, in whatever guise, provide accurate information regarding attending children online directly to HMRC which would reduce the amount of debt parents hold with Providers around the Country, as well as save the Tax Credit system in the region of \u00a31Billion Per YEAR!\r\n",
