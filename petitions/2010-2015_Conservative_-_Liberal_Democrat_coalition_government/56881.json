        "additional_details": "England has removed the requirement for a psychiatric review before referral to a Gender Identity Clinic. Patients in Wales wanting to be referred to a Gender Identity Clinic must still have a psychiatric assessment performed before they are referred, despite Gender Identity Clinics performing psychiatric assessments themselves. This slows down the process and places more strain on NHS Wales' time and resources.\r\n\r\nThis is a petition to remove the need for a psychiatric assessment before a gender identity clinic referral, giving Welsh GPs the ability to refer their patients directly to a gender identity clinic.",
