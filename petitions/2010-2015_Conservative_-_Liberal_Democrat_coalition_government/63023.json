        "additional_details": "It is sad to see that public sector workers pension rights are being ignored by government, by the unions and by the public.\r\nNurses pensions were changed in 1995 and again in 2007, many of us have pensions that were guaranteed by govt in writing.\r\nMany of us who are now getting older have no time to make alternative arrangements for our pensions but have been told we have to work longer, pay more and get less.\r\nI did take this issue to my Union and was told I can't even take legal action to retain my preserved right to retire at 55yrs old which was guaranteed to me in my contract in 1989.\r\nI would like Parliament to discuss keeping the guaranteed rights as promised, remembering they do not in fact apply to anyone after 1995 anyway. These rights should be guaranteed, they were guaranteed and I've paid my pension and I expect the govt to keep their side of the bargain too.",
