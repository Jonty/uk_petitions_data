Let us remind them that these elected MPs are representitives of the people, with this said they should not threaten them to stop their political carreers. This is wrong and undemocratic and goes against the electorate. Its meant to be \"a government for the people, of the people, elected by the people\" not for Cameron, Miliban and Clegg.",
