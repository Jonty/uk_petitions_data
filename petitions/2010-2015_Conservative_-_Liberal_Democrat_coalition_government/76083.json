        "additional_details": "QEF is a college funded by Queen Elizabeth in 1934 for the education of students with disability's.\r\nIt is also aimed to provide qualifications for people on job seekers or disability allowance who are strangling to get into work and aims to have either a work placement, or a job by the time you leave with incredible success rates.\r\n\r\nAs of August 2015, DWP (Department for work and pensions) have decided they will no longer be funding the college within the south west of England for budget cuts.\r\nThis college is one of the most amazing colleges to attend with the most incredible teachers, some who have worked at QEF for over 15 years.\r\n\r\nThis will be taking away the chance for any one from the age of 18+ who find they are struggling to find there way back into the working environment to rebuild self confidence, self esteem and a some of many great qualifications!\r\nTo not fund this college would be one huge shame and would leave a big impact on many people!",
