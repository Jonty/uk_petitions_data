        "additional_details": "This petition is to try to prevent the planned October changes to the appeal against an ATOS fit for work decision, whereby, if a claimant is deemed fit for work, by ATOS, he/she will lose there benifits until a decision is made by the DWP. No time limit has been put as to how long this decision must take. They will have to claim JSA but in so doing they will be declaring themselves \"fit for work\" when they have already declared themselves unfit for work!!!",
