        "additional_details": "The law abiding, Unionist people of the United Kingdom, insist that our national flag is flown from Belfast City Hall. The decision to remove the flag of this nation, was driven by hatred and by people, who are steeped in bigotry and crime.\r\n\r\nWe were told Ulster would be a country for all, a shared future and one, in which all communities would be respected. Sadly, parity of esteem has long been forgotten about and the eradication of all things British has come to the fore. The Unionist people of the United Kingdom, demand that our flag, the Union flag, is once again, flown from Belfast City Hall.",
