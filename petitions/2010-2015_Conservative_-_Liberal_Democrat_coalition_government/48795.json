        "additional_details": "Since 1997 successive governments have started to limit  the rights of individuals to report on certain suspects.This has been put forward again by the police inspectors.The police inspectors are more and more over stepping the bounds of there authority by infringing on the rights of individuals to know the truth of all suspects.\r\n\r\nWe cannot allow the police to move this country any nearer to a police state than it is now.\r\n\r\nWe must ensure that safeguards are put in place to stop the police in there tracks and bring them back to a place in the past,where the rights of the individual took precedence over the money making schemes of the police inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe government must put in place new rights that protect the individual and ensure that the freedom of speech and expression are paramount.",
