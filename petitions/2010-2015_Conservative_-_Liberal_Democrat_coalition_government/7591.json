        "additional_details": "The riots, which started in just one borough of London have now spread throughout London & across the country. The rioters are increasingly violent, criminal & rampant & the police simply cannot cope. We need to deploy the army now to take back control from these pathetic thugs & turn the fear they are generating back on them. Until order is restored the army should be mobilised & water cannons & tear gas should be made use of to protect the good people who are being terrorised & whose livelihoods are being burnt to the ground. It is only a matter of time until we hear that innocent people have been killed. This needs to stop, and NOW. Wake up David Cameron & Theresa May & protect your people.",
