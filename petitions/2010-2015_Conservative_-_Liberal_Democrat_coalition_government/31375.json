        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that the start of the school day should be moved to 10am rather than the 8.45 -9am currently in practice.\r\n\r\nThis would mean that pupils arrive at school better rested, more alert and ready to work.  This is particularly an issue in rural areas where the current start times mean a very early rise for many pupils making them tired and unfocused throughout the school day. ",
