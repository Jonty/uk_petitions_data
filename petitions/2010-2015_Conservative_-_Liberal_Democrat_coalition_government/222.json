        "action": "Protect Freedom of Speech by removing the word \"insulting\" from Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986",
        "additional_details": "Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 forbids the use of \"insulting words or behaviour\" in a public place, if this is \"likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress\". This provision has been responsible for a number of arrests in recent years. For instance, Leicestershire trader Tony Wright found himself arrested in 2005 for selling T-shirts emblazoned with the words \"Bollocks to Blair\". In 2008, a 16 year old boy was arrested for calling Scientology a \"dangerous cult\". In addition, members of a Worcester based animal rights group found themselves arrested in 2006 for using toy seals painted with red food dye as part of a protest against seal culling. Moreover, Oxford University student Sam Brown was arrested in 2005 for saying to a police officer \u201cMate, your horse is gay, I hope you don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d\r\n\r\nFeeling \u201cinsulted\u201d should never constitute a crime by itself. Therefore, we the undersigned petition the government to remove the word \"insulting\" from Section 5.\r\n",
