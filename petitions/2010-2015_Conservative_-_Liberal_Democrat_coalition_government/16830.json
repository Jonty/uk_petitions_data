Species such as; Eurasian Lynx, Elk (Moose), Wolf, Beaver, various Eagles and many others.\r\nAs well as this the government should seek to educate the public about the nature and effects of such reintroductions in order in part to dispel myths and false apprehensions about such actions.\r\nThe government is legally obliged to consider the reintroduction of such animals under 'Article 22 of the EU Habitats and Species Directive of 1992', but seems to be failing to do so.",
