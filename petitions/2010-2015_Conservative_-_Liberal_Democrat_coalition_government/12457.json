        "additional_details": "With rising fuel prices pushing up the prices in the shops, allowing hauliers to use red diesel in road going vehicles over 7.5 tons would help keep prices down.  Private vehicles would have to continue to use normal fuels.  This would at least help keep down the price of food and other goods thus stimulating the economy.",
