We need a group of people from all MP\u2019s ward with no political bias to sit and judge MPs if they are failing the public and or break the rules. They should have the power to fine an MP and or dismiss the MP. And if it is a criminal offence such as fraud then it should be down to this group to pass it on to the Police it is wrong that MP\u2019s always look after their own it is time they where accountable to the public.",
