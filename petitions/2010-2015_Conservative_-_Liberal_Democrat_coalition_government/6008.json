        "additional_details": "There should be a grave increase in the way that corporations and high-earning individuals are treated by our criminal justice system. Crimes involving the evasion of taxes, abuse of position, environmental crimes and other crimes commonly committed by corporations and white-collar individuals should have harsher sentencing. Currently crimes such as burglary and theft have comparatively higher sentences, even though these corporate crimes typically affect more individuals and have a larger detrimental effect on society as a whole.",
