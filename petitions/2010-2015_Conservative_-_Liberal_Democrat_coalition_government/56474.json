        "additional_details": "The Department of Transport will consider changes to the rules that will deny young people the chance to drive until they are 18 and will ban them taking any passengers under 30, and driving after dark. This is a draconian response to the problem of young people dying on the roads. A more thorough test and compulsory training in night and motorway driving would be a fairer and more effective response.",
