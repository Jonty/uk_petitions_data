        "additional_details": "Ofsted and the DfE must work with teachers to remove unnecessary, elongated paperwork from the teachers workload. Writing things like Scheme of Works that are conjugated lesson plans means teachers are planning lessons a year in advance, only to change them closer to the time to make them fresh & relevant due to ever-changing conditions in education. Teachers are under massive pressure to complete masses of paperwork for all sorts of things which takes valuable time away from giving learners the support the need. The DfE needs to have confidence in the profession and not require pointless information to be constantly documented. ",
