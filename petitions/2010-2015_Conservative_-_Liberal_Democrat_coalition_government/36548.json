In the case of marriage there is a legal contract in place whilst in other cases at least a verbal contract. That organisations can exist that can so frivoulously disregard the these agreements and promote that they should be broken is a detriment to society as a whole. Both parties have a choice to be in the relationship but cheating means that one party no longer has an informed choice: in any other walk of life this would not be so readily accepted and certainly not encouraged.",
