        "additional_details": "There are fundamental issues with British politics. We are at a point where the good of the country is overlooked in favour of knee-jerk reactions to win short-term favour, the money of the few richest businessmen with interests in our country and unwillingness to depart from ideology, even if doing so would clearly be the right thing to do. Some decisions made this way turn out very well, but the end does not justify the means, and a lack of clear reasoning and rationale behind decisions has left the public with low faith in our current system.\r\n\r\nI propose that every law requires an independent study showing its benefits before it can be passed, monitored by a new regulatory body. This would increase public confidence and reduce the passing of reactionary, damaging and downright dangerous laws.",
