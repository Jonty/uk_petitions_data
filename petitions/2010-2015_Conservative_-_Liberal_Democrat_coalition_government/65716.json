They provide a vital public service, for example Specialist Construction Industry work has been centralised in Newry since 2008 when this was previously spread across 200 offices.\r\n\r\nA free walk in service which local people rely heavily on for assistance with complex tax queries are also under threat.\r\n\r\nWe demand HMRC halts their office closure programme immediately and to put a financial case to government for adequate resources, including staffing and offices, to help close the tax gap.",
