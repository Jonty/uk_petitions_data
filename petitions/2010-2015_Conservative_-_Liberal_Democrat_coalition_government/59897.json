        "additional_details": "Government should financially support all UK registered animal charities and organisations from Lottery funds or other financial means. Animals are part of the British culture and should not be left to stray and suffer on the streets. Animal charities and organisations are forced to turn away sick and homeless strays by the hundreds due to insufficient funds. Their funds barely pay for food. Government support would enable organisations to employ more fosterers to care for stray and unwanted animals in their own homes and not depend on volunteers. Animal neutering and vet fees for strays should also be financed by the Government and not from charity funds. Without this expense and with financial support from the Government there would be adequate funds for food, fosterers, heating, dog walkers, advertising, and rescue crews. Over Xmas many stray cats were left homeless and hungry on UK streets after being turned away by rescues that were completely full, which is totally unacceptable.",
