        "additional_details": "The price of fuel is very high. Fuel affects everyone including businesses and consumers. We believe that if the government reduced fuel duty by 25p in the litre, that would create more disposable income within the population which would be spent elsewhere to kickstart a moribund economy and thereby generate better revenue for the government.We also believe that a reduction in fuel duty would make transport more affordable thereby reducing costs of materials, businesses and eventually consumers would benefit.
