        "additional_details": "We call on all politicians and government to stop scapegoating immigration for their political and economic incompetence.\r\n\r\nThe UK is a nation of immigrants. Immigration has contributed positively to our country bringing skills, inward investment and diversity.\r\n\r\nBeing part of Europe is that we have a free movement of goods and people. This is good for the UK economy.\r\n\r\nWe do not support free entitlements as of right but it is wrong to deprive those in the UK who have come to live and stay essential healthcare, benefits and housing in order to survive in crisis.\r\n\r\nThe United Kingdom and its people is a compassionate country. This is reflected by our contribution to International Development of 0.7% of GDP.\r\n\r\nThe extremism of right-wing rhetoric scapegoating immigrants is wrong. It is wrong of senior politicians creating racial tensions that immigration is to blame for their economic and political failures in recent years.\r\n\r\n",
