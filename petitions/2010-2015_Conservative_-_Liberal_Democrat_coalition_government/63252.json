        "additional_details": "luvmydog.co.uk are selling through their main site as well as others such as Amazon, barbaric dog collars, with internal spikes, badged as \"stylish\".  The \"Herm Sprenger Curogan Classic Style Prong Collars\" are collars with some 10, double inward spikes that dig into the dogs neck if any tension is applied.  These break the skin and draw blood, in the name of \"training a dog\" and making sure they behave.  Any true dog owner/lover would never consider using such a barbaric method to train a dog.  The site needs to be stopped selling these to the public and sites such as Amazon need to be made to stop allowing them to be sold on as well.  This is a gross act of imhumane treatment to dogs and needs to be stopped immediately.\r\n\r\nIf the above has not convinced you, then go to the following site and see what your reaction is at seeing the collars.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.luvmydog.co.uk/acatalog/Herm_Sprenger_prong_collar_LuvMyDog_worldwide_uk.html",
