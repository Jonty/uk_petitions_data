Members of the public are taking authorities to tribunals and ending up out of pocket because the authorities are rarely if ever held to account and made to compensate for their wrongfull actions) costing the general public both time and money because there is an inbuilt arrogance in government that you challenge them at your own peril and this cannot go on, it is unjust and unfair.",
