        "additional_details": "It is time for Parliament to debate the development of London.\r\n\r\nThere are now more than 200 tall towers with planning permission. Development is out of control. Open spaces are being lost. Land that was thriving being used for employment and culture is being given over to luxury housing which will stand empty. Amenity is being destroyed, the overshadowing created by poorly planned buildings will create dark and gloomy streets and homes. Our heritage is under threat, as it is now almost certain that Parliament will be placed on UNESCO\u2019s list of World Heritage Assets in danger.\r\n\r\nThis is the cost, and ordinary Londoners are seeing none of the benefits. There is little or no affordable housing on new developments. 75% of new housing is bought by foreign investors before it is built.\r\n\r\nInstead all the benefits flow into the pockets of developers who are walking away with record profits.\r\n\r\nOur country deserves not to have its capital city vandalised. London deserves better.",
