        "additional_details": "The number of train suicides is increasing however it is also becoming more frequent that people are being helped to prevent this however the British Transport Police have been issuing warnings for ASBO's for people that have 'trespassed' at train stations. For someone that is mentally unwell at the time this can have a negative influence and can mean they are afraid to contact police when they need help as one of the conditions to the ASBO warning is about not contacting police unnecessarily. I would like the government to reconsider this approach and find an alternate approach that will help mentally unwell people instead of scare them from contacting the police.",
