        "additional_details": "Personal finance is a key skill in life, but there is a serious lack of education on the topic. Everybody needs to be able to manage their own money, and not just for their own benefit. Young people are clueless when it comes to personal finance, completely uneducated about many important aspects of finance, for example credit scores and EVEN just simple budgeting. It is simply ludicrous that these essential skills are currently not mandatory within the education system. The proposition is that Personal Finance should be made a mandatory subject in Key Stage 3 and 4 education, and encouraged as an enrichment choice in higher education, for the good of individuals, and the economy.",
