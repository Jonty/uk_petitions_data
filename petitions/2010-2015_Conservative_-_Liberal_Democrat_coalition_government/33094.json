        "additional_details": "We support the proposal by Lord Adonis that the House of Lords should be located in a northern city, and that the government should bring forth legislation to do so as part of its reform of the upper house next year.\r\n\r\nOver-concentration in London is \"unhealthy for our national politics\". \"Birmingham or Manchester, or indeed any of the other great cities of the Midlands or the north, would be much closer to those who elect the second chamber than London.\"\r\n\r\n\"The public purse would make a net saving by selling the vast and expensive property portfolio the Lords has been acquiring to house its 850 members along Millbank and the surrounding streets.\"\r\n\r\nElectronic communication and video conferencing mitigate almost all of the potential problems of geographical separation of the houses. Indeed politicians would be forced to use the communication methods of businesses and manufacturing industry priced-out of London, giving them a good perspective on modern working methods.",
