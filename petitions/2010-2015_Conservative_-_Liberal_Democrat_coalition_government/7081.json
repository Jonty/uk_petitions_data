        "additional_details": "There are enormous pressures on NHS Health Trusts to deliver a wide range of health services to their local communities. It is my experience that despite the mental health directorate I work for coming in on budget year after year we are constantly being  penalised by the failure of numerous other departments not managing their budgets correctly. Mental health is seen as the least necessary of the services and has to pitch in with round after round of savings. Statistically your mental health is at greater risk than ever. The government need to ensure mental health services are  protected not only within the NHS but also greater promotion and funding of the Third Sector. (Voluntary and Charity Organisations)",
