        "additional_details": "Due to Durham County Council cut backs the Village of Witton Gilbert Durham was denied a desperatley needed pedestrian crossing on the busy B6312 Sacriston Lane which is used by  over 6500 vehicles a day. The current solution which provides a \"safe island\" in the centre of the road (Sacriston Lane local store ) has become a bottleneck , is dangerous, and is very likely to endanger children and elderly people trying to cross safely.  An \"accident waiting to happen\"..What is needed here is a re-assessment of the flow of traffic. Durham County Council should come up with the funding to install a full predestrian crossing with lighting and if this happens the bus stop will need to relocated, This will be safer for both drivers and pedestrians alike and I hope you will sign and support our request to forward this e petition to Dirham County Council road traffic and safety department. Thanks for reading it.",
