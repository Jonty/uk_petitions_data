No other sentence other than the maximum should be considered for those who steal the innocence of defenseless individuals.\r\n\r\nI would also like to see tougher conditions for such criminals whilst in custody. It is one thing to keep them out of society but to allow them all but a normal life (albeit under lock and key) is unacceptable.\r\n\r\n",
