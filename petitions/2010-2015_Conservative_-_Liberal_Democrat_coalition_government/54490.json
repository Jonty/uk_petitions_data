        "additional_details": "Main Issue:\r\n\r\nCouncils are (without trying to collect council tax arrears) summonsing council tax payers to their local magistrates court to fight for a liability order which then after rejecting small payment offers ordering bailiffs to visit your home, this adds a large amount of costs to the bill, and makes the most vulnerable poorer or even homeless and more severe suicidal as there's no way out.\r\n\r\nI do accept that council tax should be paid but I think the councils should be forced to create better plans to collect council tax before going to magistrates and bailiffs and that anyone in the situation now should have all extra costs of bailiff and court fees refunded and small payment plans accepted for people already affected, and also councils should offer a repayment plan so we don't have to guess what weekly payments they will be happy with.",
