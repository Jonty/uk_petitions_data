        "additional_details": "Drivers who can't be bothered to indicate are a menace on the road. They waste everyone's time, making other drivers wait when they shouldn't have needed to, but far more importantly they cause real danger on the road by misleading people as to their intentions and causing accidents.\r\n\r\nFailing to indicate should automatically lead to 6 points on the licence and a fine in the region of \u00a3100 or \u00a3200, and in cases where it was particularly dangerous e.g. a roundabout or major junction, it should be 9 points and a heavier fine.",
