        "additional_details": "This is a petition for the amendment of laws that limit the free peoples, basic, human and democratic right to protest.\r\n\r\nYou would think in a country like England that a person or group is free to express his/her views in public? The right to protest, a fundamental pillar of democracy.\r\n\r\nIn fact this is not true.\r\nIn fact, to a degree it is also illegal for one to remain static/still on a public footpath/pavement!?\r\n\r\nAuthorities(the Police) can diminish protests or end them all together by the use of a vague law called: \"Obstruction of a Public Highway\".\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the absurdness of this law, 1 man conducting a static protest (standing still) on a public footpath, \"8 people wide\" can be deemed as an \"Obstruction of a Public Highway\".\r\n\r\nAt the least a police officer has the right to politely tell a protester to keep walking, at the maximum an officer can arrest a protester for \"Obstruction of a Public Highway\".",
