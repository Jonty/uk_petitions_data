At present as long as the developers tick the correct boxes the councils are unable to defend planning applications,despite hundreds of local residents objections.\r\nIf a set percentage of local residents object this would be enough to stop the development. It would bring communities to work together if they knew it would make a difference.\r\nWe want to be able to say NO if we wish and keep our communities for future generations.",
