        "additional_details": "Cotton style bedding for rodents is harmful to rodents in the following ways:\r\n\r\nBlockages - The material cannot be digested properly and can cause what seems like constipation. The material can also enter the lungs and cause respiratory issues, which are incurable. It is a slow and painful death.\r\n\r\nLimb trapping - It can also be too harsh to pull apart for small creatures, and when they exit their nest to get food or water, their limbs can become trapped. And with their natural instinct, they pull on it until their limbs can get dislocated. Some people have even reported their pets gnawing their own limbs off to free themselves.\r\n\r\nSafe alternatives are paper substances like Carefresh, Fitch, or plain, unscented ripped up toilet roll.\r\n\r\nThe cosy bedding by Rotastak has been removed from Pets At Home, as the company have realised their error and listened to the public. Sign this petition to get it removed completely, and replaced with a safe alternative.\r\n",
