        "additional_details": "As a pro-life person it's not right that if I give blood my blood donation can be used to take life in abortions. Or that if I died my organs could go to someone who helps take unborn children's lives. I would like to be able to give blood; I'm O- & think it could help someone. But the thought that I could be taking part in abortion (literal murder) scares me, so I have never donated. It's bad enough that unborn aborted children have no say in their bodies getting cut up & used to profit others.\r\n\r\nIf organ donation was presumed consent I would have to opt out too for the same reason. Yet if there were a register where you can ensure only those pro-life could receive your donation, I would sign up right away.",
