        "additional_details": "DVLA management have announced the full closure of 39 Local offices, 10 Enforcement and 3 processing units with the intention to centralise all services at their Headquarters in Swansea. This is a blatant attack on a public service that supports the motor trade and the general public.\r\n\r\nApproximately 1200 people will be declared surplus with the majority being made redundant. These closures will disproportionally affect the most vulnerable in society.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, deplore the attack on the vital services provided by an efficient and effective workforce of 1200 and call upon the DVLA, DFT and the Secretary of State for the Department of Transport to cease all plans to close 39 Local offices, 10 Enforcement and 3 processing units.\r\n",
