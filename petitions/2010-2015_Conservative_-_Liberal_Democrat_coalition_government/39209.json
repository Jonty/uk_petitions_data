        "additional_details": "I have on many occasions read stories about offenders that re-offend upon release \"to be arrested\" so that they can \"go home\".\r\n\r\nTo an average joe public, this is unfortunate that someone deems prison a better lifestyle than outside in society.\r\n\r\nFor those who have strong intentions to re-offend to return home, releasing them into society is counter productive.  The costs, man power and court time involved in processing an offender that doesnt want to be freed is an unneccesary burden on the police, courts and taxpayer.\r\n\r\nI propose that as prisoners approach the end of thier sentence they be given the option to stay in prison.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the police and courts more resources to focus on who is trying to evade them rather than repeatedly arresting those who want to go home.\r\n\r\n",
