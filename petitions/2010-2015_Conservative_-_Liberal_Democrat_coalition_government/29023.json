        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to hold a Global Warming Referendum. With all the 3 main parties backing CAGW I do not feel the public have been given a fair opportunity to democratically have their say on the subject. It's reality and it's funding. Therefore I would like the Question to be put: NO. No more wind turbines to be financed via Green Energy Bills which take from those who can least afford it, the poorest. And YES. Yes the poorest in the land should pay for the UK making a Green example to the world which has no effect on global CO2 natural or man made.",
