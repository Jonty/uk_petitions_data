Redburn has 76 pupils and approximately 40 of those are from militry families, this school is next to Palace Barracks in Holywood and as it stands at the moment each day the gaurds open a side gate facing the school to enable parents to saftly drop their kids to school, however should the school close....this will put militry families in danger.....infact they might as well be sitting ducks in my opinion!!! Surely this is wrong???? ",
