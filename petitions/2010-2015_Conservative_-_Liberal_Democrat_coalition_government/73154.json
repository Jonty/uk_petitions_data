        "additional_details": "In an ideal world, a third or fourth of school leavers should be attending university and not 50%. We need to put the prestige back into apprenticeships and non-university institutions of further education. The ridiculous expectation than half of school leavers should launch themself into academia has left rampant inequality, often leaving those who do not attend university with a bleak future. Degrees are devalued with such a high number of graduates, making it increasingly difficult to find a job despite possession of a good degree. Hopefully this can help lead to the return of the educational system which was once envied by other countries, where our universities are strong and reward academic merit, where those with no wish to attend university have prestigious alternatives and where a degree actually leads to a good job. Let's work towards a fairer, more efficient system of further education.",
