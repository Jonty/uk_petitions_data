Every year innocent people and animals are seriously injured or worse at the hands of the inane idiots that think it  'a bit of fun to post rockets through letterboxes,&  tie pets to bangers' WHY?  Because explosives are freely available to anyone with money. Is it not about time that the government restricted sales of fireworks to Certified Pyrotechnicians? Rent council land for organised displays? Would this not generate revenue for government? Build community spirit? Keep innocent parties safer? Please sign and help ban the sale of these horrible devastating things to Joe Public.",
