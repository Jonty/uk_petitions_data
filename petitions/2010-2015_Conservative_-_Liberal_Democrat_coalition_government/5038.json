The average size of a British house is 65 sq m where as in Denmark it is 137 sq m, twice as big.\r\nJapan, a country roughly the same size as the British Isles but with twice the population and 80% mountainous still manages to have new builds that are 57% bigger than British new builds!\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland and Wales are the only countries in the EU which have no minimum space standards for housing. It essential to set minimum sizes for rooms, a universal set of space-standards across the board applicable (both social and private housing) for all new homes in England and Wales.\r\n",
