        "additional_details": "Short term military service is compulsory in many countries and is useful for teaching life lessons and discipline. It can also offer learnings in trades and advantage young individuals for later life. Every man and woman should be drafted into the armed service that is 20-39 of age if they are abled to do so. Less abled individuals should be given the option. The minimum term should be 9months with an option to extend to 15months. 1.5month will be at a basic training camp which would also cover army history and  take individuals through the basic armed defence systems and would offer individuals a choice in what they would like to specialise in. The option of extended service to 15months would offer individuals less fortunate and also less able to either get into university, college or trade to extend their time in the armed forces until they do. The armed forces has many options to offer and defence is always a necessity in our lives. Please spare a thought for this petition. ",
