Once assigned to a child, the benefit cannot be removed, even if the parents split up.\r\n\r\nBeing young, unmarried and having children does not give you any extra advantages when it comes to social housing.\r\n\r\nThe time has come to try to halt the growing number of young women whose only function in society is to live off the state and produce another generation who will repeat the same process.\r\n",
