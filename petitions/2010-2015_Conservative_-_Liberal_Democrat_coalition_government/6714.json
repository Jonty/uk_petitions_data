Teen pregnancy has only been cut by 13%, which is no where near 50%.\r\nThe government should bring in baby simulators in order for teenagers to see what it takes to be a teen mom in the flesh rather than the glamorised way in the media. Baby simulators should cut the teen pregnancy ratings by a great load, as it will have teens thinking twice about what they are doing. If teens see before they become a young mum, what it takes, the sleep deprivation, isolation, the loss of friends and the energy they've got to keep up throughout the day, they won't be so fast as to be hurring up to the sonogram.\r\nTeenagers think parenthood is this straight and narrow road, until they've experienced it. Bring in the baby simulators and watch the underage pregnancy decline.",
