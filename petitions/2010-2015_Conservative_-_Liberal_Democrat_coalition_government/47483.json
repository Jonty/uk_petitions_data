It has been estimated that up to 4,000,000 citizens equating to 15% of the Romanian population will come to Britain, many of them branded as criminals or scroungers.\r\nThis stereo typing is both factually and morally wrong as many Romanians working abroad are highly skilled with over 2,000 Romanian doctors already working in the UK.\r\nRomanians are EU citizens and should be afforded the same rights as people from other European countries not defamed as immigrants when they can be viewed instead as expats.\r\nThere is a lot of hostile publicity towards these people, which will lead to discrimination and racism.\r\nWhy deny Romanians access to the UK on these bases if they are prepared to make a valuable contribution?\r\nI ask the Government not to delay the decision to lift all restrictions on Romanians on January 1, 2014 and to do something to reverse the adverse publicity surrounding Romanians.\r\n\r\n",
