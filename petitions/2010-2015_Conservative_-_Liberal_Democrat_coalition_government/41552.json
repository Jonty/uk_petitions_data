        "additional_details": "With the Autumn statement due on 5 December 2012, it is about time that this government helped struggling first time buyers (FTBs) by announcing meaningful incentives.\r\n\r\nFor example, the re-introduction of the stamp duty holiday for FTBs, force the banks to offer competitive mortgage rates for FTBs or relax the deposits required for FTBs.  There may be other, more beneficial incentives about how this government can help FTBs but the issue needs to be discussed and soon, otherwise a whole generation risks being excluded from the property market which would have far reaching implications for society.\r\n",
