This so called parent does not have the right to be back on the street and in a community to potentially \"mother\" another child.\r\n\r\nThe process of serving a minimum of 5 years for the atrocious crime that was committed needs to be reviewed under the sentencing policy. To release this person after only serving 4 years of a serious offence is an absolute insult to all true parents across the globe.\r\n\r\nThe signatures on this e-petition prove that the public want answers and aren't prepared to continually put up with poor sentences being given to criminals attributing to the murder of children.\r\n\r\nWe ask that the government stop the release of Baby P's Mother immediately and review the sentencing procedure for such horrific crimes.",
