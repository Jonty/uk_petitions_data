        "additional_details": "This petition aims to raise awareness of the bizarre application of deportation rules.  Poloko Hiri has fought for this country and yet on the basis of a speeding offence, is to be deported.\r\nThis is not only bizarre, but disgusting to treat an individual this way.  Whilst guidelines exist, there are better ways and more sensible ways of applying them.\r\nThis man should not be deported on this basis.  For goodness sake, a man was granted leave to stay on the basis of a cat allegedly.  Mr Hiri has a daughter here and his human rights to that, let alone representing this country count for so much more.\r\nThis petition therefore aims to overthrow that decision and questions how rules are applied.",
