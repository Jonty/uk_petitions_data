        "additional_details": "The Government and the Prison Service has threatened the Prison Officer who set this forum up with dismissal. The forum has been set up to give a voice to hard working Prison Staff who on a daily basis face violence from the most dangerous members of society. The forum does not breach the Official Secrets Act or libel individuals. What it does do is tell the truth abut the dangers faced by staff on a daily basis and how the assaults on these staff are brushed under the carpet.\r\n\r\nPlease support these brave servants of society by signing this petition and sending it to family and friends.",
