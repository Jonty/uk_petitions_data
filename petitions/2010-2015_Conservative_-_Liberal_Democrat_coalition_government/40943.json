The number of migrants due to arrive here is expected to be even higher than the number of Polish and other Eastern Europeans that arrived when restrictions were lifted for them in 2004.\r\nWith every public service already stretched to breaking point how are we as a country supposed to support this? The Government must step in to protect jobs, housing, benefits, hospitals and schools. I fear this could break our already fragile economy.  ",
