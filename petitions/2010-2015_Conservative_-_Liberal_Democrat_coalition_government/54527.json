        "additional_details": "There are many ways in which people remember loved ones that are now gone. Some tend graves, most have photos and those who have served may have medals that mean so much to them. Over time as memories fade and age increases these things become harder to tend, faded with time or passed by without a glance and those that went before us are slowly forgotten.\r\n\r\nBy creating a special engraved \u00a31 coin at this time, with the name of each UK citizen and their occupation on the reverse, we could as a nation provide relatives with a lasting reminder, one that can be carried with them wherever they go. As legal tender the relative may keep it safe or alternatively choose to let the coin go into the nations economy, making it possible for the coin to help its new owner feed and house his/her family. Children could grow up learning about the past by studying those that pass through their hands.\r\n\r\nAnd as a nation whenever we receive one in our change it will give us time to pause and reflect.",
