        "additional_details": "Studies have shown that teenage drivers are much more likely to crash their cars if they have teenage passengers. This is because teenagers like \"showing off\" to their peers, despite risking life and limb in the process. A legislation should be put into place banning teenage drivers from having any passenger under 21. This has already been successfully implemented in some regions of the United States.",
