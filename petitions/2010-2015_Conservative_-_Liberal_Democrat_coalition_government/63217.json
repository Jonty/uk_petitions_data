        "additional_details": "We the undersigned call on the government to address the increasing decline in grassroots football.\r\n\r\nGrassroots football is in a state of disrepair, pitches are poor and unmaintained, changing rooms dirty and undesirable and all this against a background of yearly rises in subscriptions fees.  We\u2019re paying more for less. It\u2019s no wonder people are leaving this great game of ours.\r\n\r\nThis decline is continuing to have an effect on the fortunes of our national teams, places an increased burden on the NHS and flies in the face of your keep Great Britain fit campaign.\r\n\r\nWe urge you to readdress this issue now.  No more empty words but real action with real benefits for all. Even a freshly mown pitch would be a start for some.\r\n\r\nGrassroots football has never been so poor yet our national game is richer than ever. We call on you to revisit your strategy and properly address the decline in facilities to reduce the increasing numbers leaving this great game of ours.",
