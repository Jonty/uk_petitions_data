        "additional_details": "Our Proposal is that all social networking sites request that a registered Debit or Credit card be given to be able to open a account with Socia networking sites like Facebook, Bebo and Myspace, this will ensure parents are able to monitor all accounts being open, it will also enable the authorities to be able to trace all accounts back to the user for miss use. Alternatively a user can upload a utility bill to the social networking site but the account would have to be opened in the name stated on the bill. This would ensure that adults that dont use Credit or Debits card are still able to create an account",
