        "additional_details": "The government has rightly identified that as a country we need to rebalance our economy away from relying on the financial service sector to support high-tech manufacturing.  To do that we need plenty of highly qualified scientists and engineers.  So it seems to be bizarre that at the same time you have chosen to reduce the relative spending on A-level science.  While you claim not to have reduced A-level science funding you have removed the higher additional funding these subject need to pay for laboratories etc.  I think you should reconsider this move and support the vital STEM subjects at higher funding levels than the cheaper to teach arts, humanities and social sciences.",
