        "additional_details": "The people in the UK need assurance that this disgraceful figure of 947,000 illegal immigrants is addressed and delt with by the minister and the Goverment. I ask that the people can see action rather than words in the controlling of our borders, and that they need a new structure. That they gain confidence that our present system is not swamped by the financial pressures of dealing with this amount of illegal immigrants. We must not see this figure increasing but reduced over the next 12 months.",
