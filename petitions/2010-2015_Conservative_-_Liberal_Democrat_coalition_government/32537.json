After the execution of these political Sikh prisoners there will be many more Sikhs hanged as they have been politically oppressed by the Indian State. The Indian State must stop the Genocide of all Sikhs and allow them to live with dignity and freedom. The Sikhs want to enjoy basic Human Rights and not be oppressed. Sikhs want the world to acknowledge the 1984 Sikh Holocaust by the Indian State. The Sikh nation should not be hanged for self defence and saving the life of many thousands of Sikhs. SHAME ON INDIA",
