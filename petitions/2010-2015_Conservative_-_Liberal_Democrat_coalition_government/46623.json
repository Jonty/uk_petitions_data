        "additional_details": "Everyone has a right to legal representation if arrested for a crime. This was originally as the poor had no representation at court.  It is now used simply when in police custody and before any questions have even been asked. It can be used each and EVERY time a person is arrested at the cost of the tax payer. As a way to reduce the cost to the tax payer it should change so that every person has 3 uses of free legal representation in police custody during their lifetime. The vast majority of the public would never need 3 uses and it would reduce the persistent offenders casual use of this expensive resource time and time again. After the 3 uses it would be the individual who would have to pay for any request for representation. This would still enable everyone to have access to representation, whilst greatly reducing the cost to the tax payer and so help reduce the budget deficit. It would also provide an alternative saving and reduce the pressure on welfare cuts.  ",
