        "additional_details": "I want to stop Asylum seekers being given large expensive houses, usually in the London area, at the taxpayers enormous expense, when they could just as easily live in a cheaper area.  They should not be given the choice to move just because they want to be in a nicer area....This should be stopped immediately by all local councils.  Asylum seekers should not be treated better than people who have lived and WORKED in the United Kingdom all their life and put their effort and resources into the structure of the community.  This is simply unfair and unjust.",
