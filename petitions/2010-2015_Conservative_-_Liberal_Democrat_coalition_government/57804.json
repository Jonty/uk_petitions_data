        "additional_details": "To influence road user practice and thereby make the roads safer for all users (especially the most vulnerable) a law of \"Presumed Liability\" must be enacted.\r\nThis will assume that the party operating the more hazardous vehicle is responsible in the event of a collision.\r\nThis practice already exists in a number of european countries, particularly those that are recognised as cycle friendly.  However this is not just about cycling but the protection of all vulnerable road users.\r\nThis is a very low cost option that I'm sure will have a significant bearing on the attitude and practices of road users and provide a safer environment for all.\r\n\"Presumed Liability\" will not prevent any party involved in a traffic incident from defending their case in the event that the more vulnerable party caused the accident.  Nor does it remove the need for ongoing investment in highways' safety infrastructure.\r\nACTION - The government should incorporate \"Presumed Liability\" into road traffic law. ",
