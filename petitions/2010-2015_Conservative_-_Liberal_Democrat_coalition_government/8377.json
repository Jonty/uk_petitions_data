        "additional_details": "We the undersigned, call upon Westminster City Council to abolish the new parking regulations within its borough, as the economic effect on the local business infrastructure will be catastrophic and will in effect lead to job losses due to the loss of revenue. In addition this will also severely compromise the safety of all night workers by forcing them (due to the extortionate parking fees proposed) to commute at unsociable hours by public transport which has proved in the past to be extremely dangerous, also for most this is not an option due to poor transport links in the early hours.",
