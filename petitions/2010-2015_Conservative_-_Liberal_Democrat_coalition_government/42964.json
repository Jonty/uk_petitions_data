The current cost of castle view house is \u00a3148 per sqm; compared with \u00a3553 per sqm in Manchester.\r\n\r\nNot only is there a business case to be made for this, but the move would have devastating effects on the 27th most deprived authority (Halton) in the country.\r\n\r\nHalton needs these jobs, and the DfE would save money.\r\n\r\nWe urge the department for education to reconsider their proposal.",
