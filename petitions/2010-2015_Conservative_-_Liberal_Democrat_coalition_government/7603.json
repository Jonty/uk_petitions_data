        "additional_details": "Legalise all drugs (availability via licenced premises).\r\n\r\nTop reasons for this (not exhaustive list):\r\n\r\n1. Prohibition fails. This is proven. The called war on drugs is a hugely expensive waste of resources.\r\n\r\n2. Eliminates the criminal market, which will then:\r\n\r\n3. Reduce crime. Most crime is drug related. Society would be much safer\r\n\r\n4. This leads to less people in prison (police can also be more effective as they will have more resources)\r\n\r\n5. Drug quality can be controlled (ie purity). Currently one of the greatest dangers to users is the amount of harmful chemicals that are cut with street drugs - not the drug itself\r\n\r\n6. The govt would raise substantial tax revenues from sales of drugs\r\n\r\n7. Most scientific evidence supports legalisation as\r\nthe best solution. There is also major support from *ex* high level police officers, *ex* govt officials, etc. ie the people in power *know* that this is the correct way forward but are fearful of losing votes",
