        "additional_details": "We request the Government intervenes to ensure English Heritage make an exception to its 20 year rule and erect a Blue Plaque to celebrate actress Dame Elizabeth Taylor in honour of the British origin of one of our greatest stars. One of her final wishes was to have a Blue Plaque erected at the place of her birth in Hampstead, London. Ms Taylor's request was made in person to TV presenter and journalist, Matthew Wright. English Heritage has a rule; the subject of each proposal must have been dead for 20 years to allow that person's reputation to  mature. Ms Taylor is Britain's most iconic screen actress also known for her humanitarian work. Her established reputation is unlikely to diminish. If English Heritage stick to this rule, her legion of older fans may not be here to view the plaque in situ. Her romance with actor Richard Burton remains the stuff of legend. Burton's Blue Plaque was erected by English Heritage in Hampstead in 2011. An exception must be made for Elizabeth Taylor.",
