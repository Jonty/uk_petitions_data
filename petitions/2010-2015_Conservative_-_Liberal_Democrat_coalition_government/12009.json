        "additional_details": "The after effects of violent horrific events can have long lasting impairments to individuals.  Events such as major pubic disorders, sexual crimes, and terrorist attacks natural disasters are sadly increasingly common place within modern society. Research has shown innocent members of the public along with public service professionals and military personnel can all be equally psychologically affected by these events.  Improved provision of integrated social, health, employment and financial assistance such as therapeutic intervention, employment support, eligibility to state benefits and rehabilitative health services is essential for UK citizens who have unfortunately experienced PTSD.  This will enable individuals to recover from the effects so they can make a continued worthwhile contribution to society.",
