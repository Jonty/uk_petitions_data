        "additional_details": "Although the culture of binge drinking appears to be prevalent in the UK, it is in fact a minority form of behaviour. The government could give more help and support to families and local communities to combat the problem through the introduction of more imaginative policies.  Examples of policies that could be useful are\r\n\r\nTrain and support parents and partners to address alcohol abuse in the family\r\n\r\nTrain bar staff to recognise alcohol problems and support them to not serve alcohol to drunks\r\n\r\nEncourage the alcohol industry to promote low/no alcohol drinks\r\n\r\nGive businesses incentives to promote Smart drinking policies\r\n\r\nReduce the free/cheap drink tokens handed out during \u2018freshers week\u2019\r\n\r\nAlthough binge drinking culture in Britain is a national scandal, dealing with it is a local issue.  We need to be more proactive and empower families and communities to help themselves.  Some this could be internet based and so be much less expensive than it would first appear.",
