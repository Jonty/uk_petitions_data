It is further suggested that this site become part of the testing, so that anyone who signs certain petitions (e.g. those calling for the return of the death penalty, or for immigrants/prisoners to lose their basic human rights) is removed from the electoral roll on the grounds of incompetence. Perhaps the signatories could then be given an experience of life under these conditions, followed by an opportunity to change their views; I'm sure it would be an enlightening experience for everyone.",
