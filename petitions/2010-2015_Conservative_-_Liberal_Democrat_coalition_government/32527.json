        "additional_details": "Animal rights activists that terrorise, intimate others & commit other crimes should be kept under surveillance & prosecuted if necessary. Animals bred for specially for the sole purpose of experimentation or food are often kept in less cruel conditions than if those animals were living wild, fending a living for themselves. Animal experimentation is as essential as breeding animals for food & harvesting the by-products (like leather) of their slaughter. In pharmacological R&D for new drug agonists (enhancers) or antagonist (inhibiters) of specific biochemical metabolic pathways & processes, SUITABLE animal models are required. Drugs attached (in lock & key fashion) to biological substrates (like to cell receptors in membranes, DNA, enzymes, precursor macromolecules) can switch on or off certain biochemical pathways of certain species concerned hence providing the desired chemotherapeutic intervention.",
