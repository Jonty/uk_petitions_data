        "additional_details": "I think it is crucial to consider downgrading and illegalising the drug \"Salvia\" to a class \"B\" drug. I think this is extremely important because unlike most illegal drugs such as Cannabis and Ecstasy, this drug causes much more physical harms than most of the illegal drugs available in the country, it can't be denied.\r\n\r\nProof of the harms of Salvia recently in the news a teenager grabbed a young baby out of a buggy and chucked it onto the floor, the baby did have minor injuries but could just have easily have died. Salvia causes extreme \"psychedelic hallucinations\" making the person under the influence of this drug \"out of touch with reality\", and most of the harms it does under the influence are physical harms to others and the person under the influence, to keep this drug legal just shows how corrupt our drugs laws are and should be changed.",
