        "additional_details": "As the law stands a person owning a back-to-back house is allowed to use their chimney without a flue-liner. This can cause unnecessary death (or at the very least poor ill-health that goes undetected) to the occupant/s in the adjoining house.\r\nThe onus is on them to prove that fumes (from a gas fire for example) are leaking into the house. The carbon monoxide content may be under the threshold of a carbon monoxide detectors' limits (PPI-parts per inch) and so there is very little that can be done, even by a solicitor, to ensure your safety from this, very real, danger.\r\nThis is to petition for a change in the law to make it compulsory to put a flue-liner in the chimney of all back-to-back houses.",
