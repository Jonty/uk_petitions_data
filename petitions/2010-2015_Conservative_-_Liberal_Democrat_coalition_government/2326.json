        "additional_details": "For years, it has been argued that responsible shooters should be allowed to fire conventional pistols and semi-automatic rifles again across a range of calibres.  A way to allow and facillitate this is to create a new class of firearms certificate whereby agreement is given by the owner of a firearm to it being permanently stored and used only at secure ranges and never leaving these facilities.  This would prevent any chance of misuse.  In addition, cost savings could be found by allowing holders to pay to use secure ranges currently only used by the police and army infrequently, thus maximising their use and creating an income stream to reduce the cost of such facilities.",
