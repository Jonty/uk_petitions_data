        "additional_details": "We call for the government to create post graduate loans (after degree) for students. After the government raised the fee's it is impossible for working class students to afford to pay \u00a39,000 for a master degree upfront. Resulting in education being for the wealthy and not for the deserving.\r\n\r\nCurrently a student can only gain funding through a career development loan through a bank. However this causes problems as it is hard for a full time student to pay back their loan while studying full time for their masters. Instead we call for a loan system like the current undergraduate system in which students pay back their loan once they are earning without interest.\r\n\r\nMake education fair, not for a price.",
