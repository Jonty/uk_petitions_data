A man can swim topless despite his toplessness being sexual in certain contexts, male strippers for example - women do not have that right.\r\n\r\nRevise gender discrimination laws so that requiring a woman to cover her breasts is treated as gender discrimination if the same is not required of a man e.g. at a public sauna.",
