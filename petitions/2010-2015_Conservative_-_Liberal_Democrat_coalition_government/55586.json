        "additional_details": "I have set up this epetition to have the Secretarty of State for Education Mr Gove experience life in a state school as to allow him a real insight into the education system.\r\n\r\nI feel that in order for Mr Gove to fully appreciate the education system then he should spend time teaching. As Mr Gove believes teachers only work from 8:30am till 3:30pm while enjoying too many holiday, earning too much money and working towards too large a pension. It would also allow him to see what a help and asset Teaching Assistants (TAs) are in the learning and development of pupils. He would also witness at first the absurd and unattainable expectations being set on children and teachers.\r\n\r\nI am more than welcome to host Mr Gove in my OFSTED accredited Outstanding school and it is my suggestion that the classroom where Mr Gove will teach should be set up with cameras. This would allow a documentary to be made to show the public how successful or unsuccessful Mr Gove finds his time in state education.",
