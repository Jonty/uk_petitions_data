In the words of local MP Tim Farron \u2018Appalling decisions taken over the last four or five years have turned a good hospital trust in to one that is now on the critical list\u2019. We believe that the Chief Executive of UHMBT must now take responsibility for these failures and move aside to allow patients and hardworking staff alike, to regain confidence in the management of our local hospital which has currently been lost. If this does not happen, we call upon the government to intervene.\u201d\r\n",
