        "additional_details": "We believe that everyone hs the right to their own life and death. Denying a dignified and painless death to those that wish it is a violation of their liberty, and should be stopped. Euthanasia is not murder, it is mercy for those that need it and will save thousands from unimaginable suffering and a lack of dignity. Letting people live in pain is barbaric. Please help end the suffering by signing the e-petition. Thank you.",
