We believe that this is an unwarranted extension of the powers of the state over our data and an erosion of our liberties.\r\n\r\nWe feel this legislation to be all the more egregious after both government parties campaigned against such measures in opposition. Defending our nation should not come at the price of our liberties. We call on the government to withdraw the planned legislation entirely.",
