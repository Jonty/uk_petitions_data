But it's also easy for cowboy companies such as car clampers to just ignore them. The existing methods to enforce judgments are expensive and unreliable for small amounts. I propose to allow claimants to use a low cost 'attachment of taxation' order whereby HMRC would add the claim to the tax owed, collect it using its existing efficient mechanisms, and repay the creditor.",
