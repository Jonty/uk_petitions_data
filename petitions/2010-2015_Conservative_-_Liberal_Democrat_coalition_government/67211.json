I would also like to see a register of road work being carried out so that utility companies can do there work either prior to road improvements or at the same time so we don't have patches of road way after a full resurfacing job.\r\nI believe the highways agency shall be responsible for all highways taking the ownership away from local councils then investment can be co-ordinated better.",
