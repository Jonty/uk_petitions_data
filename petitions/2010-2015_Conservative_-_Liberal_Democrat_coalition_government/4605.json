        "additional_details": "New Zealand\u2019s Accident Compensation Commission administers legislation that creates a social contract whereby individuals give up their right to sue for compensatory damages in exchange for comprehensive accident insurance cover and compensation.\r\nIn 1967 New Zealand abandoned a litigious, fault-based system, toward a completely new \u2018no-fault\u2019 approach to compensation for personal injury. Specifically it addressed;\r\n-all injuries to earners whether occurring at work or not, funded by a flat-rate levy on employers for the cost of all injuries to their employees.\r\n-all motor vehicle injuries, funded by a levy on owners of motor vehicles and drivers.\r\nNew Zealand ACC is now governed by the Accident Compensation Act 2001 under the same core principles.\r\nThis petition proposes that the creation of a similar body would greatly benefit the UK.  At the very least it will reduce insurance costs for motorists and businesses, and fairly end the culture of personal injury litigation.",
