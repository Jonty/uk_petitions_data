        "additional_details": "Currently the first \u00a330,000 of a redancy payment is tax free. My petition is to make ALL of a redundancy payment tax free. At the very time when a person needs all the resources thay can muster to cope with loosing a job; the Treasury will profit from you mis-fortune.\r\nThis \u00a330,000 limit has been in place for over 30 years (I think; probable longer). It has not been increased in line with inflation, if it had the limit would probable be around \u00a3100,000. The more money a person has when they are made redundant they longer they will not be a burden on the state",
