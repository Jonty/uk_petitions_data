I would like the government to introduce this tax to give incentive to people to lose weight.\r\n\r\nIt would improve health, saving the NHS money. Along with many other benefits.\r\n\r\nObviously this would exclude people who have a medical issue which helps to make them overweight. Also I would like the government to only apply the tax to people who are overweight due to fat and not muscle. ",
