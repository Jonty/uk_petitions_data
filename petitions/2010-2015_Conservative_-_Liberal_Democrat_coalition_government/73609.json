The principles of British justice articulated in the Magna Carta have come under lethal attack from the last two British governments. Examples are:\r\n\r\nThe Labour governments introduction of control orders - which attack legal process: breaking the principle of no incarceration without trial, and undermining Jury trial.\r\nThe Coalition governments attack on judicial review - which enables the executive to be held to account in court. They have also attacked Legal aid - designed to give the poor the same legal protections as the rich.\r\nThe Conservatives also plan to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which is a direct attack against the principles core to Magna Carta.\r\n",
