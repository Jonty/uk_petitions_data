        "additional_details": "We are asking that the Department of Education adds suicide awareness as a mandatory requirement for social education within the UK curriculum. Suicide accounts for the highest percentage of deaths in young men 18 - 25. Countless young adults succumb to suicidal thoughts, often with no pre existing mental health history and no \"warning signs\". We believe that raising awareness can encourage young adults to seek help at the most difficult time in their lives.",
