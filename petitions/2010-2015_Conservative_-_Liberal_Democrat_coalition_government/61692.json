We believe for the reputation of this proud footballing nation that he should be prevented from attending this summer's international showcase. Whilst England are considered to disappoint at major tournaments, further embarrassment could be avoided by not having his inept performances undermine the rest team's efforts.\r\n\r\nOh and ban the Green Party from parliament.",
