The amount saved will be added to each year and the compound interest / returns from investments must be reinvested / saved.\r\n\r\nThe same way that compound interest is used to increase the value of someone's savings if they reinvest that money each year can be used for the nations benefit. If we started now, the interest we as a nation could earn would continue to increase in value and instead of being in debtor nation we can slowly become a creditor nation again.\r\n\r\nSurely this would be a good thing to do in the long run! The government is always encouraging us to save for our retirement, perhaps they should start setting a good example and saving money too so that one day we can be debt free and not at the mercy of the financial markets.",
