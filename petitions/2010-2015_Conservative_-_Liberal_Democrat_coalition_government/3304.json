In its current form a driver can qualify as having received his required training by sitting through the same course every year. No courses have a requirement to pass, just to attend. Its just another way of creating paying work for trainers, and taxing hard working HGV/PCV drivers who receive the required training before taking their tests. And any half decent company will make sure its employees are updated in house, but this in house training is not applicable for the CPC. ",
