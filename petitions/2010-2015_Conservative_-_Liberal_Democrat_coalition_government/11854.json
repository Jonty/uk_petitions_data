        "additional_details": "The proposal is that non UK Citizens should not be entitled to FREE treatment on the NHS unless they are UK BRITISH Citizens who have resided in the UK OR been born here. New citizens and their relatives must have paid Income Tax and National insurance contributions for at least FIVE YEARS for entitlement to free treatment. If reciprocal arrangements exist then treatment can take place with costs being recovered from the patients country of origin. If no such arrangement exists then transporting patients to their home country should be their only route to treatment. Emergency treatment costs should be recovered direct from the government of their country of origin.  ",
