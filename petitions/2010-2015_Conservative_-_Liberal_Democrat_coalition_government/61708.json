Due to fenland council and RSPCA these dogs have been taken from jj rescue for no reason. Jj rescue gives dogs a home food and plenty off love no matter off the reason for them being there where the RSPCA will not do this and puts them to sleep. This is wrong and these dogs need to come back to the care off jj rescue. Please take five minutes and sign the petition and give these loving dogs a life to live.",
