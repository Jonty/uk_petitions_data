Bullying is learnt behaviour and children are easily influenced by the behaviour(s) they are exposed to, particularly when Adults in positions of authority and trust exhibit such behaviour(s).\r\nIt is unacceptable to assume that existing school complaint and grievance procedures are adequate.\r\n\u2022\tAll concerns raised about bullying behaviour should be independently and immediately investigated\r\n\u2022\tPeople who feel they are being bullied should be properly and independently supported\r\n\u2022\tInformation should be annonymised where possible to protect the victim(s)\r\n\u2022\tChildren should be protected at all times\r\n\u2022\tPeople should not be fearful of possible recriminations\r\n\u2022\tIf accusations of bullying are made they should be communicated to the alleged perpetrator at the time they are made to ensure that Hearings are fair\r\n",
