We should not be creating laws specifically for small sections of society where perfectly good laws already exist. If these sections of society do not like the laws in this country, they are free to go to a country that will meet with their requirements.\r\n\r\nOur British culture is slowly being eroded by the Islamic section of our society, yet, they form less than 5% of the population. To continually change our laws to fit in with their beliefs, is showing a bias and prejudice in their favour. Only when a Sharia complicit country starts to allow western culture into their country, should we consider letting them bring their culture to this, still mainly Christian, country.",
