Recently there has been an increase in cyber bullying and only in August did a young teenage girl kill herself due to the increase in hurtful messages she received from the site. If the government made it a rule to make sure sites checked what was written before it was posted and if it did fall under the category of sexual, abusive or bullying words ,then remove it. A lot less hate mail can be spread as a result and therefore lead to a decrease in cyber bullying.",
