        "additional_details": "I feel that people that live in Rural areas are being unfairly treated with the fuel prices.  I live in Norfolk and in my local town the fuel is a lot higher than anywhere else.\r\nI feel that the public transport infrastructure in Norfolk is poor, the latest i can get a bus to Norwich is 1800, where as in London they have Night Buses which run 24/7.\r\nPeople that live in London get the London Weighting allowance, In rural areas we stuggle we get no extra pay and the area we live in is as exspensive as London.\r\nI feel that some form of discount should be offered to people who live in a rural area.  Its just not fair.  If i could get a bus to and from work each morning i would for a return ticket.\r\nPlease help people out that are already struggling.  Cut the fuel prices in rural areas with poor public transport infrastructure.",
