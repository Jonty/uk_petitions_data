        "additional_details": "This Petition is to stop the Government raising the retirement age to 67 years old for state .\r\n\r\nWhy should the people be held to account for the Governments incompetent handling of the state pension fund over the past years.\r\n\r\nDo they not realise by making people work to later in life you are cheating the younger generation of Jobs.\r\n\r\nCurrently more and more people over 50 are finding it harder and harder to find work. All you will do is condem a large majority of people of this age group to seek income support so increasing the national debt this is a very short sighted view and will just cause families even greater stress than they are currently under. Please stop this now!!",
