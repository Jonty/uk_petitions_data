This is unfair for parties which hold regional seats and these people should be given a chance to speak also. Any party with more than 2 seats should be invited to a debate which along with the big players can appeal to the voting public and get their views across. Not everyone is happy or votes for the big 3 so the others should be allowed a voice to fight for their cause. ",
