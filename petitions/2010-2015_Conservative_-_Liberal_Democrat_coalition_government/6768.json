The benefits system is regually abused by large proportions of people.  If we are to review Public Services, then the Benefit system must also be independently reviewed and the law changed or further powers given to investigate and prosecute people who abuse a system designed to help people.\r\n\r\nIt is not fair that people in Public Service who risk there lifes for the public, have their pay and conditions changed whilst those on benefits do not.",
