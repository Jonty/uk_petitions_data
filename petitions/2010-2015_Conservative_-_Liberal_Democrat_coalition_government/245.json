        "additional_details": "We call upon the Government to make trainee teachers bursary funding fair for all.\r\n\r\nIn the recent discussion paper \"Training Our Next Generation of Outstanding Teachers,\" Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove proposes grading trainee teacher\u2019s bursaries by both subject choice and undergraduate degree classification.\r\n\r\nThe proposal implies that trainee teachers with lower degree classifications have lower potential as teachers.\r\n\r\nThe proposal ignores any other qualities that could give a trainee teacher greater \u2018potential\u2019 such as additional qualifications or work experience.\r\n\r\nThis petition is for fair bursary allocations for all trainee teachers regardless of their previous experience and qualifications. When a trainee teacher begins training they are all at the same level and should be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, believe in fair and appropriate funding for the next generation of teachers and ask the Government do the same.\r\n",
