        "additional_details": "Over 40 years ago salary increases were calculated as a fixed amount eg. \u00a320 a week across the board. But for decades now companies have been using annual salary percentage increases. This has created the massive differential in salaries that now exists and it has caused the 'have and have nots' situation we see today, helping stoke the Financial Crises we now face. We need to stop this method of salary increase as the Government now has to find a way of devaluing all our debts and so called savings created within our now inefficient fiat currency. ",
