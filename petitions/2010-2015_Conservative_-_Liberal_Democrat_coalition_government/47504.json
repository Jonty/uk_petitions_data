        "additional_details": "This petition is to be signed by those who believe the dangerous dogs act needs to be reformed.\r\n\r\nIt currently states that a dog can be destroyed if its looks fit a certain description no matter what the dogs personality is like. The goverment should reform this piece of legislation so that a dogs temperment is taken into account before a dog can be seized or destroyed. It should not cost the pet owner money trying to pay for legal fees fighting for their loved pet.\r\n\r\nLooks do not determine a dogs behaviour. It is against the law to discriminate against a persons race so why can this be allowed for a dog who cannot speak or defend itself?",
