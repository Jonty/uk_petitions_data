        "additional_details": "We need to stop the unnecessary suffering of feral ponies grazing in herds on our common land, moors and mountains within England & Wales.\r\nHorses are classed as 'domestic' animals  and require a passport & microchip to determine ownership. However, as these ponies are randomly bred, reared and sold as a 'herd' they are, under the current law, exempt from  passports & microchips.  This law needs to change: These ponies are being 'farmed' for the meat market and should, therefore, be treated and regulated as farm animals just like cattle and sheep.\r\n\r\nThe Government needs to  change the law  and introduce Regulation for 'herd' grazing ponies in order to prevent the ongoing suffering, abuse and neglect that is caused as a consequence of this current loophole.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
