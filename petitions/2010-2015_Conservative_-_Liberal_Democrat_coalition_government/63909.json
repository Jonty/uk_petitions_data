        "additional_details": "Under present law there is absolutely no permission required if a pub/cafe/restaurant is changed from an A1 to an A3, which is the classification for a retail outlet.\r\nThe law must be changed on the grounds that an A1 is intended for recreational leisure and community use. Large supermarket retailers are presently commandeering pubs and restaurants without requiring any permission or without there having to be any consideration to the impact on the local plan or traffic flow. There is nothing in law that will prevent them from opening a store on a busy roundabout or next door to an existing local supermarket, whereas a new development has to adhere to much more planning regulation before it can be passed.\r\nA law cannot be applied to one set of circumstances but be completely disregarded because planning permission is not necessary by default.\r\nA local council should have the power to object without fear of being fined by the Government because of the way the law stands.",
