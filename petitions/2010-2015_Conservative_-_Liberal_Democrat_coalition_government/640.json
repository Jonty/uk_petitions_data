        "additional_details": "Presently members of all Commonwealth countries such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh can vote in British elections simply by being resident in the British Isles. The law should be reformed so that members of Commonwealth countries are not able to vote in British elections unless they hold British citizenship. There are presently over one million Commonwealth citizens in the UK who are not British citizens but are able to vote in British elections. British citizens are not able to vote in most other Commonwealth countries such as India and Pakistan, and being able to vote in our elections should not be used as a means of showing any type of international relationship. It should be restricted to those voters who have British citizenship. It will require a simple reform of the Representation of the People Act to ensure that only British citizens may vote in British Elections, with the understanding that at present EU citizens do have the right to participate in local elections.",
