        "additional_details": "I feel that current guidelines on sentencing for causing DEATH BY CARELESS DRIVING are far too lenient.  Although it could be argued that the person responsible 'has to live with it' for the rest of their lives, the current sentencing makes a mockery of the suffering endured by the bereaved for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\nI feel that longer bans and a mandatory retraining and driving test are necessary.\r\n\r\nI would like to ask that HM Government to make the driving ban at least 3 years.  I would also like to ask for driver awareness courses and a resit of the driving test(theory and practical),to be mandatory.",
