        "additional_details": "It is totally unfair to have to pay more for a two \"6 months\" tax disks than for one \"12 months\" tax disk.\r\n\r\nI cannot understand how the government justifies to take more money from people who don't have enough money to pay this tax for 12 months in advance. It is a more expensive tax on people who already have less money. This is ridiculous and unfair.\r\n\r\nAny argument that it costs more money to run two transactions instead of one is unjustified as the application is done on-line (same system in place for 6 or 12 months applications) and most of the process is automatic.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult times, I think that it would good for people to not have to pay more because they are less well off than others.\r\n\r\nThe prices of two \"6 months\" tax disks or one \"12 months\" tax disk should be the same.",
