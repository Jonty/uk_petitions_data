        "additional_details": "This Police force are illegal! They want a friend of mine to die!\r\nI was trying to warn my friend that she needs to forgive as she is a Christian and this is part of her Christian faith, but she will not. If she does not she could be liable for Armageddon destruction and I did not want her to die.\r\nBut she got her local Police force involved threatening to arrest me if I made any further contact.\r\nI complained to them and IPCC but neither of them upheld the complaint, ignoring the warning that she may die.\r\nI cannot see that I did any wrong. I was warning my friend because I cared about her. So my complaint should have been upheld.\r\nIf this petition passes then I want this unlawful Police force replaced with a more justified Police (if Lincolnshire must have one) and my complaint upheld.",
