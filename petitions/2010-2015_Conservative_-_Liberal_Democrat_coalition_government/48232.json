        "additional_details": "Ban the Grand National\r\nFor too long, the cruelty of the race has been blithely ignored by the horse-racing authorities and the race-going public.\r\nIt shouldn\u2019t be like this. Sport, after all, is meant to be an uplifting activity, reflecting the quest for excellence and heroism in competition. But there is nothing remotely inspirational or heroic about forcing horses to gallop round a dangerous course at high speed and risk sustaining painful, even fatal falls.\r\nIn the Grand National alone, ten horses have been killed since 2000. And last year, the Cheltenham race meeting was overshadowed by the death of five horses. The first day of racing this year has already resulted in the first 'casualty'.\r\nThere is only one way to stop the suffering of the horses and that is to ban the Grand National. If racing enthusiasts truly respected these noble, majestic creatures, they would be unable to tolerate any longer such needless cruelty  masquerading as sport.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
