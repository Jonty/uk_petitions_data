        "additional_details": "Reduce the House of Lords in size, by removing representatives of all religions.  This would involve Islamics and Christians and any minority quasi-political group of activists including Born-Again Christians.  These groups would still receive representation through their existing Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nReplace them in the House of Lords with a Third Chamber of appointed experts.  These individuals would move in or out of the House of Lords, as government business demand changes.\r\n\r\nReform the House of Commons, by transferring to the elected MPs a responsibility for business associated with a sole  government department but with the constituency enlarged to cover the whole UK. This would enable MPs to train for career advancement to a Third Chamber and then the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThis is more in line with modern business practices.\r\n\r\n",
