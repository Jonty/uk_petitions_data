        "additional_details": "Currently, the E.U represents 65% of our government, however \"government with the consent of the governed.\"\r\n\r\nMany suggest we should have an EU referendum, but there is an alternative.\r\n\r\nAs British citizens we wish to hold more opinion in decision-making to re-enforce democracy. If the current government do not wish to withdraw from the E.U, which many citizens desire, the U.K and the other 26 member states should consider lowering the amount of decision the E.U has.\r\n\r\nSurely we deserve some consensus in decision-making.\r\n\r\nWe would like our government to represent us by suggesting a Lisbon Treaty Reform, if signed by 100,000+ we would like to bring this proposal to the most convenient conference.\r\n\r\nThis would improve development of the E.U's member states drastically.",
