        "additional_details": "Allotments provide the opportunity of exercise and traditional hobbies.\r\n\r\nJohn Corker, 71, has kept bantams for 10 years and is involved in local and regional exhibitions with the birds, winning many accolades. He keeps a variety of poultry and waterfowl, including rare breeds.\r\n\r\nThe birds are shut away in the evening to prevent noise and located on an allotment over 50m from any residential dwelling, as recommended by the Allotments Act of 1926-1950 which is still in action.\r\n\r\nThe allotments have been located on the Grange Villa site since 1900, housing a poultry scheme. However following 1 complaint regarding noise, the Parish Council has decided to ban cockerels on the site without the option for discussion or appeal.\r\n\r\nSign our petition for the government to lift the ban, to save these rare breed birds and the dying traditional hobbies of our regions, as the ban spreads.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/watch-county-durham-champion-chicken-8028234",
