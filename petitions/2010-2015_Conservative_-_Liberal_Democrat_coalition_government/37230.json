        "additional_details": "As a regular customer of Virgin Trains on the West Coast Line, I can testify to the fact that Virgin provide a very high quality service - fast, friendly, efficient and by and large affordably priced.\r\n\r\nFeedback on social networking sites to the news of Virgin's loss of the West Coast franchise strongly suggests that many other rail users are as dismayed at the idea as I am.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to urgently rethink its decision to award the franchise to First Group instead.  Rail passengers are, after all, taxpayers as well, and should be given chance to express their views and have those views taken into consideration before any major changes are made.\r\n\r\nAs the saying goes - if it ain't broke, don't fix it!",
