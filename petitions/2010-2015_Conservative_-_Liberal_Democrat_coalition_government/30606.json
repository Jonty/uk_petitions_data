Community hospital beds are desperately needed for the area including pallative care and rehabilitation beds.  Care in patient's homes is not adequate and care in good nursing homes is in short supply and too expensive in the area.\r\nA Minor Injuries Unit should also be provided to ease the long waits in the local acute hospital A/E in Worthing.",
