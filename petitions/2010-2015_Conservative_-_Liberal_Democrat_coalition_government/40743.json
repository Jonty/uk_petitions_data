Remember smoking and alcohol are both legal and are the main factor for hundreds of thousands of deaths a year, yet cannabis has never been a cause of death.\r\n\r\nAllowing people to grow there own or make it available to purchase. Actually putting money into the economy from taxation. Not just for those who require it medically, but those who enjoy smoking the herb recreationally and for those whole enjoy just looking at the beautiful herb.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
