        "additional_details": "With Motor cycles paying more than cars, new roads with tolls, just keeping 3000 people in work, and subjecting the poor to having to get a cheap car with higher fuel and road tax, now is the time to stop completely Road tax. Certainly the amount can be phased in so all new cars sold with 10 years road tax added, all older cars after 10 years exempt.\r\n This will save the government money, help the poor at a stroke, encourage smaller cars.\r\n France has done it saving a lot of money and for the poor many hastles.",
