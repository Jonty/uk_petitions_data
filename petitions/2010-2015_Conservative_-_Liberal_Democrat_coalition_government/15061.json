This has to STOP. Far too many dogs / people are suffering dog attacks and this is not being actioned by the police or authorities. Stop blaming the dogs behaviour and start acting on the owners. Any breed of dog can attack. All owners have a responsibility for this NOT to happen.\r\n\r\nGive the police the authority to prosecute dog owners who do not abide by set guide lines in public places, e.g. keeping dogs on leads and under control at all times.\r\nEnforce new laws with regards to dog ownership and dangerous breeds and bring back Dog Licences for all dog owners with \u201con the spot checks\u201d. Have this scheme policed by Community Support officers or dog wardens and backed by the authorities.\r\n",
