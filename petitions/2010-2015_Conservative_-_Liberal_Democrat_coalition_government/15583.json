Civil servants working for Alex Salmond revealed the difference between expenditure and taxes in Scotland between 2009-10 was \u00a314 billion. This is blatantly unfair, and Westminster should act immediately to assess this to get a fair deal for all the citizens of the UK whom they are meant to represent.",
