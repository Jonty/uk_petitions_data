        "action": "Terminate all arms deals with the Israel Defense Forces.",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned urge the government to terminate all deals between the United Kingdom and the Israel Defense Forces (\"the IDF\") concerning the trade of weaponry, ammunition and machinery.\r\n\r\nIn November of last year, the IDF launched a seven day operation against the Gaza Strip called 'Operation Pillar of Defense'.  This led to the deaths of 103 Palestinian civilians and hundreds more wounded. It has become increasingly clear that the Israeli government is prepared to attack Palestinian territory in an entirely disproportionate manner.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Defence has committed itself to supplying the IDF with light weaponry, components and ammunition for tanks, helicopters and other combat vehicles. The British government cannot allow these arms to come into reach of those who intend to use them without justification.\r\n\r\nI therefore urge the government to reconsider arms deals with Israel and to prevent our country from funding the offensive nature of said country.",
