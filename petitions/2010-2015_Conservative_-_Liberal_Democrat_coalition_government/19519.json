        "additional_details": "With the European Union constantly attempting to increase it's political powers, and the European Court of Human Rights challenging Parliament on the matter of prisoner voting rights, this petition calls on the House to pass a bill affirming that British Parliament alone holds supreme authority over the United Kingdom, and that in matters where British law conflicts with European Union law, British law takes precedence. Furthermore, this bill must revoke the rights of national British courts to issue a declaration of incompatibility when they believe that an Act of Parliament contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights. Parliament, led by the democratically elected House of Commons, not the courts, must decide the future of this country.",
