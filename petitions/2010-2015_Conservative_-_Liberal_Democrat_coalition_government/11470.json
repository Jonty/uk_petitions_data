In my opinion they drive un-taxed due to this cost. Paying either for 6 or 12 months can be a shock to their finances and they'd rather risk it.\r\n\r\nI would ask the government to introduce a monthly direct debit option. I feel that this would make it more affordable for those on lower incomes, obviously without any kind of surcharge for using this option.",
