It is strictly forbidden in Islam for Muslims to consume or use any products associated with pigs.\r\n\r\nThe upmarket brand also has a selection of handbags and wallet.\r\n\r\nThere are over 4.6% Muslims living in UK.\r\nIt would be great that something could be done about this as lot of Muslims are not aware of this.\r\n\r\nMuslims are not allowed to pray, go to Mosques, fast etc when wearing pig leather shoes.\r\n\r\nAt least there should be a label on each leather shoe giving us just a little information on what leather is this shoe made of.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if this matter could be taken as serious s possible.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n",
