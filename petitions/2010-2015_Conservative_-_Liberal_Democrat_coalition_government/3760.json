        "additional_details": "Many families in the UK today are blended families so one or more of the parents may have children from previous relationships, and therefore may have to pay child maintenance. When a blended family is in receipt of state benefits in most cases the child maintenance payment is restricted to \u00a35 per week taken direct from their benefits.  If the blended family has one or more adults in work this payment can rocket to a staggering proportion of their income. In most cases this rise would make the family far worse off for working thus forcing a lot of families to stay on state benefits, when they want to work. I propose that a family with children should only have to pay the mandatory \u00a35 per week if they are in receipt of Working Tax Credits, thus solving the problem and getting them back into work.",
