        "additional_details": "The introduction of Lasting Powers of Attorney has brought with it, excessive complexity and cost. If a solicitor is used, the cost is prohibitive. If an individual prepares their own form, it is a complex procedure for the novice and registration costs alone are high.\r\nThe government is currently reviewing the separate \"health\" segment, with a view to converting this to a tick box on the \"finance\" segment.\r\nThe opportunity should be taken to revert to something more in line with the former Enduring Power of Attorney document which was far more simple and cheaper to deal with.\r\nThe existing Lasting Power of Attorney document is likely to result in too many people taking no action to ensure their affairs are dealt with in a way that they would wish, in the event that they should become incapable of managing their own affairs.",
