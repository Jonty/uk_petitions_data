        "additional_details": "Michael Gove is a minister which is ruining our education system. His policy of removing January exams are going to cause unnecessary stress on pupils. This is because A-Levels are already extremely challenging, and Gove passing these reforms should trail whether he could do this himself.\r\nThe GCSE system needs reforming, but the reform proposed by Mr Gove is being rushed and not thought through of the impact it's going to have on the students which are not academedically intellectual.\r\nGove was recently got a vote of no confidence from teachers and he should resign as Education minister.",
