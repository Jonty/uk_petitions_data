        "additional_details": "Anjem Choudary is the co-founder of now proscribed group Al-Muhajiroon. He is best known for his extremist views which most recently he has voiced in relation to the brutal murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby. Anjem Choudary preaches hate, conflict and hostility which in turn create division amongst our diverse communities in Britain. He does not speak for British Muslims and we, the undersigned, ask the government to stop the British media from giving him opportunities to voice his hateful and divisive rhetoric. ",
