If this is allowed to happen, this will be another example of corporations being allowed to escape their responsibilities to the British taxpayer, not only seeking to make an unwarranted profit from NHS healthcare but to then avoid paying due taxes on that profit. This is unacceptable and abhorrent to the spirit of the NHS. ",
