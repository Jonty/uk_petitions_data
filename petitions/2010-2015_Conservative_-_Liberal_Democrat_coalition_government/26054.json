        "additional_details": "A petition for Her Majesty's government to remove all sellers of the magazine 'The Big Issue' from the streets of the UK. There have been numerous reports of these homeless sellers acting aggressive and being a general nuisance to the general public as well as obstructing entrances to public places. The content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues that are relevant to them. The Big Issue Company does not need to have sellers on the street; the magazine can easily be distributed by other means.",
