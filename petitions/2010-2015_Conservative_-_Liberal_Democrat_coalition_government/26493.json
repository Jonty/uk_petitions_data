        "additional_details": "The use of billion as a unit is becoming an increasingly common monetary unit. The UK's definition of a billion is the long scale unit - 1 000 000 000 000. However, mass media and government reports frequently substitute the short scale definition for this unit. This makes the usage of billions unnecessarily confusing.\r\n\r\nI would like the government to take a consistent approach with its own documents and statements when reporting amounts in billions.\r\n\r\nI would also like the government to actively encourage the consistent usage of the unit when values are quoted in GBP within the british mass media.",
