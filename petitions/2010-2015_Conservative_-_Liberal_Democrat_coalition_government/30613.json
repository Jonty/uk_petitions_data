        "additional_details": "The Government are currently discussing stopping all of the Diplomas at GCSE/A-Level. The Diplomas are worth 7 1/2 GCSE's. Diplomas give people the chance to study about the industry and get an insight into what it is like for a career choice for their future.\r\n\r\nI am currently in year 11 and am the last year to be doing the Creative and Media Diploma it has helped me in many ways not just in the Arts but in English and other essay subjects. It's a great atmosphere and environment for learning which should not be stopped! I want the Government to keep Diplomas as it opens options of learning for future job which otherwise would not be available.",
