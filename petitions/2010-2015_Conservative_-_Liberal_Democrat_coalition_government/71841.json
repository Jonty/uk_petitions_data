        "additional_details": "The British Thyroid Foundation insist that if the patient's thyroid blood test result lies within the reference range they do not have  a thyroid condition.  The reference range is made up of, \" 95% fiducial limits of so-called healthy people\", which means, \"An assumed fixed basis of comparison of so-called healthy people\". If the starting point is loose then surely there must be flexibility upon interpretation. Patients' may still have a  have a low thyroid condition even although there results lie within the reference range.\r\nACTION FOR DOH:  GP's and endocrinologists to take into consideration signs and symptoms together with the blood test result even if T4 is in the lower half and TSH is raised. We are all individual and no one has a base line to work from. How do the GP's know where we should be in the range.\r\n",
