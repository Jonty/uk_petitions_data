        "additional_details": "The UK Parliament legislated for the Scottish independence referendum to be a decision for Scotland alone.  However, unlike devolution, Parliament acted without a mandate either from manifesto pledges in a general election or a specific referendum.  As a result, the electorates in Northern Ireland, Wales and England have been disenfranchised on the future of their country without their consent.\r\n\r\nA referendum should be held across the UK prior to the proposed Scottish independence referendum to confirm that Scotland can hold one independence referendum.",
