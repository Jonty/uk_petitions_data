I have watched them since the current government has come in to power and the only thing I hear is the coalition blame labour or the EU for all the problems.\r\n\r\nIf they didn't want to deal with these issues then they shouldn't have wanted to get into office.\r\n\r\nPrime Ministers questions currently has no purpose or relevance to the current electorate. Something needs to be put in place to stop politicians from avoiding questions that we want answered.\r\n\r\nUsing the same old tactic of \"Your government did this\" or \"Your government did that\" and even \"The world is the problem\" simply doesn't cut it any more, things are far more serious than they have been for a long time and we want answers!\r\n\r\nAn easy way to fix it would be to not allow any reference to former governments in current PMQ's stopping the \"blame game\" from going on and some straight answers being had.
