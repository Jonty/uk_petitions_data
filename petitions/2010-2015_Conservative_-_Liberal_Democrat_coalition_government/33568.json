        "additional_details": "I would like the government to supply funding or to issue an act of parliament that requires Lincoln City Council and Lincolnshire County Council to create a purpose built Park and ride site outside of Lincoln City, one of the most applicable locations being Carholme round-about.\r\n\r\nLincoln has required a designated park and ride site for some considerable time. I propose that it operates from the out side the city along the successful ring road.\r\nA Park and Ride system is operated every year during the Lincolns famous Christmas Market and proves very successful, the City of Lincolns economy is set to increase and this is illustrated with the growing tourism accommodation offer in the city, the investment of \u00a318 million for the redevelopment of Lincoln Castle and the ongoing development of Lincoln University is also a factor.\r\n",
