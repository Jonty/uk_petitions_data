        "additional_details": "This is the United Kingdom, A union, but its more like England funding the other nations to have a better welfare state than our own! English people are discriminated, clearly why do English students have to pay \u00a39000 a year fees and Scottish students don't pay 1p. EMA was taken of only English students. Only English people have to pay for NHS prescriptions over 18. These are few but very major points there are many other points that the government must address because it simply is not fair to say the least after all this should be one country. and it shouldn't matter where you live in it! And the argument isn't to take funding of the Scotish but to simply make the criteria British.",
