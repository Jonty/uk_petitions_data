        "additional_details": "We want to see the separation of church and state, we don't want to see the church of England representatives sitting in the house of lords, we don't want the queen to be advocating for one religion as its head, as this is not in line with giving equal rights to both the religious of all types and the irreligious.We believe that this Idea that has been achieved in the united states, France, Australia, Canada, Etc and should be made for the UK. We believe for Our society to progress we need these changes and more such as the ending of the coronation oath which involves religion and the changing of the national anthem which includes  the word GOD, which is not a secular ideal.",
