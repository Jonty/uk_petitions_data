        "additional_details": "Currently GP practices can charge a maximum of \u00a350 to provide a copy of a patients medical record. In some cases this can take hours of a staff members time due to the size of the record plus it can cost anywhere between \u00a35 an \u00a310 to be posted by special delivery to ensure its safe arrival. This fee has been set at the same level for many years and we would like it to properly reflect the amount of time spent on each individual record and the appropriate postage costs. This requires a change in an act of parliament.",
