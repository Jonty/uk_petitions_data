        "additional_details": "I would like the Government to reintroduce a two year period of National Service for all UK males and females between the ages of 18 to 24. This would:\r\n\r\n1. Stop those illegally entering the UK to avoid national service in their own countries.\r\n\r\n2. Create a strong skills base in the UK to be used on leaving the service to get a job. Many employers are now crying out for this.\r\n\r\n3. Help reduce crime on the streets and prevent drug addiction thus helping the police and the NHS.\r\n\r\n4. Instill in young people a sense of discipline and moral responsibility.\r\n",
