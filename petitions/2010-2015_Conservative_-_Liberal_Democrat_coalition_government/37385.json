        "additional_details": "Start building council houses again. The money you give to private landlords would be kept within the community. Jobs would be provided for many workers. Mothers would be able to afford to stay at home with children if paying a reasonable council rent. THE GREED FACTOR WOULD BE CUT OUT OF THE HOUSING INDUSTRY. Private house prices would stabilise. Leave the right to buy after 5 years. Give people back pride in rented homes. End the misery of uncertainty and 6 month rentals. The situation we have now  means we are going backwards into the 19th century.",
