        "additional_details": "Young adults get a raw deal when it comes to housing and homelessness once they're over the age of 18. Councils have no responsibility to help homeless young people over the age of 18 and there is little other help available . This makes the vulnerable even more vulnerable. We urge the government to reconsider the definition of vulnerability when assessing whether a priority is owed to an under 25 to stop young people who have support needs becoming or remaining homeless. We also urge the government to put pressure on local councils to free up single housing stock for single homeless young people. ",
