        "additional_details": "It is extremely upsetting for disabled people to be continually labelled things such as \"scroungers\" and  \"benefit cheats\" by the media, certain politicians and members of the public.  These attitudes encourage hate crimes towards disabled people, and actually risk worsening the mental or physical health of people who are already ill.  I wish the government to legislate against public service officials and the media using inflammatory and insulting language about disabled people.",
