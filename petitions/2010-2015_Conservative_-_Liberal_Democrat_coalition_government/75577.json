        "additional_details": "Since non drivers are often at a serious disadvantage when applying for jobs even when driving is not required, could the government please consider increasing the tax allowance for working non drivers as a reward for their efforts and their lower carbon footprint. The money for such an incentive could come from fuel duty. The same incentive could be offered to driving employees who nevertheless use public transport or walk or cycle to work, as a better alternative to employers charging for parking at work.",
