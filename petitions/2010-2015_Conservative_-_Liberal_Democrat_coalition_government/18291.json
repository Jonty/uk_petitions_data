We believe that  fortnightly collections should be maintained and that central government should encourage more councils to implement the fortnightly schemes, learning from other local councils about improving waste reduction.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that weekly collections are not a 'basic right' and if that were the case the UN would have made an issue of weekly collections many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe money being used by government to increase the number of bin collections, should instead be used to encourage more councils to introduce fortnightly schemes.",
