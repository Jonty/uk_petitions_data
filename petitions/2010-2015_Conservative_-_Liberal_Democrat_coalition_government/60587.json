        "additional_details": "HM Government should call on the Football Association to rethink its proposed ban on footballers displaying messages on t-shirts during matches. Such a ban would disappoint fans and the media, as well as denying freedom of expression.\r\n\r\nAny legal concerns about such messages could surely be addressed by requiring players to clear slogans with the referee before the game. Referees are already required to report such messages after the match, so any new legislation is unnecessary.",
