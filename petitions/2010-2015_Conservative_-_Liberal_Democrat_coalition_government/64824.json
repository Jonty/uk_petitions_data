        "additional_details": "The FA have today launched plans to introduce Premier League B teams into a new league within the football pyramid.\r\n\r\nThis will have detrimental affects to all lower league sides from a financial aspect to possible stadium moves to allow B teams to compete. Lower league youngsters will also be tapped up to fill these B teams, making it harder to compete and gulfs between PL and FL will become wider.\r\n\r\nWe already have Champtionship, League 1 and League 2 sides that can be used as feeder clubs for PL stars rather than PL sides gaining extra income.\r\n\r\nAs a lower football league fan we urge everyone to sign this so that the football hierarchy understand the anger and dismay we have towards their plans.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and stop this madness!",
