        "additional_details": "The majority of drivers set off from traffic lights as soon as the red and amber phase starts, not waiting for the green. This risks collisions with any vehicles crossing during the amber phase.\r\n\r\nWe should eliminate the red and amber phase, going straight from red to green. This would bring us into line with mainland Europe.\r\n\r\nThe red and amber phase was to give time for drivers to engage first gear from the days when the clutch would burn out if you stayed in gear when stationary. It is no longer needed and it's elimination would increase road safety.",
