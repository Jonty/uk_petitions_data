It does not, however, show that a person is suitable for the role they are applying for. It also only proves that a person has been caught. Someone could get away with crimes against the very people they are supposed to be caring for years without being caught. This is why I think that a clean CRB does not always show the true picture of someone\u2019s character/personality.\r\nI am proposing that the Government should introduce a compulsory additional test of character/personality so that the wrong people are not employed in sensitive job roles. This test should be a compulsory part of the employers interview process.\r\nHaving personally worked with some of the most uncaring people I have ever met I do think this test needs to be introduced as soon as possible.\r\n",
