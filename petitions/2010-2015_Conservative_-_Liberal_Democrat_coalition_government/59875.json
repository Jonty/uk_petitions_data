        "additional_details": "In January 2013 a new meningitis B vaccine called Bexsero was licensed by the European Commission but it is currently only available in the UK privately (at a huge cost) and if specifically requested.\r\n\r\nMillions of \u00a3s are annually given to foreign countries in aid, but the Government is not able to protect its own.  This is completely unacceptable and unfair.  We are the tax payers in this country, and we should be given the means of protecting our own children first.\r\n\r\nThis vaccine will save thousands of lives, especially among children under five who are most at risk.\r\n\r\nMeningitis B is the most common form of the disease in the UK and one of the deadliest.\r\n\r\nWe urgently need the Government to intoduce the vaccine into the UK Routine Childhood Immunisation Schedule, thereby making it available on the NHS so it will be given to all children and save as many lives as possible.",
