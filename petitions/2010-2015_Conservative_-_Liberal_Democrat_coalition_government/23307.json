        "additional_details": "Domestic cats have a large impact on the community and natural environment, causing nuisance and damage to property, spreading disease through fouling, and killing local wildlife.  Legislation should require:\r\n\r\n    Compulsory identification through microchipping;\r\n\r\n    Compulsory registration; and\r\n\r\n    Compulsory sterilisation.\r\n\r\nWhile legislation will not resolve all problems associated with cats, it will provide the mechanism to:\r\n\r\n    Encourage responsible cat ownership;\r\n\r\n    Reduce the number of unwanted cats being bred;\r\n\r\n    Allow for cats found in a public place or on private property to be seized; and\r\n\r\n    Allow for reuniting of lost cats with their owners.\r\n\r\nSuch legislation was successfully passed into law in Western Australia on 09 November 2011.\r\n\r\n",
