        "additional_details": "We want this petition to be signed by as many people as possible to show that the general public strongly DISAGREE with the sentence that has been handed to Kane Robinson. Our aim is for Kane's sentence to be not only reduced but suspended.\r\nIt\u2019s time the law stepped up and started protecting our loved ones from the REAL criminals who endanger our loved ones every day, Instead of prosecuting the people who not only contribute to our community but are no threat to our society.\r\nPlease sign our petition if we reach our goal of 100,000 signatures this will be taken to the House of Commons, which will hopefully provide justice for Kane Robinson.
