There is one e-petition about the death penalty, but it is not based on a refurendum like mine, also they only talk about the death penalty being only given to rapists which is contrary to mine also.  Please look again.\r\nI strongly believe that we should re-introduce the death penalty for killers/Terrorists/paedophiles/Rapists, people who are committing the worst kind of crimes. It should be a refurendum for the British people to decide what they want.   It is costing the taxpayer vast sums of money to keep these non human beings alive in prison, only to re-offend again when they return to normal society. It also costs the taxpayer vast sums of money protecting these individuals identity and also by trying to house them again and have them under monitoring. We do not want these people in the places that we live, places we call our homes and raise our children!",
