For example, petitions that call for abolition of or amendments to a form of taxation that was abolished over 70 years ago, could be automatically rejected and save a considerable amount of time.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any petition that describes Vehicle Excise Duty as \"Road Tax\", should be rejected automatically.",
