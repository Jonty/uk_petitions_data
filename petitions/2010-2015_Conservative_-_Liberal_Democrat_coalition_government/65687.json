        "additional_details": "The significant contribution made by the largest voluntary army in history, that was the Indian army serving the British in WWII, needs to be properly commemorated, since so many died for the freedom we all now enjoy. In 1939 at the start of WWII, the voluntary army numbered just under 200,000 men, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945. This contribution by this voluntary army has never been properly acknowledged by Britain.\r\nThe commemoration can be in the form of a plaque or statue in Trafalgar Square and welcoming ranks of the current Indian Army and other dignitaries at the unveiling ceremony. This will help to strengthen the existing friendship between India and the UK. It will also provide the opportunity for the people of Britain to say a thank-you to India for their contribution in the fight for our freedom we all cherish.  ",
