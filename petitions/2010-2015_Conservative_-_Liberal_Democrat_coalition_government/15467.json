        "additional_details": "Many recent pop, hip-hop and RnB songs have made use of a technology called autotune, which is frequently adopted to mask a dearth of basic singing skill, let alone talent. This petition aims to see autotune banned.\r\n\r\nPenalties would need to be levied for this newly defined crime. The author suggests perhaps confiscating all the music equipment and profits of autotune offenders and redistributing these resources to struggling vocal artists with talent.",
