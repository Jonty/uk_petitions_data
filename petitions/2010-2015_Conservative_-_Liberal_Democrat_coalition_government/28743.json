        "additional_details": "Sir Roy McNulty who produced the Rail Value for Money study concluded that the \u00a34bn per year cost of the UK rail system includes roughly 30% of waste, almost entirely due to Network Rail.\r\n\r\nIt is not reasonable that the passengers or the tax payer should be expected to pay for this. As such, all rail fares including peak, off-peak singles, returns and season tickets should all have 30% reduced immediately. Network Rail should be obliged to pay for this.\r\n\r\nThe aim is to restore value for money to the people who use the railways.",
