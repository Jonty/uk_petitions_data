        "additional_details": "It has come to light that member of the Digital Spy Forums that goes by the name crazychris12 had a bit of a barny with his Wife and Daughter.  Long story short, the police were called, posted the inane story on the forums, got drunk and mysteriously de-registered himself from the forum.  This morning he sobered up, realised what he'd done and claimed he'd had his account hacked.\r\n\r\nNow, I implore the Minister to get involved in this case and put it to the owners of the Digital Spy Forums that this guy, crazychris12, is spewing his lies all over other forums and really winding up the membership.",
