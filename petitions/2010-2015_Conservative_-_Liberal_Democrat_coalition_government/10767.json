        "additional_details": "In light of recent events (rioting/looting) there is obviously a lack of respect for our country, government, police and citizens. Mostly the complaints from the rioters is there is nothing for them, the government does nothing. Bring back national service and give these youngsters a chance to gain respect for their country and citizens. They would learn skills which could aid them in their future. The government would no longer be giving away benefit money to create singers and would actually be paying the youngsters for their service. A simple win win situation.",
