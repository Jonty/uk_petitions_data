        "additional_details": "We would like the government to implement pilot programmes for bike racks on public buses. This would be a very low cost initiative with huge benefit for cyclists, tourists, and for the public bus companies.\r\n\r\nIt means cyclists can use buses on very steep routes, for routes too long to cycle entirely, in bad weather and on dark evenings.\r\n\r\nOther cities and countries around the world have implemented bike rack programmes with great success.\r\n\r\n",
