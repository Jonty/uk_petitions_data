        "additional_details": "This petition calls for the creation of a network of segregated cycle tracks along busy roads. The cost of fuel is rising. Traffic jams are increasing. Many car journeys are less than a couple of miles, easy to accomplish by bike. Many of us have bikes we rarely use, because we feel unsafe on the roads. London's Cycle Superhighways are a tiny step in the right direction, but unless such routes are segregated from motor traffic, only a hard-core of lycra-clad adrenaline-junkies will use them. We need an environment in which all ages feel safe to cycle. This petition calls on the Government to require councils to reallocate road space away from parked cars and the multiple lanes that turn our roads into urban motorways, decreasing our quality of life. It calls for a plan to create wide, fast, continuous cycle tracks with priority signals, of the type used in countries such as The Netherlands.",
