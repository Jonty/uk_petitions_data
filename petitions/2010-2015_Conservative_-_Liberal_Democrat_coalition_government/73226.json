This pram race will bring smiles to families and business owners along the route as it will bring people out on new years day to spend some cash into our local shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants. The garage is hardly open and  i find it hard to believe they will make \u00a34500 in 2 hrs when they dont even have petrol half the time.\r\nWE WANT THE PRAM RACE.",
