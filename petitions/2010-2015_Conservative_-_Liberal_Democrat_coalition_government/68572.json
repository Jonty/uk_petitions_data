        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, request HM Sec. of State for Foreign & Commonwealth Affairs to intervene for 16 year old Atefah Rajabi, Sahaaleh, condemned to death as the VICTIM of  rape for ' breach of chastity',  in violation of her human rights under the Int. Crim. Court's declaration on women's rights, by a judge sitting in an Iranian court. This judicial decision is immoral as well as being a  breach of the ICC Declaration, to which the Iranian government are signatories to, as well as a breach of Articles 37 & 167 of the Iranian Constitution.\r\n\r\nMiss Sahaaleh has already suffered unduly at the hands of her abuser, and we, the undersigned, urgently request the Secretary of State to personally start negotiations with his Iranian counterpart, to secure an overturning of the globally and nationally illegal judgement.",
