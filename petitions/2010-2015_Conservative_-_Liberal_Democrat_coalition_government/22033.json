        "additional_details": "Over recent year, MP credibility with the public has declined in dramatic fashion. To once again realign the MP and public relationship, all MP must become more accountable for their depts and actions. I suggest that all  MP's, party leaders and future PM's should be accountable if they break any manifesto pledge on the process to election. Any break in a manifesto should be subject to a criminal prosecution for failing to deliver manifesto promises. It's time to make MP work for us again rather than working on lining their pockets. ",
