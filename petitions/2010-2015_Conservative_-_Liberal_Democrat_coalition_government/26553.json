        "additional_details": "We the undersigned are angry and saddened at the plight of exservice personnel shamelessly abandoned, living in poverty on the streets of a country they served to defend. Up to 4500 exservice personnel are homeless as 80,000 MOD properties lie empty that could be used to provide shelter. This is a disgrace. We want our homeless heroes off our streets with a roof over their heads and an opportunity to regain their self confidence and self worth. We want to see disused barracks opened up as a short term solution to the housing problems. These men and women should be afforded the opportunity to work on run down barracks providing shelter for them as a means of giving them some self worth, dignity and a reason to wake up each morning. We want improved aftercare for PTSD sufferers which many of our homeless heroes suffer from. We the British public are very proud of our armed forces, this is our way to show that we will not let them be forgotten or abandoned. ",
