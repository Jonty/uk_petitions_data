Why can the Football Association criminalise him, ban him from his workplace, fine him \u00a350,000 and make a mandatory order for a 78 year old to attend educational classes when he has not committed a criminal offence prosecutable under the laws of the UK.. That is wrong and the state should intervene and rule against such dictatorial bodies in this case",
