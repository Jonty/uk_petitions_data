Even with help, I struggle to quit because cigarettes are easily available.\r\n\r\nIn ICeland smoking is now by prescription, which ensures that those who need to smoke and like it can continue to do so, but people like myself who would quit if it was not available could do so.\r\n\r\nPlease, let's eradicate this in England and the UK.\r\n\r\nBan smoking today.\r\n\r\nWill Wisbey ",
