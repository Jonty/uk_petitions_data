        "additional_details": "Residents in Fryston Village will not only lose their views of the fields, woods & river but there is only one way in and out of the village over a a railway bridge which is already ridiculous. The traffic will be heavier, especially during building, the village will be busier and the surroundings will go into an even more dire state of disrepair as the Council and the Land Trust already struggle to maintain it. The Council need to concentrate on rectifying existing problems rather than creating more and losing the faith of the whole community in doing so. The majority of the village land was handed over to the Land Trust to be \"maintained for perpetuity\" and yet the council want to build 150+ new houses right next to the Nature Reserve",
