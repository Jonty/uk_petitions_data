        "additional_details": "Cease all dividends paid by energy companies until they have sorted out their infrastructure and can provide energy to the british public at reasonable prices. The Banks shareholders have not been paid dividends for the last 5 years and will not receive any until their capital base is at a safe level. Therefore I believe the Energy Companies should do the same.",
