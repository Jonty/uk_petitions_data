        "additional_details": "As lovely as Trooping the Colour was, it did make me think why in 2013 are we making personnel redundant yet we still find the millions of pounds to buy & maintain the fancy uniforms that will never be used in action. It is a fanciful dress that was once affordable but now is simply an inefficient use of scarce MOD resources.\r\n\r\nWhy are we still using horses ? These are very expensive indeed and are not used in action.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have to consider, why are 4500 soldiers being put out onto the street yet we are willing to pay for, feed, train and look after hundreds of these horses. I'd rather see a soldier and his/her family supported by the UK Government than a fancy horse that has no useful purpose.\r\n\r\nThe police have dropped their dress Tunics, now is the time for the MOD.  It's simply not acceptable in 2013 when hard working soldiers are losing their jobs.",
