Plus a year long ban of driving and a fine.\r\n\r\nIn the end a killing is killing and GBH/ABH is GBH/ABH. I think it should be treated the same, unless it is cause via self defence of course.\r\n\r\nAnd I don't think defensive driving is ever that extreme.\r\n\r\nHurting/killing someone by car/bike is still hurting/killing it is just using the vehicle as the weapon of choice.
