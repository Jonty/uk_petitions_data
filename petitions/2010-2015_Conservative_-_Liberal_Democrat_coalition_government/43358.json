This Great Briton of our modern age has made a tremendous contribution to the public's enthusiasm for and study of Astronomy.  He has inspired a huge number of astronomers past and present.  He has presented the longest running continuous television show in the world.  It is only right that his unique contribution be honoured and the most suitable place for his cultural and scientific legacy is St Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey",
