He is a member of the United Kingdom Independence Party.\r\n\r\nHis comments regarding rape are abhorrent and he should resign from his post as MEP and withdraw himself from the by-election.\r\n\r\nHe wrote \"But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says \u201cStop!\u201d. The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on.....I think that most right-thinking people would expect a much lighter sentence in [this] case\"\r\n\r\nHe also declared that  \"the victim [of rape] surely shares a part of the responsibility\".\r\n\r\nHe has also shared homophobic views, likening homophobia to a dislike of Earl Grey tea.
