        "additional_details": "UKBA could you please speed up the processing times for Tier 1 Entrepreneur Visa. It is important as we are awaiting the visas to commence businesses. There are applicants awaiting the decision for more then 6 months. I am personally awaiting the decision since almost 4 months now. Due to the delay in the processing times, the investment money is being stagnated and resulting in losses which eventually is affecting the economy. Besides the delay in processing times is not allowing the applicants to leave the country for other professional and personal commitments. Having investments stagnated for 50K and 200K for different applicants is  definitely as drawback and I certainly do not appreciate this. Please can UKBA speed up the processing times leading to earlier decisions allowing the applicants to decide to shape their futures as future entrepreneur  helping strengthen the economy. Thanking you. ",
