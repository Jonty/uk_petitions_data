        "additional_details": "People who are caring for 24/7 for elderly relatives should not have their benefits stopped nor should they be made to look for work.  Let's face it, if there were jobs available, who would take someone on who looks after someone all day every day?  At the end of the day, a carer could have to take the person they a looking after for hospital or doctors appointment at the drop of a hat.  Also,the person being looked after could be admitted to hospital as an emergency any time of the day or night.  The DWP should be more compassionate in instances like this.",
