        "additional_details": "In the event of Yes vote for Scottish independence I propose the  the remainder of the United Kingdom immediately be given a referendum with the following question. \"Do you want a currency union with  Scotland\"? This is a different question to Scotland using the pound for which they wouldn't need any permission. They could use the Ruble if they wanted. But currency union means that \"our\" Central bank would have to consider the economy of a foreign country when making monetary policy such as Interest Rates.\r\n\r\nBEFORE the Scottish vote takes place the UK government must offer a guarantee that such a referendum be offered to the people of England, Wales and NI so that Scottish voters know that the remainder of the UK will have an opportunity to state their preference.",
