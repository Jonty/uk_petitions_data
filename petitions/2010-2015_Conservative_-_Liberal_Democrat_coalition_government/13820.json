If  the Government Department is satisfied that the second home is necessary, a license would be granted to allow the transaction to proceed. A fee should be charged for this license. Currently, too many second homes stand empty for much of the year; we need to free up our housing stock for people who need real homes, burst the house price bubble, and bring the life back to affected communities.",
