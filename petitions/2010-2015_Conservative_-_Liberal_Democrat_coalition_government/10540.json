        "additional_details": "We, the undersigned, believe:\r\n1. That the East Lothian Question applies vice-versa as well, with English MP's voting on matters which do not concern them.\r\n2. That full devolution should be given to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland so that they can make their own law, particularly in Scotland with Defence Cuts and Scottish bases being closed over English ones. This will also be beneficial as an answer to the Scottish Independence Referendum set to take place in 2014.\r\n3. That, with no English Devolved Authority, English MP's are seen to represent the whole of the UK and therefore make decisions on law for the whole of the UK. This is wrong.\r\n4. That the UK Government should consider A) Devolution Max for Devolved Parliaments and Assemblies. B) Scottish MSP's and MP's decide on Scottish Issues, English MP's decide on English Issues, etc. C) That England should have it's own Devolved Parliament/Assembly or Regional Assemblies to end the stigma of \"The English MP's control the UK.\"\r\n",
