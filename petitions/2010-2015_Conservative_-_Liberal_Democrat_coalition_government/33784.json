        "additional_details": "The need for a \"safe haven law\" in the uk is on the increase as more and more newborns are being found dead and disguarded. The safe haven law is in effect in the usa and in general Safe Haven Laws allow a parent to anonymously leave an unwanted newborn baby in a safe place, such as a hospital, emergency medical services, police station, or fire station, and not have to worry about getting in trouble. The baby will then be given to social services to be cared for and adopted.\r\n\r\n",
