        "additional_details": "This petition demands that the government make the minimum wage equal for workers of all ages. Why should someones age determine how much they are paid when quite clearly they can be working harder than someone who earns \u00a36.08 yet the harder working employee is only paid \u00a33.68. Stop the age discrimination of companies employing more 16-17 year olds and give younger people a fairer chance in life.",
