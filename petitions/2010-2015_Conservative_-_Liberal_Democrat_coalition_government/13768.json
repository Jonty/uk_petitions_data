Where\u2019s the incentive to work?? I would like to see anyone who is on benefits or working and earning below \u00a31000 per month have their rent and tax paid by housing benefit in full, anyone over this threshold will have to pay full rent and tax a fairer system helping all and giving low paid workers an incentive to work.\r\n",
