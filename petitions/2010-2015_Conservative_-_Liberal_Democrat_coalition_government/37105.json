        "additional_details": "The Government should a) speed up JSA claims to reinstate JSA within 2 days and b) allow JSA to be claimed in anticipation of temporary work being paid. Currently Jobcentres operate a system whereby reinstating a JSA claim requires a) an initial interview, which can take up to a week to be allocated, b) a \"signing on\" date which can take a further week, c) the posting out or transferral of JSA some days after that.  This causes hardship especially for those low-paid workers who gain e.g. labouring work through agencies, which can lay people off at less than 24 hours' notice, and may themselves take 2 weeks to pay.  The slow and inflexible JSA system both causes  hardship and is a deterrent to taking up work that may end abruptly, leaving workers and families with no income.    ",
