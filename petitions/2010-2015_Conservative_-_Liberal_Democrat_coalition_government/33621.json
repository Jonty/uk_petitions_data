        "additional_details": "The Water Companies have had 23 years since privatisation to put their house in order and deliver clean and plentiful drinking water and to cease discharging untreated sewage to our rivers and sea\u2019s.\r\n\r\nThey have failed in both respects despite the consumer contributing over \u00a3100 Billion through punishing increases in their water bills.\r\n\r\nWater Companies also waste over 726 million gallons of water every day of the year & many beaches are still affected by untreated sewage. They are mainly interested in maximising their profits for the benefit of mainly foreign shareholders and large salaries and bonuses for Directors and Managers.\r\n\r\nTherefore in the interest of our strategic water supply and health & safety the Water Industry needs to be re nationalised as a matter of urgency.\r\n",
