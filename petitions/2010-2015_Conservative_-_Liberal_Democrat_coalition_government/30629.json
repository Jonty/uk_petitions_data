        "additional_details": "If the education of our children is so important, why must they lose a day of teaching so the school can be used as a polling station? This seems illogical when there are libraries, community centres, sports clubs/leisure centres in every community that have the space and facilities to provide suitable alternative accommodation. Provision of inset days to update/provide necessary training for our teachers makes sense, closure for voting, when other venues could be used, does not.",
