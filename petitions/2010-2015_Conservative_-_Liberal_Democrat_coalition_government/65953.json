        "additional_details": "With our roads becoming ever busier the current classification of driving offences and associated maximum sentences which can be imposed are in many cases ambiguous or ridiculously lenient.\r\nI propose immediate bans for offences highlighted in the Highway Code, which, should a person act in that same manner when taking their driving test would result in the driver failing the test and being refused a licence.\r\nFor example:\r\nDriving whilst using a mobile phone.\r\nDriving whilst under the influence of drink/drugs.\r\nDriving in a manner which endangers other  road users/pedestrians.\r\nI also propose a revision of classification of dangerous/careless driving and introduction of newer more relevant offences such as assault with a motor vehicle and failure to ensure safety of vulnerable parties i.e pedestrians/cyclists.\r\nI propose all offences revised/introduced via this review carry instant roadside bans ranging from one month to judicial sentenced lifetime ban dependent on offence.
