        "additional_details": "The Government plans to introduce a test by which drugs will be approved for use in the NHS and will receive funding from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The test is whether the proposed drugs will have a 'wider societal benefit'. This is in addition to tests on cost effectiveness and how much a drug will benefit a patient's quality of life. This is new policy is a clear node to only approving drugs for diseases where the patient has many working years ahead of them; therefore being a  'benefit' to society. This policy undermines the principle that all people regardless of age are equally valuable in society. This policy is in consultation now and the majority of the public don't know about this. The NHS don't want this, NICE don't want this and neither do the members of the British public that are informed on this issue. Please sign up and show the government we want this consultation and this policy stopped immediately. ",
