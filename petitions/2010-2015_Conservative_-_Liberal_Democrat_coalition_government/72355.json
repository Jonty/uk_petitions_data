        "additional_details": "This is a petition that aims to demonstrate in an official capacity the ever decreasing popularity of the incumbent Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Cameron.\r\n\r\nThe list of both deliberate and accidental political ventures that David Cameron has authorised and overseen that are to the very core detrimental to the hopes and aspirations of the British population is vast. Never before has 'democracy' allowed so many British people to suffer at the hands of so few. We have had enough.\r\n\r\nWhilst this petition, whether successful or not, will do little to actually change the ideology held by the political establishment, it could at the very least generate enough interest and enthusiasm prior to the 2015 general election to change how the UK engages with the currently crooked and corrupt democratic process that governs this better deserving nation.\r\n\r\nThanks for your participation.",
