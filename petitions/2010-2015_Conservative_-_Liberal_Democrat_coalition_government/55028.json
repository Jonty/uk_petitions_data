        "additional_details": "By looking at many countries such as France or Belgium,we are able to see how many intelligent,helpful Muslims choose to move away due to their commitment to their religion.\r\nThe call for banning the Burqa and other religious symbols is against many various articles of the Human Rights Act.\r\nArticle five states that everyone has the right to 'liberty and security', banning the Burqa would cause this article to be broken.\r\nArticle eight mentions that we,as humans,have the right to private life and family life. If we all have the right to a private life than we should be able to wear religious symbols.\r\n\r\nThe most significant article which would be broken would be article eight,where it is mentioned that we all have the right to thought,conscience and religion.\r\nArticle ten would also go against the ban as the article mentions that everyone has the right to expression.\r\n\r\nBy supporting each other,we should gain as many signatures as we can in order to prevent the law coming into reality.",
