        "additional_details": "Following several deaths on this road over the years and 2 major incidents in the last few months I believe it is time to sort this road out! This is a 40mph road that many people treat as a dual carriageway often reaching speeds of 60mph. There needs to be clear road markings and in my opinion either a cycle lane needs to be put in to narrow the area which cars, trucks ect... Use or the road should be narrowed to stop these idiots creating their own lane in the middle of the road. STOP THESE DEATHS AND SORT THE ROAD OUT!!",
