Local communities should be allowed to support or reject the application as a majority vote, and all approved applications should have a planning gain for all the local community.\r\nFuture applications should only be considered by referring to the recent 'Revised National Planning Policy Framework'.\r\nThe new charters guiding principles of 'living within the planet's means; ensuring a strong, healthy and just society; achieving a sustainable economy; promoting good governance; and using sound science responsibly' must benefit everyone.\r\nBe so very careful, otherwise, 'Never in England's green and pleasant land, will so much be surrendered by so many, to benefit so few'.
