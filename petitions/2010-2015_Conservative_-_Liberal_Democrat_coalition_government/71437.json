        "additional_details": "This petition aims to prohibit the use of the Triple Test (Trisomy Screenings) in order to protect society's most vulnerable. Such screenings have a eugenic effect that causes 90% of Down's Syndrome babies to be aborted before birth. With the prohibition of the Triple Test, babies will no longer be subject to discrimination due to physical and mental impairments that is beyond human control before they are even born. We urge the Department of Health to strongly consider banning such immoral and prejudicial screenings in a bid for equally between all babies, regardless of their conditions or abilities.",
