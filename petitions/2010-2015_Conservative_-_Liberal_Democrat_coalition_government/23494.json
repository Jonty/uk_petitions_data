        "additional_details": "As the Government is the owner of Network Rail, I would like the government to instruct Network rail to rename St Pancras station.\r\n\r\nSince there is a long European tradition of naming international railway terminuses after military victories. For example, Gare d'Austerlitz in Paris, and Waterloo in London. In addition St Pancras is only a minor saint. Since Waterloo is no longer an international terminus it would be appropriate to rename St Pancreas station Agincourt station to maintain this European tradition.\r\n\r\n",
