Without medication they will die.\r\n    What is the point of performing life saving surgery if people can then not afford to buy the prescribed medication?\r\n    Other conditions receive free prescriptions as they are deemed life threatening. Without medication an organ transplant recipient will reject their new organ and ultimately die ! ",
