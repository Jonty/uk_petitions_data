You don't have any change and the local shops will only give change after a purchase. You then have to  pay using \u00a32.00.\r\n\r\nHowever you are only allowed to park for two hours and a ticket would be issued not taking into account the fact that you paid 20 pence more for your parking.\r\n\r\nI petition the government to make all car park owners provide machine that give change in order to make the system fair.\r\n\r\n After all you wouldn't pay more for a product than you actually have to.\r\n\r\n",
