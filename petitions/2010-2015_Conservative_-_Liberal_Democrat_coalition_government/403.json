        "additional_details": "This petition is to keep Formula One (F1) free to air in the UK. Recently BSkyB have signed a deal with the BBC to show all races, qualifying sessions and practice sessions. This seems to be unfair on viewers who enjoy Motorsport but do not want to pay a minimum \u00a3487 for the first year.\r\nAs this is the UK's most popular Motorsport we feel that it is unfair that other sports such as Rugby League have Group A status but F1 or any other Motorsport does not. F1 has a rich heritage in the UK as the very first race was at Silverstone in 1950.\r\nFurthermore, F1 is the only mainstream sport other than Test Cricket where British sportsmen (Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton) are successfully competing to be champions of the world. Surely for this to still be the case in twenty years time F1 should be free to air in the UK for the sake of Motorsport, the motor industry and British sporting pride.",
