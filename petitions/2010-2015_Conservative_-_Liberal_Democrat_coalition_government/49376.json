        "additional_details": "From  April 2013 the government has scrapped Council Tax Benefit for people on low incomes and local councils have had to run their own schemes with a 10% budget cut.\r\n\r\nIn most parts of England, people of working age, both in or out of work, who are already struggling to pay for rising food, fuel and water rates bills, now have to pay towards council tax bills no matter how low their income is. ( for instance Jobseekers Allowance for a single person is \u00a371.70 per week or \u00a356.80 for under 25's )\r\nThis is hitting those who can least afford it, at the same time as millionaires receive a handsome tax cut . (People with an income of \u00a31 million a year are now on average over \u00a350,000 a year better off as the top rate of tax has been reduced)\r\nThe government should restore the full subsidy for help with council tax bills.",
