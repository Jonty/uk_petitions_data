This for men can ruin peoples live's and the facts are even though people say its the best interest of the child, the fact of the matter is they don't know what is going on untill around the age of 3/4 years of age. There are some mother's out there who only have to mention a (NAME) of a male for the CSA to track that person down and make there live hell. I would like this to change for women to have a case upon reasonable doubt brought before the courts before a judge decides weather or not it is viable for the child to know or no know whom the father is in light of factual evidence.
