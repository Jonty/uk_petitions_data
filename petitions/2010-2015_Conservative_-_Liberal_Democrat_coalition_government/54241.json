It encourages body shaming and throws  numbers of body statistics, calories and waistlines at the viewer. It does not promote a healthy approach to food or life. One of the key issues of this programme is also the reputation it has to be known as a trigger for eating disorder sufferers. It needs to be stopped.  ",
