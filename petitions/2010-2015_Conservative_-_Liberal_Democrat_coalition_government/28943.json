        "additional_details": "*Sir* Philip Hampton is the head of the board of RBS, and the man who generously offered Stephen Hester a bonus of \u00a31million just for doing his job. Hampton has admitted that bankers pay is already too high and needs to be lowered, yet still offered above the odds pay and bonus.\r\n\r\nRBS is mostly owned by the British taxpayer, you and me, so Hampton offered our money to a man who was already overpaid by his own admission.\r\n\r\nHampton was given his Knighthood in 2007 delivering public services. The fact he thinks that it is acceptable to deliver public services in a way that spends our money on pay and bonus he admitted knowing was unwarranted means he has shown that he has not earned that Knighthood.  His actions would cost the public purse money, and rob public services of much needed resources to line the pockets of the already super-rich.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned request and demand that it be rescinded as he is acting in a way contrary to its issuing.",
