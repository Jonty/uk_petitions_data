        "additional_details": "Most people do like to return to a local pub culture and away from the thousands of bars that only serve to get people as drunk as possible.

After all, it's necessary to manage this problem that we are having in this country. With threatening refugee crisis, it's becoming more and more dangerous to stand by all soft laws should we protect our citizens. Do it now",
