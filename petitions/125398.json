        "action": "Make it law that all vehicles have to be fitted with a lifehammer.",
        "additional_details": "Many vehicles already have life hammers fitted Including Buses and plant machinery. But cars do not. Lifehammers or emergency hammers could save lives. Car window glass is almost impossible to break with just human force alone, especially when you only have a limited time to do it. So please help to make having a lifehammer or emergency hammer in your vehicle a law. It really could save lives. ",
        "background": "After hearing the awful tragedy of the family who lost their lives as their car went off the pier in Buncrana, it stresses the importance a lifehammer or emergency hammer could have on saving lives. They cost barely anything. They break the glass windows in emergencies allowing people to escape.",
