        "additional_details": "Drug testing has been used in Europe and at UK festivals with Police and PHA support. There needs to be a debate on how this can be implemented across the night time industry so that it's customers can be as informed as they are with alcohol choices. The tragedy of these deaths is conversely having an impact on that economy. There were a further 14000 hospital admissions which is additional burden on the NHS. Statistics: http://digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB21159/drug-misu-eng-2016-rep.pdf",
        "background": "Despite current laws, 1 in 5 young adults used illicit drugs last year, of unknown purity and strength and have been attributed to the deaths of 50 people in 2014, a trend which is increasing. By allowing safe drug tests in venues, users will be aware of the composition and lives could be saved.",
