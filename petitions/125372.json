        "action": "Make it mandatory for smart meters to work regardless of supplier",
        "additional_details": "All accounting systems are now universal and I feel the Select Committee should question British Gas. Why do they insist on customers bringing their electric supply and not install a smart meter for gas supply only for which they are supplier to the property? It is a very serious issue and I humbly request the Chairman of the Select Committee to question British Gas. I do want a Smart Meter installed without any conditions attached. There is clear indication of the MONOPOLY for energy supply.",
        "background": "I phoned B Gas and requested to change our gas meter to a smart meter. They stated that unless I bring my electricity to them they can't provide a smart meter. They further stated that if I change the supplier at any time the smart meter will not function due to their accounting system.",
