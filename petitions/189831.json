        "additional_details": "The African elephant is killed at a rate of one every 15 minutes purely for its tusks. Not only is there the individual's death but infant elephants are often orphaned as a result of poaching. They also die as a result unless rescued.\r\n\r\nThe existence of legal domestic ivory markets leads to an increase in poaching because the tusks of freshly killed elephants are being falsely antiqued. \r\n\r\nThere are now just approximately 400,000 African elephants left in the wild. \r\n\r\nDon't let them disappear!",
        "background": "Environment Secretary Andrea Leadsom is to break a 2015 Tory promise for an outright ban on ivory.\r\n\r\nLeadsom proposes that all ivory carved before 1947 should remain on sale. This will fuel the illegal poaching of endangered African elephants by new ivory infiltrating the market.",
