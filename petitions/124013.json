        "additional_details": "I think the British public have a right to borrow/have mortgage from government. The Bank of England should have a branch in every high street. \r\nA national bank created just for small buissness/mortgage borrowing and basic current accounts.\r\nPrivate banks profit billions pay their Chiefs millions and get bailed out by the public when they get it all wrong.\r\nA nationally owned bank I think would help keep private banks in order.\r\n",
        "background": "I think the public should have an option to borrow/have mortgage from a private bank or to borrow from a national bank run and owned by government.         \r\nI'd rather borrow from my own country's national bank and pay back with interest, instead of borrowing from foreign owned private banks.\r\n",
