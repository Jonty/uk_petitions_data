In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore clear to us how you would like the law to be changed. You could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the law.\r\n\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/"
