        "action": "Hold a referendum on the deal that is negotiated to leave the EU",
        "additional_details": "Since the Leave vote succeeded, there has been great uncertainty as to what will actually be delivered. Many people voted to stop or reduce immigration from the EU, yet many of the models put forward for our departure involve access to the EU's single market and a commitment to the free movement of EU peoples. The people of Britain should be allowed their say on what we are able to negotiate.",
        "background": "The discussion of the result of a vote for Leave in the EU referendum was hampered by a lack of knowledge of what would and could be negotiated once the country left. Now as we move towards Brexit, the deal we negotiate should be voted on by the British public for their agreement prior to departure",
