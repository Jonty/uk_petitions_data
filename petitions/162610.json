        "action": "Change burden of proof of dangerous dog to be responsibility of the accuser.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, a dog is determined to be dangerous by the authorities based on the dog's appearance, rather than by hard evidence or by what the dog has done. It is currently the responsibility of the owner of the dog to prove the claim that the dog is dangerous to be false. If the owner cannot prove this negative, the dog is then euthanised. \r\n\r\n\"Whether your dog is a banned type depends on what it looks like, rather than its breed or name.\" Source: https://www.gov.uk/control-dog-public/banned-dogs",
        "background": "Many innocent dogs have been seized from their owners and euthanised, and it is the responsibility of the respective owners to prove that their dog is not a banned type. This is a perversion of the burden of proof and needs to be changed so that the authorities must prove that the dog is banned.",
