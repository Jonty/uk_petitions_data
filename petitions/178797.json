        "additional_details": "In the last forty years, foreigners from these countries have committed no terrorist killings in the USA. \r\n\r\nThe Syria tragedy is of a scale not seen since the second world war - with 4 out of 10 Syrians displaced from their homes -some 11 million and over 400,000 dead. Seventy-five percent of the dead of this number are not committed by ISIL but President Asad, who is backing by President Putin.  That this genocide has not been higher has been because of number to escape, that President Trump seems to be closing the door of these people is unhuman, and we must let him know this.",
        "background": "President Trump's Executive Orders banning Syria Refugees and visitors from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen is contrary to the actions of a country we consider an ally, and we the UK Government condemn strongly and without reserve. ",
