        "action": "Form a British Expat Committee to defend Expats rights in pre-Brexit negotiation",
        "additional_details": "Of critical importance is that Government decisions concerning Expats be negotiated with Brussels after having consulted with the committee.  Currently the anxieties and opinions of ordinary Expats are not being sought on issues directly affecting them and their futures.  Government decision-makers will not be affected by outcomes which have an impact on Expats\u2019 rights, healthcare and the benefits they enjoy.  The futures of Expats must not be regarded as bargaining chips.",
        "background": "This Committee is to consist of representatives from Spain, Ireland, Germany, France and Italy to cover the diverse social demographics of the 5 main countries.  It will contend issues raised during the Brexit debate prior to negotiations which adversely affect the rights and welfare of Expats. ",
