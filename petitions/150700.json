        "additional_details": "1) \u00a3350 Million is the gross figure and not the actual amount we send to the EU.  It does not include the rebates we get back.  It will not be used on the NHS as already indicated by various members of Brexit. \r\n2) Immigration - Dan Hannan said that there isn't going to be a fall in immigration despite Brexits claim there would be.\r\n3) No saving on energy bills.  Inflation and the price of oil set to rise in the aftermath of the Brexit decision triggering a rise in energy bills. \r\nThe list goes on. ",
        "background": "The top leaders of the Brexit campaign knowingly lied and used mis-information during the EU Referendum.    In particular claims regarding the amount of money sent to the EU and what the money would be used for on exit.  They should make a public apology to the British people for their behaviour. ",
