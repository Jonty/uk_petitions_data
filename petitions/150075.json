        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign claimed that \u00a3350M per week would be released to be spent on the NHS.  This claim was stated to be false by \"Leave\" within days of the vote.\r\n\r\nIndividuals who make false statements to the state (for example in relation to benefits) risk being prosecuted, whilst politicians are not censured for false statements to the people.  We believe that a separate offence of knowingly or recklessly making false statements or misleading the public in relation to elections is required.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum on the continuing membership of the EU has highlighted the use of clear untruths and other misleading comments.  Voters have suggested they would have voted differently if they had known the truth.  There should be criminal liability for such activity to prevent it reoccurring.",
