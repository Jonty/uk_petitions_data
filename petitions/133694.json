        "additional_details": "My Gran was a refugee from WW1 and her twin sister was a refugee from both WW1&2. They had to flee wars they didn't ask for, wars caused and fuelled by nationalism and xenophobia. The EU was the result of the hard work in the shadow of so much death, work to try and build a better future, a future where once warring nations would come together in a spirit of cooperation and friendship. London voted to Remain in the EU, we should be allowed to do so.",
        "background": "Given that London voted to Remain in the EU it is unfair that our economy is hamstrung by other regions of the U.K. voting to Leave. Give Londoners what they voted for!",
