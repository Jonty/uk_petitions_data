        "action": "Royal Navy ships must return rescued migrants and not bring them into Europe.",
        "additional_details": "People-traffickers are effectively being aided by our Navy, as they merely take the migrants part way in unsuitable craft and leave it to us to complete the journey for them.  This encourages further attempts, putting people's lives at risk, as well as adding to the crisis in such places as Greece and Italy - which then is passed on to us.  While it is humane to rescue, we must send the migrants back, not help them on their way.",
        "background": "Europe is currently suffering from a migration crisis.  This includes migrants attempting to reach Europe in inadequate and overloaded boats.  The Navy has been sent to help with the rescue of those who get into difficulties, but the policy is to bring them into countries already overwhelmed.",
