        "additional_details": "The government has just held a public consultation on their mandate for the NHS: https://goo.gl/XiST49\r\nIt did not run for long and it was not well advertised, even so it seems the system was overloaded: many people reported their submissions bounced.\r\n\r\nWe have the technology to engage the public in a proper two way consultation with the NHS: a robust and transparent system of question and answer.\r\nThis will then serve as both a mandate and reporting mechanism to hold the NHS directly accountable .",
        "background": "Parliament has demonstrated that it cannot be trusted with the NHS.\r\nSuccessive governments have subjected it to endless ideological top-down reforms.\r\nWe need to establish a stable, long term plan for the NHS which is accountable directly to the public without the interference of the government.",
