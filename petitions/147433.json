        "action": "Make it compulsory for all eligible voters to vote at the next general election",
        "additional_details": "Media stories post EU referendum have shown that many voters used their vote to protest and had no expectation of Leave winning.  This isn't about politicians not listening, this is about voters not taking responsibility.  Compulsory voting happens in many other countries including Australia.  This petition is for a one-off compulsory vote at the next general election to persuade all voters to know that their vote is taken seriously and that they are prepared for the implications of their vote",
        "background": "This will create the conditions for any new government to have a clear mandate for the direction in which to take the country after the next general election - even if that is to remain in the EU.  Only a general election with all voters casting will be able to outvote the recent referendum. ",
