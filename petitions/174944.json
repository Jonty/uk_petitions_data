        "additional_details": "Since we (the people) did not have a right to vote on this legislation, I feel as if it would only be fair for Politicians, the Devolved Assembly and the European Parliament members to face the same process if they were under any suspicion. Just as always, Politicians don't want to live in the real world and face the same measures as you or I do. I think this is deeply unjust, and they should face the same rules as the common folk, with NO so-called 'protections'.",
        "background": "For most people, a warrant can be issued by a secretary of state or senior ministers. However, warrants to spy on MPs have to be signed off directly by the PM. MPs will not repeal this law, so instead, let's make them face the same sort of scrutiny like people living in the real world do.",
