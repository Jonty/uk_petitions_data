        "additional_details": "The best performing LSCBs are those with strong chairs that provide robust challenge and monitor improvement. The government response to this review is to remove the statutory strength that permits this challenge. This government has a duty to ensure that its duties are wholly taken over by a named role/team within or independent of these agencies and safeguard vulnerable children, a team already existent in current LSCBs that could be strengthened by revised terms of reference.",
        "background": "The Woods LSCB review states that challenge by the LSCB is vital, but the government response to the review gives responsibility to public bodies with no named professional to offer challenge or monitor change. Revised LSCB terms of reference could provide this and safeguard vulnerable children.\r\n",
