        "action": "Make retesting of all road users compulsory every 5 years to ensure road safety.",
        "additional_details": "http://tinyurl.com/nkzmbzh shows the evidence. What is proposed is that road users be charged for the retest. If they pass the test they are refunded the entire test fee as they are competent, if they fail they revert to a provisional licence and have to retrain similar to learners. This makes roads safer (priority), increases employment within the DVSA (better for workforce), provides additional income source which can be put on improving the road network in the UK. Winners all round.",
        "background": "With road deaths increased in 2014 by 4% from 2013 to 1775, serious road injuries increasing by 5% in 2014 from 2013 to 22807 and the total of 194,477 casualties of all severities in reported road traffic accidents during 2014 retesting of road users is essential to protecting the roads.",
