        "additional_details": "Fathers who pay child maintenance for children should be allowed to see that their hard earned money is actually being spent on supporting the child, instead it is seen as a position of power and a way to undermine the father, the idea is to provide mothers with a card that can be monitored to ensure the money is being spent correctly, for example say there's \u00a3300 on the card and only \u00a3100 is spent that month the \u00a3200 left over should be put into a savings account for the child's 18th birthday?",
        "background": "Child Maintenance Visa Cards would ensure that the hard earned cash is being spent on the child and not the mother. Accounts should be reviewed every quarter and receipts should need to be submitted monthly to confirm what had been spent. A app that lets you scan the receipts would keep things easy.",
