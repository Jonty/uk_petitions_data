        "additional_details": "This proposed \u00a3390 charge per annum could prove damaging to the educational prospects of our children who wish to further their studies, either at secondary school or at college. It is unfair that the council proposes students who use council transport and receive EMA, should use their EMA to pay for the proposed charge. Students will be excluded from travel if they cannot pay. The charge will be administered per student. No concession is offered for families with two or more post-16 pupils. ",

Please sign this petition to keep travel free for our sixth form and college students attending full time further education.",
