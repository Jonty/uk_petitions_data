        "action": "Allow PTSD as evidence in chief in legal cases",
        "additional_details": "As an Independent Sexual Violence Advisor I have witnessed first hand the crippling effects trauma has on people who experience chronic PTSD and other trauma related symptoms, as a result of Sexual Violence and Rape. Some people can find it impossible to engage in a criminal investigation and subsequent court case due to severe trauma symptoms. This means that cases don't go ahead, and dangerous criminals who commit these crimes are never bought to justice under our current legal system. This petition calls for a change in the current law and police procedure, so that PTSD and other trauma related symptoms, can be used as evidence in chief in criminal investigations.",
        "background": "Some Survivors of sexual violence and rape who suffer chronic PTSD and other trauma symptoms, can often find it impossible to engage in the criminal justice process. This means that criminal cases aren't instigated and perpetrators are free to continue committing crimes.",
