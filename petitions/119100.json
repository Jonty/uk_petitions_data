        "additional_details": "China is flooding the market with cheap steel. Cut off the demand and you cut off the supply. If the Government can waste \u00a384bn on bankers who still got their bonuses, who still live unaffected lives then they can help these communities who will be decimated. Port Talbot Steel works losing \u00a31million per week and we waste \u00a320 million teaching people to speak English from abroad. Let's prioritise. Three new aircraft carriers being built . Where is the material coming from ? Its not the UK !",
        "background": "Steel companies in other EU countries have been bailed out by their respective governments in order to save the industry , such as Italy. More than two thousand jobs have been lost in the last two years in this sector. Remember the mining industry ? It happened like this. History repeating itself.",
