        "additional_details": "Think of the mortgage interest on just ONE London home. We are paying that for scores of MP's every year. This is WASTED money. If 1 bedroom flats are provided for MP's whilst SERVING parliament, these can be used for the foreseeable future. Over the next 50 years, just imagine how much could be saved! Giving more public money to banks in interest payments is just crass when the poor are being priced out of London.\r\n'We are all in this together' so MP's shouldn't see an issue with this cost cut.",
        "background": "Paying mortgage interest for MP's London homes is obscene. 1 bedroom flats are sufficient for them to carry out their parliamentary duties in London. Providing 1 bedroom public owned flats, will save millions of \u00a3s as each new generation of MP's can occupy them. 'We are all in this together'.",
