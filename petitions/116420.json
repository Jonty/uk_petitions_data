        "additional_details": "Bands such as 'New Years Day', 'Ashestoangels', 'Solice In Nightmares' and 'The Dead XIII' are examples of this genre and should be referenced to build up an idea of the gravity of this situation.",
        "background": "I believe this genre of music is harmful to our youth as it promotes worthlessness, low mood and incorporates subjects such as suicide in to its lyrics. Anything that promotes these things should be spoken about at length by MP's as it is a very distressing and sensitive subject that affects many.",
