        "action": "Hold a referendum to allow the people to ratify the terms negotiated for Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "By passing decision-making responsibility directly to the people of the UK our elected representatives abjectly failed to do the job for which we pay them. It is therefore right and consistent that once the exit terms are known, the people should have the right to ratify or reject the terms on offer by means of a further referendum.",
        "background": "The first referendum was a vote on the principal of leaving the EU as the exact terms for leaving were completely unknown and still are. Once the negotiated terms for exit are known the people should be given the opportunity to confirm or rescind the first referendum result.\r\n\r\n",
