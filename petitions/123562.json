        "additional_details": "The Cotswold Way runs across the road making it a danger to 100's of walkers during the summer months. There have been many accidents here as drivers turning into the petrol station or driveways have had collisions.  HGVs thunder throughout the night at 40 or above disturbing our sleep.  Noise levels are unacceptable.  We are after all a settlement of approximately 20 houses with children and grandchildren.",
        "background": "The speed limit in our village is currently 40mph. This is too high as there are at least 15 houses situated in very close proximity to the road making noise levels far too high day and night. Pedestrians and drivers are at risk as it is dangerous to cross the road by foot and by car. ",
