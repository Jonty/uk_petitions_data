        "additional_details": "Members of the \"Leave\" campaign are conceding that \"facts\" and \"information\" used by their side to persuade the electorate to vote for GB to leave the EU is inaccurate.\r\n\r\nAfter WW2, Churchill encouraged unity.  Since then, our older generations enjoyed a unique period in GB's history in which people could concentrated on and benefit from wealth creation instead of suffering from destructive conflict. We must remember the lessons of history and try to give future generations similar opportunities.",
        "background": "Given the importance of the issue, the closeness of the vote, that a majority of young people - over time most affected - voted \"Remain\" and the misinformation used to persuade the electorate how to vote, a fresh referendum on GB's EU membership is both a democratic, moral and social necessity.",
