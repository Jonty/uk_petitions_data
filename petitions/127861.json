        "additional_details": "Chickenpox complications include severe skin infections, scars, brain damage and death. There is no reason children should suffer these complications when there is a safe vaccine already available. \r\nStudies have confirmed that the cost to the NHS would be offset by not having to deal with chickenpox complications, antibiotics prescribed, hospital, GP appointments aswell as time taken off work by parents caring for children infected with Chickenpox.\r\n",
        "background": "Chickenpox is pretty much unheard of in the USA, Japan and Germany. A vaccination was approved in 1995 and has been used for 20 years. It  was combined with the MMR vaccine creating an MMRV vaccine in 2005. The World Health Organisation includes it as one of children's vital immunisations. ",
