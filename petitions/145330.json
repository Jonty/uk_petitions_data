The leave campaign was full of untruths that are only now being retracted. No one has been able to offer a viable alternative to remaining in the EU.\r\n",
        "background": "It's now up to parliament to decide whether or not to go through with taking the UK out of the EU. MPs are in a much better position than the general public to know what is best for the UK in this regard. They should do what they know is right despite the referendum result.\r\n",
