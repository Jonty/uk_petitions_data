It's not unreasonable within 12 months the Commons should decide if a new mandate is required or not. ",
        "background": "3 times in the past 40 years the Prime Minister has changed without an election. The Fixed Term Parliament Act should include provision that a vote should be held within a year of a change in Prime Minister so that if the House of Commons thinks the government needs a new mandate it can get one.\r\n\r\n",
