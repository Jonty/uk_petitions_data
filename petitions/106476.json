        "additional_details": "Due to anti-gun laws being in force there is no real quick and painless way of committing suicide. Death via heights is often messy and public which may not be the way some may want to end their lives as those few seconds between jumping and ground contact is filled with a grim expectation with contact with the ground, not to mention if they land feet first they will experience their body being physically crushed, as opposed to the sister of death via sleeping pills, euthanasia.",
        "background": "Suicide in the UK today, how does it happen?  Firearms, co-proxamol poisoning ,self-poisoning and not to mention hanging. These methods are usually messy and leave the victims with their last moments of life being full of pain and misery. Why do this when death can be quick and painless?",
