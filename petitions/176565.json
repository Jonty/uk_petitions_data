        "additional_details": "The Royal Stoke hospital car park is a joke and you have to drive up and down for as long as an hour to get a space and then you are charged \u00a31.70 per hour it is scandalous that the sick have to pay in this day and age we are going backwards not forwards. If the NHS had the correct funding they would neither need to charge the sick or employ the parking attendants to police the car parks. There are parts of Scotland and Wales where it is free why not in England.",
        "background": "If you are sick or if you visit a sick person you should not be charged for this it not your fault and can not be avoided. If you work in a  hospital you should not be charged for the privilege of working there. Fund the NHS properly and there would be no need to charge sick people or their visitors",
