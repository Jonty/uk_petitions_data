        "action": "Make it a criminal act for child contact denial to be accountable for.",
        "additional_details": "Reasons why contact is stopped:\r\n1. The resident parent (RP) wants to start a new life and wants the non resident parent (NRP) out of the way.  \r\n2. The RP wants money/property from the NRP and uses the children as bargaining pawns. \r\n3. The RP may see children as a way of getting a house, welfare money, and other benefits. \r\n4. The RP is possessive and wants all the children\u2019s love. \r\n5. The RP dislikes the NRP new partner, who they see as a rival 'parent', so prevents the child seeing the NRP.\r\n",
        "background": "Resident parents who deny contact between their children and the non-resident parent without due cause should be held accountable. It is a form of psychological child abuse. Justice for the affected children whose resident parents think they can play with their lives. ",
