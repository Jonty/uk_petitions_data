        "additional_details": "The family has been very let down by Swale Borough Council, and Swale social services. Swale accused mum of making herself homeless and ignored all evidence provided. Swale refused to help mum with storage so all furniture was lost. Children have been through months and months of being unsettled, scared and not having slept in their beds since january. Appeals have been placed with Greenwich Borough, but all been turned down despite having local MPs support. Family needs housing ASAP",
        "background": "Family homeless since January are in need of housing after fleeing Swale council in fear of children being removed. They spent 16 weeks in a B&B and have received no help from either Borough. Children now fully settled into schools after a long wait for school places, family settled in Greenwich.",
