        "additional_details": "It is helping those who take it to deal with side effects of chemotherapy and any pain there cancer may be causing. It helps them eat and sleep which can at times be very difficult when suffering with cancer or going through chemotherapy. There is also a lot of anecdotal evidence it does much more too. We are not promoting this as a cure but that does not change the fact that people are with cancer are choosing to consume cannabis anyway and they should be protected. ",
        "background": "Many people with cancer are already consuming cannabis but having to break the law to do so and that is not right and unfair. Some people try to buy online and get scammed. Even CRUK are aware of these scams. Also clinical trials so far in Spain have been positive and we welcome many more.",
