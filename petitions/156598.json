        "additional_details": "The EU Referendum had an advisory role. The outcome was compromised by misleading information from the Leave campaign, topics included: NHS, immigration, free movement and the cost of the UK\u2019s EU membership. Millions of people didn't know what they voted for. \r\nThis anonymous poll is designed to help MPs understand where they stand and proceed accordingly as the period of uncertainty is unquestionably bad for the economy.\r\nMPs are required to vote in Britain's best interest by law. ",
        "background": "MPs need to have their say on the EU Referendum led by their conscience to do the best for Britain. First, it is better to hold an anonymous poll so that MPs are not influenced by career ambitions of being re-elected (support their electoral area outcome even if they are fundamentally against it).",
