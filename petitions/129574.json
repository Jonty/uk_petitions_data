        "additional_details": "If the Home Office makes an incorrect decision on someone's case, this can usually be appealed in court. The fee increase will make people unable to challenge such decisions, leading to severe disruption in their personal/family lives.\r\n\r\nOnly rich people will be able to access courts, as the proposed amounts are impossible for most immigrants and asylum seekers to pay. This is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/21/asylum-and-immigration-court-fees-set-to-rise-by-over-500",
        "background": "The Government has proposed a massive increase in the fees that immigrants and asylum seekers pay to have their immigration/asylum cases heard in court. This huge rise in fee (eg. from \u00a3140 to \u00a3800 for a hearing in court) will prevent individuals from being able to take their cases to court.",
