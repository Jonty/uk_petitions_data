        "additional_details": "On the 4th October 2016 I was walking through the streets of Leeds City Centre when I came across a man preaching about God, I asked the man why he was shouting in the streets in such an aggressive manor, in response I was ignored and physically pushed away, after that I was surrounded by 6 other preachers and shouted at for questioning who gave them the right to push their beliefs onto others; their answer - \"God\".\r\n\r\nStreet preachings have gone on for thousands of years and must come to an end.",
        "background": "For millennia, preachers have shouted in our streets in an effort to push their belief onto others; telling us that their Gods can solve our problems and that false entities such as the Devil cause them. These teachings should be preached in the houses of these religions and not on our streets.",
