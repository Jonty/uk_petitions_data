        "action": "Stop the resident parent from dictating if the child should see the other parent",
        "additional_details": "For example; the resident parent not answering phone calls/texts/emails from the non resident parent to make contact arrangements and not been at an arranged place so that contact can be made. Enforcement of court orders should be met with harsher punishments to the resident parent if the order is not kept to. Criminal law needs to be investigated further if allegations are made in family law situations to make it fair for non resident parents.",
        "background": "Resident parents of children get away far too much with using the child as a weapon and family law needs to be reformed to allow the non resident parent greater rights without going through the court system to see their children",
