        "additional_details": "As gender neutral toilets are gradually coming into place, I believe it is very appropriate that the transgender community is made to feel as comfortable as they can be. The cost of the sanitation bins are very little and extremely convenient. The bins will be used if the trans* man is menstruating. He will then be able to use the male bathroom and feel comfortable doing so. ",
        "background": "I would like male toilets to have sanitation bins as the transgender community will be able to feel more comfortable and not have to use the female toilets if they are menstruating. This will promote self esteem among the transgender community. ",
