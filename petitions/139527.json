        "additional_details": "A referendum in the UK is not automatically legally binding. Any decision made can easily be disregarded by the sovereign government or put to parliamentary vote in support of some alternate outcome. For many people, the recent EU Referendum presented some very difficult questions. But the promotion of democratic power has been a central concern. Regardless of personal opinion, anything other than immediate action in respect of the people\u2019s democratic choice would be completely unacceptable.",
        "background": "In respect of the democratic decision made by the people of the United Kingdom during the 2016 Referendum on the United Kingdom\u2019s membership of the European Union, the government should immediately notify the European Council of the United Kingdom\u2019s intention to withdraw as a Member State.",
