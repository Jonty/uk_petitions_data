        "additional_details": "I took out a \u00a35000 loan when I was 18. I was in then in a job that enabled me to repay the debt comfortably. Since then I lost that job and have been financially crippled since then. I can no longer get a mobile phone contract, I find it hard to get a private tenancy agreement. None of this or the consequences was I informed of during school. Make information about loans, credit cards and mortgages compulsory in GCSE maths to better equip students for the real world.",
        "background": "Children are leaving school into a world they are not aware of financially. Too many young people are taking out Loans and Credit Cards without fully understanding how that will affect them later in life. Make finance a part of GCSE maths and teach students about loans, mortgages and credit cards",
