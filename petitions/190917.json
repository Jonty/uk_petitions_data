        "additional_details": "Teachers cannot give individual attention where a ratio is 1 to 30. This may impede a child being able to reach thier potential. Gifted children may go unnoticed, those with special needs may act out distress through challenging behaviour, others may struggle to engage, drop out of school, or become excluded. Feelings of unsafety due to overstimulation and not enough individual attention may also arise.\r\n\r\nResearch:- https://www.classsizematters.org\r\nThe above research was carried out in America. ",
        "background": "Classes of 30 are far too crowded. There is increased potential for unsettled distruption from behaviour, louder noise, lack of physical space & lack of 1:1 teaching support. This challenges a child's capacity to learn, engage, be understood, understand and hear and see what is being taught clearly.",
