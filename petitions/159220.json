I want to get the phone companies to take collective action to create an easier way to report and block scammers. My idea would be free service that, after getting a scam call, you could dial a 4 digit number, like you do with 1471. This would report the last callers as a scammer. If this number gets over a certain number of reports, it could then be blocked.  ",

At the moment, we have to be reactive to these calls and can only spread the word on Facebook, emails etc to warn others but what if we could all help to actually stop them?",
