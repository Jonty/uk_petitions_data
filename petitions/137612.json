        "additional_details": "Most people wanted the same thing out of the EU Referendum.  Open discussion and open trade with Europe on a level playing field.  The simple question of \"in or out\" has divided a nation down a line that should never have been drawn.  The issues are way too complex for a yes/no answer and this vote should be seen as an honest reflection of the frustration in Europe and the seed for real open discussions and creating real open and united Europe not imposed by law but free will and humanity.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum was about maintaining links with Europe but was frustrated that the EU was not listening. David Cameron is the best placed person to continue talks with Europe. The question of \"in or out\" was too simplistic and should be the basis for real unity within the EU.",
