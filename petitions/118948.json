        "action": "Make it illegal to sell more than 2 packets of paracetamol in one transaction",
        "additional_details": "There are guidelines released by MHRA (The Medicines and Healthcare  products Regulatory Agency) recommending that sales are limited to two packets and does not occur within a promotional deal.\r\n\r\nLimiting sales will not stop overdoses from occurring, but it will make people more conscious of the dangers of paracetamol for accidental overdoses, and those intending to commit suicide will have to go to multiple stores, giving the person longer to think, rather than act on impulse.",
        "background": "Retailers can sell 100 paracetamol in a single transaction, as long as the packets only contain 16 tablets. Some retailers limit it to 2 packets however this is individual store policy. This should become the law, as it will reduce accidental and intentional overdoses, saving lives and NHS money. ",
