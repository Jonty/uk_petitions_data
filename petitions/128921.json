        "additional_details": "The families of the 96 people who died at Hillsborough have had to endure 27 years of pain and heartache uncovering what they always knew was the truth. The families themselves and campaign groups have had to find exorbitant amounts of money to fund a fight that should never have had to be fought whilst the establishment have continued to fund their cover up and lies fully funded by the tax payer.",
        "background": "The Hillsborough victims families have for 27 years had to pay their own legal fees unearthing the truth of what happened on 15/04/89. The South Yorkshire Police and others held responsible for the tragedy that day have had their legal fees paid by the tax payer. Another miscarriage of justice.",
