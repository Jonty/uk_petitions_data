        "additional_details": "If the change goes forward, motorbikes will not have to use the opposite lane for filtering while some bus lanes sit empty. This will significantly reduce the risk of accident for riders. Currently, motorcyclists are being penalized for using some bus lanes in London and having to read the sign each time before entering the lane can cause a potential danger to other road users by distracting rider's attention from the road.",
        "background": "Motorcycles should be allowed to use all bus lanes in London. This would help the riders to arrive quicker to their destination and stimulate people to transfer from cars to motorbikes, which are more environmentally friendly.",
