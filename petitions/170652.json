        "action": "Pass a law so that EU roaming charges are abolished despite the Brexit vote",
        "additional_details": "This law will work by making mobile networks abolish roaming charges or face fines if they fail to do so. This will protect holidaymakers from shock bills. You could also introduce a reciprocal law for EU holidaymakers coming to the UK. This means that EU mobile networks can't charge for roaming in he UK. This will make negotiations easier as it will benefit EU citizens as well.",
        "background": "The EU has introduce a law to ban roaming charges across the union. However, as UK is leaving those laws won't apply for UK networks and charges will go up. One way is to make a law to stop networks charging for EU roaming. This law could be reciprocal to make negotiations easier.",
