        "additional_details": "Standing Order No. 42 allows the Speaker to direct a Member to discontinue his speech if that Member 'persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his own arguments or of the arguments used by other members in debate'. However, this rule is rarely enforced by the Speaker, and the above examples suggest it is insufficient to prevent members of the house single-handedly obstructing bills.\r\n\r\nAppropriate time limits on MPs speeches would be a hard stop to the practice of \"filibustering\".",
        "background": "In October 2016, the \"Turing Bill\" was blocked as Sam Gyimah MP \"talked out\" the bill, preventing it reaching a vote. In November 2016 Philip Davies MP spoke for an hour to block a bill to end unpaid internships.\r\n\r\nThe practice is wholly undemocratic and makes a mockery of the parliamentary system.",
