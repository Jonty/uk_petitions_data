        "action": "George Galloway should be re-instated to the Labour Party.",
        "additional_details": "George Galloway became the Vice-President of the Stop the War Coalition in 2001. Actively involved, he often delivered speeches from StWC platforms at anti-war demonstrations. \r\n\r\nGeorge Galloway was removed from the Labour Party for supposedly 'bringing the party into disrepute'. The 'Chilcot' report on the Iraq war has proved that Mr Galloway was right to oppose the invasion of Iraq.\r\nWe the people demand his expulsion be revoked and to be re-instated to the Labour Party with immediate effect.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "George Galloway was wrongfully expelled from the Labour Party and should be re-instated with immediate effect. Or atleast members of the Labour Party should be allowed to vote on whether he should be re-instated if Mr Galloway so wishes to return.",
