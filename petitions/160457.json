But nobody knew what out meant,\u201d Fabian Picardo, the chief minister of Gibraltar, told the FT in an interview.  He said voters should be given a second chance to decide between remaining part of the EU and accepting a new post-Brexit accord with EU member states.\r\n",
        "background": "There is no clear proposal to implement Brexit.  It is very possible that the actual plan, once set out in sufficient detail for practical implementation, may command less support than the recent referendum. Given its irreversibility, we must confirm that any plan still commands majority support. ",
