        "action": "Introduce motorcycle licence progression training as per the 3rd EU Directive.",
        "additional_details": "17-19 year olds can ride A1 class bikes (125cc) on a CBT cert. At 19 they can take the A2 test for larger bikes. There is now no incentive to train to A1 test standard because they are forced to repeat the same tests when they are entitled to progress at 19. This essentially entices them to wait and continue on a CBT. They ride for up to 2 years without any highway code knowledge, theory test and hazard perception. CBT only gives them 2 hours road preparation. DVSA stats show a 8% KSI increase. ",
        "background": "Department of Transport ignored the licence progression training in Article 7.1.c of 3rd EU Driving Licence Directive. It imposed compulsory retesting which removed all incentive for novices to train and qualify for A1. There was an 8% increase in Killed & Seriously Injured 'after' implementation. ",
