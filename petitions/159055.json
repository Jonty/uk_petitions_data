        "action": "Fund our NHS with an additional \u00a33billion per annum using former EU finances",
        "additional_details": "In addition to this there are an increased number of reports of missing medical records that are needed to claim work related illness compensation. The funds should be drawn from the savings of leaving the EU as suggested by the leave campaign. Such insinuations have been recognised in hindsight as a significant influence on the voting of the British public and many feel that the retraction of that notion is unjust.",
        "background": "Our national health service is wavering under the weight of increased expectations and lack of funding. This petition would like to see that NHS staff are paid and treated fairly, compensated properly for any work related illness and supported through any work related illness as may be necessary.  ",
