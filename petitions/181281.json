        "additional_details": "It's very hypocritical that a petition was raised demanding a ban on Trump making a State Visit to UK, due to claims of racism, while no such protest was made when Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, visited Britain, though his forces racially attacked many British citizens resident in his state. While there have been protests about Trump's temporary restriction on migration to the US from 7 countries, with claims such is a Muslim ban, there is no such uproar about the 16 countries who ban Israel.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "\r\n\r\nDonald Trump should be allowed to enter the UK in his capacity as the head of the US government, and should, as per usual protocol, be invited to make an official State Visit, because he is the democratically-elected leader of the USA, one of our major trading partners.\r\n\r\n",
