        "additional_details": "In other countries such as Norway (that are not in the EU and bound by unmanageable rules and regulations) small inshore vessels are excluded from quota's and they have a thriving industry and healthy fish stocks.\r\nEverybody understands the need for conservation and the quota system needs replacing with a more sustainable and environmentally friendly method such as limited days at sea and/or fishing gear restrictions. \r\nThrowing back dead fish is immoral and wrong and must be stopped.",
        "background": "The quota system has been a nightmare for the fishing industry and fish stocks in general. The disgusting practice of throwing back good quality fish that are dead or have no chance of survival must be stopped.\r\nQuota systems simply do not work in mixed fisheries.",
