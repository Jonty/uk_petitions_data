        "additional_details": "There is no reason for this information to be made public or even recorded, except for the media to create drama and a division within the country. When a democracy makes a decision, the result should be the nations result and not multiple results specific to areas of the country, or a age group. Focusing what percentage voted what and where, serves no benefit to the nation, and only divides it. So no longer provide the public with a group to attack, when a vote does not go ones way. ",
        "background": "An individuals vote in the UK is private and is only public if they choose it to be so. This should also apply too the votes of geographic areas and age groups. So this same consideration for privacy of individuals should apply also to geographic areas and age groups.",
