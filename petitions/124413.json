        "action": "Stop planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payments.",
        "additional_details": "Over the last few years there have been many changes to the structure and award systems that provide financial assistance to people living with disabilities. The Personal Independence Payment was brought in to help those who can function relatively normally in society if provided with help with basic daily needs. Take away the PIP and the government is potentially going to be facing having to provide residential care for 640,000 additional people, the cost of which will be far greater than PIP.",
        "background": "Personal Independence Payments are awarded to people living with disabilities who need help with basic tasks such as getting out of bed, getting washed and dressed, and bathing/personal hygiene. Approx 640,000 people whose basic care needs are tended to by help paid for with PIP will lose funding.",
