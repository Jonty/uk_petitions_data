        "additional_details": "There is overwhelming evidence of the positive impact that service dogs can have on people who have mental disabilities, just because the disability is often invisible does not mean that the impact is not as great as those with physical disabilities. Two UK charities now provide service dogs for children under 10 with autism but can not grow their charity due to lack of funding. We need psychological service dogs to be widely available to all that need them to give them a good quality of life. ",
        "background": "In the UK there is no service dog support for people with psychological disabilities, having spoken to the charities who train service dogs in the UK for pysical disabilities it is clear that this is due to lack of funding and resources. This needs to change as it is doing across the world.  ",
