        "action": "Force a new general election due to public vote of no confidence.",
        "additional_details": "The country voted in the referendum and in spite of individual reasons for the cast of their vote, the British electorate voted in favour of leaving the EU. As this was a legal vote, I am not calling for a second referendum, but I do call for a public vote of no confidence in the current and prospective leadership of our country. The Conservative's were legally voted to power, with David Cameron as Prime Minister. With his resignation the country should call for a new General Election.",
        "background": "After the resignation of David Cameron, the u-turns of prominent MP's of the Leave campaign, where they have stated a specific standpoint in the run up to the referendum, only to state the opposite after their narrow win; has caused political turmoil and a vote of no confidence from its electorate.",
