        "additional_details": "The 4 breeds that are banned:\r\nPit Bull Terrier, Japanese Tosa, Dogo Argentino & Fila Brasiliero. \r\nHundreds, maybe thousands of dogs are put down every year simply because of their breed, whether they're deemed dangerous or not. Aggressive dogs come about because of how they're raised, not because of their breed. My Staffordshire Bull Terrier has in fact been attacked by a labrador, never another Pit. Put more focus on helping, neuturing and retraining these dogs, not killing them. ",
        "background": "In 1991, the Dangerous Dogs Act came into force which meant 4 breeds in particular are banned in the UK. For the last 25 years, Pit Bull Terriers have been the main target and it's totally obsurd. Aggressive dogs are not about the breed, it's about how the dogs are raised. ",
