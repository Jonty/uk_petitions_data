        "additional_details": "This is not an education issue as most of the perpetrators are aware of the law, these offences are usually committed furtively or with some ready excuse in mind. Obvious deterrents are monitored CCTV in hotspots financed by swingeing fines clearly posted. Councils could consider rewards for residents who provide the evidence required. If a resident is prepared to provide the power and monitor a camera, then the council could install CCTV on their property if it overlooks a rubbish hotspot. ",
        "background": "There is an ever increasing amount of rubbish on our streets. The better Councils are at clearing it away the more it seems to encourage the criminal. Our litter and rubbish dumping laws are fundamentally sound but are ineffective owing primarily to the difficultly in identifying the culprit.",
