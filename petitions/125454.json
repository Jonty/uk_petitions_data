        "additional_details": "Relying on the implementation of a lease alteration for smoking is not practical. It is expensive, complicated and involves all parties being willing to adopt.\r\n\r\nThe health effects of passive smoking are well documented as are the damage it has on young children.\r\n\r\nHome insurance premiums may be proportionately higher as a smoker lives in the building. Heating bills may be higher as those affected open windows to combat the smoke.\r\n\r\nMany of the UK's homes are old and cannot be made 'air tight'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
