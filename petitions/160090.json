        "additional_details": "The current law on misconduct in public office is not statutory,  and there is a limited definition of who holds public office which does not include MP's. The law needs to be placed on statute and MP's should be included in the definition of holders of public office and liable to commit the offence except where parliamentary privilege exists. This would mean that MP's could be prosecuted where they abuse the public's trust in the office holder by, for example, lying in a referendum debate. ",
        "background": "It is alleged that some MP's knowingly lied about the facts to the public during the recent EU referendum thereby causing those members of the public to vote in a way they would not have done if in possession of the true facts. The current law of misconduct in a public office is unclear. ",
