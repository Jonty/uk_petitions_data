I would like to put it to the government to give any parents that losses a child to get a minimum of one month off work if they wish to take it.  If it was clear that you can take a month then this would be one less thing to have to worry about at a heart breaking time. \r\n",

After this totally devastating event my partner was legally expected to return to work two days after the funeral.  This is NOT enough time after the loss of a child. \r\n",
