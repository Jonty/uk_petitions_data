        "additional_details": "Paramedics have threatened with death, spat at, kicked, punched and had knives pulled on them as they answer emergency calls.\r\n\r\nAmbulance trust\u2019s are now calling on magistrates to get tough with offenders convicted of assaulting 999 teams, to protect frontline medics from violence and abuse.\r\n\r\nThere is no deterrent. If people knew they would get a guaranteed prison sentence for attacking medical staff, they would probably think twice about doing it.",
        "background": "This offence should be created to enable prosecution for anyone who assaults Medical Staff. This offence can be committed anywhere medical personnel are working. This must be extended to not only to NHS trusts, but also voluntary organisations and private providers.\r\n\r\nMedical Staff are life-savers ",
