        "additional_details": "So the House of Commons blocked a bill proposed by the Lords to allow 16/17 year olds the vote in the upcoming EU referendum. The Commons didn't want to set a precedent that this age group should be allowed to vote in the general elections- in which all I can reply with is that general elections happen once every 5 years whereas the EU referendum will happens ONCE A LIFETIME. Join me and sign this petition fighting for a more democratic referendum in which all people can feel represented.",
        "background": "The young are more politically involved than ever! Its their future and they deserve a say in one of the most urgent topics of a generation. Cameron eagerly wants the vote to be held unrightfully soon obsecuring the certain advantages of letting these worthy citizens join us in democracy!",
