        "additional_details": "Every day I see people posting how their van was broken into and their tools stolen. These are then sold on the popular auction websites. Most  tools for sale could be legitimate and the vendor would  have no problem advertising the serial number. The harder stolen tools are to sale and more traceable they become the less attractive they become to thieves. Ave cost of basic kit is circa \u00a32000 and insurance to cover is prohibitively expensive. Also damage to vehicular to gain entry costs \u00a31000's",
        "background": "As a member of the Van and Tool awareness group on Facebook I'm shocked by the blatant resale of stolen tools on popular auction sites. Selling tools with a compulsory Serial number would make tracing stolen tools easier and make steeling them less attractive ",
