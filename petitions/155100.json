        "action": "Make MP's like us: 93% state school; 50% women; 100% from their constituency.",
        "additional_details": "50% of the population are women. Women got the vote a hundred years ago and still they are under represented and under paid in every walk of life.\r\n7% of the population are private school educated and yet they make up to 50% of MP's in government. \r\nCareer politicians live and work in London and do not understand the people they represent. \r\nThese three problems can be solved by the next General Election. Let's make MP's more like us and bring in quotas for a fairer, less divided, United Kingdom.\r\n",
        "background": "The country is economically and politically divided. MP's are bewildered by those outside London because they are so different from them. Let's break the domination of private school educated, London based men in our politics. Bring in quotas now for our representatives so MP's look like us.",
