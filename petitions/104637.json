        "additional_details": "Hunting with dogs is not a sport, it is animal abuse. Research has proven that it is not pest control. Farmers and hunters create artificial earths, feed, breed and rear fox cubs. The use of animals to kill other animals is barbaric and archaic. the majority of British people want hunting with packs of dogs to remain illegal, please respect democracy and preserve, strengthen and enforce the Hunting Act",
        "background": "We want to ensure that the hunting act remains in place and that there are no more attempts to amend the act. We believe that the act should be strengthened and feel that all hunting with dogs should be banned permanently. Hunting with dogs is cruel and barbaric and has no place in a modern society.",
