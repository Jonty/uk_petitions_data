        "additional_details": "More than 900 asylum-seeking children have gone missing in the past five years but since the start of 2015 the rate has risen, according to new figures obtained by the Observer. At least 340 disappeared between January and September, and nearly a third of those remain missing and at risk of exploitation and radicalisation, according to Freedom of Information responses from 132 local authorities across England and Wales. With many children in the UK still without a social worker assigned to them, the real number could be significantly higher.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The number of children who disappear soon after arriving in the UK as asylum seekers has doubled over the past year, raising fears that they are being spirited away by traffickers into domestic servitude, the sex trade or are ending up on the streets.\r\n\r\n",
