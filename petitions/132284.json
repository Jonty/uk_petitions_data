        "additional_details": "Our mechanic informed us it is expected from cheaper cars as they use low quality seats, more expensive makes use higher quality. We believe there should be a standard of seats used, we are told to put our children in the back of our cars- unbeknownst to us potentially putting their lives at risk should they be in a crash! The front seats fly back at force, along with the person in them and the passengers in the back are flung forward- it's so very very dangerous.",
        "background": "During a rear impact crash our front seats fully reclined with force, we have been informed this is standard from 'cheap' cars- ours was a 2014 model.  This happens with all makes and models potentially putting passenger's lives at risk. This Is unacceptable and higher standards are needed. ",
