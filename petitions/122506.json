        "action": "Stop using the unfair Carr-Hill formula to fund GP practices in England",
        "additional_details": "We petition the release of the Carr-Hill formula in full.Following the release of the formula we petition parliament to halt any changes to the way GP's are funded until a full public consultation within each NHS trust is carried out of the Carr-Hill formula as well as a risk assessment for GP practices to ensure the safety of patients in primary care.",
        "background": "GP funding is being changed using the fundamentally flawed Carr-Hill formula that does not take into account the diverse needs of different practices. It has also not been released in full so there is no accountability or transparency for the public. \r\n\r\n",
