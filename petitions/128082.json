Parliament has very recently passed a law which bans legal highs. This law is called the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016.\r\n\r\nThis law makes it a criminal offence to produce and supply legal highs (also referred to as a psychoactive substance), which is punishable with up to 12 months in prison. The Act also gives the police power to stop and search people they suspect of carrying and supplying legal highs, to enter and search property they suspect of selling legal highs and to seize such prohibited goods.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about what is included in the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016 using the following website: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/2/contents/enacted/data.htm\r\n\r\nIf you would like Parliament to take additional action on legal highs, you could start a new petition calling clearly for the specific additional action you would like.\r\n"
