        "action": "Grant all EU citizens currently residing in the UK lifetime permanent residence",
        "additional_details": "Given the uncertainty created by the EU referendum result, it is essential that the UK government takes great care to ensure that both EU nationals living within the UK and UK nationals living within the EU are guaranteed certain basic rights. Citizens from across the UK and the EU have started lives in other member states in good faith. In order to ensure a calm transition, it is only fair that those citizens' rights are permanently protected as enshrined by the principles of both EU and UK law",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, request that the UK government grants full unconditional permanent residence status to all EU migrants who have been living in the UK for at least 4 years or more at this point in return for similar EU agreements on the status of UK nationals currently residing within the EU.",
