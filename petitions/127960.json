        "action": "stop medicines wastage, allow the re-use of returned medication to the  pharmacy",
        "additional_details": "The government should allow pharmaceutical bodies to have criteria which can be followed to allow some medication that has to be returned to pharmacies to be re-used thus saving millions of pounds firstly in destruction costs and secondly in the cost of the medication. In light of the recent financial crisis and the cash strapped NHS. These efficiency savings could be pumped back into the NHS. It is also and unethical scenario when there are people around the globe who cannot afford medications.",
        "background": "Every year millions of pounds is lost when medications are returned to the pharmacy for destruction by patients, care homes e.t.c. Some of the medication remains untouched. We have the ridiculous situation where medication that has left the premises and returned the next day has to be destroyed.",
