        "action": "Reassess general aviation airfields as green belt not brown field sites.",
        "additional_details": "General Aviation airfields are home to wild flowers, plants and grasses as well as many small animals and birds. Our future commercial pilots start their training at these airfields which provide local employment. We will miss this national resource when it's too late and they have been dug up for housing. These are green sites and must be afforded the same protection as farm land.",
        "background": "Airfields around the country are categorised  as brown field sites making them attractive for development of housing estates. However these airfields are 90% grass land. Reassessing them as green belt will protect our green countryside, protect local employment and protect general aviation. ",
