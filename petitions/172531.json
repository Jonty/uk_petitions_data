        "additional_details": "As a chef, it is expected that I will work over the festive period, including Christmas day, boxing day and all bank holidays, with no extra incentive.   I fully support retail workers having Christmas day AND Boxing day off, but this should be extended to those who work in hospitality too. This is especially important for those who work away from their hometowns, as one day off is not long enough to get home to see their family and means a Christmas day spent alone. ",
        "background": "\r\nChristmas is a family time, hospitality workers work extremely hard during the Christmas run up and many don't get Christmas day off, nevermind boxing day. Some things are needed over the festive period; eating out isn't one of them.",
