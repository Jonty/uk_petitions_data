        "additional_details": "The EU referendum presented many examples of deliberate manipulation. Whilst the UK might have a gross contribution of \u00a3350M, a week, and it might be a good idea to increase NHS funding by \u00a3350M, to suggest one can replace the other is deliberate misrepresentation. \r\n\r\nThis petition is not parochial.  It should be an offence, irrespective of who it is who lies.",
        "background": "Democracy only works if we have honest and balanced information on which to base our decisions. If it is an offence to mislead consumers when advertising a consumer product, it is surely much more important to deliberately mislead in order to get a vote. \r\n\r\nPersonal opinions are fine, lies are not.",
