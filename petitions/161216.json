        "action": "Prime Minister suspend 3rd Heathrow runway until Brexit negotiations complete",
        "additional_details": "Assumptions of Heathrow expansion economic projections are based on London being at focal point of connection between UK & other European countries. Logic may now not hold true.\r\nUntil full scale of Brexit negotiations are known economic case for 3rd Heathrow runway is tenuous.\r\nIf after Brexit negotiations on UK leaving EU, Scotland negotiates to remain part of EU, perfectly conceivable Edinburgh & Glasgow could become significant economic hubs in their own right. Less need for Heathrow expansion",
        "background": "Economic case for 3rd runway Heathrow can't be justified until all Brexit negotiations complete & or 2nd referendum.\r\nUnder Brexit if carried out, London may no longer retain hub status. If Scotland negotiates to remain in EU, strong economic case Edinburgh & Glasgow become future gateways to Europe",
