        "additional_details": "The referendum vote was split almost 50:50 it makes no sense to say that \"the people have spoken\". Millions of leavers are changing their minds as the folly of Brexit unfolds. Their views should now be heeded. The referendum took no account of the constituent parts of the UK leading to patent injustice. \r\n\r\nA FREE PARLIMENTARY VOTE ON THE REPEAL OF THE 1972 EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ACT IS THE ONLY PRESENT REMEDY AND VITAL TO THE EXERCISE OF DEMOCRACY.\r\n",
        "background": "What if Brexit Wrecks It? National unity and prosperity, and stability in Europe are at stake.The EU referendum is only advisory. It is the duty of MPs in a representative parliamentary democracy to decide whether the 1972 European Communities Act should be repealed. ",
