        "additional_details": "GCSE students are aspiring to get As and A*s, not 8s and 9s. Students currently in year 10 will get results with a mixed bag of numbers and grades, while those younger than them will get mostly numbers. For a system that is said to bring out the best in this generation's pupils, it has been getting mostly negative feedback and takes years before it is fully implemented. Putting A Level content into GCSE exams is not the ways forward, they are two different things and should always remain so.",
        "background": "As we all know, GCSE's and A Level's are getting even tougher thanks to the new '9-1' system. A Level content is being put in GCSE exams and this makes life tougher for students in year 11 and below. Sign this petition so the Government wakes up and takes action.",
