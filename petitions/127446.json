The welfare of the poor dogs being bred needs questioning as the needs of the dogs isn't always first priority.\r\nThis is how easy it is to get a license and the fee for a licence varies depending where you live.\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/dog-breeding-licence-england-scotland-wales",
        "background": "The current criteria/eligibility and fees to obtain a dog breeding licence is making it open to everybody, we are over run with dogs and puppies in this country. Breeding is an easy option to make big money quick. We need to clamp down and start putting the welfare of the animals first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
