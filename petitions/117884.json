        "additional_details": "There is an increase of people smoking e-cigarettes in indoor public places.Places range from the local supermarket restaurants,work places,shopping centres etc.As an asthmatic to breathe the vapor from one of these devices starts off an asthmatic response.I've become very wheezy,tight chested,and very short of breath,reaching for my reliever inhaler.After inhaling these vapors which I believe contain nicotine and other substances,I feel unwell and sometimes for several days afterwards.",
        "background": "Being an asthmatic there can be lots of triggers that can cause irritation to your airways and lungs.Asthmatics struggle as a result of pollution,exhaust emissions, second-hand cigarette smoke,and now e-cigarette vapor.Please put a stop to the use of e- cigarettes being used in indoor public places.",
