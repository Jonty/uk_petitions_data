        "additional_details": "Some voters accept as genuine, without question, posts on social media that are either written, endorsed or shared by MPs. The government should set up an independent body to monitor and police MPs Social Media accounts. Were it can be proven an MP has intentionally lied or spread false information on Social Media, this body should have regulatory powers to impose sanctions and or fines on the MPs responsible. It is important that MPs are seen to be as transparent as possible.",

The Government  should set up an independent body to monitor these accounts. ",
