        "additional_details": "Just because we voted differently doesn't mean we don't want him to steer this ship through this scary storm. Come back and keep your word to the many millions of Great British people whom chose you above all others to lead our country. It will be a mammoth task to undo our ties with the EU and a task I wouldn't want to trust to anyone else. I'm sure I am not alone in this. Please show your support to our Prime Minister.",
        "background": "I am so disappointed that David Cameron has abandoned us, his Great British people.\r\nWe elected him because we trusted him and we trusted him when he said that he would support our decision over the EU. I am sure he feels abandoned by us but in truth we voted Leave because we believed in him still.",
