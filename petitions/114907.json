        "additional_details": "For starters we shouldn't be banning people for their opinions on domestic actions in a US political race that doesn't concern us. But more importantly if he does actually win the nomination, and then goes on to win the presidency. We then have to work with a man who we banned from our country in the first place - which totally offsets and upsets relations between two closely bonded countries. Leave the decision making on appropriate responses to the Americans. Lets mind our own business.",
        "background": "There are proposals to ban Donald Trump from the United Kingdom. At least, there's a petition on the topic. This is totally illogical. ",

The Home Secretary will use these powers when justified and based on all available evidence. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has made clear that he completely disagrees with Donald Trump\u2019s remarks. The Home Secretary has said that Donald Trump\u2019s remarks in relation to Muslims are divisive, unhelpful and wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the strength of feeling against the remarks and will continue to speak out against comments which have the potential to divide our communities, regardless of who makes them. We reject any attempts to create division and marginalisation amongst those we endeavour to protect.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n",
