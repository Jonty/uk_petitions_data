Most of us will come into contact with the NHS at least a dozen times in our lives.  It seems the politicians are unable to solve this problem. So let's all pull together to solve it for them. The NHS will simply not survive without more hospitals, more beds and staff. This is something I am will to have a tax increase for.  Just 100,0000 votes gets this debated. ",
        "background": "Governments of the day will not increase taxes to solely fund and secure the future of the NHS. They assume it's election suicide so never do it. Let's force a cross party agreement that stipulates the NHS requires a national tax of it's own to secure funding for more hospitals and more staff. ",
