        "additional_details": "Why are we using several button batteries when a single AA or AAA battery would do the same job with a minimal increase in size? \r\nAA type batteries are much less appetising to toddlers and babies who have managed to open their toys to reveal a potentially fatal prize, as well as being much harder to swallow.\r\nMy toddler hasn't been injured, thankfully, but when I started to think about how many of his toys contain 3 or 4 of these batteries each, I became quite concerned. \r\n",
        "background": "The UK is seeing a large increase in serious injuries, and in some cases death, from children swallowing button batteries. \r\nAt the same time, we are seeing an large increase in the use of button batteries in children's toys. \r\nSurely this cannot be coincidence? ",
