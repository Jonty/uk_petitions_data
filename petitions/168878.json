        "action": "Outlaw sale of electronics with firmware reflashing code that can be reflashed",
        "additional_details": "Cyber attacks against hardware have begun to take the form of reflashing attacks which modify the firmware of the targeted device.\r\n\r\nIf the device's capability to be reflashed can itself be removed or tampered with by reflashing, attack code can make itself undetectable and impossible to remove, requiring the entire electronic device to be thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe proposal would obstruct this form of attack as fixed unchangable code would exist allow reflashing and reporting of flash memory contents.",
        "background": "For security, require electronic devices with \"reflashable\" or other alterable firmware to have the section of code that performs the reflashing, and one that correctly downloads the current reflashable firmware contents, stored in Read Only Memory that is electronically impossible to alter.",
