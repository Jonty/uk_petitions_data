        "action": "Reform Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 to remove the test for 'Priority Need'.",
        "additional_details": "Recent initiatives like 'No Second Night Out' fail to address the underlying issue that Council's have no statutory duty to help most homeless people. Only by ensuring that help is genuinely available to all can we break the current cycle of despair faced by so many. Government figures published earlier this year showed a 55% increase in rough sleeping since 2010. Only a significant change in policy can turn this round.",
        "background": "All who become homeless are at risk of harm and should have a right to assistance. The current system discriminates against most single people and drives many into a spiral of crime, drug abuse, sex working and both physical and mental decline; in turning wasting resources in the NHS and elsewhere.",
