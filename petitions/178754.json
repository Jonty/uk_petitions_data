        "additional_details": "On International Holocaust Memorial Day, President Trump signed an order halting refugee admission to the USA for four months, suspending the admission of Syrian refugees indefinitely and preventing nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries, including permanent US residents, from entering for three months. While other world leaders have condemned this, our government has refused to do so. \r\n\r\nThe US needs a critical friend. Britain must not abdicate its responsibility. ",
        "background": "We call on Prime Minister Theresa May to condemn President Trump's Executive Order \"Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States\". This Executive Order flies in the face of international norms on human rights and religious tolerance. ",
