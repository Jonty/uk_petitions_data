        "additional_details": "The campaigns run by both sides failed to properly inform the public in a balanced and objective manner of the issues at stake in this referenda.  Claims such as demands to reclaim 'sovereignty' were factually untrue and not challenged.  Figures such as the claim that \u00a3350m a week membership fees will be put into public service are demonstrably not true.  Claims that Britain is 'ruled by Brussels and unelected bureaucrats' was not effectively challenged although this is demonstrably not true.  ",
        "background": "The results of the referendum on continued EU membership on 23/06/2016 was very close.  I am concerned that the public, following a fractious campaigning period which was characterised by gross misinformation, and an unbalanced and impartial press were unable to make an informed decision.",
