        "additional_details": "1)Build a *new* international airport(linked to HS2), of similar size to Heathrow, around Birmingham. \r\n2)Divert half of all Heathrow's contracts to the new airport. Reducing pressures on London's resources. \r\nSome of the benefits are\r\n\u2022Sharing traffic between West/North of London. \r\n\u2022More passenger capacity than a single runway extension.\r\n\u2022Help tourism/service industry in the north of UK. \r\n\u2022In Emergencies, as both airports are of similar size, they can better cope with diversion of air traffic. ",
        "background": "Heathrow expansion can only exasperate West London\u2019s housing and congestion problems.\r\nI believe London\u2019s future success and those of rest of UK will best be served by deliberately planning to reduce pressures on London's limited resources. \r\nHence this proposal as a two prong solution. \r\n",
