        "action": "Stop Northern Rail from introducing Driver-Only operation.",
        "additional_details": "Currently trains operating on the Northern franchise require a minimum of two safety-trained members of staff: the driver and the conductor. Driver Only Operation will mean the downgrading of the conductor to a ticket vendor, and in some cases there might not even be a ticket vendor on board. A second safety-trained crew member will always be safer than having only the one. This will allow Arriva / Deutsche Bahn to maximise profit by paying their staff less.",
        "background": "The new Northern Rail franchise was awarded to Arriva (ultimately owned by German state railway Deutsche Bahn) from 1 April 2016. The new franchise includes a commitment to switch some routes to Driver Only Operation. This would allow trains to be operated with only one member of staff - the driver.",
