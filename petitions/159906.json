        "additional_details": "An ASDA branch in Manchester ran a trial of a 'quiet hour' for autistic people, in which they turned off bright lights, loud music, and store announcements. This was very highly supported, and autistic people found it incredibly beneficial for them. We are a National Citizen Service group who have learned a lot about this topic recently, and we want more supermarket branches to create a 'silent hour', in order to make life that little bit easier for people with autism.",
