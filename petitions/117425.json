        "additional_details": "Considering how many people scoliosis affects, there is very little public awareness. The largest group are between the age of 10 and 15. It is more common in girls than boys. \r\n\r\nScoliosis progresses with growth so early intervention is critical. The longer it is left to fulfill its course the worse the outcome for the sufferer. Simple screening can provide massively better outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe earlier intervention is made, the better the outcome. Parents are frequently left distressed feeling responsible that their child's scoliosis has reached a stage that could have been prevented if they'd just noticed it earlier.\r\n\r\n \r\n ",
        "background": "Scoliosis is a progressive disease with no cure affecting approx 1 in 35 people. Left unchecked it can result in life-long surgeries, disability and pain management. In aggressive cases it can become life threatening. Quick, simple screening can save young people from this. Let's bring it back. ",
