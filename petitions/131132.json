        "additional_details": "As many people are aware prices to travel abroad or even to enjoy a holiday in the UK skyrocket outside of term time (during school holidays and half term). While parents have the option to take students out of school to avoid such price hikes teachers do not, as it is their duty to teach every single day. I believe teachers should receive a discount or monetary contribution towards holidays during half-term and Summer holidays. ",
        "background": "Teachers work very hard for little pay. Often they cannot afford the holidays they deserve during their only allocated holiday time, as prices skyrocket during school holidays. \r\n ",
