        "additional_details": "Current maternity pay = \u00a3139.58 per week\r\nCurrent employer minimum = 6 weeks @ 90% of pay, followed by SMP for the rest of the maternity leave. Maternity leave period also often leaves a portion at the end of the year that will be unpaid due to timing of the woman leaving work prior to having her child.",
        "background": "In present times, women now earn just as much, or often more than men. Women are obtaining careers and working hard to keep them and to get remunerated for that accordingly. The current maternity pay of \u00a3139.58 per week is nowhere near enough to now allow a woman to stay at home on maternity.",
