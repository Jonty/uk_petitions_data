        "additional_details": "Working in stressful environments without adequate time to relax can lead to stress, fatigue and ultimately making mistakes which can put lives at risk, we believe staff should have enough time to get away from the department and unwind. 30 minutes is nowhere near enough time to leave the department, pick up lunch and then have time to eat before being late back for shift. We propose that lunch breaks should be extended to 1 hour or 45 minutes at the least to ensure staff have time to eat,relax.",
        "background": "As you know NHS staff work under immense stress and pressure, saving lives on a daily basis. Staff working in these conditions should be given adequate time to get away from the department and relieve themselves of stress. Working under intense pressure without adequate rest can lead to fatigue.",
