        "action": "Ban advertising by gambling companies in particular on-line gambling.",
        "additional_details": "The UK advertising rules for alcohol are amongst the strictest in the world and virtually all tobacco advertising is now illegal in the UK. The rules for advertising alcohol and tobacco are based upon evidence that points to a link between alcohol advertising and people\u2019s awareness and attitudes to drinking and that tobacco advertising increases tobacco consumption which in turn kills people. Whether it's bingo, slots or sports, advertising gambling has similar effects with serious consequences.",
        "background": "Many people have mixed feelings about gambling. However, gambling problems hurt families in many ways, from money worries to anxiety and depression, theft to either repay the debt or to continue gambling and even suicide.  Yet gambling is advertised every where and is allowed on TV 24 hours a day.",
