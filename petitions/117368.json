It is a sincere attempt to gather information on:\r\n1. what has been going wrong\r\n2. how the culture that exists (apparently unchanged) within banks contributes\r\n3. what can be done to encourage, persuade or require banks to change their systems, processes and goals in order to reduce the risk of future crises\r\n\r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/dec/02/fca-regulator-city-attitudes-tracey-mcdermott-banking-firms-impact-society",

The FCA, rightly, intended a major investigation into the culture, behaviour and pay of staff in banking. It has now decided not to go ahead. It is vital that we learn what we can to avoid future crises.",

You could start a new petition calling for Parliament to change the law, so that the FCA is required to conduct a review of banking culture.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could ask the Government to commission a separate independent review of banking culture, or to carry out a review using its own resources. \r\n\r\nYou might also be interested in the work of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which looked at professional standards and culture in the UK banking sector: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/bankingstandards\r\n"
