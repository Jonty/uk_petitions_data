        "additional_details": "Friday 24th June 2016 the votes were counted and 52% 17,410,742 voted to Leave EU. Emotions running high, protests and angry remain voters have argued and now written a petition for a second referendum to take place. This would be a huge waste of money, we are a democracy we have voted and decided as a nation. If we hold a 2nd referendum who's to say that the leave party won't succeed again and the remain voters will be outraged once again or vice-versa. Do not open another referendum.",
        "background": "On Thursday 23rd June 2016 we joined together as a nation and voted on our future. Both Remain and Leave campaigns tore the nation in half. Social media up roared with debates and arguments. Leave party won our PM resigned, our sovereign plummeted and the country went into chaos with panic.",
