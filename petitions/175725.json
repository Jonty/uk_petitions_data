Families in Manchester are fighting daily to get the help and support they need myself being one of them, it's a long, hard and lonely road and at the end of a very tiring battle you may lose so it's time to start all over again.\r\nThings must change, we need to stand up and help Manchester do better.\r\nWhether you are affected or not just one day you might be.",
        "background": "I am a mum of 5 son's 2 of them have Autism, I have been fighting for services for my children for the last 6 years in Manchester.
