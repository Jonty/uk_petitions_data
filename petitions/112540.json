        "additional_details": "For too long have the UK and allied governments taken a back seat with small drone attacks, it is time to have a direct presence and teach extremeists that this behaviour is not tolerated. If they are not stomped out entirely with a big miliatary movement, like a weed they will regrow and spread extremism across Europe. \r\nLike we have seen in the Paris attacks they are already at war with western civilisation as a whole. We are the ones who are late to the war, Fight in their streets before ours.",
        "background": "ISIS have made acts of war and terror towards Europe and countries engaged with them in Syria. Action so far have not been enough to deter such acts. ISIS and other terror organisations including individual extemism will not come to an end unless they are destroyed in their entirety.",
