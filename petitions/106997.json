        "additional_details": "The British public requests the opportunity to show that such kindness and practical support is the only reasonable response.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned pledge to offer our homes to refugees and to support their living in the UK until they can return. The British are more willing and able to help than our Government chooses to admit.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to facilitate this offer of practical assistance. We stand in solidarity with those in Iceland.\r\n",
        "background": "Around 10,000 Icelanders have offered their homes to Syrian refugees after the Government shamefully said they would only take in 50.\r\n\r\nThey have demonstrated that citizens are more sympathetic to the suffering of those affected by the conflict and subsequent human trafficking than our Governments.",
