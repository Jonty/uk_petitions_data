        "action": "A law that restricts roadworks to 5 miles in any 30 mile stretch on a motorway.",
        "additional_details": "Extended roadworks (greater than 5 miles, Incl lead-in/out) with reduced lanes and a 50 Mile an hour speed limit requires significant levels of concentration. It increases the likelihood of an accident, increases traffic jams, restricts movement, increases the time it takes to get from A to B when the roadworks are for extended miles. Drivers get more frustrated, more likely to speed. When there is a 15 mile stretch of roadworks, on large stretches nobody is working anyway!",
        "background": "Over the past few years there has been significant investment in upgrading our motorway system, this has resulted in many miles of roadworks with restricted road width and an imposed fifty mile an hour speed limited that is monitored. Some roadworks go on for 15 miles plus. ",
