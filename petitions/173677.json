In addition, an apprentice can spend a high proportion of their wage travelling to work.  \r\nApprentices should be paid National Minimum Wage from the start. \r\nApprenticeships can be an important way for young people to get into employment and earn while they learn. But young workers should not be used as cheap labour.  All young people deserve to be paid a decent minimum wage.",
