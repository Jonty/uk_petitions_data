        "additional_details": "For decades it has been the policy of the UK Government only to include the participating parties on ballot papers.  This has led in recent years to a gradual decrease in turnout at all elections and the electoral system failing to reflect the views of an element of the electorate who have become disillusioned with all parties.  Only by including such an option would encourage the electorate to cast their vote, increase the turnout and more accurately reflect the ballot.   ",
