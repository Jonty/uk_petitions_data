        "additional_details": "Jeremy Hunt and the Department of Health have made claims that the obstacle to a 7 day NHS is the poor work ethic of NHS consultants.   This has been mixed with statistics about Emergency Care and routine care in a misleading way that has alienated the profession and misled the public.   The Government must work with the doctors of the NHS is to survive.   A failure to clarify plans will destroy motivation as the staff need to know they have a shared aim with those that steer the NHS.",
        "background": "NHS staff want to be able to provide a high standard of clinical care to patients with emergency, or urgent problems 24/7.   The Government has made no differentiation between emergency and routine care, and  needs to clarify its plans,  or staff morale will be fatally damaged",
