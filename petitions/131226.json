        "additional_details": "This recent BBC report shows that 5000 care homes in the UK are now on the brink of closure. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-36200855\r\n\r\nWhilst councils are undoubtedly under extreme financial pressure, in failing to keep up with the rising costs of care, they are putting businesses, jobs & the lives of the UK's most vulnerable residents at risk!\r\n\r\nWe therefore ask you to review the rates paid by local authorities for adult residential care in the UK as a matter of urgency, before it is too late! \r\n",
        "background": "Adult social care is severely under funded. Local authority net spending on social care has dropped by an average of 2.2% a year since 2009 despite day to day living costs increasing. The rates provided to operators to care for LA funded residents are woefully inadequate & many homes risk closure.",
