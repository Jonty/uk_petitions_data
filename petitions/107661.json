Those retiring after April and those already retired will receive very different pensions (both classes of state pensions are expected to be protected by the so-called 'triple lock'). The difference will be perceived as unfair and unjust. The government must recognise this perception of unfairness and injustice and must remedy it by improving the pensions and prospects of those already retired.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/new-state-pension/overview",
        "background": "People retiring after April 2016 (and having 'paid in' appropriately) will be in receipt of the new 'flat-rate' state pension of 'no less than \u00a3151.25 per week' whereas those already retired on a basic state pension (and having 'paid in' appropriately) will continue to receive \u00a3115.95 per week.",
