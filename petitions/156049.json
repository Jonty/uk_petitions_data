        "additional_details": "Different parts of the UK have different amounts of self determination. For example, Scotland has a separate legal system, Wales has a second official language, Northern Ireland uses a different voting system, and London is asking for more powers, while many regions have no powers at all.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, Cornwall wants to raise a tax on second homes, it should have that power, instead of relying on subsidies from elsewhere to address regional problems.",
        "background": "We call for the creation of a Royal Commission, or other form of Constitutional Convention, to consider ways in which the constituent parts of the UK can all be treated fairly, and gain more autonomy; and to explore other voting systems, and related matters.",
