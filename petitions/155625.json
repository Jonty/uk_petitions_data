Only 17,410,742 of the total electorate of 46,500,001 voted to leave the EU.\r\n\r\nThe 51.9% vote included an undefined number of \u201cprotest votes\u201d and votes based on false information/promises. These do not therefore constitute a Leave/Out vote.",
        "background": "The Government of the United Kingdom has an overriding obligation to ensure the safety of all U.K. residents and the stability of the United Kingdom. We believe that in choosing to not invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty the Government will be honouring this obligation.",
