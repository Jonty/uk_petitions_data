        "action": "Allow Police Scotland & Scottish Fire & Rescue to Reclaim VAT",
        "additional_details": "Despite other non local authority institutions, such as the BBC, being able to reclaim VAT this is still denied to Scottish emergency services.  These public services now face a combined annual bill of \u00a333m at a time when budgets are being cut.  Labour and the Conservatives both campaigned in Scotland in 2011 pledging to combine Scotland's eight forces into a single, national force as a way of saving money.  We have a single force now - let them make those savings and claim back their VAT.",
        "background": "Police Scotland and Scottish Fire & Rescue have been unable to reclaim VAT since the eight local Scottish forces were combined into a single, national force as a cost-saving measure.  They are now the only emergency services in the UK unable to do so, leaving them with a large annual VAT bill.",
