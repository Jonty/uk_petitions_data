        "additional_details": "An example & this is not unique - Virgin Care, which beat Kent Community Health NHS Foundation Trust to the lucrative deal, will be able to run health services in the hospitals for the next seven years.\r\nAt the end of this period, Virgin will have the opportunity to extend the contract for another three years. The deal follows a tendering process that began in November 2014. Just one example of stealth privatisation.",

UK tax payers contribute to the sustainability of the NHS - this should remain in the public sector not benefiting shareholders or private interests.",
