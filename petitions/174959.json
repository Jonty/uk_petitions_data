        "action": "Give TFL control of suburban rail in the London's South East",
        "additional_details": "In 2014 Southeastern was given \u00a370 million by the government to improve services. Last month we learned they made a profit of almost \u00a316 million from delay compensation payments. With fares due to rise next month, the service remains unacceptable. TFL has a proven record of delivery on other suburban lines. This issue needs to be brought up again after recent revelations about its shelving being due to petty party politics. Infrastructure improvements in the South East are well overdue.",
        "background": "Passengers have been asked for patience as London Bridge station is redeveloped but since the opening of new platforms in August the service is still as appalling as ever. Now we have been told that plans for rail devolution in the South East have been quashed. Enough is enough.",
