        "action": "Call a referendum on HS2",
        "additional_details": "This is not a petition about stopping development of necessary infrastructure and destroying communities along the way, but one about the potentially unnecessary expenditure of tens of billions of pounds equivalent to 6 years of savings made by leaving the EU.  Other options have not been considered such as double decker trains.  There are double decker options that can fit under most existing tunnels by using space under the train too.  There is also video conferencing!  ",
        "background": "The establishment has discovered that its opinion on the future of the EU is not aligned with the majority of the British public.  It is very likely that their view on the need for HS2 is also not aligned with the British Public.  Hold a referendum on HS2 so the public can decide.",
