        "additional_details": "It recently came to my attention that an individual has successfully published the iconic CC41, I intend to fully challange the Mark personally and have appealed and invited the millions of Brits to join me in this campaign,  so that the trademark CC41 is not granted solely to the individual Mr Douglas Steward, further information of this can be found on the IPO website under the words \"CC41\" The double 11s symbol 11011, another iconic symbol I also wish you to consider protecting.",
        "background": "I would like you to consider protecting the historic expired marks CC41 and 11011 under article 6_ter or equivalent Non EU regulation so that it remains free to use by the people and not that of sole property of an individual so that they are able to gain financial reward.",
