This would be a great moment in Cornwall's history, so all of us Cornish could sit down and be proud of a team and actually support a team! Please share",
        "background": "I'm a young cornish man who wants to have a team to support, now cornwall is a national minority we are meant to have the same rights as Scotland, Wales and Ireland, I'd love to turn my TV on and see cornwall playing national rugby and football! Please share this and help cornwall on its next step!",
