        "additional_details": "As a country we are thousands of nurses short. The cost of overseas recruitment of highly skilled nurses is already a huge cost to our NHS and private sector. Additional surcharges will hinder the affordability of recruiting desperately needed staff. The Government have suggested this will aid UK employers to train and recruit british staff. Students are not choosing nursing as a career path due to many factors. Without highly skilled nurses, lives are increasingly at risk! ",
        "background": "The Home Office are planning to charge \u00a31000 per worker, per year to every employer who recruits an overseas worker. Our healthcare system is in crisis and with additional financial constraints such as this surcharge will see our healthcare system in even more trouble. ",
