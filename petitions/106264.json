        "additional_details": "The drop out rate for students on nursing degrees is around 50% with financial problems being cited as one of the main reasons for this. \r\n Better funding for nursing students will help to reduce this figure and save money spent on educating and training student nurses, more will go on to graduate and more posts will be filled. \r\n Student nurses also get less funding compared to other degrees and are in studies or placement for 12 months a year with just the odd week off for annual leave.",
        "background": "Student nurses study a degree programme for 3 years, on placement for 37.5 hours a week for 50% of the course. \r\nUnlike students on purely academic degrees student nurses do not get long holidays this leaves little time for part time work. This can leave students facing money issues & even poverty. ",
