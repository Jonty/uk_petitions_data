        "additional_details": "More details here in a post written by his manager, Christian Clancy: http://thephuckery.tumblr.com/post/127650317172/tyler-uk\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to also look into Tyler's recent fashion show where he talks about being banned. \r\n\r\nThis man poses no more of a threat to public safety than any musician playing in the UK and the 2005 law that prevents suspected terrorists from entering the UK which caused him banned seems completely inapplicable. ",
        "background": "Tyler, The Creator was banned from the UK last August due to lyrics he wrote back in 2009 as a 17 year old that were interpreted as posing a threat to public safety. These songs have not been performed for years and Tyler's message and music is one of inclusion and creativity. ",
