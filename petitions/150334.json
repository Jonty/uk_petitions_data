        "additional_details": "The referendum gives ADVICE to the government only, it does not command.\r\n To call  for a general election would place this issue up for democratic decision in the proper way - before our sovereign parliament, while registering that the present referendum decision makes the current political status quo completely untenable.   \r\n  Our membership of the EU is fully legally intact until article 50 is invoked.",
        "background": "The sovereign decision-making body of the UK is parliament . The margin for \"out\" was small. A general election must follow  but such a momentous decision,  probably involving the disintegration of the UK, NOT voted for here, should not be settled by a referendum. Referenda ADVISE government only.",
