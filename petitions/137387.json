        "action": "Delay the replacement of Trident till after the imminent Scottish referendum",
        "additional_details": "Following the UK's exit from the European Union and the massive decline in the value of the \u00a3, the cost of replacing Trident is expected to rise significantly from the Department of Defence's previous estimate of around \u00a340 billion to \u00a360-150 billion. Furthermore, Scotland's potential exit from the union means the current base of the nuclear 'deterrent' in Clyde may no longer be tenable. It is not right that we replace our nuclear weapons for status, a serious debate on this issue is required.",
        "background": "We've all debated the strong moral and ethical case for the replacement of Britain's nuclear 'deterrent' program. However, following the UK's decision to exit the European Union on the June 23rd this year. There is now a stronger economical and political case to be made against its renewal.",
