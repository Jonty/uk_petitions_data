        "additional_details": "British citizens who live abroad are also not allowed to vote in the country where they live because they do not have the citizenship in that country. They pay taxes and cannot vote in any country - this unfairness has to stop!!! The 15 year rule makes no sense in the modern world of telecommunication and with globally accessible media.",
        "background": "British citizens who have lived abroad for 15 years are not allowed to vote at British elections. British citizens who live abroad in the EU will be the most effected by the results of the British referendum in June 2016. All of them must be allowed to participate in the referendum!!!",
