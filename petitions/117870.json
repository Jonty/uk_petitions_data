We suggest that to make a fair and representative vote on the issue of leaving or remaining in the E.U. the steps outlined in the header be implemented forthwith. This is a vote for Britain and the British people of adult voting age and it is essential that the voting is totally without prejudice. Therefore to ensure a fair and just ballot on the forthcoming Great Britain leaving/staying in the European Union, we the undersigned would like parliament to debate that all eligible voters must provide photo I.D. when voting namely a British Passport. Also that postal voting will not be allowed.",
