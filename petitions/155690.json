        "additional_details": "Before any vote to ratify the results of the referendum takes places, the Leave campaign must present a plan to Parliament to explain their proposed form of our future relationship with the European Union. This plan must be consistent with the claims presented to the electorate by the Leave campaign and on which the electorate has voted. It must moreover be endorsed by the principal proponents who have supported it.  \r\n\r\nNo steps shall be taken to alter the existing status of the UK within the European Union until this plan is endorsed by Parliament.\r\nParliament must ensure the democratic integrity of the referendum and act in the strategic interests of the United Kingdom in its entirety.",
        "background": "Leave have won the referendum. Next, our Parliament must endorse its results.  But what exactly will they be endorsing? Leave leaders are already taking back the claims they presented to the country during the campaign.",
