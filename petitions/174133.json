        "additional_details": "It is estimated that by 2035 Greater Manchester will see a growth in population by 300,000; and that as it stands there will not be enough housing and infrastructure to accommodate for this growth.\r\n\r\nThe Greater Manchester Combined Authority have therefore determined that in order to meet these requirements, 30% of new housing will have to be developed on Green Belt Land.\r\n\r\nThis is simply unacceptable and alternative solutions to this problem must be pursued.",
        "background": "The people of Greater Manchester must conserve what little Green Belt Land the region still has. The proposal of developing on such land will have an irreversibly devastating impact on the local wildlife and fauna; pollution in our suburban areas; and overall aesthetics of the landscape.",
