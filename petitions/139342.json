        "additional_details": "It is unacceptable that the over 65s have been allowed a say on a Britain that they will not have to live with, but the youth have been sidelined and forced into a Brexit that they do not want to happen. A second EU referendum must be held in the next two years that will allow 16-17 year olds to also vote on their future, and let us make a decision on our fate. We are the future of this country but have not been allowed to let our voice be heard. ",
        "background": "It is ridiculous that 16 and 17 year olds were not allowed to vote in a referendum that has changed their futures, but older generations have decided the next forty years for us. 18-24 year olds, (the next generation of Britain), has voted to remain. Give 16-17 the right to vote on their future too.",
