        "additional_details": "The free movement of people throughout the EU has enabled growth in multiple sectors of society. European workers underpin many vital British services, not least our NHS, and British workers live throughout the EU and wish to continue to be free to do so. \r\n\r\nThis is not just about the economic arguments. Our communities thrive when we work together, and that means being able to travel between countries and work collectively for the good of everyone.\r\n\r\nBritain wants freedom of movement. ",
        "background": "Freedom of movement for EU citizens is a vital part of modern society and is extremely beneficial to the UK, as well as our European partners. As a part of our negotiations for exiting the European Union the British people wish to keep this principle. ",
