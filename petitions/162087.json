        "additional_details": "Too many children are removed based on a parent having mental health problems. I had mine taken despite social services saying I was a good mum and commending me on my parenting. All assessments have been positive but the psychological report paints a bad picture of people with mental health. How is removing children unless they were physically or sexually abused, benefitting children and their parents? More support in the home is needed for those that can be a good parent with help. ",
        "background": "I have borderline personality disorder and because of a relapse and time in hospital, I had my children removed and placed in care. This was meant to be until I got better but they are still not home despite a return to good health and the children begging to be back. I am now fighting for them ",
