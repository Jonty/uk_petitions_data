        "action": "Mandatory 'call-in' of Planning Applications on 10 signatures of Parish electors",
        "additional_details": "Local Planning Applications affect all our lives and vast sums of money are involved. 90% of all applications are decided by unelected council employees with no control by parish councils or elected members. This is plainly wrong and undemocratic. It also leads to allegations or suspicions of underhand influence by those seeking planning permission.  When a Parish Council wants to co-opt a new member, upon the request of 10 members there must be an election; hence the number 10 in this petition.",
        "background": "Now County Hall staff decide 90% of Planning Applications despite opposition of local residents, parish councils and county councillors. There is no democratic control. PAs should be decided by the Planning Committee (comprised of elected councillors) at the request of 10 parish residents.",
