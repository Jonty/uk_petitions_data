        "action": "Repeal scrapping the Dubs amendment, reinstate support for refugee children",
        "additional_details": "The amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 required the Home Secretary to bring a number of unaccompanied refugee children to the UK. No target had been written into the legislation but it had been suggested that the UK could help 3,000 of the most vulnerable. So far, 200 have arrived and a further 150 children would follow before the end of March. Scrapping the amendment had been sandwiched between PMQs and the final vote on the triggering of Article 50. Source: BBC/i",
        "background": "On 9 Feb the government quietly scrapped its commitment to unaccompanied child refugees. And yet Britain has a proud history of welcoming refugees. It would be shameful if the UK closed down \"a route to sanctuary for unaccompanied children just months after it was opened.\" (Lord Dubs) Source: BBC/i",
