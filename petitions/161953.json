        "additional_details": "A whole generation of our children risk being labelled failures by the system that replaced levels. Previously a child and their parents would easily see progress during a school year by looking at their levels. Currently they are labelled as 'emerging', 'expected' or 'exceeding' and a child who is emerging is then described as not being ready for the next year group that they move in to. If our children are to achieve their true potential, we need to stop labelling them as failures!",
        "background": "Children who don't meet the expected standard for their year group are being assessed as emerging and not 'Year _ ready'. Essentially we are telling them they have failed! Children need encouragement not labelling in this way. Levels mean that progress can easily be seen year on year.",
