        "additional_details": "The local NHS is proposing to keep the Watford site in Vicarage Road as the acute hospital. This plan is not sustainable: it cannot meet the health needs of the people of the area. The estate requires \u00a3100m of backlog maintenance and cannot be brought up to modern standards. \r\n\r\nWe need a new hospital that everyone can get to, which surveys have repeatedly shown patients want. The present hospital is in a congested corner of our area, next to the ground of a Premier League football club.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "It must be purpose-built and equipped to modern standards with enough space for parking and future expansion.\r\n\r\nWe are members of the New Hospital Campaign formed to request a new hospital on a central, accessible site between the three main towns - Hemel Hempstead, St. Albans and Watford.  \r\n\r\n",
