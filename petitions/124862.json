        "additional_details": "A recent FOI (Freedom of Information) request to the Treasury regarding Gift Aid was not possible, even by going through official channels (including through my local Member of Parliament). This petition is to open up the Gift Aid Mechanism to greater transparency, ensuring the destination(s) and amount(s) of this effective Government subsidy, is made readily available to the general public, enabling greater scrutiny of these funds and the organisations which receive this funding.\r\n",
        "background": "Gift Aid accounts for over \u00a34 billion a year in government subsidy to\r\nregistered charities in the United Kingdom. This payment is neither\r\ntransparent nor able to be scruitinised by the general public. ",
