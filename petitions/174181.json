        "additional_details": "Palestine is recognised by over 130 countries worldwide. The United Kingdom, a permanent member of the UN Security Council,  should now do so as a major contribution to a two state solution to this conflict. While our Government recognised Israel in 1950, it has still not recognised Palestine \u2013 despite supporting many United Nations resolutions, and European Council conclusions confirming the Palestinian right to self-determination. This is in our National interest and that of the region",
        "background": "Our Government should recognise a state of Palestine now giving practical effect to British Policy of two states, Palestine and Israel, to live side by side in peace and security enabling Palestinians and Israelis to fulfil their right to self-determination, 100 years from the Balfour Declaration",
