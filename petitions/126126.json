        "additional_details": "All political parties should be funded via a mechanism similar to short money which should be shared equally to all political parties that achieve a minimum number of members who agree to follow the Electoral Commission rules. ",
        "background": "It is about time that political lobbying is made both clearer and less open to abuse. Let's fund political parties out of public money only and end the opportunity for political lobbying via donations. Take lobbying by means of political donation out of the equation and there'd be a lot less sleaze.",
