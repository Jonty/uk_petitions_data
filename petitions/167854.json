        "additional_details": "Gambling sites, advertisements, constant emails and the availability of gambling make it increasingly difficult for a compulsive gambler to resist the compulsion to gamble. Many people want to give up, the problem is the temptation, current protection offered by sites is not good enough. I propose a national data base where addicts can register to say they wish to be banned from all sites and casinos, it is then the responsibility of the sites or casinos to check this database to protect users",
        "background": "Gambling addictions are often underestimated in their control over individuals and the devastating impacts on the victim, family and friends. Effects of gambling unfortunately can include lost life savings, pensions, subsequent divorces and homelessness among many others. ",
