        "action": "Ban plastic \"6 pack rings\" and use biodegradable / edible alternatives",
        "additional_details": "\"6 Pack Ring\" refers to the plastic rings used to keep 6 tins or cans of drink together.  As an Island nation we should take the lead to protect our shores and the animals that inhabit them.  A company in the US has developed an edible (to the aquatic life) alternative made using grains from the brewing process.  The rings we use now are photodegradable but can take up to 90 days to break.  Plenty of time to kill a seal, bird, turtle or other marine life that thinks it's something to eat.",
        "background": "Over 100,000 marine animals and 1m sea birds die each year after digesting or getting stuck in plastic \"6 pack rings\".  I would like government to force manufacturers to use environmentally friendly alternatives / edible (for aquatic life) options.",
