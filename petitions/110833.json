        "additional_details": "In 2013/14, 19.1% of children in Year 6 were obese and a further 14.4% were overweight. This is just one year group (10-11 year olds) and a third of these children were overweight or obese.",
        "background": "Child obesity is increasing rapidly, and it seems the government are a little stuck for options that will impact this increase. The most logical way of tackling this issue would be to do more sport, and so making this compulsory in schools is the perfect start. Otherwise what is the purpose of P.E.?",
