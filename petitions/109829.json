        "additional_details": "Both purchases have fallen through due to sellers changing their minds, not sticking to what was verbally agreed to at time of offer, and not taking the buyer into any consideration at all.  \r\nThe second purchase fell through after all the searches and legalities had been done, resulting in her having to pay \u00a3632.00 with nothing to show for it!\r\nWe need to petition for a system which is fair to both sellers and buyers, such as that used in Scotland whereby an offer to purchase is legal and binding",
        "background": "Our daughter - a first time potential home owner - has made offers which have been accepted on two properties, and both have fallen through although finances were in place and legalities completed.  She is currently still 'sofa-surfing'.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
