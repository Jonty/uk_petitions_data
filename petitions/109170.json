        "additional_details": "The Met is considering scrapping all 1,000 Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) working in neighbourhoods in London, the BBC understands.\r\nThe move to axe PCSOs will be discussed at the next Management Board meeting.\r\nThe proposal comes at a time when the force is planning savings of at least \u00a3800m by 2019.\r\nThe Met said all PCSOs who could be affected have been informed. Labour said the move would be the \"nail in the coffin\" for neighbourhood policing.",
        "background": "The Met police are considering cutting 1000 PCSOs which will have a devastating effect on Neighbourhood Policing across all London Boroughs. NHW and the Ward panels have spent years creating a successful working relationship with these officers and this will basically bring it to it's knees.",
