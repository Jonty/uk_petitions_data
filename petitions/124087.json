        "additional_details": "the county of Tyne and Wear has virtually no relevance. Therefore, the districts of Newcastle and North Tyneside could be absorbed back into the borders of Northumberland and still keep their unitary authority status. The historical importance of Northumberland is extremely important to the people of Newcastle and North Tyneside. it is time to restore Northumbrian identity. ",
        "background": "Newcastle and North Tyneside used to belong to the historic county of Northumberland. the Local Government Act 1972 created the existence of the Metropolitan county of Tyne & Wear. Tyne and Wear County Council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts are now unitary authorities (self governed).",
