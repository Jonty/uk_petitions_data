        "additional_details": "Just 78 per cent of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) trains arrived at their destination on time during the second quarter of 2016, significantly worse than every other operator.\r\n\r\nThe terrible service is creating mayhem for customers, it is a nightmare. Causing undue stress for people that are relying on a train service to get to work or get home. Often missing valuable time with their children.\r\n\r\nAt the same time David Brown CEO has taken home a \u00a32.2m package.\r\n",
        "background": "The company, which runs Southern services has been embroiled in an industrial dispute with the RMT. There have been a series of unofficial and official industrial actions. A very high number of conductors are calling in sick which is contributing to significant delays and cancellations.\r\n",
