        "additional_details": "The public are understandably discouraged with the current formulation of the Common Agricultural Policy. They don\u2019t want to see their taxes being used to line the pockets of already wealthy landowners, or to prop up failing farming industries unconditionally.\r\n\r\nThe public wants to see a domestic agricultural policy that is ahead of the curve by leading us on the path towards a low-carbon farming future, where our agricultural system provides significant benefits to the environment.",
        "background": "The government should redirect subsidies in a post-Brexit domestic agricultural policy, away from environmentally damaging farming, and towards environmental protections. \r\n\r\nSubsidies are needed to support farmers who tackle climate change, mitigate floods, increase biodiversity and soil health.",
