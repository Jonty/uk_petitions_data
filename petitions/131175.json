        "action": "Create a separate loan that caters for accommodation for university students",
        "additional_details": "With an extra loan that caters for accommodation students will not have debt on their shoulders as soon as they start university, and can start focusing on more important things like the education itself. If grants are scrapped, at least bring something new and realistic to the table? This way less students will be tied between going to university or not because of the expenses, and will have easier access to a higher education letting students from 'low income families' have a better chance. ",
        "background": "Many student loans barely cover the cost of accommodation, so how will students from low income families go to the university of their choice when accommodation is more than the loan they are entitled to? This leaves many students in a deficit before they've even paid for anything.",
