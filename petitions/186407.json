        "additional_details": "As a minimum, signs of adequate font size to be readable from a passing vehicle should be provided along affected sections of road, showing what is proposed (e.g. 'Proposed 20mph Speed Limit'), with a telephone number and/or website address where further details can be obtained and objections made. The road network performs a vital function for the whole of society, so it is essential that a balance is struck between the desires of residents and the needs of the wider community.",
        "background": "Existing requirements to consult on proposals for traffic calming, lower speed limits, waiting restrictions, etc are inadequate to ensure that everyone affected by them is made aware. People who use the roads but do not live in the area often do not know what is planned until it is too late.",
