            "details": "The process for leaving the EU and determining our future relationship will be a complex one, so the Government must take the time to think carefully through our objectives and approach.  We want to ensure the best possible outcome for Britain and the future UK-EU relationship. The Prime Minister has been clear that we would not trigger Article 50 until we have a UK-wide approach and objectives for these negotiations. \r\n\r\nUntil we leave the EU, EU citizens and their family members coming to and living in the UK continue to be subject to the rights and responsibilities set down in EU law on free movement. The same situation applies to UK citizens travelling, working and living in other EU Member States. \r\n\r\nThe issue of free movement of people and its place in the future UK-EU relationship will be considered as part of the Government\u2019s preparation of its negotiating position.  The Prime Minister has said that in negotiating the deal, we need to ensure that we listen to what people have said about the need for controls on free movement, and that we also negotiate the right and best deal for trade in goods and services for the British people.\r\n\r\nA new Department for Exiting the EU has been created with responsibility for overseeing preparations for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU and conducting these withdrawal negotiations in support of the Prime Minister.  It will also lead work to establish the future relationship between the EU and the UK.  In doing this it will work very closely with the UK\u2019s Devolved Administrations, the UK Parliament, and a wide range of other interested parties on what the approach to those negotiations should be.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
            "summary": "The Government will set out its negotiating position in due course, including on issues such as free movement, as we prepare to commence the formal process of exiting the European Union. ",
