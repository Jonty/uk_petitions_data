        "additional_details": "The idea for it came from author Jilly Cooper and some of her friends, a group of influential personalities in their own right, who in 1996 started the 'Animals in War' Memorial Fund with Anne, HRH The Princess Royal, as patron. Jilly herself donated to the fund all the royalties from her successful book Animals at War.  After a long and challenging nationwide fundraising operation the memorial was completed, it took 8 years.\r\n\r\nNot many people are aware this monument exists.\r\nHelp us please.",
        "background": "Over the years there have been many pets that became War Animals who served and died for many different countries and yet there isn't a single DAY that commemorates ANY of them; War Animals Or Our Treasured Pets.  \r\nHelp us to gain momentum - and give the animals what they deserve.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
