        "additional_details": "On their website the Labour party clearly states that as a member you can vote in leadership elections. Nowhere does it mention that you will have to wait 6 months to vote. The \u00a325 fee for members who joined after the 12th of January, is discrimination against the poor and is pricing them out of democracy. Hundreds and thousands of Labour members who signed up for Jeremy Corbyn will miss out on the all important leadership vote. This is immoral and should not be allowed. ",
        "background": "If you have signed up to the Labour party after the 12th of January 2016, you will have to pay \u00a325 to vote. This is not right and is not the rules people signed up to. Please read additional details for more information on this petition. ",
