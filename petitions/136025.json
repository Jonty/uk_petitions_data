        "additional_details": "The closed circuit part of the test that ensures riding at 50 KMH is totally irrelevant. We wish to see a structured sensible test similar to the previous test that provided safe training and restricted access to powerful bikes for a short period as we believe this was the most successful version of motorcycle testing. We believe that structured training is preferable to complicated legislation as a way to reduce accidents.",
        "background": "Since the implementation of directive 2006/126/EEC the UK motorcycle test has become unnecessarily complicated and prohibitively expensive. ",
