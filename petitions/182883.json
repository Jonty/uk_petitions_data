        "additional_details": "Workers in Asos, Boohoo warehouses work 12 hour shifts with just half hour paid break, are set unrealistic hourly picking targets, are constantly monitored like lab rats by having to wear arm monitors, are forced to work overtime and if they refuse are fired and are dismissed from employment if they have a family emergency and can't arrive at work one day. These are medieval working conditions and companies should not be allowed to treat workers as such. It is the UK Goverment duty to stop this.",
        "background": "I am appalled by the findings of the Dispatches report 'Britain's Cheap Clothes' aired on Chanel 4 on the 30/01/2017. I am asking the UK Government to stop companies impose such inhumane working conditions on workers and fine those retailers that don't comply. ",
