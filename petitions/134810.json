        "additional_details": "Nicola Sturgeon said it was \"democratically unacceptable\" that Scotland faced the prospect of being taken out of the EU against its will. She said the Scottish government would begin preparing legislation to enable another independence vote.\r\n\r\nThe overnight fall in the pound caused the UK fall below France in the ranking of wealthy nations. The removal of Scotland from the UK will result in a further 8% reduction in economic size, power and influence, and natural resources.",
        "background": "The Leave vote on 23rd June 2016 will trigger a second Independence referendum in Scotland as an inevitable consequence of EU exit.\r\n\r\nThe power and influence of the remainder of the UK will be greatly diminished. It will lose its place as 5th richest country in the world and become a minor nation.",
