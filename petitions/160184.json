        "additional_details": "Central to the Care Act 2014 is wellbeing. At the heart of the principle of wellbeing is \u2018control over day- to-day life, including over care and support and the way it is provided.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis is because choice and control is fundamental to the core purpose of adult care and support which the Care Act guidance sees as being to \u2018help people to achieve the outcomes that matter to them in their life.\u2019 \r\n\r\nCurrent practice is not recognising the legialation introduced to protect vulnerable people.",
        "background": "In an attempt to reduce cost councils (LA's) are removing the right of choice from those who receive care and support. By appointing one provider forcing people to accept the care provider offered rather than the one better placed to support them.",
