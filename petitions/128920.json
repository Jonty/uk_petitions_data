        "additional_details": "His Magazine adds:\r\n\r\n'...it is no excuse...even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident. \r\n\r\nIt is clear his Judgement is questionable and he should no longer be in Public Office despite his apology.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "With the Jury reaching the verdict that 96 Liverpool Fans were  'unlawfully killed' at Hillsborough, Boris Johnson et al, said when he was Editor of the Spectator Magazine that Liverudlians:\r\n\r\n'see themselves...as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it\"\r\n ",
