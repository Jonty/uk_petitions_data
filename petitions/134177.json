        "additional_details": "In the recent referendum, 58% of all OAP voters stated that they wanted to leave the EU. This decision will have less effect on them as it will to young people. This is wrong as leaving effects our future, education and  job prospects. I feel that there should be a second referendum in which 16 and 17-year-olds are able to make their opinion heard. Young people will be able to do this responsibly. This was proven in the Scottish referendum in which the voting age was reduced to 16. They cast their vote and thus their opinion responsibly.",
        "background": "The most recent referendum that took place in our country, the result was to leave. This doesn't represent the views of the younger generation (16-17-year-olds). I feel that we should be given a chance to express our views as this decision will affect us as much as it will everyone else.",
