        "additional_details": "Delaying procedures means prolonged distress and discomfort for patients.\r\n\r\nFrustration at the intransigence of a system which seems to place more emphasis on 'protocol' and pecking order than on patient care.\r\n\r\nAnother referral means another fee for the hospital so less money in the pot to pay for other treatments",
        "background": "If a consultant investigates and determines a procedure is needed, it is an enormous waste to send the patient back to the GP to be referred in to the same hospital. Where another consultant decides (for his own ego?) to investigate all over again. Just more fees for the NHS to pay and time wasted.",
