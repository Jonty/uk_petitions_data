        "action": "Enforce use of stun guns in halal slaughterhouses.",
        "additional_details": "There a number of sickening videos online of animals dying horrific deaths in halal slaughterhouses..i strongly reccommend you view these to understand fully the emergence of this petition.\r\nThere are also articles written by top muslim scholars who agree that stunning the animal does not go against the rules in the Qu'ran. To kill an animal with a blow to the head is forbidden, but to stun them with stungun (which is placed on the head) is permitted.\r\n The animal is still alive and the blood will still pump out as is necessary for halal meat.",
        "background": "We are a nation of animal lovers..yet we allow animals to endure horrific, painful deaths on our soil. \r\nThe animals in halal slaughter houses who do not use stunguns, flail and scream in pain for up to 5 minutes before they die. THIS IS NOT NECESSARY FOR HALAL.",
