        "additional_details": "Crohns and colitis were removed from the eligibility criteria a couple of years ago. As many patients can walk over 50m, they are not deemed eligible. Soiling yourself or suffering from burst/leaking ostomy bags is embarrassing and demeaning and can be avoided by using facilities quickly. ",
        "background": "Over 260,000 people in the UK suffer from the \"invisible\" disabilities that are Crohns and Colitis.Having to locate and use a toilet quickly is often more difficult than it sounds.Toilet dependancy and urgency are a way of life which can be helped by being able to park close to facilities.",
