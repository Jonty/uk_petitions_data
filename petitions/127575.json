        "action": "Stop further public funds being used to set out the case for remaining in the EU",
        "additional_details": "The Electoral commission has put a spending limit of \u00a37 million for each of the designated Lead campaign groups (Remain or Leave) in the EU referendum. This has been designed to make the case fair for both sides. By Spending \u00a39.2 million the Government have clearly shown bias using Tax Payers funds. We, the petitioners, request the Government to prevent future tax payer funds, from any source, UK or EU, being used to make the case for the UK remaining in the EU.",
        "background": "The recent distribution of literature at a cost of over \u00a39 Million, making the case for the UK to remain in the EU, undermines the Electoral Commissions objectives of the Referendum and demonstrates a lack of integrity by the Government. We believe voters deserve a fair referendum ",
