        "additional_details": "We as the crew stood down are not only concerned due to recent life saving rescues during the summer and throughout the year but as citizens living in the densely populated busy area visited by many unaware of the changing conditions of the River Mersey. We urge the RNLI to act now to reinstate the 12 crew and reopen New Brighton Lifeboat Station immediately. All 12 crew/helms are capable of continuing immediately. RNLI state they will begin training new staff soon. Station will remain closed. ",
        "background": "On 21st July 2016 the RNLI took the drastic action of standing down (effectively sacking) 12 of the crew of New Brighton Lifeboat Station forcing it to close. This was just as the schools were closing for the summer and New Brighton would be at its busiest. Potentially putting lives at risk.",
