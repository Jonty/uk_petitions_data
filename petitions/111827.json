        "action": "Make the 2010 Equality Act more easily enforceable.",
        "additional_details": "People often need to resort to tribunals and ultimately (expensive and exhausting) Judicial Reviews. This is often an impossibility for those who are in any way vulnerable. The Equality Act should take legal precedence over outdated laws which it contravenes. A Government-led media campaign is essential. Whilst this might sound expensive the economic cost of not enforcing the Act is huge. Not enforcing the Act is unjust, affects employment, drains the NHS and is a moral and social catastrophe.",
        "background": "Since the Equality Act was passed little has changed. Those affected have few easily accessible options in law to get their rights enforced. The Government needs to make the Equality Act easy to enforce for vulnerable and disadvantaged people, by means other than tribunals and judicial reviews.\r\n\r\n",
