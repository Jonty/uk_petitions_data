        "action": "Stronger punishment for mothers who stop fathers seeing their children.",
        "additional_details": "Implement stricter rules and punishments for mothers who feel this is acceptable. Social services should be involved as this could be seen as not meeting your childrens emotional needs. Court orders should be strongly enforced if they are disregarded by EITHER parent. The system has been unfair and one sided for long enough now and fathers that pose no danger to their children should be able to play an active roll in their lives. I start this petition as a mother, for fathers that are being punished by women that feel children are theirs and theirs only. http://www.lawgazette.co.uk/news/family-courts-have-lost-authority-warns-judge/58240.fullarticle",
        "background": "To grow up as a well rounded human being children must have BOTH parents involved in their lives. Unfortunately for many men this is not the reality and they often have to fight through courts. Some often giving up as this can become expensive and at times seem very one sided and never ending. ",
