        "action": "Stop basing student loans on parental income.",
        "additional_details": "As tuition fees increase at an unrealistic and exponential level, student are expected to repay money that realistically is unaffordable. Not only this, but loans and bursaries are based on parental income as they expect your parents to be able to pay ridiculous amounts towards your education. It is not their degree so why should they have to pay! Why is it based on their income? It's a heavy penalty to pay penalising larger families, people with twins, self employed parents and so on. ",
        "background": "When applying for university, any loans or grants that are received are based on parental income, penalising families who of a moderate or higher income. It is not fair on families that have twins or families that have parents who are self employed as 50% of that money goes back in the business!",
