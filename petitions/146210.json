        "additional_details": "During the run up to the Referendum there were different views on future policies and promises made from the Leave campaign, but many unanswered questions remain. For example, financial priorities, distribution of previous EU subsidies, our relationship with Europe, immigration policies, Scottish independence and, the relationship between NI & The Irish Republic, Gibraltar & Spain, market access for the City of London, Cornish fishing rights and free trade etc.",
        "background": "The Leave campaign groups gave different views & promises for a post-EU UK. Mr Cameron is resigning as PM earlier than anticipated; the Conservatives did not fight the 2015 election intending to leave the EU. In short, the next Conservative PM will not have a people's mandate to govern.",
