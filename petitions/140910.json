        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to ensure our voices aren't recorded over in parliament and that what we originally voted still counts. There are no excuses for dismissing a majority, and to petition the results of the vote is insulting to all Brexit voters; our voice was the loudest and our voice matters too! Let democracy stand! We are part of this country and our vote should stand; regardless of opposition. ",
        "background": "After the referendum, the majority of Great Britain decided Brexit was the right option for the country. Now unaccepting Pro-Remainers are making a laughing stock of democracy and implying that 17 million people's voices mean nothing by trying to overturn the decision. This is wrong!",
