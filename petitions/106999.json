        "additional_details": "I ask for those who are willing and able, to show the government that we want to help house Syrian refugees. We need a system, similar to the one set up by German volunteers 'Refugees Welcome', that enables willing volunteers to offer temporary/long term shelter to the most vulnerable of asylum seekers, whilst our Government gets its act together on resettling these families.\r\n\r\nGermany & Iceland are looking to take in 10,000 survivors each of the Syrian war. What is Britain doing other than aid?",
        "background": "The people fleeing Syria need shelter and refuge. The victims in Syria are dying from war, not starvation. This is not a migration issue. It is a humanitarian issue and with 6.5 million Syrian's displaced, asylum is the key. The British public can help. Aid is not enough any more.\r\n",
