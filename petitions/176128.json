        "action": "Regulate to ensure all rental properties are toxic mould and fungus free",
        "additional_details": "It sounds bizarre but nobody is regulating this. I'm not talking about a bit of condensation, I'm talking about when the building you live in is rotten. I'm talking about the landlords that paint over various toxic mould and damp problems to move a new tenant in so months later a jungle of danger grows back through, all the while a network of fungus roots start to form beneath the floor and then you have mushrooms sprouting. Tough regulation and penalties are needed to stop estate agents, landlords, freeholders, from making us ill.",
        "background": "Many of us are living in rented accommodation unfit for habitation. Toxic mould and fungus are lethal and nobody should be in that environment. I believe it is a breach of our human rights and breaks rules set out in our tenancy agreements, yet we are helpless and move from one place to the next.",
