        "action": "Set up an independent system to publicly check MPs' honesty by rigorous testing.",
        "additional_details": "Testing should be first blanket, across both Houses, then randomly & at need. Public should be able to petition for testing as for the recall of an MP.  \r\nQualified teams combining available methods (polygraph 'lie detector', micro-expressions, forensics) should inquire about crimes; blackmail; bribes; lying; withholding truth; loyalty to covert networks (e.g. Masons).\r\nAll results for each official should be published promptly & be held in perpetuity, readily available as a public record.\r\n",
        "background": "Multiple known cases of misdeeds in high office, widespread allegations of gross crimes & cover-ups, and the resulting public distrust of politicians, mean radical measures are now necessary - to uncover offenders, clear the innocent of undue suspicion, and so re-establish confidence in government.",
