        "additional_details": "Everybody has heard of fracking but not many understand it. It's a process of drilling deep into the ground then forcing fluid at high pressure into the ground to fracture the rocks to release the gases. The problem is where the fluid goes cannot be controlled as it will always take the easiest escape route, and that's upwards because the ground is always softer nearer the top. Contamination of our water table is a huge risk and it will effect all of us. We can't take drinking water for granted?",
        "background": "Fracking for shale gas is banned in many countries due to environment and health risks to humans. The long term effects cannot be undone so we need to stop it before it happens. Our health and our children's health is more important than money.",
