I feel we have to act now to make sure we minimize any influence this will have on all people and vulnerable persons now and for all of our future generations. These programs and software are vital tools for the people to use to influence the vulnerable and easily susceptible to influence. We must come together now and get these stopped before the material has influence more people and children. Please help me to minimize this.",
