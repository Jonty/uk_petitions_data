        "additional_details": "At the recent EU summit in Malta, Angela Merkel said that \"there will be a multi-speed EU, and not all members will participate in the same steps of integration\u201d  \r\nThe proclamation raises the prospect of states \u201ccherry-picking\u201d their relationship with Brussels \u2014 the very concept Merkel resisted when David Cameron was trying to negotiate a new deal for Britain last year.\r\nThe circumstances have therefore changed sufficiently to justify a second referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EU.",
        "background": "The Scottish referendum was supposed to be a 'once in a generation' event, but Brexit has changed the circumstances and justifies a second poll.  In the same way, the EU has now made concessions that have changed the circumstances and justify a second referendum for the UK to remain in the EU.",
