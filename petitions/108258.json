        "additional_details": "Not only are animals hunted but they are mistreated in industry. For example, intensive farming leads to animals being inhumanely treated and forced into cramp places. Furthermore, in China, there are festivals which celebrate dogs being butchered and eaten. Dogs are also stolen from people for the festival. This is inhumane and unfair to animals which shouldn't be treated so poorly. ",
        "background": "Around the world, domestic and wild animals alike are being mistreated as they are hunted and abused for personal gain. For example, in some areas animals such as Rhinos and elephants are hunted for Ivory and their tusks. This leads to suffering and the death of many animals, which is not right!",
