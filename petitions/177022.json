Hospitals are paying the price of chronic government underfunding of Primary Care and Community Care, and to financially penalise hospitals for flawed government policy is clearly absurd.",

With unprecedented pressure on Emergency Departments currently this is an absurd system of punishing hospitals for being busy. ",
