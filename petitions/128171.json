        "additional_details": "If a flat or house isn't in a purpose built retirement complex the age limit should be removed. The housing crisis is now worse than ever and simple changes like this can help to free up more spaces for younger people to live. They need homes near jobs to be able to input economically. A simple change which could drastically improve our economic and social futures.",
        "background": "Many normal flats and homes in the expensive areas around London are only open to buyers aged 60+ Having homes costing \u00a3280,000 and under limited to this age group means first time buyers can't buy a home near the capital and that's where many jobs are based.",
