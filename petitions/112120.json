        "additional_details": "A law must be passed to ensure that the UK's youth juvenile system operates according to international rules and standards on children's rights.\r\n\r\nDetention centre staff must be trained to work with children and hold a relevant degree.  \r\n\r\nYouth justice system institutions must be reduced in size to ensure personal and effective mentoring and care. \r\n\r\nChildren who are detained must be placed in institutions as close as possible to their families. \r\n\r\nChildren must be treated as children not inmates.\r\n",
        "background": "A scheme in Spain called Diagrama is revolutionising the way young people are treated in prison. It is cheaper than our current system, and is successfully reintegrating youth offenders. It also has a zero percent suicide rate. \r\n\r\nSuicides in custody and youth reoffending in the UK remain high.",
