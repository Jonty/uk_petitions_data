        "action": "Make sexual harassment punishable with a fine or prison sentence.",
        "additional_details": "Sexual harassment can range from anything from \"cat calling\" and \"wolf whistling\" to inappropriate physical contact and unwanted sexual advances. So many women nowadays feel as though they are unable to report it but it has profound psychological and social effects on women every day. It continues to objectify women even to this day. Due to the little reports our national figures are majorly unrepresentative of the life women live daily. Enough is enough. Stand with the 2010 Equality Act.",
        "background": "Currently within the UK, at least 90% of women have experienced some form of sexual harassment before the age of 17. Sexual harassment is not has emotionally damaging affects but it continually exacerbates the ideal that men have power over women and impedes women's societal right to be equal to men",
