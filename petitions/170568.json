        "action": "Make the Work Capability Assessment illnesss specific",
        "additional_details": "Examples of the assessments carried out for all claimants, regardless of their condition, be it mental or physical include: reaching, standing and sitting, absence or loss of control of the bowel, consciousness during waking moments and picking up or moving and transferring. This is part of a long list of many assessments which do not relate to mental illness. This has meant that people with mental health problems, signed off work by a doctor and or psychiatrist are often declared fit for work, resulting in a decline in their health and often suicide. We ask that the assessments are specific to the disability of the claimant in order to obtain a fair assessment of that individual's disability. \r\n",
        "background": "The Work Capability Assessments for the past five years have been heavily directed towards physical disability which is irrelevant to those suffering from mental illnesses. This makes it almost impossible for anybody with a mental illness to be assessed accordingly. ",
