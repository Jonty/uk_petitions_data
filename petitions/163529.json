        "additional_details": "'A conservative estimate puts the number of paper cups handed out by coffee shops in the UK at 3bn, more than 8m a day. Yet, supposedly, fewer than one in 400 is being recycled'.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Government actively works with major coffee chains and retailers to explore the use of environmentally friendly coffee cups. As part of this, non-recyclable cups should be banned or a tax placed on them to encourage the use of 'cups for life' and bringing in a national awareness of the problem.",
        "background": "In the UK over 2.5 billion take-away coffee cups are placed in landfill every year. The public are wrongly led to believe that these cups are actually recyclable (i.e. through environment friendly logos on the packaging). This is a major issue resulting in huge amounts of waste",
