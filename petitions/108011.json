        "action": "To hold an urgent review into the system of benefit sanctions.",
        "additional_details": "The DWP's own literature admits that sanctions are likely to lead to a \"deterioation in health\" during the first 2 weeks of a sanction. If a person were to starve their dog for 2 weeks as a punishment they would be arrested for cruelty and neglect but the DWP can put a person in exactly that situation. Being able to feed your family is a human right, to deny them that right as a \"deterrent\" is wrong and inhuman. An urgent review of this system is needed and should be stopped while it is reviewed",
        "background": "Many of those who have had their benefits sanctioned (stopped) have  had to use a Foodbank as they cannot afford to feed their family. They have their benefits stopped for between 2 weeks and 3 years as an immediate punishment for often minor reasons such as being 10 mins late for an appointment.",
