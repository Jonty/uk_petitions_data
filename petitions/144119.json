The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. \r\n\r\nThe concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to backbench MPs."
