        "additional_details": "Tattoos, body piercings and diverse hair colours are an act of freedom and self expression in a linear society that wants us to conform to physical norm. They do not affect the level of service we provide to our work sectors and every individual should be able to physically express themselves however they want no matter what job they do. It should be law as part of the anti-discrimination act to be accepting towards those with any tattoos on the body, any hair colour and any piercings. ",
