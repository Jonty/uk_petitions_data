        "action": "Call for a second EU referendum due to misleading campaign lies in the first.",
        "additional_details": "An independent body should regulate campaign information (as in commerce, where lies are justifiably banned). Democracy can't exist if voters can't judge the options, & as campaigns may be biased their protest to lies is inadequate. Additional reasons for a 2nd, honest referendum are: no mandate for Brexit's form; nearly half-in-half results; possible UK break-up; many years of negotiation likely; renegotiation of all current world trade deals; less EU trade access; & EU rules we have no say in.",
        "background": "Lies made informed choices less likely. Unlike exaggeration & forecasts (where some variability may be inherent) lies have no factual basis. Among many, 2 prominent were: \u00a3350 million/wk paid to EU \u2013 to go to the NHS; & Turkey on the cusp of EU admission. Genuine & thorough campaign info was scarce.",
