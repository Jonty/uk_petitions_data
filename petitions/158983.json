        "additional_details": "Debate around Brexit has highlighted that people across the UK and Europe feel there is a lack of democratic accountability within the EU's legislative framework. \r\n\r\nPrinciples like freedom of movement have thus been imposed without democratic mandate or account being taken of economic and cultural differences across the EU's member states. \r\n\r\nIf the EU is to succeed, its core principle must be that Europe and its sovereign states are governed according to the democratic wishes of its peoples. ",
        "background": "Given that both the Leave and Remain campaigns have put forward reasoned arguments, we the undersigned call upon HM Government to seek a third path forward, ensuring that the UK remains an integral part of a Europe that has democratic accountability at all its levels. ",
