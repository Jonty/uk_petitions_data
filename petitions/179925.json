Everyone is targeting Trump as he conducts his office but he is just the messenger and that is not fair. \r\n\r\nWe reject Globalisation and support stricter immigration controls just as does the USA. Therefore we do not seek to alienate relations with the USA and welcome Donald Trump and the USA with open arms. ",
