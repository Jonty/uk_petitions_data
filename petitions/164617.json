        "action": "Make 24 hour automated external defibrillators (AED) compulsory in local areas",
        "additional_details": "Each year in the UK there are over 30,000 cardiac arrests in homes and communities. Death occurs within minutes of the heart stopping. On average it takes 8 minutes for the ambulance to reach a life-threatening situation, meaning action needs to be taken within that time period. \r\nSome areas have AEDs available but at restricted use as they are within establishments with opening hours. AEDs are straight forward to use and should therefore be publicly and easily accessible. \r\n",
        "background": "An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a portable electronic device that allows the heart to reestablish an effective rhythm in the event of cardiac arrest. \r\nIt should be compulsory for there to be defibrillators readily available on a 24 hour basis, seven days of the week - this saves lives.",
