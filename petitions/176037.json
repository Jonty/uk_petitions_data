        "action": "Raise the minimum wage for Under 25's to \u00a37.50 in line with all other workers.",
        "additional_details": "It's near impossible to live a decent quality of life on earnings around the minimum wage; So why for under 25's who work in the same roles as adults can be paid \u00a33.45p/h less an hour despite being potentially better educated more capable than their adult counterparts. Many under 25's work their jobs to help low-income parents provide necessities and I feel this discriminatory legislation therefore unfairly targets the young people of low-income backgrounds who are just about managing to cover the costs of running a household...\r\n\r\nI therefore petition the government for pay equity for under 25's.",
        "background": "Young people can be paid considerably less for work than an adult, in the same role at the same company; U18's can be paid as little as \u00a34.05 per hour & U21 \u00a35.60; This pay gap is discriminatory legislation, which says YP are worth less than older citizens (Regardless of ability to perform the job.)",
