        "action": "Make primary/high schools stagger half terms making family holidays affordable",
        "additional_details": "I come from a modest hard working family who gave me and my sister a holiday every year usually with extended family. These are precious memories and are experiences that have contributed towards making me the hard working single mother I am today. I work hard and save to take my children to see different places in the world, my son is 9yrs old he is now keen to go on to study geography. His dream is to visit every continent before he is 21. I would like to help him with this dream but it is difficult without getting myself into debt, incurring fines and/or the stigma that is forced upon parents like me because of the current regulations.",
        "background": "I believe that family holidays should be a given right for every child, childhood memories that are achievable for every family regardless of age, race or social status. If schools were to stagger the half term holidays this would give families flexibility to enable them to book affordable holidays",
