        "additional_details": "I have seen many animals being posted for sale on the internet, then being resold for more money, by unsavoury types.  I am a member of many rescue groups who will back me on this.  They go out their way to try & get these animals to save them from falling into bad hands.  There is no way of regulating the sale of these poor animals.  The best way is to put a stop to it altogether.  The animal rescue centres are full to bursting, due to bad breeders.  A good breeder will only have pups if asked.",
        "background": "This is also an opportunity for unsavoury types, that should not own animals at all.  Sadly in this day & age of dog fighting, it is open doors for poor dogs being sourced as bait dogs.  ",
