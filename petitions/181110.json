        "action": "Make it law for all animal care workers to be animal first aid trained.",
        "additional_details": "With this petition, we ask that it become law that ALL animal care workers have pet first aid training. As with all work places that legally must have human first aid qualified staff, we recommend that all animal-based businesses also have the same controls and measures in place that ensure staff are animal first aid trained.\r\nFurther, that animal care workers commit to undertake and continue with CPD, throughout their careers, to ensure that they have up-to-date animal first aid qualifications.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently, in the UK, it is not a legal requirement for animal care workers e.g. groomers, pet sitters, dog walkers, animal trainers and animal boarding, to have any animal first aid training. Through this petition we want pets to have the best care possible and ensure their welfare is paramount.",
