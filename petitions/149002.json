        "additional_details": "During the recent European Referendum leaflets were delivered to every household containing wildly misleading statements, intended to deliberately sway voters based on inaccuracy. Statements were set out as 'facts' which were by their nature intended to misrepresent key information. This would not be permitted for the advertising of something as basic as a deodorant and should not be allowed for decisions which can affect the future of our whole country. ",
        "background": "Political leaflets should be subjected to at least the same standard and process as commercial advertising. There should be an equivalent code to the  Advertising Codes to prevent the statements made being 'misleading, harmful or offensive'.",
