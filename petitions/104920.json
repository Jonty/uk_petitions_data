        "additional_details": "Yet another life is lost due to a drunken driver. On 15 June 2015 Melanie Miles was only 42 when she was killed, in Bristol, by a van driver over the drink limit and in possession of drugs. He was jailed for the offence but only for 6 years. \r\nIf he had not been drinking it is highly unlikely he would have jumped a red light and hit Melanie on her 125cc (small) motorcycle.\r\nSo many cases of death through drunken driving could be avoided if we followed the example of Norway.",
        "background": "The petition wants the law to be very clear - if you drive you DON'T drink or take drugs of ANY amount.\r\nTo drive after drinking or taking drugs is a selfish and inconsiderate action which shows no regard at all for any other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
