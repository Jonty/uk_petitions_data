        "action": "Ban all LGVs from UK roads at weekend in line with other EU countries.",
        "additional_details": "UK employers need to utilise its LGVs and drivers more on night shifts which will be more UK road friendly and cost effective whilst boosting weekend leisure businesses, employment, safety standards while improving driver fatigue, as UK LGV drivers who, although work to EU Driving Laws, still work the longest shifts in Europe. Some drivers still do a 70+ hour week here in the UK by bending rules on EU drivers hours by using '' Periods of Availability'' which do not count to drivers hours rules. ",
        "background": "UK suffers with a growing trend of congestion on its roads at weekends where EU vehicles are adding to this congestion as they take advantage of unfair competition as most EU countries legislate against this. UK companies cannot compete. UK companies cannot move through the EU countries at weekends.",
