        "additional_details": "These toilets are not like the ones we have at home with the sink, bin toilet in one room behind a closed door. There is a gap at the bottom and the top, there is no privacy. \r\n\r\nBoth genders will be going through hormonal & bodily changes. Some girls start their menstrual cycle early. Will they not be embarrassed to use a shared toilet \r\n\r\nBoth girls & boys have the right to explore their bodies in their own privacy amongst the same gender. The unisex toilets restrict this development which is sad.",
        "background": "In my child's school the toilets have become unisex. The school gave parents and children no notice prior to this happening. My child was shocked when a boy walked into the toilet. The girls in the school do not like it and some boys and girls have stopped using the toilet. This is a health concern.",
