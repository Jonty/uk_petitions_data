        "additional_details": "One of the problems with CKD is that the Kidneys are unable to regulate the level of Potassium in the blood.\r\nHigh potassium can cause paralysis and heart problems, your heartbeat can become irregular and you can have heart failure. If left untreated, high potassium levels can even cause your heart to stop.\r\nThe easiest way to regulate potassium in the blood is through diet, but at the moment food in the UK does not contain information about Potassium levels so it is very difficult to do this.\r\n\r\n",
