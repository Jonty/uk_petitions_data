The police should be given the right to form unions, they should be paid correctly for the work they do and they should have a stable pension to retire to. We also need stricter rules on private security firms. We need as a society to reform the bond we once had with the police and make this country a safer place for all! #LOVETHEPOLICE",

To be paid not nearly enough for the amount they are made to work? I don\u2019t think so! So how have the government responded to this? MORE CUTS!",
