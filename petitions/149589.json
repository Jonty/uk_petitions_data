        "action": "A second referendum if UK job losses exceed 12,000 after initiating Article 50.",
        "additional_details": "If corporations announce expected job cuts that they will implement if the Article 50 process is initiated, then there will be some threshold over which the electorate and politicians on either side of the debate should be allowed to reconsider their referendum position. Announcements of UK job losses on Friday 24th June already include JP Morgan (4,000), HSBC and Morgan Stanley with the first already matching Port Talbot. A second referendum can help the United Kingdom avoid such job losses.",
        "background": "The referendum campaigns were based on projections that were largely distrusted. A \"pain threshold\" of 12,000 job losses would be the equivalent of three \"Port Talbot Steelworks\", the latter creating considerable public out-cry when the potential 4000 job losses were announced in March 2016.",
