        "additional_details": "According to Keelly Abbott, \u201cLesbian, gay and bisexual students could be left vulnerable here with a lack of any sex education that is relevant to them.\u201d, which is often the case. Without the attention to homosexual relationships and gender identity, homophobia and transphobia is prevalent in schools. 50% of trans people, in a study provided by Huffington post, said that they'd experienced transphobic bullying, and 69.1% of LGBT members experiencing homophobia and biphobia.\r\n ",
        "background": "Sexual education often only talks about heterosexual sex and relationships, which often leaves LGBT people feel left out as they cannot relate to the things they're being taught. By including information about sexual/gender identity, this would help people to understand them and not bully them.",
