        "action": "Make coloured (unnatural) hair and all piercings allowed in all schools",
        "additional_details": "It is unfair that students cannot have coloured hair and more than one piercing in each ear. In almost all cases, they get in trouble and/or suspended because it's distracting. Yet, what is more distracting? Having coloured hair and a few ear piercings? Or getting suspended from school and not receiving an education? Hair and piercings are a form of expression and creativity. School should be a place where students can freely express their personality, not forced to become someone else.",
        "background": "In most schools, unnatural hair colours and more than one piercing in each ear is not allowed because it's 'distracting'. However, its not. Students already cannot express themselves through clothing (uniform), so things like hair and piercings are the only thing left, and even that is not allowed.",
