        "additional_details": "We, the British people, must know what we are voting for on 23rd June.\r\n\r\nWhat does a vote to \"Remain\" mean if MEPs can reverse such a fundamental tenet of our reasons for staying? There must be a binding vote with a clear outcome.\r\n\r\nFor Cameron's \"emergency brake\" to come into force, the European Parliament must vote to modify the EU directive on free movement.\r\n\r\nThe British Government must request to put its renegotiation to the test in the European Parliament before we go to the ballot box.\r\n",
        "background": "The European Parliament will not vote on Cameron\u2019s renegotiation of our EU membership until after we vote in the referendum.\r\n\r\nThe European Parliament Vice President said many MEPs will resist it, and it is no more binding than a deal \u2018hammered out down the local bazaar'.\r\n\r\n",
