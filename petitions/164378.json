        "additional_details": "As Agriculture received the largest amount back from the money spent on EU membership, the government must pledge that the higher percentage of the money saved from not being in the EU will be spent on agriculture. \r\n\r\nEvery 4 years the public should then have a democratic say on where the remaining percentage should be spent, through official voting on a ballot, with boxes asking if the money should be spent; either: completely on the NHS, on public services, or education. This must be honoured.",
        "background": "After the EU Referendum held on June 23rd 2016, the public made a democratic decision not to spend \u00a3350 million a week on the EU. \r\n\r\nAs the public made the democratic decision not to spend it on the EU, the public should now democratically decide what \u00a3350 million per week should then be spent on.",
