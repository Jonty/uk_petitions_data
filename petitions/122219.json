        "additional_details": "Many times now I have tried to purchase tickets to events only to find it sold out with minutes of going on sale. After the event is sold out I then find the same tickets available for sale at inflated prices on other websites such as Stubhub. This is not fair on the people that actually want to go to the event. Why should the real fans be charged ridiculous prices to see their favourite bands and sporting heroes.",
        "background": "Time to stop ticket touts and 2nd hand websites selling sold out tickets at inflated prices. Fans who want tickets to go to the events are being unjustly punished. We want the government to act and enforce personal information on to tickets and proof of identity requested upon entry to venue.",
