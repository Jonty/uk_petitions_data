Being a parent, I find this incredibly frustrating, especially since there are never many of these spaces available in the first place.\r\nAnybody who does not have a parent and child badge should be fined, clamped, towed or be issued with a fixed penalty notice.",
        "background": "I propose a system similar to the disabled parking system, in which badges are issued to drivers with children allowing them to park in parent and child spaces and allowing the regulation of these spaces.",
