        "additional_details": "There is no proven evidence that exposing children to sexual information has reduced adolescent sex or pregnancy. It should be a matter for the parents to decide if their children should be exposed to sexual information.",
        "background": "Studies have showed that children under the age of 10 do not think of sexual activities or relationships. So sex education for little children under the age of 10 years is not necessary. Exposing children to sex is the same as showing red to a bull because what you don't know you don't miss.",
