        "additional_details": "I have been on a Swedish derogated contract for 3 years and the company I work for have no desire to hire anybody anymore as this contract allows them and the agencies to just screw over the normal hard working people that just want to get on and work. \r\nMeaning the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 literally don't count for anything and i find it hard to believe that the recruitment agencies are allowed to do this.",
        "background": "The Regulations give agency workers the entitlement to the same or no less favourable treatment for basic employment and working conditions, if they complete a qualifying period of 12 weeks in a particular job.\r\n",
