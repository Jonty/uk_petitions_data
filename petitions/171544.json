        "action": "Create a new licencing law for people transporting horses in trailers",
        "additional_details": "After careful research I have found that for than 25% of road traffic collisions are caused by people towing horse trailers with horses in them. \r\n83% of the 25% are motorway collisions causeing full shut downs on the M4 28 times this year alone. \r\nI believe that new licensing laws are needed for these people that wish to transport their horses around. Especially using the motorway to lower the risk of further accidents and also the trauma this must cause the animals.",
        "background": "Many people have accidents caused by inexperienced drivers traveling with horse box's (trailers) every day, Usually because these people dont have the experience or training to tow such a heavy loads, People trained to drive B+E vehicles (car & trailer) are trained with empty loads not live animals.",
