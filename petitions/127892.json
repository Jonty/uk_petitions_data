        "action": "Ban male circumcisions for children; Unless for specific medical reasons.",
        "additional_details": "Circumcision has roots in religious belief, many believing that if a young boy was circumcised it would stop him masturbating. Many studies have claimed that being circumcised stops disease or infection, whilst this may have been true hundreds of years ago we now have the ability to wash ourselves daily. The Council of Europe recently passed a resolution condemning the practice as a 'violation of the physical integrity of children'. We need to stop this barbaric and medieval practice.",
        "background": "The UK has always prided itself on the safety we provide for our children, but we are mutilating young boys every year. Male circumcision has practised in the UK for many years without questioning but we still have a ban on Female circumcision as it is seen as a mutilation of a child. Stop this now.",
