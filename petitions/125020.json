        "additional_details": "At 517 homes, this development will have a negative impact on the environment, as well as traffic and the area in general. Persimmon have offered a derisory sum of just over 2 million pounds towards school places in the area, but how long will that last, and what of doctors and dentists? We understand the need for housing and are not against developments per se, but this one, if it is to go ahead, needs scaling down, and the meeting that gave rise to the decision needs looking into.",
        "background": "This development has been passed without a single Poulton councillor on the committee. The development itself is by far too large for the area to cope with, even with a proposed alteration to the roads. The impact on the wildlife, the already busy roads, schools etc has been grossly underestimated. ",
