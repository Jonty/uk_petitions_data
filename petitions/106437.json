        "additional_details": "During the last severe winter we had and food could not reach the supermarkets due to snow blocking roads , shortage of food on the shelves was starting to cause anarchy within the public. This was just a taste of things to come. Just think if this was to happen all the time. Usually civilised people act very different when threatened with shortages. Do you really want this to happen to your children, grandchildren. Stop destroying agricultural land now! ",
        "background": "If we keep building on agricultural land used for food production we are going to cause food shortages and with the population growing at a fast rate this is not sustainable.  In 1940 the country could only just feed its population with a fraction of the population. ",
