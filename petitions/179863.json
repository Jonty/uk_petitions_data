It's designed for people to feel they have power and let of steam.\r\n\r\nFor starters, for a serious website, it comes across as a joke. \r\n\r\nThe example given for 'description' I've just seen \"Make wrongly describing a casserole with a pastry lid as a pie a criminal offence\" shows how serious this is.\r\n\r\nAlong with fake signatures from around the world, and Jeremy Clarkson for prime Minister, it really does show a pure joke is being played on people.",
        "background": "I'm sick of people jumping on the wagon petitions like politics is XFactor. The fake signatures, ridiculous petitions, and the fact many petitions will never succeed however sensible they seem just shows how bad this is for politics.",
