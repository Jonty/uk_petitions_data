        "action": "Franchise to commit c2c to fast train services with stops at Southend stations",
        "additional_details": "Trains make more stops at London stations which means that evening commuters face travelling on dangerously packed trains. Changes to the morning timetable mean fewer trains stopping at Southend stations causing disruption and overcrowding on morning commutes. The Department for Transport must require c2c to listen to their customers and return to the original timetable. We call for the reintroduction of the old timetable which included fast services and stops at Southend stations.",
        "background": "Timetable changes which came into force in December 2015 have led to massive overcrowding and delays to commuter journeys from Southend stations.",
