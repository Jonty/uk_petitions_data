        "additional_details": "Sensationalist media and reactionary politicians debate sovereignty, independence, power, laws, isolation, fear, immigration, security, racism, unity, EU reform, offering no clear focus/vision.\r\nParliament want a \u2018YES/NO\u2019 answer to a question they cannot or will not resolve. Our decision will have a lasting global impact. Do we have the facts necessary to make a valued judgement? Why pander to political division when EU solidarity is the best way to defeat the international enemy? STOP THE VOTE.\r\n",
        "background": "EU nations are under huge pressure: global economic, border conflict, international terrorism, the refugee crisis, community division, and the risk of EU collapse. The EU question should not be asked during these turbulent times. Long term views are being confused by short term fear. STOP THE VOTE.",
