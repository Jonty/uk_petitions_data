        "action": "Ban fee paying 'private' schools so admission to all schools is based on merit.",
        "additional_details": "Independent schools in the UK cost on average \u00a313,000 a year per child, or 32.5% of the average two income household. This means that for the average citizen these schools are unfeasible. No wonder 27,000 children attending private schools are not UK citizens. This outrageously outdated system allows the elite to become richer, by granting them better educations. Oxford and Cambridge admit more Etonians each year than applicants from the whole country who qualify for free school meals, showing how these upper class elites can buy their way into life.",
        "background": "Eton was founded in 1440, over 557 years ago. It is deplorable that we allow these schools to still operate in a society where they are totally out of place. When it comes to education, meritocracy is the most sensible answer. Keep Eton, the facility's, the teachers erase the price tag.",
