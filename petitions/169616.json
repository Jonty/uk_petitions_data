        "action": "Stop the Boundary Commission splitting Great Grimsby into two constituencies",
        "additional_details": "The Boundary Commission\u2019s proposal to cut our historic town completely down the middle therefore makes no sense, separating the famed docks in East Marsh Ward from the centrepiece People\u2019s Park in Park Ward and the River Freshney in Freshney Ward from the ancient village in Scartho Ward. The proposal is unfair, undemocratic and unacceptable and is based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register. Sign this petition and keep the town of Great Grimsby in one seat. ",
        "background": "Parliamentary boundaries define the area where a person votes for their local MP \u2013 their parliamentary constituency. A boundary review examines these areas and makes proposals for a new set of boundaries which are fairer and more equal, while also trying to reflect GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS and LOCAL TIES.",
