Parents with buggies, children and grandparents, super-fit sprinters, dog walkers and people with disabilities, as well as volunteers, will come together at hundreds of courses across the UK.\r\n\r\nParkrun is a non-profit running movement. The ethos for the 850 runs is for the event to be free and open to everyone.\r\n",
        "background": "Stoke Gifford Parish Council have taken unprecedented decision to start charging people to take part in Little Stoke parkrun- a free weekly 5kmand 2km run for kids. \r\n\r\nWith UK obesity adult rates at over 60%, the government needs to protect parkrun from council fees to use their local parks.
