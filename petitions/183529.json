        "additional_details": "MPs should consider the Speakers' recently expressed opinion on foreign policy matters, particularly his hostile position to a US Presidential address and his welcoming stance in relation to countries with a history of human rights abuse including China, Singapore, Indonesia and Kuwait. His inconsistent tolerance of applause in the Commons (acceptable at the end of his own speech and not at the end of SNP speeches) should also be considered. ",
