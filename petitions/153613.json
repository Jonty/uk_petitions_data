        "additional_details": "Over the last year of campaigning there have been many examples of blatant lies and deception, by the media and by MPs, to bolster the case for Brexit. This has now come to pass and may yet precipitate the dissolution of the UK.  Encouraging such a state of affairs is surely a treasonable offence and, at the very least, those involved (media barons and MPs) should be properly held to account in a court of law.",
        "background": "The Leave campaign was one of the most dishonest in recent political history, leading to a result where the public have been knowingly and wilfully misled.At a time when public trust in politicians and the media is at an all time low an example needs to be made that such behaviour is not acceptable.",
