        "additional_details": "Early detection of breast cancer can mean less money being spent by the NHS. Less chemotherapy needed. Less drugs needed. Consultants would rather catch cancers early so why are the NHS taking the age back up 50? My sister and I will be doing more research into this. But we want to get the petition up.and running a soon as possible.  Cancer destroys whole families. Dont let the NHS trust go backwards in cancer detection! ",
        "background": "My sister was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer at 48. If she hadnt been screened this early she might not have been here today. I had  breast screening at 47 and was diagnosed with primary breast cancer, if I hadn't been seen until 50, it would have been much worse. Screening early is essential.",
