        "additional_details": "Many women are being rejected for fertility treatment EVEN IF THEY ARE REFERRED BEFORE THEIR 40TH BIRTHDAY, because they are deemed too old for treatment. \r\nTreliske Hospital in Truro say that this is because the success rates are too low however with improvements in IVF techniques it is something of a myth. \r\nOne consultant advised that 'if it were sports injuries, the people make more of a fuss about that, which is why those types of treatments get funding'.\r\nSo let's make a fuss!!\r\n",
        "background": "Current legislation and NICE guidelines recommend that women up to the age of 42 should be offered at least 1 cycle of IVF, however primary care trusts around the UK are ignoring this and setting the upper age limit at 39 making treatment for infertility a postcode lottery.
