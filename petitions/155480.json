However, we are still proud to be British and are therefore dismayed that we were unable to vote in the EU Referendum. We believe that democracy has not occurred until each and every British citizen holding a British passport has had their right to vote on such a fundamental issue. Then and only then can HM Government claim that all British people have had their say.  ",
