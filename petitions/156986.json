As a large proportion of the public now think they made a mistake and the country is in ruins, the government should do what they are voted in for and start governing, and put a stop to this now for the good of the country. \r\n\r\nThere is too much buck passing and shirking responsibilities, and this will drag on for far too long now.",

Politicians need to do their job and put a stop this ASAP for the good of the country. It's now a total Joke!",
