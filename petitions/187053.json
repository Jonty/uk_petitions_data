        "additional_details": "Health tourists think that medical treatment in the UK is free. It is for those who have never paid a penny into the funding system. \r\n\r\nNone UK nationals other than asylum seekers must be required to produce valid comprehensive travel medical insurance along with their passport as a condition of entry into the UK. \r\n\r\nNHS staff should contact insurers in the interim period between diagnosis and admission for a yes or no as to whether proposed treatment can go ahead. This would also free up beds.\r\n",
        "background": "The NHS needs but rarely ever gets monies owed to it by none UK residents. Making comprehensive medical travel insurance a condition of entry into the UK would save the NHS many millions of pounds every year if insurers were consulted by NHS for prior agreement to fund treatment before it starts",
