        "additional_details": "The Crown Estate land ultimately belongs to the tax payers of the UK and we should all have the option to access and use it, we are happy to pay a fee for use but an option to pay per use should be available to make the ability to ride here open to all.  With riding on the roads becoming more and more dangerous the ability to ride on land like this is more important to horse riders than ever.  Please offer a daily permit option.",
        "background": "The Crown Estate offers some of the nicest and safest riding in Berkshire yet the only option available to riders is to purchase an annual permit for \u00a3235.  This makes the opportunity to ride in this beautiful and safe area non viable for most people.  The option of a daily permit should be offered.",
