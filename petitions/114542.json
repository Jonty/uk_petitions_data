        "additional_details": "Turkey has been allowing jihadists to travel through it both coming from Europe and returning from the battlefields of Syria. \r\nTheir major strategic goals in the Syrian civil war are to prevent the Kurds from gaining strength. \r\nThe NATO alliance obliges every member to act in defense of another member and the shooting down of a Russian jet is an  unnecessary provocation.",
        "background": "Turkey has been reckless with Europe's security, due to it's support of radicals in Syria, constriction of civil liberties for it's people and dangerous military provocation towards Russia, a provocative act which no side really wants to put to the test. Defeating ISIS hardly rates at all.",
