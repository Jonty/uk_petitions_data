        "additional_details": "Most of the refugees trying to come into Europe are middle aged males. Not only males escape war zones, you would also bring your children and wives? In February we were warned ISIS would send warriors disguised as refugees in the thousands. It is now September and we are welcoming them with aid and shelter. Yes, refugees need help and migrants are vital to the survival of the country but we must consider the safety and security of the nation. Prevention is better than the cure.",
        "background": "The UK government needs to pass a law that will prevent foreign people entering the country from areas currently in conflict with the United Kingdom. This is for the safety and security of the nation.",
