        "additional_details": "All parties in relation to the issue have been contacted with no result so far in 2 years. BT and Virgin cannot make a business case and the MoD told us residents need to self-fund fibre. Self funding however is not an option for a large portion of soldier families being attached to The Vikings, who re-locate every 5 years! The council has no jurisdiction. We've been left to struggle with inconceivably slow broadband surrounded by private housing with fibre access, in a London suburb in zone 4. ",
        "background": "The soldiers & their families in Woolwich living in Service Family Accommodation don't enjoy Fibre Broadband despite surrounding areas being connected. Internet is used to stay in touch with loved ones (deployed) and it's a disgrace that for economic reasons infrastructure is left outdated. ",
