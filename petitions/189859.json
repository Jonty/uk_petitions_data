So many times you either pay a lot more than the time you actually use the car park. If you pay less, you either have to keep going back to extend parking or you will get a Parking charge notice. It is so unfair for hospitals to charge money from you for the time you are not even using the parking. A system with ANPR where you only pay for the time you have used the parking will be fairer.",
