        "additional_details": "In the light of recent terrorist attacks; including the Paris and Orlando shootings, the whole religion of Islam has been constantly blamed in the media for the actions of criminals. There is nothing Islamic about committing any forms of abuses. Help stop bigotry in all the media and our institutions so that ordinary Muslims can live normal lives in Britain. ",
        "background": "Muslims in Britain are facing increased hostility, prejudice and discrimination. Stop the negative portrayal of a whole religion and terming 'terrorism' with Islam in the media. Ordinary Muslims do not need to suffer for the actions of a minority. ",
