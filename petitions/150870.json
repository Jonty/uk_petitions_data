        "action": "Make it an offense to knowingly mislead the public for political gain",
        "additional_details": "Historically our elected representatives (our leaders) took care to set a GOOD example. We now observe a marked increase in indefensible claims, apparently made for the sole purpose of gaining political power, regardless of fact or any intention to deliver. Being elected under false pretenses should lead to disqualification. We demand standards from business and sports people that we currently do not demand of our elected officials. This situation must be addressed urgently.",
        "background": "Making claims or promises that are deliberately false, for the purpose of gaining votes, constitutes fraud and should be treated as such. Persons making such claims should be prosecuted, and if found guilty, banned from public office. Probity in our leaders is essential and needs to be ensured.",
