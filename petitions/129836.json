        "additional_details": "In the digital age we live in, the BBC should be able to survive on advertisements and selling the rights to its various TV programs and even to charge a subscription if they wish to. ITV and Channels 4 and 5 survive without any contribution from a TV license Why Should the BBC be any different. \r\nIt is time to stop charging this unfair tax which is punitive to those on lower incomes and not supported by the majority of the public. ",
        "background": "Stop the TV licence as it's immoral and not wanted by the majority of the public, is a biased organisation and it should not be compulsory to have a TV licence.\r\nTaxing citizens to subsidise a biased broadcasting corporation is unfair and it shouldn't be allowed to happen!
