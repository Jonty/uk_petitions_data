        "additional_details": "Since a religious ethos was last prevalent in our nation in the 1950's there has been a ten-fold increase in crimes and enormous increases in social problems. A study of 88 civilisations by Professor J.D. Unwin from Cambridge University in the 1940's showed the following: whenever there was pre-marital sex, infidelity, wide-spread promiscuity and same-sex relationships, the whole civilisation was wiped out within 3 generations - with no exceptions. There are other similar studies. ",

The criteria for TV standards should be based according to moral and spiritual values in line with our Judeo/Christian heritage.",
