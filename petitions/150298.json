        "action": "Jeremy Corbyn to step down as Leader of the Opposition.",
        "additional_details": "Jeremy Corbyn has had his opportunity to lead the opposition in providing effective scrutiny of the government. However, the instability of a shadow cabinet without effective leadership at this time could be disastrous for parliament at a vital time in the UK's history.\r\n\r\nThe opposition has a responsibility not just to those who voted for it but for the entirety of the UK. We should thank Jeremy for his work in leading the opposition, but ask for him to step aside so stability can prevail. ",
        "background": "In light of the recent referendum on the UK's place within the European Union and accompanying shadow cabinet turmoil, parliament requires an opposition which can command the support of its MP's, and speaks for those who elected it.\r\n\r\n",
