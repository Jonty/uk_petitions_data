        "additional_details": "We are constantly being told that the UK isn't doing enough to aid migrants by privileged and pampered celebrities who are usually in the fortunate position of being outside the risk migrants bring to infrastructure and services. If you believe we should be putting Britons first then urge the government to ignore the pressure being piled on by celebrities by signing this petition to keep residents of the Calais migrant camps & their dependents out",
        "background": "Jungle residents in Calais are not refugees but economic migrants who have travelled through numerous safe countries to try and enter the UK illegally. Celebrities using their fame to attempt to force the government to open our border is an undemocratic process belittling the views of ordinary Brits",
