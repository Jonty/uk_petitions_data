        "additional_details": "Lucy's Head Start is campaigning for mandatory training for paediatric medical professionals leading to earlier diagnosis.Families involved with Lucy's Head Start have reported that some but not all midwives, health vistors or GPs have dismissed, missed, misdiagnosed or mistaken their child's condition for flat head due to lack of awareness, which is why we desperately need mandatory training.Most children diagnosed require surgery and early intervention is vital to prevent severe symptoms. ",
        "background": "Craniosynostosis is a skull condition that causes a baby to be born with, or develop an abnormally shaped head. The irregular skull shape causes severe symptoms resulting from increased pressure in the skull, it affects 1 in every 3,000 babies born each year but is a largely unheard of condition. ",
