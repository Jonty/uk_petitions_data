        "action": "To scrap the literacy and numeracy tests for those wanting to become teachers.",
        "additional_details": "Last year I was accepted by a school and university. I had completed my degree, achieved the necessary GCSE results, gained 2 years experience of working in education. However, after 3 attempts I failed the numeracy and I am now frozen out for 2 years. After contacting Nicky Morgan's office, I received a reply stating that I am not ready to be a teacher. The questions that are asked are irrelevant to teaching especially when the tests are not relevant to the subjects that trainees want to teach.",
        "background": "These tests are preventing future teachers from beginning their training. There are many requirements that need to be met and the schools and universities that provide the training are losing students because of the governments involvement. The training providers don't even approve of these tests. ",
