        "action": "Change the law in UK to make return and exchange policy standard and compulsory.",
        "additional_details": "Not only consumers pay extortionate prices, but they have no right to get full refund and can only exchange an item (only once) within 3-7 days. Shopping in these stores has not only become difficult but very stressful when you make a mistake in choosing an item of clothing. We want government to change the law to make it compulsory to allow refunds. We need 10,000 signatures to receive a response from the Government and 100,000 for this to be discussed in the parliament",
        "background": "Over the last 20 years it has become more and more difficult to return or exchange an item of clothing in Asian clothing stores in places like Southall, Green Street and many other locations all over UK, due to strict store policies which make shopping a total nightmare.",
