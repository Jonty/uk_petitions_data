        "action": "Requesting the British Government to review the FCO travel advice to Tunisia.",
        "additional_details": "The travel advice makes it impossible for the Tunisian/British community in the UK to obtain comprehensive travel insurance from conventional UK companies and removes the need for competitive pricing for the traveller. This is restricting people\u2019s freedom to live their lives.\r\n",
        "background": "We believe that the time is now appropriate to request a removal of the restrictive travel advice which has had such a devastating effect on the country's progress and economic stability.\r\n",
