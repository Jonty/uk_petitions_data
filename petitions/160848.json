He had his own fashion show, he has his own carnival. I saw Tyler, The Creator last year in Bristol, 15th May 2015 and it was one of the best nights of my life!",
        "background": "Tyler The Creator was banned due to lyrics he wrote when he was 17! They said he promoted 'homophobia and violence' quite ironic for the fact he's 24 years old now and he even sells shirts with the 'Golf Pride World Wide' which also have the LGBT colours on them.",
