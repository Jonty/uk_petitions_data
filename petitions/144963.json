        "action": "Create a multi-party team to negotiate the exit from the EU including MYPs",
        "additional_details": "There are 12 different political parties with MPs in Westminster. There are 369 MYPs. The young have the most to lose from a poorly negotiated exit. Let's ensure a democratically representative task force, including all parties and elected young people leads the exit process. This will avoid the exit being led by a team with an unrepresentative perspective on what we in the UK want. This gives us a chance at getting the democracy in the UK that we deserve. ",
        "background": "The exit from the EU has a long term impact. MYPs (youth parliamentarians) should be included in a new multi party team that leads the exit rather than the leader of the largest party in Westminster. This team needs to reflect the views and background of the nation as a whole. ",
