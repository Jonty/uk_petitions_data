        "additional_details": "The Conservatives were elected in May 2015 with a mandate to secure \"a clear economic plan\" and \"a more secure future\". Our Government has failed to lead, its manifesto pledges now lie in tatters. Our economy has weakened. The UK is divided between those who the status quo has worked for, and those who feel ignored by the establishment. We must now heal our Nation, and require a new breed of politics and Government who can secure peace and prosperity for ALL. #UniteBritain",
        "background": "Our Nation is divided and in clear and present danger. 37% of the electorate has chosen to leave the EU.  The present Government and Tory party is in disarray. A new General Election is required so we can give a new Government a clear mandate to navigate the change ahead and unite our country",
