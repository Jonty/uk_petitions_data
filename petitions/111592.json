If we make organ donation an opt out system then so many lives could be saved however still giving the general public the choice to opt out if they do not agree. Most people appear to agree with organ donation yet fail to join the register or share their wishes with their families. Let's save lives!",

It is because of this that I am here today! I propose that we change the law to give more people this chance and save lives!",
