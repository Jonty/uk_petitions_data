        "action": "Apply VAT on airfares to better fund the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Airline passengers do not pay fuel duty or VAT and APD can be as low as \u00a313. We might think this makes annual holidays affordable but in fact undertaxed flights largely benefit affluent people who fly several times a year; 70% of flights are taken by only 15% of adults.\r\n\r\nMy petition is to apply VAT on airfares and for the additional revenue to be used to support our NHS. Most of us like an annual holiday but those of us who can afford 2 to 3 holidays each year can also afford to pay more tax.\r\n",
        "background": "The NHS is underfunded; at the end of 2015/16 the NHS had a deficit of \u00a31.85 billion. Aviation is lightly taxed but harmful, eg it impairs children's learning ability and is detrimental to wildlife. It is also exacerbating our climate crisis and in 2014 produced over 11% of the UK\u2019s total emissions.",
