        "action": "I am starting this petition to demand an end to Greyhound racing in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "In 2004 a young male Greyhound (Rusty) was found by a walker. Whimpering on a rubbish tip Rusty had been shot through the skull and his ears had been hacked off (to prevent his former owner being identified through Rusty's racing tattoos in his ears). Despite being tortured- mutilated and left for 3 days, Rusty was still alive and wagging his tail. Rusty's injuries were extensive and he had to be put to sleep by a vet. This is just one example of the horrors of Greyhound racing.",
        "background": "The life of a racing Greyhound is filled with abuse, neglect and early death. 1,000's of healthy puppies who fail to make the grade are culled. 100's of dogs that sustain injury on the track are destroyed.\r\n1,000's of healthy dogs are destroyed if no retirement home can be found. Please help them!",
