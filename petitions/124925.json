        "additional_details": "I am petitioning for Anklyosing Spondylitis and Arthritis sufferers to be given free prescriptions and both conditions to be added to the NHS medical exempt list. This condition can affect any of us, and is usually diagnosed in your twenties. Having to pay for prescriptions or prescription pre-payments till you're sixty is not fair, and it needs to be added to the medical condition exempt form. ",
        "background": "Anklyosing Spondylitis is an auto-immune disease effecting more than 200,000 people in the UK. Currently there is no cure, so the only way to manage the pain and flare up's is to take medication... Taking 20 tablets+ daily and not having free prescriptions.",
