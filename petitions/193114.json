        "additional_details": "I enquired at many shops to see if they had any age restrictions on the sale of paracetamols some did but others did not. Studies show 1-3 children in the classroom are suffering from mental health issues or stress. Being able to purchase painkillers so easy no wonder so many children choose to overdose. My daughter spent 2 weeks in hospital and the amount of children who come in and taken an overdose was worrying. I know this won't stop them trying but we could make the sale less easy.",
        "background": "I was unaware until recently that children under 16 could purchase painkillers. I had always assumed you had to be 16. My daughter had purchased paracetamols and took an overdose. Although she is alive an ok I want to prevent the sale of painkillers to under 16's.",
