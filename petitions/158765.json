        "action": "Retain permanently the UK rights of residence of EU citizens here on 23/6/16",
        "additional_details": "Currently citizens of an EU or EEA country can apply for a UK residence card which lasts five years, after which they can apply for a permanent residence card. The rules allow for dependents of the approved holders of such cards to also acquire rights of residence. This petition argues that the UK Government should commit immediately to retain these rights for EU citizens already living here after the conclusion of any treaty respecting the UK leaving the EU, in the interests of good faith.",
        "background": "The result of the EU Referendum has left thousands of EU citizens resident in the UK worried about their residence rights. There is a moral case for the UK Government urgently to reassure them that their rights of residence will not be revised in any negotiations or treaty on the UK leaving the EU.",
