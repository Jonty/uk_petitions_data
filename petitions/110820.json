This will help to lower that deficit, while keeping the economy and infrastructure up to standard. As you're workers for the 'public' we feel your wages could be better spent on providing us with better services like the NHS or the police, ambulance or fire brigade. The services that actually keep us safe.",

That power was given by Parliament to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) in 2010, so that after 2012 MPs no longer had control over their own pay. IPSA conducted a public consultation after 2012 and decided what the salaries of MPs should be after the election.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to contact IPSA about its decision, here\u2019s how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttp://parliamentarystandards.org.uk/About%20Us/Pages/Contact-Us.aspx\r\n\r\nParliament could change the ministerial salary (the extra pay that Ministers receive on top of their salary as an MP). You could start a petition about this, if you wished to do so.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more information about MPs' and Minsisters' pay here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/RP13-33\r\n"
