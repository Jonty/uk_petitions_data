        "additional_details": "Leaving Corporation Tax at 20% could reinstate Disability Welfare reductions, and remove the need for sanctioning people. People are being forced into homelessness and are actually dying because they're being sanctioned by ATOS. Their appeal hearings are taking months. 50% of appeals are won but, until they are, people are left without money to survive. \r\nI don't want to live in a society that is happy to let this happen so would like it changed. I'm happy to fund helping those that need it.  ",

There are many in our country who now can't survive.\r\nAs a business owner I'm in a position to help.",
