        "additional_details": "28 years ago, GCSE exams were introduced. We have now seen anxiety and depression rates in 15-16 year olds double in the last 30 years. It has been a common view that exams are getting easier as more people are achieving an A. This belief has led to ever increasing grade boundaries, causing higher levels of stress. Getting an A now is harder than it was 28 years ago, so today's generation faces an unfair playing field in the real world. This has to stop.",
        "background": "Grade boundaries for GCSE and A-level exams the risen over the years. This means students study harder, score higher, and the grade boundaries rise again in a stressful vicious circle.\r\nStress leads to anxiety disorders.\r\nAnxiety disorders in young people have risen.\r\nThe NHS can't help every-one.",
