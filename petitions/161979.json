        "additional_details": "The Leave campaign appears to have been based on lies and misrepresentations.\r\n\r\nMounting evidence suggests that Leave voters voted on domestic issues, such as more funding for the NHS, schools and other public services. \r\n\r\nSome Leave voters voted in protest at Westminster and the Establishment.\r\n\r\nThese are domestic issues unrelated to the EU.  Leaving the EU will not solve these problems.  \r\n\r\nArticle 50 must not be invoked unless there is a genuine mandate of the UK electorate to leave the EU.",
        "background": "Before Article 50 is invoked parliament should debate whether the Leave vote is a genuine mandate to leave the EU.  \r\n\r\nEvidence suggests that many Leave voters voted on the basis of false promises, misrepresentations and domestic issues.  \r\n\r\nThe real implications of Brexit were not understood.",
