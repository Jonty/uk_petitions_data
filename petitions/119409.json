The regulation and licensing of broadcasters are the responsibility of Ofcom, which is an independent regulator. \r\n\r\nThere are certain conditions which must be met before Ofcom can issue a licence to a broadcaster. If these conditions are violated while the licence is in force, Ofcom can impose sanctions up to and including revocation of the licence. This is a decision for Ofcom, which is takes independently of the Government and Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Broadcasting Act 1990 (as amended by the Broadcasting Act 1996 and the Communications Act 2003) lays down a number of restrictions on who can hold Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting licences. \r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on Parliament to change this law to add a new licence condition. For example, the new condition could require that where a station was funded by a foreign government and that government was named by the UK Government in defined circumstances, the licence application to Ofcom would fail or any existing licence would be revoked by Ofcom.\r\n\r\n"
