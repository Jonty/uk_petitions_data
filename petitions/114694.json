        "additional_details": "With over 3000 horses killed by drivers per year and approximatley 10 riders, this battle should not even exist. \r\nWe NEED to make it a criminal offence for drivers not to take due care when passing these large unpredictable animals. Death rates will only rise if these highway code guidelines do not have legal back up. Riders of all ages have to use the road, so it is only a matter of time before tragedy will strike.\r\n\r\nPlease help nip this problem in the bud and make the road safer for everyone.",
        "background": "With the roads becoming busier day by day, the battle between drivers and horses on the road is becoming increasingly dangerous. Unfortunately for the majority of riders, the roads are unavoidable when exercising their horses. ",
