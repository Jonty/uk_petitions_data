        "additional_details": "Most figures displayed by the media do not include animals that are bred for the purpose of testing and for use of tissue\r\nthen discarded or rejected because their genetic modifications did not work.\r\nUse of animals:\r\nRodents 84%\r\nFish, amphibians, reptiles 12%\r\nLarge mammals 2.1%\r\nSmall mammals 1.4%\r\nDogs and cats 0.3%\r\nPrimates 0.1%\r\nScientists suggest that new drugs in development that act in very specific ways in the body may lead to more animals (specifically primates) being used in future years.",
        "background": "Since 1882 the use of animal testing has been reduced. But when the media states a reduction, it compares from the horrific state of which we treated animals to a position where we were only capable of improvement.
