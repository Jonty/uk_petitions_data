        "additional_details": "Yes it will need to be made secure - as does the future of our country. This will create more jobs, even if temporary, to develop and support this system, and the people learning to use it. Ideas for how the system should work:\r\n - Web application per constituency - to ease traffic.\r\n - Ballots can be used in conjunction with e-voting or separately.\r\n - Each persons unique voting number can be used as part of secure sign/log in.\r\nE-Voting system is used by many countries in Europe and USA.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Our current document ballot voting system isn't a completely secure or convenient way to vote. An E-Voting (online) system could be a great addition or replacement to the current government voting system, allowing instant access to vote from anywhere.",
