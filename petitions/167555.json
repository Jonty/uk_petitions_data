        "additional_details": "I offer history as a witness and evidence. Name one conflict resolved by the UN?\r\nIt has become clear since the 1960's that the UN is an organisation mired in politics and self interest. The rules created for countries to debate are being abused in a wholesale and cynical fashion. Their must be a better way by way of a court which member states adhere to or else they are dismissed from the organisation. The bailiffs of the court will be member countries having no interest in the actions at hand and able to use full force to achieve the edicts of the  court. No more should soldiers stand by and witness rape, murder and torture. No more should cynical members be able to abuse the courts decisions with a veto.",
        "background": "The UN has presided over countless deaths of civilians over the years and has lost its way in the new world of aggression where all countries seek are weapons and power. We need a court like system, signed up to by all with real penalties for transgressors.",
