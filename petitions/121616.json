        "additional_details": "The UK has a history of inviting even foreign dignitaries to address different areas of parliament. It is now time for petitions which reach 100,000 signatories to have their starting petitioner invited to parliament to address the start of the debate. If he/she would rather appoint a proxy then that too should be offered.",
        "background": "Currently a petition is debated upon its merits in a committee or house when it reaches it's 100,000 threshold. Democracy would be seen to be done if the petition  starter was part of the debate from the outset to represent all the signatories. ",
