They're not usually an effective way of getting speedy help with a personal case. \r\n\r\nThis might be something that your family in the UK could raise with their local MP. They can find out who that is here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/\r\n\r\nThey might also be able to seek advice for you at their local Citizens' Advice Bureau.
