        "action": "Move Cannabis to Class C and move it from a schedule 1 drug",
        "additional_details": "The reclassification of cannabis from Class C to Class B was done as part of a deal made by Gordon Brown and the Daily Mail editor. This was done against the findings, research and recommendation of the ACMD. The schedule 1 status means that the drug has no medical value. This is completely wrong as it was still being prescribed as a medicine in the UK until 1971. Over the last 20 years there have been on average 2 published studies per day on medical cannabis. People are suffering as a result.",
        "background": "Both of the current class and scheduling of cannabis are out of date, unscientific, completely against all evidence, have created enormous harm to society and has held back medical advances for over 45 years.",
