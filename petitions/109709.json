        "additional_details": "Local authorities do not seem to have lists available, certainly not for specialist autistic provision and although the National Autistic Society have some facilities listed it is by no means an extensive list. Parents/carers are then left to search the internet to see what they can find which is not only laborious but can miss some specialist provision.\r\nThere are care home web sites but again this is not adequate as they do not always cover autism or have very sketchy information.",
        "background": "We have a severely Autistic 23 year old adult son who is now on his 4th move in 5 years to find suitable residential accommodation. Every time we have had to look for new places no one knows about what provision is available. There is not a central 'official' register to find such provision.",
