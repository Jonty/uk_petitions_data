        "action": "Hold a post referendum opinion poll on key factors before the exit negotiations.",
        "additional_details": "Evidence of misinterpretation of facts has been shown by those leading the campaigns. Public information and opinion has also been shown to be misinformed, given social media trends (i.e #Regretzit) and search engine results (i.e. What is the EU? / What are the results of leaving the EU?) taking place post the referendum result.\r\n\r\nA full and open opinion poll should be carried out to find a better understanding of UK opinion on a wider number of topics involved in the exit debate.",
        "background": "Public opinion and information have been misrepresented in a highly complex question. Public opinion of key facts (Immigration, Economy, Politics, etc.) should be found before any exit negotiations can take place, to ensure accurate and fair representation of the true feelings of the population.",
