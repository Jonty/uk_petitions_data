        "action": "Censure Nigel Farage MEP for his outburst in the European Parliament on 28/6/16",
        "additional_details": "When Mr Farage said, \"Now I know virtually none of you have ever done a proper job in your lives. Or worked in business or worked in trade or indeed ever created a job.\" Not only did he offend every member of the European Parliament, he also brought shame and indignity on the British people.\r\nThis kind of behaviour wouldn't be tolerated in a classroom. So much more so that he is televised and splashed across the papers. \r\nThe undersigned therefore call on the government to issue a formal censure.",
        "background": "MEPs our the representatives of the British public in the European Parliament. Therefore, when they speak, they speak on behalf of us all. Mr Farage unleashed a torrent of ill-informed abuse on the 28th June, days after the British EU referendum.\r\n",
