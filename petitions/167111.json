        "additional_details": "Linda Masarira, locked up since 6 July on trumped-up charges, has health problems & is the mother of 5 children (youngest 2 yrs). Accused of inciting riots in the female section of Chikurubi prison on 10/9, she was moved to solitary confinement in the dangerous male section \u2013 we fear for her safety. Other activists are also still incarcerated, many needing medical care after violent treatment by the police. Both Gift Siziba\u2019s hands are believed to be broken.  This vicious persecution must stop.",
        "background": "Zimbabwe\u2019s last election in July 2013 was massively rigged & since then misgovernance & corruption have destroyed the economy \u2013 people are starving & there is 90% unemployment. Civil unrest in Zimbabwe is growing & brave protesters are being incarcerated without trial or sentencing & refused bail.",
