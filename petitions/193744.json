The dictionary was available in the plan before the speaking assessment and for the writing but now it's not allowed at all. Where is the fairness in that? As a year 10 student I am still VERY reliable on the dictionary during lessons and I know I will fail, along with many others, because of this new rule. (Bearing in mind, the exam has stayed as difficult as it was)",
