        "action": "Make employers test for cannabis using the saliva test rather than urine.",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis is used worldwide as medication and although it could affect the way in which you work, the effects wear off after a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe test for alcohol in a work place can only detect alcohol taken that day or the day before therefore, the same should apply to cannabis.\r\n\r\nUnemployment is already a massive issue in the UK and these tests only make it more difficult for people to maintain their employment wether they use recreationally or for medical purposes.",
        "background": "The urine test for cannabis is thought to be able to detect cannabis taken from upto 2-3 months prior to the test. This is a massive issue as cannabis has no impairment on your work even a day later. The saliva test used by police for roadside testing only detects cannabis taken that day.",
