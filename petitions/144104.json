        "action": "A referendum on whether or not to break up the UK",
        "additional_details": "If the UK does break up over the next 2+ years as a result of the EU referendum, we believe that subsequently many people will wonder why they never had a chance to vote on an absolutely key national issue. Certainly neither of the main parties currently sitting in Westminster parties has a mandate to conduct such a break up. And in any case both parties now seem pre-occupied with their own leadership problems\r\n\r\nDemocracy surely means getting (or at least trying to get) a clear opinion from the citizenry on vital national issues. In fact since it is about the future of the country overall, rather than specific economic or social policy issues, we would argue the \"break up of the UK\" is an exemplary referendum question. ",
        "background": "The recent EU referendum did not ask about the future of the UK as country - it asked if that country had a future as part of the EU. However a clear consequence of the vote distribution is that parts of the country will now propose to secede from the Union (Scotland, Northern Ireland? (&London??))",
