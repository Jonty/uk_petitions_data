In the wake of food scandals, scrapping government standards risks undermining public confidence in the food we buy.\u201d",
        "background": "Conservative ministers are planning to repeal an array of official guidance on animal welfare standards, starting with a move to put the code on chicken farming into the hands of the poultry industry.
