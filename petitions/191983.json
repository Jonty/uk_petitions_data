        "action": "Repeal the ban on laptops and tablets on flights from six Middle East countries",
        "additional_details": "Students, professionals and others for whom their laptops represent an important part of their academic and/or working lives, will be asked to entrust their devices to the hold of the aircraft. \r\n\r\nIssues of theft or damage aside, to be parted from such a valuable device (both literally and figuratively) on such arbitrary grounds as those presented, is simply unacceptable.\r\n\r\nI sadly, have come to expect such nonsense from Trump - but believe that we in the UK can do much better than this.",
        "background": "The UK has banned laptops, tablets and similar devices \"larger than a normal smartphone\" on all direct passenger flights from Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nWhilst they can be placed in the hold, for many this is an unacceptable and unfounded risk and inconvenience.",
