        "additional_details": "London almost comes to a halt and there is chaos everywhere on tube strike days. How much losses small businesses make on those strike days? There are people out there struggling to make ends meet with lower wages, zero hour contracts etc. and if they lose their one day salary due to not being able to commute to work what does it mean for their family? As much as we respect and love the TfL staff for the service they do, we strongly believe there are alternative options to raise their concerns.",
        "background": "We understand and appreciate the intentions of the various union staff who go on a tube strike time and again. We all agree that they need to be looked after. However does it really worth all the inconvenience  it causes to the commuters on those strike days. Definitely not! We need to stop this.",
