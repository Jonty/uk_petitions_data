        "additional_details": "If an organisation is not a Charity, or it is 'out of scope' for CQC regulation, VAT is required to be paid by end users. Support in the home does have to involve personal care. Currently, families choosing services from a LTD or LLP company to help themselves or a loved one rather than state or charity provision are penalised with 20% VAT on vital care services.  Volunteer services and Charities can't cope with demand, so if you are willing to  pay for services that are not \"personal care\", we do not think VAT should have to be added. Seniors Helping Seniors\u00ae is an organisation that has evidence of great care outcomes for families and we are fighting the VAT charges. Refund will be passed back to every single family who has had to pay VAT to date.",
