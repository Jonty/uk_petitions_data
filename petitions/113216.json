        "additional_details": "Our current government systems and structures are based on procedures, practises, cult like ceremonies and principles that have existed since government itself was created. It doesn't work. It is a system that sustains the system itself. \r\nThink about it. Hundreds of years in the same cycle with the poorer still getting poorer, the rich getting richer, surveillance becoming more ingrained.\r\nWe need an institution collaborating the best minds the country has, a 100% open, unbiased, non profit way",
        "background": "We need a government that consists of 1000 of the best scholars in their fields. Not people 'sworn in' from social groups and elitist clubs.\r\nWe need a school of the countries best economists, geologists, doctors, physicians, environmentalists, resource experts, philosophers, psychologists and so on",
