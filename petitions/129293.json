During this time no provision is made to help them access shops, pharmacists or even hospitals!\r\n\r\nI would like to empower Doctors to issue temporary Disabled Parking Badges to help post operative patients rehabilitate.\r\n\r\nThese badges would give the bearer the same access rights as the current Disabled Badge scheme however they would expire as patients recover.",
