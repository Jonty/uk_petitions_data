        "additional_details": "As the situation is now;\r\nChildren have around 6/7 weeks summer holiday. During that time prices for taking a holiday increase astronomically meaning holidays are unaffordable for some. \r\nPeople who work in some jobs may not get this time of year off work eg nurses, soldiers, tourism industries.\r\nChildcare for 6 weeks makes finding a job for single people difficult & expensive.\r\nShortening the holidays and allowing 2 weeks free choice will:\r\nenrich childrens lives,\r\nboost tourism businesses,\r\nhelp!\r\n",
        "background": "I have listened to the debate about term time absence from school. It struck me that the only real argument was lost classroom time over the entire school period totalling a year. If the summer holiday period was two weeks shorter this would no longer be an issue. Many positive impacts would follow ",
