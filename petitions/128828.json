I believe that there would have been no Hillsborough disaster if tanked-up yobs had not turned up in very large numbers to try to force their way into the ground.\r\n\r\nover the years he has insulted all Hillsborough relatives and Liverpool fans and even refers to them as \u2018contemptible\u2019:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "the title \u2018sir\u2019 is supposed to represent honour and respect and there\u2019s nothing honourable or respectful about the way Ingham has over many years consistently abused the people who lost loved ones in such a tragic way in the Hillsborough disaster.",
