        "action": "Government to HONOUR referendum result & Invoke Treaty of Lisbon Article 50 NOW",
        "additional_details": "There is no legal obligation for the Government to act on the results of the referendum, making a mockery of the very democratic process which gave them their jobs: to serve the people\r\n\r\nMake them act on it\r\n\r\nUnless article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is invoked, NO ACTION will be taken by the UK government to actually leave the EU. The referendum will have been a waste of time, money and ultimately the clearest sign that the political elite can disregard the will of the electorate without consequence",
        "background": "With the result of the referendum declared and the leave vote winning, this petition seeks to oblige the government to act immediately in invoking article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon to irrevocably start the process of leaving the EU as soon as possible with time being of the essence.
