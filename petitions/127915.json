        "action": "Create a permanent and separate role of 'Minister for Mental Health'",
        "additional_details": "The current minister for 'Community and Social Care' Alistair Burt has numerous other areas of health to look after, which means that his full attention is not focused on this crucial area. There is still too little being done to reduce stigma, even with the government's promise to increase funding and awareness. I think a 'Minister for Mental Health' would have more control over the mental health budget and drastically improve care for our most vulnerable citizens.",
        "background": "I am writing this petition to ask the Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister David Cameron to create a 'Minister for Mental Health'. I know personally the devastating effects that mental health problems can have, both myself and within my family. It needs taking seriously.",
