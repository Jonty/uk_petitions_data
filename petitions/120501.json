        "additional_details": "In Scotland, the award is considered on a case by case basis.  In a recent Scottish claim, for the loss of a child, the parents were awarded \u00a3100,000 yet in England & Wales they would have only received \u00a312,980.  \r\nAnother example of how unjust the process can be, if a celebrity suffers hurt feelings they can be awarded around \u00a3200,000.00 yet a wife who suffers the death of her husband will only receive \u00a312,980. \r\n\r\nSupport us to change the law to make it fairer to grieving relatives.\r\n",
        "background": "The price of a life in England & Wales is only worth \u00a312,980.\r\nThe loss of a loved one, a WIFE, HUSBAND or CHILD (under 18 years of age) according to the law is worth a pitiful \u00a312,980.  We appreciate no amount of money can compensate for the loss, but the level of the award should be increased.  ",
