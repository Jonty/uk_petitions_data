        "action": "Stop age discrimination. Pay under 25\u2019s the national living wage.",
        "additional_details": "In the Equality Act 2010, the section on equal pay relating to age is ignored as it assumes that experience comes with age. We've seen similar discrimination based around race, sexuality, gender and disability but modern law has evolved to remove pay discrimination in these categories but not for age. Matching the youth and adult minimum wages is an important move with the goal of creating an equal and fair society where youth is seen for its assets, not as an opportunity for exploitation.",
        "background": "There are many no skilled and low skilled employees aged under 25 that work alongside adults undertaking tasks to the same standard but are paid lower wages. This is age discrimination. Employees should have a fair pay structure based upon ability. Age should not be an influencing factor.",
