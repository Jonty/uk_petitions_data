Potential wildlife issues could surface such as excessive damage to natural habitats. A lot of road systems going in and out of the Trossachs area will have to be resurfaced and some may also needed to be replaced based on potential future traffic conditions. I hope something can be done to protect the scenery and current environmental standards from any negative effects. ",
