            "details": "Delivering on the Armed Forces Covenant, we have introduced protection to ensure that former and current Service personnel are not disadvantaged in accessing social housing because of the requirements of military life. \r\n\r\nIn 2012 we changed the law so that seriously injured and disabled Service personnel and former members of the Armed Forces with urgent housing needs are always given high priority for social housing.  \r\n\r\nAt the same time, we introduced regulations to ensure that serving personnel, and veterans who are within 5 years of having been discharged, do not lose their qualification rights because of the necessity to move from base to base. \r\n\r\nBoth these changes apply also to bereaved spouses of Service personnel who are required to leave services accommodation and to members of the Reserve Forces who have been seriously injured or disabled in service.   \r\n\r\nWe recognise there is considerable appetite amongst members of the Armed Forces to own their own home and provide security for their families.  \r\n\r\nMembers of the Armed Forces have been given priority for Government-funded shared ownership schemes. Service personnel retain their priority status for shared ownership for up to a year after active service. If they die while in service, their priority can be transferred to their bereaved spouse or civil partner. \r\n\r\nRegular armed forces personnel can also benefit from a \u00a3200 million scheme to help them get on the property ladder. The Forces Help to Buy scheme enables servicemen and servicewomen to borrow up to 50% of their salary, interest free, to buy their first home or move to another property on assignment or as their families needs change.  Further information on home ownership, including for armed forces personnel can be found at https://www.ownyourhome.gov.uk/\r\n\r\nFinally, we have supported the roll-out of the No Second Night Out and StreetLink initiatives ensuring rough sleepers, including veterans, are found quickly and that they do not spend more than one night on the street.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government",
