        "additional_details": "Currently around 600,000 Disabled people are in receipt of PIP. There is wide concern that the PIP criteria are already too strict, and that this has led to almost 50% of Disabled people losing access to some or all of their support when being reassessed from Disability Living Allowance. The original intention behind the PIP assessment was to \u2018take a holistic view..., fairly taking into account the full range of impairments\u2019. The Government's planned regulations move away from this.",
        "background": "The Government has tried unsuccessfully to limit PIP, which helps with additional unavoidable costs of being Disabled. Two upper tribunals have ruled against this. Now the Government has tabled regulations that could cause around 146,500 people to lose the benefit without going through Parliament.",
