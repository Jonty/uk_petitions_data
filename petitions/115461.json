'His' (example) partner doesnt support him. they share a home. they are not married. they dont share funds or bank accounts. he cant claim jsa because she works full time. how is this fair what else can he do. hes applying for jobs. her money gets shorter each day. no help. the unemployed looks for work in old clothes.scruffy looking. how can he achieve employment this way. he needs the funds from JSA!!",
        "background": "we all know when in a relationship, not a marriage, but house sharing. we use our own funds especially in new relationships. we dont share funds. we keep our own money. when one of the couple becomes unemployed and the other is working full time there is no help for the unemployed person.
