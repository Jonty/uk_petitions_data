        "action": "Put gender equality on the national curriculum",
        "additional_details": "As a 16 year old girl living in London, I am still thoroughly disheartened by the gender pay gap and the lack of women in top positions in every sector and profession. By increasing awareness through education, girls and boys will be taught how to view each other as equal, then carry this knowledge with them into the wider world. It will also give them a chance to learn about the suffragette movement, the objectification of men and women in the media, as well as the fundamental lack of female education around the world.",
        "background": "Gender inequality is still an extremely prevalent issue in our society which I strongly believe everyone needs to be educated about at school in order to combat sexism. Increased educated of future generations is the way to begin to pave the way towards true equality beyond classroom walls.",
