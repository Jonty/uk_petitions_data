This is enough work for me (everyone is different) but I am sure 60 year + women would not want to work full time if the main reason is to support a changed government policy.   It would be sensible to have a sliding scale of pension rather than absolutely nothing causing hardship during the years 1950's women have to wait to receive their pension - that they have rightly paid into all their working lives and will now lose up to \u00a330k per women.
