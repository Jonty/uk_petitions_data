        "additional_details": "Time and time again we provoke Russia and when we get a response our media instantly turns on it's propaganda machines and makes us look innocent. What good would it be to continue trade sanctions and threatening them with military action (Not directly - but through military drills). If we wish to have 'everlasting peace in our time' - then the solution is not to provoke a country into a state where it wishes to defend itself. Instead of such provocations we should seek diplomacy of co-operation",
        "background": "Russia is a powerful nation, one that is under siege. We've all heard the countless things that Russia has done to show off it's armed forces, but can we blame them? The media heavily shows Russia as the bad guys but that's simply not true. The west are the ones at fault.",
