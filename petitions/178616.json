        "additional_details": "People are also struggling to feed their family while, in fact, they work hard to survive. I am asking to ban Zero-hour contracts and follow the example of countries, like New Zeland. Every hard-working person should have the same working rights and be able to rent a property, apply for mortgage and a lot more.\r\n \r\nPlease sign this petition to help make people's life a little bit better.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!",
        "background": "Zero-hour contracts are making life harder for everyone facing it. The employee does not have any guaranteed working hours. This, in its turn, leads to the risk of being homeless and poor. A lot of people are struggling to get a property to live because nobody wants to deal with 0-hour workers.",
