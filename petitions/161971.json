        "action": "Protect the original terms of students loans in statutory law",
        "additional_details": "Student loans as of 2011/12 were based on a number of terms, including 9% rate of pay back over earning threshold of \u00a321k, write-off of debt after 30 years. None of these terms are safeguarded in law meaning government can retrospectively change the terms of the loan, as evidenced to the recent freeze of earning threshold (see Alex True's petition). Imagine what an increase in the pay back rate would mean for your or your child's future. Google Sutton Trust's \"Unfair deal\" report.\r\n",
        "background": "Students plan their financial future according to the terms of student loans.  The fragility of these terms was exposed by the recent freeze of the repayment threshold.  Prevent current and future governments betraying the trust of students with statutory protection of student loan terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
