        "additional_details": "Whose lives are these major referendums going to affect? In years to come you will no longer be here and the younger generation, will be in control. But, how would you know about the long lasting effects, that your votes caused. How would you feel as a child, knowing that the adults around you were choosing your fate? We may be \"young & foolish\" but we know a lot more than you think. Despite telling our parents what they should vote, no-one listens to our voice. We make no impact, we want change",
        "background": "As a child of 12 years of age (nearly 13), it makes me feel angry that we are not allowed to vote. We may be \"young and foolish\" but it is our lives it is going to effect. Coming back from a sporting event, we were having a strong debate about the EU referendum. And decided to protest to be heard.",
