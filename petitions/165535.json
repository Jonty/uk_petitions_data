        "additional_details": "I am a keen pool, sea and river swimmer who feels shocked each and every time I hear of another life lost in the beautiful waters this country has in abundance. I never again want to hear a report of someone dying trying to save another human being or rescue a pet. I strongly believe that there can only be benefits to a nationwide swimming policy that improves health and encourages the use and support of local facilities.\r\n",
        "background": "After the tragic deaths in Aug 2016 please sign my petition asking for FREE access to swimming pools & swimming lessons to anyone under the age of 18 in the UK. Around 40% of children cannot properly swim & over 400 people drown in the UK every year. There is an easy way to reduce these figures.\r\n\r\n",
