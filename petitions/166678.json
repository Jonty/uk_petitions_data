        "action": "Move parliament away from the Palace of Westminster to Carlisle, Cumbria",
        "additional_details": "The problems of poor infrastructure, transport and communication can be ignored while the British Government continues to rule from Westminster. The North East has at least reasonable transport links; Cumbria boasts two lane trunk roads. Much of Cumbria has poor mobile signal and even poorer broadband.  What might change if the Government had to try to function in that environment.  This time Cumbria, after 10 years perhaps another northern county, then perhaps Cornwall!",
        "background": "London-centric government leads to a distorted view of the UK and a disproportionate distribution of resource. The Northern Power House discussion mistakenly sees the Merseyside/Manchester/Leeds axis as the North of England. Government from Carlisle will shift more than just the base of politics.",
