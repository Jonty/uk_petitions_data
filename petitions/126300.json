        "action": "Make carbon monoxide testers mandatory in GP surgeries",
        "additional_details": "Carbon monoxide can strike anywhere, but those most at risk are the vulnerable in our society - the young, the elderly, those with pre-existing medical conditions.\r\n\r\nHowever, what is unclear is how many victims are turning first to their family doctor for help from the 'silent killer'.\r\n\r\nAs front line protectors of the nation's health, GPs must be armed with the tools to swiftly diagnose, and therefore prevent, carbon monoxide poisoning.\r\n\r\nOnly a small percentage of GP surgeries - about one in five - have the necessary equipment to test for carbon monoxide levels in patients.\r\n\r\nThese devices cost less than \u00a3200 each and will save lives.",
        "background": "We call upon the government to make near patient breath testing devices mandatory in GP practices on the following grounds.\r\nAround 50 people die annually in the UK from carbon monoxide poisoning\r\nCO incidents also send thousands more to hospital every year\r\nTesting kits will save lives",
