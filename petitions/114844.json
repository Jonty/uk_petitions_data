        "additional_details": "Reasons:\r\n\r\nWhy did Mr Cameron decide to negotiate without asking the electorate first what we actually wanted?\r\nWhy once again has Mr Cameron not stuck to and included what he promised in the manifesto?\r\nWhy has Mr Cameron watered down the points he decided to negotiate?\r\nWhy has Mr Cameron said he is open to suggestions regarding the 4 year benefits ban?\r\n\r\n ",
        "background": "We, the electorate demand a referendum by 31st March 2016 as we do not have any faith in Mr Cameron's negotiations and they won't result in anything that would satisfy the electorate. Therefore we want to be able to vote on the future of our country as soon as possible. ",
