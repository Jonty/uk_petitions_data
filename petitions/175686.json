        "additional_details": "Cannabis prohibition was created in 1925. In 1925 there were no scientific research & evidence on the drug, where as now there is considerable scientific research, evidence & analysis which has proven that Cannabis does not damage human health. Cannabis is a natural pain reliever which helps people with conditions like Multiple Sclerosis. It helps people with epilepsy, preventing them from having seizures. It helps people who suffer from Anxiety. Alcohol & Tobacco are Dangerous, but yet legal. When will the Government follow the rest of the world & legalise Cannabis for medicinal purposes?",
        "background": "Alcohol & Tobacco are legal in this country. Each of those is a drug. Alcohol which we know is Ethanol is a drug. Tobacco which contains Nicotine & various cancer causing chemicals is a drug. These kill people. Cannabis doesn't. Why is Cannabis illegal when Alcohol & Tobacco is legal? ",
