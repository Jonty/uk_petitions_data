        "additional_details": "On the Gov.UK website it states - Before taking any action, your employer should: follow disciplinary procedures or give you a chance to improve \r\n\r\nSmall businesses accounted for 99.3% of all private sector businesses at the start of 2015 with 15.6 million people employed by SMEs. After seeking legal advice on the subject ACAS disciplinary procedures only apply after two years. So small businesses do not need to apply these and can unceremoniously make it easy to dismiss staff. ",
        "background": "I was recently dismissed without my boss following disciplinary procedures. Employees only get job protection after two years, making it easy for SMEs to dismiss staff for unfair reasons. The law needs updating to protect the millions of people employed post probation until they reach two years.",
