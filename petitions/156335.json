        "action": "Article 50 should not be invoked: the referendum was advisory and non-binding",
        "additional_details": "We can only retain free trade across the EU if we accept freedom of movement. We cannot expect UK citizens to be allowed to work in the EU if we do not accept EU citizens working here. The consequence of a failure to achieve free trade will be catastrophic for the UK economy. The referendum was a non-binding, advisory plebiscite that has no constitutional significance. The UK should therefore remain an active member, within the EU and work to improve the issues highlighted in this referendum.",
        "background": "There is only a 3.79% difference between the two sides in the referendum. This is by no means an 'overwhelming' percentage. Given the demographic breakdown of the 'remain' component of the vote and the number of people who are realising that we will gain nothing by leaving the EU, we should remain.",
