        "action": "Impose a term limit on all MPs of 10 years (2 election cycles)",
        "additional_details": "A term limit of 10 years would give an MP enough time to learn the ropes of Westminster and make a contribution. It would increase the turnover and mean that they could not make this their sole career. More people would be able to participate and so people with a more varied life experience other than pure politics would get a voice.",
        "background": "Over the past 30 years, a political class has developed of people who know nothing but politics. They have never done a real job. After PPE at Oxford or the LSE they become bag carriers, SPADs and then MPs. They live in a bubble and do not understand peoples' concerns. Let's pop this bubble.",
