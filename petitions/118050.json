        "additional_details": "The Police, Ambulance and other public services spend a large portion of their time dealing with alcohol related incidents. A great deal of alcohol related incidents involve disorder, violence and injury. This therefore requires a number of services to deal with the fallout of alcohol abuse.\r\n\r\nThe effects of alcohol abuse are well documented and frequently attract media attention. It's time to taclean binge drinking culture and create a more sensible approach to alcohol consumption. ",
        "background": "In 2005 24 hour drinking laws were established. The idea to create a continental caf\u00e9 culture in the U.K has failed and it has turned Town Centres into binge drinking, hostile areas. \r\n\r\nPublic services are overstretched and unable to cope effectively with the effects.\r\n",
