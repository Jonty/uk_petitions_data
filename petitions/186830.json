        "additional_details": "As an employee, you have the right not to be discriminated against. If a company dismisses you and you believe they have discriminated in making this decision, you have the right to appeal to an employment tribunal.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, a volunteer could put in 30 years and if something changes with their circumstances, the organisation can dismiss them. I believe they should be able to appeal this decision to a similar tribunal and volunteering should be covered by all discrimination law.",
        "background": "As a volunteer in the United Kingdom, an organisation is allowed to dismiss you without giving a reason or even on grounds of discrimination. Volunteers are the backbone of many communities in this country and I believe they should have the same rights as employee's not to be discriminated against.",
