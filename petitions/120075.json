Teacher expectations and responsibilities have expanded to cover the role of parents, social workers and counsellors. Rigourous monitoring, tracking and scrutiny have killed the creativity, independence and fun in the classroom.There is more paperwork than ever before. A school is viewed as a \"results factory\" and no longer a place of learning, nurturing and fun. ",

The work-load has increased signficantly over the past five years due to constant and rapid curriulum changes and the ever-changing OFSTED expectations. Teachers need a work-life balance. Teaching, marking and assessment have now become very time-consuming. ",
