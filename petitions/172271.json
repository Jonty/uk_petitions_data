        "additional_details": "People in prison, prisoners and staff, are\r\nless safe than they were five years ago. This year more\r\nprisoners were murdered, killed themselves, self harmed\r\nand were assaulted than ever before\r\nSerious assaults in prison have more than\r\ndoubled in the last three years. \r\nRates of self-harm are at the highest level ever\r\nrecorded. There were 32,313 self-harm incidents in\r\n2015\u2014a nearly 40% rise in just two years.\r\nWe believe this is a direct result of overcrowding and  NPS. We demand an immediate enquiry",
        "background": "The growing use of new and largely non-detectable psychoactive substances (NPS) is leading to increased violence, bullying, debt and medical emergencies requiring hospitalisation. We demand a thorough enquiry immediately to investigate the claims made in the Secret Lives of Prisons Documentary ",
