        "action": "Change the law on pricing of haircuts/colour. Shouldn't matter what sex you are.",
        "additional_details": "Females have been fighting for equal opportunities for centuries. Charging females more for a haircut is no different to females getting paid less for doing the same job as a male. There should be gender neutral pricing laws. The pricing for haircuts/colour should be based on the length of the hair, not the sex of the person having their hair done. I called Kula Kuts in Kent and Toni & guy and both these salons informed me that a female having the same haircut or colour as a male would pay more.",
        "background": "Females have been fighting for equal opportunity for decades. I called a hairdresser today to book an appointment for my partner. I asked for a price and got asked if my partner was male or female, I asked why that was important and I was told because for a female it is more expensive.",
