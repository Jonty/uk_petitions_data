        "action": "Implement stronger sentences for those convicted of assaulting police officers",
        "additional_details": "I am a serving officer with the Metropolitan Police service and have heard about and witnessed first hand details of assaults on colleagues. Colleagues who whilst on patrol get spat at, bitten, punched, kicked, sometimes repeatedly, violently assaulted. Only today two police officers were admitted to hospital in London after being assaulted challenging a youth who was carrying a knife. Police officers need to be shown respect for serving the population, and this needs to be shown via sentencing",
        "background": "Assaults on police officers have dramatically risen, with officers frequently being attacked in the line of duty. Police officers put their lives on the line protecting citizens every day and the lack of respect that people who attack them show should be reflected through stronger sentences. ",
