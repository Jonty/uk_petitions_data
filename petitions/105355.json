        "action": "Lord Prior\u2019s inquiry into the future funding of the NHS is going beyond remit.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS Constitution clearly states that the NHS belongs to us all. It doesn\u2019t belong to an insurance company, or any other kind of co-payment organisation. We don't want to be moving towards an insurance scheme, we will not introduce an American-style private system. This is yet another attack on the NHS.  This petition asks citizens to ensure this inquiry is transparent.  The NHS Constitution clearly states that the NHS belongs to us all not big business.",
        "background": "Lord Prior suggested during a Lords debate on the NHS that he would set up an inquiry into the future funding of the NHS. Apparently, now \u201cdemand outstrips supply\u201d (as he put it) in the NHS.  We do not want a NHS sell off.",
