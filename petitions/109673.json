        "additional_details": "Its time we insisted that all dogs in this country are kept on a lead in public places. The current dog laws in the UK do not go far enough to protect the public. Your dog may be YOUR best friend but when out in public you don't know who it will be friendly or not friendly with.\r\nSo why do we allow dog owners to let their dogs run free in public places and risk attack where children play, where residents young and old enjoy the outdoors and where responsible dog owners walk their dogs on a lead.",
        "background": "As a responsible dog owner, I always walk my dog on a lead. My dog and I were attacked recently by another being walked off lead on a public playing field which resulted in a nasty leg wound for my dog and a \u00a3500 vet bill.",
