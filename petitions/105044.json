        "additional_details": "Without bee's to pollinate our crops, humanity will face trying times. Bee populations worldwide are in huge decline due to the use of 'neonic' pesticides. Without them we will face crop failures and a shortage in 'real' natural foods. Do you want to live in a world were we cannot enjoy the fruits of mother nature? Bayer and Syngento are profiteering whilst these beautiful creatures that give so much are dying from their toxins. Without the bee's our time is ticking.",
        "background": "The government has lifted a ban on neonicotinoid pesticides in certain parts of the UK. An EU-wide moratorium was put in place after studies showed the pesticide caused SIGNIFICANT harm to bees. Bee populations are in massive decline, save our pollinators by signing this petition\r\n",
