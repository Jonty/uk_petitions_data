        "action": "Legalise Polygyny (marriage of more than one wife)",
        "additional_details": "Many second and third wives are being denied their conjugal rights, such as maintenance, child-maintenance, inheritance etc. due to not being legally registered by law and are treated as mistresses. The current law is irrational, discriminatory, and oppressive towards some minority cultures who deem marriage as the sole means of intimate relationship between a man and a woman, this makes it difficult for women who are widowed, divorced, or unable to find suitable husbands.",
        "background": "The institution of marriage has been redefined in the UK with the recent legalisation of same-sex marriage, we see no rational reason, scientific, religious, or otherwise for polygyny to remain illegal. Many women will remain oppressed and without rights under the current legislation.",
