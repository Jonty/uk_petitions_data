        "additional_details": "Islams fundamentals preach love, not hate. Respect not disrespect. There are millions of Muslims on earth and a very small handful are these extremists. It is unfair that all Muslims are branded as terrorists due to this. \r\n\r\nWe do not see Christianity likened to the beliefs of the KKK. Nor Hindus to the Tamil Tigers. So why Islam to Terrorists?\r\n\r\nI ask that use of Islam in a negative way, or for that matter ANY religion, be made unlawful as to not cause offence or seclusion of said religion. ",
