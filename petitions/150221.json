        "additional_details": "Since the referendum result, some of the Leave campaigners have made a number of statements about what relationships they would like to see between the UK and the EU.  However, the British public has been given no opportunity to express a view on what relationship they would like to see.  Having made a decision about leaving the EU, the British public should now be given an opportunity through a General Election to make a choice on future relationships, and about who should negotiate for us.",
        "background": "The British public has voted to leave the EU, leaving uncertainty what relationships the UK will have with other nations.  During the 2015 General Election campaign, no main UK political party set out what model they promote, so cannot claim to have a mandate to negotiate the exit terms.  ",
