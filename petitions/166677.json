        "additional_details": "It seems, for many reasons, children and their potential adopters don't get the opportunity to discuss and/or execute adoption until the child has reached legal adulthood; and by this point the UK government no longer views the said child as eligible for adoption.\r\nThe implications of this are social and legal issues that arise later in life surrounding the relationship between child and, for example, step-parent.\r\nI believe the 2002 UK Adoption and Children Act is outdated for modern day Britain.",
        "background": "Many people today do not live in traditional nuclear families; and many children form a stronger bond with a step-parent or relationship with someone of a similar nature as opposed to a biological parent.  \r\n",
