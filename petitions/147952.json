        "additional_details": "As there is already an \u00a380 fine in place for failing to register on the electoral roll, an \u00a380 for failing to turn up to vote is not much of a further stretch. \r\n\r\nVoters remain free to spoil ballots, or not mark a preference, as a form of protest voting - they simply have to turn up. \r\n\r\nWe have a few months before David Cameron resigns and athe least a year or so before we REALLY leave the EU. So many have expressed regret for voting out.. the future is still salvageable, but we have to act fast. ",
        "background": "If another referendum happens but with a similar, or worse, lower turnout - what validates the second result anymore than the first result? \r\nAustralia uses compulsory voting every general election as it delivers a strong mandate for government. 100% turnout would ensure public respect for results.",
