        "additional_details": "General Elections use FPtP and regularly leave us with governments that are endorsed by less than 30% of the electorate. The current government is only backed by 24% of voters. Is this democracy?\r\nTurnout at General Elections is regularly around 60%. Referenda, which use PR, have far higher turnout (EU 72%, Scottish Independence 85%) because the electorate feel their vote counts. \r\nFPtP is a corrupt system that no other European democracy uses. We are in the company of Yemen, Ethiopia and Eritrea.",
        "background": "Despite MP's advice, 51% voted to leave and 49% to remain in the EU Referendum. How can the current or future governments effectively represent a population so divided if we use First Past the Post? Offer us Proportional Representation. The disconnect can only be healed by greater democracy.\r\n",
