        "additional_details": "No action is ever taken against politicians whose actions while in government damages the country physically, socially or financially.\r\nBasically politicians make it up as they go along, experimenting with aspects they dont grasp or have a personal axe to grind in doing so, example, Tony Blair and the unwritten mass immigration policy, David Camerons Lisbon Treaty referendum promise.\r\nPoliticians need to be financially and personally accountable to the public, we need a law to hold them to.\r\n",
        "background": "Politicians hold a priviliged position that has the potential to create damage to the welfare of the country and its populace when personal or party agendas take precedence.\r\nUsing deceit, lies or misdirection to pass legislation or support a position is unacceptable and must stop.\r\n",
