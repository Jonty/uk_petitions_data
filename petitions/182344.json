        "additional_details": "Each year there are several incidents of Rights of Way users being severely injured or killed by livestock, equally there are many incidents of livestock being harmed, when a simple re-alignment or diversion would be beneficial to all parties.\r\n\r\nSimilarly many ancient paths are routed through domestic, farm and business premises creating safety and security issues for both users and occupiers.\r\n\r\nThe petition is not to impinge on the rights of users but to make the network fit for modern usage.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Our historic Rights of Way network is no longer fit for purpose, the legislation is complex making changes or diversions time consuming and prohibitively expensive.\r\n\r\nChanges are needed to prevent users coming in to conflict with livestock, households, business premises and farm machinery.",
