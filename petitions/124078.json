Many people are put off engineering at school, either because they (or their teachers) do not see it as a career for the academically gifted.

        "background": "Engineering as a profession is popularly confused in the UK with such occupations as plumbers, mechanics and fitters. This gives it both a lower status than it deserves and an unwarranted gender bias. This results in the UK having the lowest proportion of females in engineering in the whole OECD. ",
