        "additional_details": "From the perspective of the victim, there are far fewer resources available for the detection and apprehension of the perpetrators than there appears to be for the equivalent action against those currently considered as terrorists.\r\nWitnessing someone attempting to force entry to your home, leave and then return with a weapon to use in the event that you confront them is a very real and terror inducing prospect for many people in this country.\r\nIt MUST be accorded the appropriate seriousness.",
        "background": "The distress and terror caused by someone trying to force their way into your home is a much more real and likely occurence than any threat from those acts currently classified as terrorist. These acts, however, cause real feelings of terror in the victims with a long lasting sense of insecurity.",
