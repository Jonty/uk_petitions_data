        "action": "Enforce the government to secure cross party consensus on NHS policies.",
        "additional_details": "De-politicising the NHS would safeguard its future as all governments, present and future would have to abide by policies agreed upon by every MP at the time they are mandated. Setting a long term roadmap and a vision would prevent the chopping and changing that occurs during every new government term. Performance can then be measured according to patient needs as opposed to performance indicators that do nothing to serve the patient but instead serve the present day government.",
        "background": "For too long government after government have kicked the NHS around as a political football in a bid to win votes. This has and continues to degrade patient care. An agreed mandate by parliament should be enforced for a predetermined timeframe, irrespective of successive governments to safeguard it.",
