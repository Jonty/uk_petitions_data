        "action": "Stop the 2015-16 Immigrations Bill",
        "additional_details": "Applicants should be able to exercise their rights of appeal here in the UK, not in their home countries where they will not have access to full legal support nor their savings which have been confiscated by the UK Government. Decision mistakes made by Immigration Officers whilst interpreting the applicabe clauses and codes of guidance should give an automatic ground for an appeal. Immigrants who are financially able to rent privately should be enabled to do so whilst they await for decisions to be made on their applications and pending the outcome of an appeal. There are a lot of concerns highlighted in regard to the 2025-16 Bill. However, time and space do not permit mentioning at this time.",
        "background": "If the Bill becomes a Law it will affect many people including legal and illigal immigrants to the UK. They will suffer backlashes such as negative effects on businesses, employment, property renting or buying, banking, finances, loans, unpaid wages, education etc.",
