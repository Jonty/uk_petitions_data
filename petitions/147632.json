        "additional_details": "Misinformation during the EU referendum campaign ignored analysis showing migrants are a benefit to our economy and society.\r\nMany people currently working in the UK are fearful that they will be deported as a result of the vote.\r\nSeveral instances of racist taunts have already been recorded.\r\nParliament can show leadership and block racism by passing an immediate vote ensuring that the government cannot remove the rights of existing migrant workers and their families in the exit negotiations.",
        "background": "It is important that Parliament proves that the EU exit vote was not motivated by racism.\r\nTherefore MP's must explicitly recognise that migrant workers are a positive benefit to the UK and also reassure residents who's security has been put at risk by the exit vote",
