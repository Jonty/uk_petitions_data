Tuition fees are set to increase to \u00a313k/year, with proposed alternatives of \"fast-track\" degrees in place as an alternative.  \r\n\r\nExperience in the US has shown that, even with marked fee increases, universities struggle to make ends meet, investing in campus amenities and non-teaching roles rather than the core teaching students need.  \r\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/16/why-college-costs-are-so-high-and-rising.html",
