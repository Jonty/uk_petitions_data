This is not because I have caused \"Emotional Abuse\" to any of my children but because they think its a POSSIBILITY they could in the future. I have never harmed a child or put a child in harms way but because of goverment targets my children have been taken, my cases were based on possibilities with no evidence of wrong doing to any child let alone my own. This needs to stop, families including mine have been ruined because of social services and their lies.",
