        "additional_details": "The report can be accessed at: https://ec.europa.eu/priorities/publications/five-presidents-report-completing-europes-economic-and-monetary-union_en.\r\nIt states, 'And finally, towards a Political Union that provides the foundation - - - '. \r\nIt uses doublespeak such as, 'The euro is a successful and stable currency', not withstanding the intractable problems a common currency has given countries such as Greece.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The report proposes the completion of Europe\u2019s Economic, Monetary & Political Union.  It uses the terms 'euro area' and 'EU' in relation to its propositions; thus a likely impact on non-euro sovereign states such as the UK.\r\nMy concern is that our MPs are not fully aware of its content or impact.",
