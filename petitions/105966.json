        "additional_details": "On the 9th August, Philip Hammond told the BBC that \r\n\r\n\"Europe can\u2019t protect itself, preserve its standard of living and social infrastructure if it has to absorb millions of migrants from Africa\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33842861\r\n\r\nHe refers to the asylum seekers in Calais, but chooses to call them migrants, implying that they have made an economic decision rather than a humanitarian one. \r\n\r\nHe does this while ignoring the beneficial contributions African migrants have made.  \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Philip Hammond used scaremongering language to claim that millions of African migrants are a threat to the European standard of living, claims not based in fact. There's a big difference between the refugees in Calais and migrants who benefit the UK, both groups deserve an apology to this insult. ",
