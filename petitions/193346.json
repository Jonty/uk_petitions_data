Now negotiations have started to deliver this, however there is no commitment from the Government and Parliament to allow the citizens of the UK to have the final say on the final Brexit deal. \r\n\r\nThe will of the people should be heard and they should be able to decide if they want to accept that deal, leave the EU without a deal or stay in the EU.",
        "background": "A new referendum should be run to allow the citizens to have their say on the final deal reached just as they did in the last referendum. \r\n\r\nThe will of the people must be heard and democracy must prevail.",
