        "additional_details": "There is a next generation issue, of those people that have young families but are now stuck in the rental market.  Quite often the rental costs are higher than what a mortgage would cost, but due to the often higher rental changes to facilitate a family home these people can not accrue enough savings quickly enough to purchase a property.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "There is gap in the 'help to buy' scheme that doesn't facilitate those people who are stuck in the private rental market.  People that regularly evidence the ability to make mortgage payment, but do not have the ability to put away enough savings to reach a 5-10% deposit.",
