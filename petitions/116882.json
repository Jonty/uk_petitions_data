        "additional_details": "The Good Friday Agreement proposed a shared Northern Ireland Assembly & new cross-border institutions with the Republic of Ireland, also the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons, revised policing in Northern Ireland and the early release of paramilitary prisoners.\r\nThe conflict in Northern Ireland over 3,600 people were killed and it is estimated 50000 were injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The spirit of the Good Friday Agreement should be applied to those who served in NI (as well as paramilitaries) facing prosecution for historic allegations.  Failure to do so should result in freed terrorists being immediately returned to prison and convictions sought for prior terrorist atrocities.",
