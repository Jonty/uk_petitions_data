        "additional_details": "Our PM has already gone back on his word of decreasing migration. However, there are genuine asylum seekers who are desperately fleeing for their lives, we do need to help these genuine families. 20,000 is a generous amount. We can't save the world and we most certainly should not be accepting economic migrants who are travelling illegally through many safe countries, rioting & causing chaos to get to a richer country of their choice, these are not the actions of people fleeing for their lives.",
        "background": "Our PM will take in 20,000 refugees from Syrian bordering refugee camps. The PM is under pressure to accept more, including those travelling illegally through the EU. We must ensure this does not happen. Our own nationals face dire conditions daily on our streets, veterans for one who need our help.",
