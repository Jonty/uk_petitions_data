        "additional_details": "Jeremy hunt is a proven and serial liar, repeatedly mis-representing the evidence surrounding weekend mortality rates in NHS hospitals as an excuse to impose an unfair and unsafe contract on junior doctors. We believe that an attempt to impose this contract will undermine and threaten our NHS. We consider that the only viable solution is the immediate resignation of Jeremy Hunt, and to drop the threat to impose new contracts on junior doctors. ",
        "background": "Jeremy Hunt has lost the confidence of the doctors, and intends to impose a contract considered as unfair and unsafe by medical professionals. He is clearly unsuitable to remain the Secretary of State for Health, and does not represent the best interests of the NHS of the British public. ",
