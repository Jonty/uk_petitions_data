        "action": "Abolish plans for the Teaching Excellence Framework in Higher Education",
        "additional_details": "Current proposals to introduce the TEF are manifested within the government's plans to marketise higher education. As tuition fees rise, research funding declines for academics who are monitored in accordance with the TEF and forced to compete for funding in order to stay secure in their jobs. The consequences are that the values of higher education will change and teaching quality will decline as higher education will resemble the secondary education system.",
        "background": "The TEF will mean that teachers are subject to a disciplinary panel which monitors their performance in accordance with 'government standards'.  This bares negative consequences for students who will be taught to a test and reduces academics to the role of 'content providers'. ",
