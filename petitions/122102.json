        "action": "re nationalise the energy companies",
        "additional_details": "Its about time consumers get a fair deal for the cost of energy. When we had Nationally owned energy companies it was the Government who decided on the cost. Wholesale gas prices have dropped by 40% and slowly the energy companies are reducing the cost but not fast and always after winter and never enough. Re Nationalise the energy companies or at the very least put in place a regulator who actually represents the consumers.",
        "background": "British Gas today announced an increase in profits to \u00a3574 million pounds a 31% increase, not for the first time that profits have increased. The regulator seems to be serving the energy companies and not the consumers who have to pay. I'm sure the dividend payed to shareholders will rise.",
