        "additional_details": "Criticism of someone's policy ideas, leadership style, etc. is perfectly acceptable.  The relentless abuse conducted since the day of Corbyn's election, however, has been shameful.  The silence of government ministers gives the impression of tacit endorsement. Therefore we call upon Parliament to condemn this despicable smear campaign and subversion of democracy by out-of-control media owners pursuing vested interests, and to look again at the wisdom of press self-regulation.\r\n",
        "background": "Since the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party there has been an unprecedented campaign of personalized and vicious abuse against him.  The Daily Mail and The Sun newspapers, in particular, have been publishing, in print and online, many articles focusing on his private life.",
