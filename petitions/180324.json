        "action": "Launch an investigation into Russian influence in the EU referendum campaigns.",
        "additional_details": "The NIC ICA concluded that Russia followed a strategy that blended covert intelligence operations, such as cyber activity, with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users. These activities were conducted in the US at around the same time as the EU referendum in the UK. Breaking up the EU is a key strategic goal of Russia, so it is highly improbable that a similar campaign would not have been waged in the UK",
        "background": "The declassified US NIC ICA on Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections concluded with high confidence that Russia had engaged in an influence campaign in the 2016 US Presidential Election. Confidence in the UK EU referendum requires an assessment of any Russian influence.",
