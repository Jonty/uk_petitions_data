They're made to apply for this benefit in a totally bias and unfair way on a claim form which asks 10 questions towards daily living but only 2 on mobility, which is the main purpose for disabled people applying for this benefit, in the first place. Maybe, if there must be 12 questions, a balance of 6 for daily living & 6 for mobility would be fairer & maybe provide a better view of a individuals needs?",
