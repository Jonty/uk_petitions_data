        "additional_details": "If a gay man wants to give blood then he has to refrain from oral and anal sex for 12 months before he will even be considered! Even if they are using a condom every time and have had clear STD results then this ridiculous rule is still in place. At the same time men and women who indulge in unsafe sex with various people are allowed to give blood whenever they see fit! \r\nWhile we have come such a long way in homosexual rights rules like this are constantly holding us back! \r\n",
        "background": "I often see the NHS on my Facebook banging on about how low the blood donation supply is in hospitals and how desperate they are for more donors to come forward, yet when you get to the crooks of it a lot more blood would be available is such outdated laws were not in place. \r\n\r\n",
