        "action": "Stop the new pay scale for the armed forces. They alreay had pensions cut.",
        "additional_details": "The government have had a massive pay rise, NHS and Police also had a pay rises though not high enough more like a slap in the face. The forces had a 1% pay rise yet food, accommodation where raised higher. This means the pay is actually cut, now this new pay scale is showing the government couldn't give a damn about the personel after saying they would invest in the mod shame you can't look after the staff. NO Personel no armed forces then what hope France save us.",
        "background": "The armed forces pay scale should not be messed with due to them already having pay cuts every year. The pensions have been cut. Whilst MPs get rises and good pensions for doing little. People in the armed forces protect the uk and leave their families to do so but get really badly paid already.",
