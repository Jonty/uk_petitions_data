        "additional_details": "Various studies show that selection depresses achievement across the system and does not help social mobility.\r\nThe 75% of children who fail the 11+ suffer a severe blow to their self-esteem and motivation at a critical time in their development. Figures suggest that these children go on to do worse at secondary modern than they would have at a comprehensive.\r\nIn selective Bucks, the 11+ pass rate for FSM children was 4% in 2014, compared to 20% for state pupils and 53% for private school pupils.",
        "background": "Selection is divisive, lowers attainment and harms children and families. Selective areas have the largest achievement gaps in the country. The 11+ selects on the basis of prior opportunity and social background. Poorer children, including high ability poor children, lose out most. ",
