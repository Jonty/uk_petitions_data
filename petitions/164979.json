The tax paid on a normal tax code of 1100L takes out \u00a31,960.00 and \u00a31,528.80 national insurance annually. Migrants are not entitled to any recourse to public funds towards which they are contributing. An additional \u00a3200 levied is unjust. ",
        "background": "An immigrant who has been an employee in the UK and is a taxpayer is already contributing and has contributed enough after 3 years, specially if someone is seeking leave to remain based on Tier 2 General visa, as they will continue to contribute for the rest of their stay in UK.
