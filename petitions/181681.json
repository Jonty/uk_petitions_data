        "additional_details": "The list should be for those who help protect the country and support it outside of their paid duties. Just being rich or doing a job you're paid to do shows innate produce prejudice for the elite. We should encourage compassion and community spirit and love of our country, but the current system teaches us that if you're in the elite, or you're friends with the PM, that's all that matters. It's not supposed to be there as the PM's private thank you card.\r\n",
        "background": "Famous people, people in power and people with money shouldn't get on the honours just because they're in those positions. It's prejudicial. They need to earn it, doing things outside their normal jobs, helping people and the community within our country. Otherwise the honours are meaningless.",
