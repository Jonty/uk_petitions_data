        "additional_details": "In order to make the best of this for the UK there is a need for all to recognise that there were almost as many remainers (48pc) as leavers (52pc) . I believe that those who negotiate Brexit terms with the rest if the EU need to do so with this firmly in mind. One way of doing this would be for UK Brexit negotiators to seek terms for UK remainers (and others who wish) to retain their EU Citizenship. Greenland left the EU but retained EU Citizenship through their Danish connection.",
        "background": "The British public voted to leave the EU on 23 June 2016 by a 6% lead for leave. This decision must be respected, however, there is a need for the UK Government to negotiate Brexit terms with the rest of the EU taking into account the 48% that voted to remain. ",
