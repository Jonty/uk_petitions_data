Most agencies have panicked; saying all jobs (even if only a few weeks long) are permanent; meaning some locums will be unfairly treated tax-wise. The agencies refuse to accept the online test HMRC provide to say a work is in or out of IR35.\r\nMany posts will not be filled short term as workers will be several \u00a3k worse off per year.",
