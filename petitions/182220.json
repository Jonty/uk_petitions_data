        "additional_details": "The Road Safety Analysis (RSA) body found that there were 85,814 road incidents within a 500 mtr radius of a school equating to more than a 1,000 per month.  In 2014 the Department of Transport confirmed road deaths or serious had risen in each quarter compared to 2013.  In this period the DfT confirmed incidents increased by 6%.\r\n\r\nThese are frightening figures and it wouldn't take much to put up a few signs telling motorists to reduce their speed to 20mph at national government cost.",
        "background": "We expect all of our children to go to school safely often schools are on busy main roads or down country lanes.  Visibility of the children can be poor and parents having to go on to work, parking can also cause a temporary hazard.  We fairly request roads have their speed limits lowered to 20mph.",
