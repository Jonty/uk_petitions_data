        "action": "Make childhood vaccinations a legal requirement for state-school education",
        "additional_details": "Recent years have seen a rise in outbreaks of preventable diseases, which has been at least partially attributed to an increase in parents electing not to have their children vaccinated. These include smallpox (which had been all but eradicated by vaccination), and measles. \r\nChildren are at particular risk, due to the way they play very closely together, and their less developed immune systems.\r\nIn Australia, it is already a requirement for receipt of state welfare.",
        "background": "Un-vaccinated children pose a potentially serious risk to the health of other children - particularly those for whom vaccines are less effective or who are medically unable to be vaccinated. Where the failure to vaccinate has no medical basis, other children should be protected.",
