        "additional_details": "The most high-profile recent example of this can be found when MPs co-opted a football chant to insult the leader of the opposition:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2016/02/22/jeremy-corbyn-heckle-eu-tory-mps_n_9291642.html\r\n\r\nHowever, this issue extends far beyond a single party and into general practice for MPs. PMQs is a weekly display of such behaviour; a fact that is particularly galling as PMQs is also the main showcase for Government and Opposition achievements, arguments and ideas.",
        "background": "Overdramatic mockery of MPs, along with miscellenous catcalls and  unintelligible shouting are immature behaviours that erode public faith in the maturity of members of the house, belie the hard work these members do for the country, and waste precious debating time in a publicly observable forum.",
