        "action": "Make employers pay tax on fuel used travelling to work to encourage home working",
        "additional_details": "Many UK companies have an old fashioned approach to home working where they think the employee may not be working etc so don't allow or restrict this flexibility.\r\nMeanwhile, workers spend hours sitting in cars, wasting time, fuel, money, blocking up the roads and pumping emissions out.\r\nIf an employee is allowed to claim the tax back for the fuel used driving to work, the company can recommend home working to save money which is better all round.\r\nThe government should make this policy mandatory.",
        "background": "A significant proportion of commuters in the UK are travelling to desk based jobs where they operate a computer and a telephone. The road networks are buckling under the strain and the environment is suffering. By shifting the tax on fuel to employers, they are more likely to prefer home working.",
