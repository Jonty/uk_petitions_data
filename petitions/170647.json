        "additional_details": "By continuing with our current war on drugs, we are facilitating criminal enterprises and causing the death of thousands of users through fake, dangerously cut drugs or synthetic replacements (So called Legal High\u2019s).\r\n\r\nWe also need a new approach especially with the legalisation of Marijuana in certain US states and potentially the whole of Canada (in 2017). \r\n\r\nThe world is changing. The criminals are happy with the current law, but we feel that it\u2019s time to reform our 1970\u2019s approach to drugs.",
        "background": "We call upon the government to recognise that the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d has been a complete failure and that people will always take drugs regardless of the law.\r\n\r\nWe believe that all currently illegal drugs must be decriminalised with certain recreational drugs such as Cannabis being legalised completely",
