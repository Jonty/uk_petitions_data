Why should single parents have to pay a fee to get any support from Government? There needs to be reforms on this matter. The law needs to change so non/ under paying parents are LEGALLY forced to pay via tax/ attachment of earnings/ deductions from benefits. Or face jail!",

This should be the case here in the UK with ever more rising numbers of children being denied what is rightfully theirs. With the breakdown of CSA we need a change! We need SUPPORT!",
