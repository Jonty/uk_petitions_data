        "additional_details": "A referendum should include sixteen plus ages as in the Scottish referendum- remember these people will be eighteen plus at 'Brexit.'\r\nMany alleged 'facts' which will have influenced some voters' choices have now been shown false.\r\nWhatever the outcome, an honest referendum where genuine facts (not misinformation and bad-mouthing) dictate choices is essential. \r\nThis is important and will affect our children for years to come. ",
        "background": "Some information has now been corrected. \r\nMany voters apparently wish to change their vote in the light of greater information. \r\n16+ age citizens should vote as in the two years 'Brexit' may take they will be of age. This was also allowed in the Scottish Referendum.",
