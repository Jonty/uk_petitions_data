        "additional_details": "\"If every 8 year old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation.\" - Dalai Lama\r\n\r\nWith ever rising rates of young suicides globally our young are becoming ever more detached and disenfranchised. Mental health is now a very serious issue for our growing generations. As little as 5 minutes of gentle meditation each morning will help our young to feel more connected to themselves and the world around them.",
        "background": "We wish to petition for meditation to be introduced into the national curriculum at nursery, primary and secondary levels. The benefits of daily meditation on a developing brain are endless. Focus, clarity, calm - fundamental qualities that can help a young mind stay healthy and happy into adulthood",
