        "additional_details": "We need a clear articulation of the allocation of the \u00a3350m/week EU contribution savings (farmers, VAT on fuel, NHS, university research?) & our international trade plan (linked to our policy on immigration).  This plan must be reviewed by the Office for Budget Responsibility, to ensure the assumptions are deliverable, or what compensation is needed via tax & spending. For legitimacy, the country must then agree this plan, either via a referendum or parliament, prior to Art 50 being triggered",
        "background": "Every business, let alone the world\u2019s 5th largest economy, must have a plan, including key policies & assumptions. UK rejected Cameron\u2019s plan, but has not agreed the exit plan. Starting an irreversible Art 50 exit process without the country agreeing a plan/manifesto would lack democratic integrity",
