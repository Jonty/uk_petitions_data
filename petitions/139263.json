        "action": "The UK must not leave the European Economic Area (EEA) without a referendum",
        "additional_details": "The European Economic Area (EEA) comprises all 28 EU member states plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Membership of the EU and EEA is separate, as evidenced by Croatia's joining of the EU on 1st July 2013 and its delayed provisional joining of the EEA on 12th April 2014. Most rights enjoyed by citizens of EU countries apply equally to citizens of EEA countries, most notably the free movement of people. If the UK leaves the EU without leaving the EEA, it will be similar to Norway or Iceland.",
        "background": "The UK voted in a referendum on 23rd June 2016 to leave the European Union. No referendum has been held on whether the UK should leave the European Economic Area (EEA). Therefore we, the undersigned, ask HM Government to legislate that the United Kingdom cannot leave the EEA without a referendum.",
