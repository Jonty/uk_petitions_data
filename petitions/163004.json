        "action": "Increase government funding for youth clubs across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "The importance of youth clubs go unnoticed, they help thousands of young people get out and meet new people. They relieve built up stress and help with issues that can affect mental health. By raising the funds it allows more young people to be involved in society and make a positive impact towards the community.",
        "background": "Many people have little awareness about the issues that face young people. Youth clubs support ANYONE in issues they face and help them tackle them but also enjoy themselves. However, there is little awareness, funding or volunteers to help support them so we want the government to increase funding.",
