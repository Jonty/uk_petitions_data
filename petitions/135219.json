        "additional_details": "In light of the EU Referendum with a voting turnout of 72.2%, and the massive discrepancy between age groups, as well as the tight victory margin, a high voting turnout is vital for a true democratic government. According to the last YouGov poll before the referendum, 72% of 18 to 24-year-olds were in favour of a Remain vote. This 18-24 age bracket are also the most likely to live away from home in a non-permanent residence. Ensuring easy access to voting must be a priority of any democracy.\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned request the government to swiftly implement a new Electronic Voting System. The new E-voting system should allow voting from any computer once standard registration has taken place. The number on your poll card should be used as a personal ID number.\r\n",
