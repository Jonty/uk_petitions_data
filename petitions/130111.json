        "additional_details": "See example adverts: http://sexistads.org/#ads\r\n\r\nThere is a repeated message in adverts that men are stupid, inferior, sex objects and that their role is purely to serve women. This stereotype is sexist and damaging young men and boys.\r\n\r\nThese adverts would be completely unacceptable if the sexes were reversed. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.\r\n\r\nWe propose: a \"would this be offensive if we changed the ['sex', 'race', 'age', 'religion']?\" test to be applied to all adverts.",
        "background": "There is currently a double standard in adverts for what is and isn't considered sexist for men and women.\r\n\r\nIn many adverts men are mocked, ridiculed, sexualized/objectified in ways that would be completely unacceptable if the sexes were reversed.\r\n\r\nLet's have some equality.",
