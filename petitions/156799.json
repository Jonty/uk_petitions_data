I know of many others that have the same issues with various other bodies too and I am by no means alone in this. The government has made some amazing steps to transparency and freedom of information, so why keep this barrier in place?",
        "background": "All public and government bodies should abolish their premium rate 0844, 0845, 0870 and similar numbers and should convert to Freephone (0800) or Local Rate (01/02/03) numbers. \r\n\r\nAn example is the SIA; a license costs \u00a3220 for 3 years yet I am still expected to call them on a premium number. NO!",
