        "additional_details": "Research published by Mercer HR suggested there was a statutory minimum of 14 Bank Holidays in Spain, 13 in Portugal, 12 in Greece, 11 in France, and nine in Germany and Ireland. Establish ABH recognises the impact of austerity on hard working families and the need for an additional Bank Holiday to support families through this ongoing period of hardship.\r\n",
        "background": "Research shows that British workers lose out with just eight bank holidays a year, in comparison with the European average of 10.8 and fewer bank holidays for British workers is on top of them getting the least statutory annual leave in Europe. ",
