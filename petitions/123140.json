        "additional_details": "In school, uniforms, prevent bullying, discrimination or otherwise mean behaviour by preventing children from being able to distinguish between each other on a socio-economic basis. Children of wealthy parents are unable to critique other children on the basis of the clothes they wear.\r\n\r\nSince this behaviour is also found in the House of Commons it should be curbed by imposing a uniform, similar to ones found in schools across the country.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35651049",
        "background": "Given that some MPs are unable to behave with a maturity greater than that found in a year 8 classroom, they should be required, by law, to wear a uniform, whilst attending the House of Commons, to prevent bullying or harrassment on the basis of socioeconomic background and focus on their work.",
