        "additional_details": "Voting influenced by lies is not democracy; it is a perversion of democracy. In campaigning for Brexit, many untrue and misleading public statements of fact were made, most notably on the side of a red bus. Knowingly false statements in order to influence voters should be a criminal offence. The offence would cover anyone making public statements of fact, including politicians, newspapers and authors of fake news. Only statements made with the intention of influencing voting would be covered.",
        "background": "Make it a criminal offence for any person to make a public representation of fact that they know is, or might be, untrue or misleading and where they intend, by making the representation, to influence voting in an election or referendum. This wording is based on Section 2 of the Fraud Act 2006.",
