        "background": "The figures quoted, pre tax, of \u00a330,000 outside and \u00a340,000 inside London, do not reflect the true cost of living especially within the housing and rental markets in London and the rest of the UK. This is yet another form of taxation using local authorities to act as tax collectors instead of HMRC.",
