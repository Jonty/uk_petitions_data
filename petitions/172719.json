        "action": "Stop the DVSA implementing EU rules for bikers",
        "additional_details": "Ever since the changes to the bike test when the DVSA brought it a 2 part test and then later on different categories, biking for newcomers has been increasingly difficult. I think this trend has to be reversed, the changes have only discouraged new bikers. 2 wheeled transport is extremely efficient and helps reduce congestion, as well as being an enjoyable hobby for many people. We need to take a stand against any further detrimental legislation.",
        "background": "The DVSA are set to bring in further EU legislation in 2018 to make a minimum weight and power for category A motorcyclists wishing to take a test. I don't think these changes will have any positive effects on biking, in fact just the opposite. We voted to leave the EU, new rulings should be void.",
