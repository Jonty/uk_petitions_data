        "additional_details": "Much of the information provided by both Leave and Remain campaigns was proven false either during or after the EU Referendum. As such trust will have been shaken in the new prospective Conservative leaders. A general election would ensure that the will of the people is maintained going forward. With opposition parties now also under new leadership a new contest should be issued to ensure that parliament still holds the people's views in the highest regard.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Following the EU Referendum and new information that has arisen regarding the campaigns for Leave and Remain a general election should be called via a vote of no confidence (Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011) to ensure that it is the will of the people to accept the new leadership of this government.",
