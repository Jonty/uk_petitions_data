        "action": "Decriminalise brothels - allow sex workers the right to work together for safety",
        "additional_details": "In the UK running a brothel is illegal. This means 2 freelance Sex Workers can't work from the same flat for safety.\r\n\r\nThe brutal & degrading Soho Raids in 2013 saw women dragged in front of press in the street half-naked & falsely accused of theft, drug taking & being coerced. This has contributed further towards our marginalisation.\r\n\r\nDecriminalising breaks stigma/stereotypes & protects those who enter the profession out of choice & people forced into it as they can approach the police safely.",
        "background": "More than 1 Sex Worker working in a building is considered a brothel. Decriminalising makes it safe to work together, form trade unions, report crimes & be protected by regular employment laws. Criminalising workers/clients pushes Sex Work underground, making it more dangerous & harder to regulate.",
