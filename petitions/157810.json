The current uncertainty is causing political and economic turmoil.  The public has not yet had the opportunity to evaluate how each political party will approach these negotiations. Following Cameron's resignation, the next Prime Minister must have sufficient public approval to negotiate with authority.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/2016GeneralElection/\r\n",

It is undemocratic for negotiations to proceed without this.",
