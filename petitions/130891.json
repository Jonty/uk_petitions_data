        "action": "Introduce realistic maximum time for DBS applications for people trying to work.",
        "additional_details": "These stresses and strains caused to peoples livelihoods need to be dramatically reduced. Many people are waiting over 5 months (in some cases over 7) uncertain of when they can financially support themselves and their families.\r\nMany applications made to the DBS are for roles within the health and social care sector, increasingly under pressure through lack of staff. \r\nThe government should also consider that such delays in peoples wages also directly impacts upon income tax payments.",
        "background": "DBS disclosures are needed to protect vulnerable people, yet thousands of people with families are waiting months to start a job they have been offered. This causes detrimental effects to peoples health and well being and in some cases homelessness. \r\n",
