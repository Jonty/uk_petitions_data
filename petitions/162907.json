        "action": "Help London workers and locals be home owners: restrict multi-property buying.",
        "additional_details": "Laws need to be put into place to restrict mass buying from wealthy individuals, as well control on companies.\r\nLondon is driven by its workers/locals but house prices are causing people to leave to other cities. Plus those commuting into London are being pushed further out as the outskirts also become unaffordable. \r\nThis petition urges the Government implement laws to help more people become home owners in the Capital, and restrict the benefits to investors raking in ridiculous rental income!",
        "background": "London house prices keep soaring, and only wealthy UK and foreign investors benefit as they buy up the capital, at prices only they can afford. Home owning is unattainable for locals and workers living in the capital, making renting their only option. Again, rents are high and saving to buy is hard.",
