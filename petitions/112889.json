        "additional_details": "My evidence is the Paris attack this is only one of many incidents. Many people were killed on Friday 13th November and we can get right these mistakes if we (England) close our border and not let in the immigrants we could prevent the number of wars. It is believed that many uk citizens stand with me and want just English people in our country to stop immigrants from disrupting family's and our environment.i therefore today want a war free world because this could disturb education& other stuff",
        "background": "This means that all immigrants can stay out and if they don't like the way the UK is run then they can leave. If we don't allow immigrants to come in then we would have a peace environment therefore, all those who were killed in Paris we could try and never let that happen again.",
