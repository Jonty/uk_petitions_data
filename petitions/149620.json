        "action": "Hold a referendum on whether to accept the negotiated EU exit terms",
        "additional_details": "It was implied by the Leave campaigners during the run up to the referendum that a vote to Leave would result in:\r\n\r\n- A very significant drop in immigration from the EU\r\n- A very significant increase in the amount spent on the NHS\r\n- The ability to stay in the single market\r\n- A significant drop in household energy bills\r\n\r\nIt now transpires these claims may not be true. We do not want unfavourable exit deal terms.\r\n\r\nPlease do not sign this petition if you are not a British citizen or UK resident.",
        "background": "The public voted to leave the EU based on assurances that this would enable us to determine immigration policy and secure trade deals that would be beneficial to our economy. The exit deal should be agreed before article 50 is invoked; then a referendum on whether to accept them or remain in the EU.",
