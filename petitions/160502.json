Less JSA claimants. Less students debts. The list goes on. It usually takes years and I mean years for Graduates to secure their relevant job roles due to lack of experience. Yes, you may say that they can do work experience while searching but that's not always the case due to lack of finance.",
        "background": "I have found many Graduates I know who are unable to secure themselves job roles due to lack of experience. Also according to The Guardian in 2013, almost half of the Graduates are jobless. They are rejected due to the fact that they do not have 1 year experience. Exception is for those who have it.",
