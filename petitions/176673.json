        "additional_details": "Laser eye surgery is available on the NHS for eye conditions that, without treatment, can lead to loss of vision. However, it\u2019s not available for conditions that can be treated successfully in other ways, such as refractive (focusing) errors. \r\n\r\nThe reasons for this are that the effect is life changing for the person receiving the treatment. The current means of correcting refractive errors, glasses, are not for everyone.",
        "background": "For those people who where glasses and those who do not, as a 20 year old, I struggle with the prospect of knowing that I will have to see the greatest years and future years of my life behind glass, as I am unable to afford the treatment myself. \r\n\r\n",
