        "additional_details": "In 2015 two boys from Derbyshire were convicted of animal cruelty after beating a disabled dog which eventually died of head injury and was also found to have a broken jaw. \r\n\r\nThey were eventually sentenced to 23 weeks in prison. This was brought on by a petition signed by 7,000 people to have the boys put behind bars. \r\n\r\nThough there sentence was protested against as the two boys and many others are likely to reoffend. \r\n\r\nThese cases may be shocking, but are very common and happen every day.",
        "background": "On average, every 30 seconds a call is made to report a case of animal cruelty. \r\n\r\nCurrent legislation is in place to protect animals, however it is often over looked and is not treat as seriously. \r\n\r\nThe punishment for animal abusers is very weak and I am pledging for them to be strengthened.
