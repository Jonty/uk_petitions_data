        "additional_details": "David Miliband is an international statesman to the core who should never have been outvoted by the unions. He won the mandate of his party members but was let down by an archaic system. Quite simply, there is no other alternative leader in with a chance to take over from Jeremy Corbyn. David has the charisma to win a general election and fight to keep Britain in the EU after the referendum campaign was won on lies and deceit. DAVID WE NEED YOU! PLEASE COME BACK AND SAVE US FROM THE TORIES!",
        "background": "Britain is in crisis following the result of the referendum and at the time when the country most needs a strong opposition, while the Tories are falling apart, they are fighting internally. Looking back, we can still see that Ed was always the wrong Miliband and David has the X Factor to become PM",
