        "action": "Hold a parliamentary debate on the re-introduction of selective State Education",
        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister argues that the re-introduction of grammar schools will enhance social mobility. However the evidence on the ground in those few areas where selective education remains entrenched is that though it may do so for the lucky few, many more are left behind. Selection favours affluent families who pay for the extra coaching to pass the selection tests and obstructs access for the poorest. ",
        "background": "The Government has announced the return of selection in Secondary Education in England without any manifesto commitment or mandate to do so and 40 years after it was abolished as socially divisive and intrinsically unfair to the economically less advantaged. ",
