        "additional_details": "We are told at a young age that we can be whatever we want to be: a spaceman, an engineer or a football player. But this isn't the truth, the education system slowly pushes those dreams out of you and turns you into a robot to society. You MUST do well in school. You MUST get a good job. You MUST earn money. If money is hapiness then how do you explain millionaires committing suicide? We are taught stuff we never need, teach the principles, give a choice, then teach the extras if they chose to.",
        "background": "Students are all taught the same thing, but told to be different. We aren't taught taxes or the laws. Did you know it's a human right to know the human rights? We are robbed of our creativity and passion. I am asking for your help to save our future generations. Teach us the truth.",
