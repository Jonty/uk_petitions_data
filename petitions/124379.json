        "additional_details": "Cases of meningitis and septicaemia due to Men W have been increasing in England, from 22 cases in 2009 to 117 in 2014. The increase seems to be speeding up in 2015, caused by an aggressive strain of the bug. But it's fatal in about 1 in 10 cases and can lead to long-term health problems.\r\nMen W infections are particularly severe and usually need to be treated in intensive care. They have a higher death rate than the more common Men C and Men B strains.",
        "background": "My son contracted the Men W strain of meningococcal septacimia at age 20 months in April 2015, he was extremely poorly and got turned away from 3 health professionals as having a virus until I went by my cut instinct and took him to the children's hospital. He had no rash and we almost lost him.",
