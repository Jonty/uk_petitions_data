        "additional_details": "All too often \"I respect the outcome of the referendum to leave the European Union...but\" is uttered by fervent supporters of the EU.  \r\n\r\nIt is all too often accompanied by proposals of a second referendum \"on the terms\" of our exit from the EU; this is designed to undermine UK government negotiations and ultimately thwart the outcome of the referendum of the 23rd June 2016.\r\n\r\nA second referendum should only be on the terms agreed to EXIT the EU.",
        "background": "Including \"remain\" in any second referendum on the deal achieved by the UK government would only serve to undermine the governments position and be intended to prevent the UK leaving the European Union.\r\n\r\nMPs that wish to ignore the vote of the British people should reveal themselves.",
