        "action": "Strengthen laws to prosecute individuals who make false allegations of abuse",
        "additional_details": "False allegations of sexual and other types of abuse have a catastrophic effect upon the lives of those who are accused. Furthermore, making such allegations, whether motivated by a desire for vengeance, attention or compensation, also casts doubt on genuine complaints of abuse and undermines public confidence in our justice system. A review mechanism whereby compensation awarded to false accusers can be recovered (where convictions are later quashed by the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court) should exist. ",
        "background": "This petition calls for a Parliamentary debate to review whether current laws relating to the offences of perjury and perverting the course of justice are fit for purpose and that they are being pursued with vigour by the Crown Prosecution Service in cases of false allegations of abuse. \r\n\r\n",
