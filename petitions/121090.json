        "action": "The European Union referendum should not be held before September 2016.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed renegotiated terms highlight the lack of ambition in seeking to reform our membership and the lack of value placed on the United Kingdom as a member nation. We would risk influencing decision making in elections to the devolved administrations and local government because party positions on the EU would have to be explained alongside their manifesto. Young first time voters and students would only just be through exam season and lack the time to comprehend the meaning of their vote.",
        "background": "The EU referendum is a \"once in a lifetime decision\", to rush to holding the referendum as early as June would be foolish.  This is too close to both the local elections, the exam season and limits the ambitions of the negotiations; it affords no time to consider alternatives. Why rush? ",
