My provider refuses to refund and says it is the app provider\u2019s responsibility. I have a contract with my mobile provider and they should have a duty of care and stop these scams operating on their network. Payphoneplus, the premium rate regulator say this particular transaction is outside their remit due to the contract between my provider and the app.",
