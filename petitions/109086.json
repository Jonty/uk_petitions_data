        "additional_details": " It is already illegal for a person to do this if they have a legal obligation to protect them such as they are their parent or it is their job (e.g lifeguard). It doesn't necessarily mean you have to physically help, but at least call emergency services. This would help human kind grow and help each other in need, imagine how many people's lives could be saved if someone knew it was illegal (not just frowned upon) to walk away. Many countries have already made this law and so should we.",
        "background": "A Good Samaritan Law, is a law which makes it illegal for someone to witness a person in danger and ignore it. An example may be, a person who passes someone they don't know drowning, and ignoring them.",
