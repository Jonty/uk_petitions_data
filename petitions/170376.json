        "additional_details": "Women on average use around 11,000 disposable sanitary products in a lifetime, which end up in a landfill or the sea. The time it takes for a tampon or pad to degrade in landfills is centuries, particularly when wrapped in a plastic bag. Ocean Conservancy volunteers collected 27,938 used tampons and applicators on our world\u2019s beaches on a single day (International Coastal Cleanup, 2013). Since a menstrual cup can last for up to 10 years, using one would prevent a decade's worth of waste.",
        "background": "According to a Huffington Post article women spend \u00a36000 on sanitary products in a lifetime.Providing menstrual cups on the NHS would save women thousands. As they are reuseable it not only provides a good solution for the costly issues but also the environmental issues that sanitary products create",
