        "additional_details": "For the following reason.\r\nNobody who voted in the June 2016 EU In/Out referendum, neither Leave or Remain voters or the 13m people who didn't vote, knew what the terms of the deal were. Therefore voters didn't have an opportunity to be able to make a fair comparison of either choice, which puts in to question the validity of the result. If the deal is implementated without consulting the electorate first, it will not have the mandate of the electorate.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call for the terms of any deal that is agreed with the EU after the June 2016 referendum are put to an in an In/Out referendum against our current relationship, before the European Council are notified of our intention to withdraw under 'Article 50' of the Lisbon Treaty.",
