        "action": "Theresa May; Appoint a Minister of State for Climate Change",
        "additional_details": "Since the creation of the Energy and Climate Change department, climate change policy has largely been driven by using more sustainable energy sources. A new Climate Change Minister working in the Business department  could design new climate change policies that are not only just focused on sustainable energy sources. A new Climate Change Minister could be responsible for growing the green economy and encouraging corporate social responsibility.",
        "background": "In Theresa May's first Cabinet appointments she abolished the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change moving the brief with Business. To ensure that Climate Change is at the heart of British politics we want a Climate Change Minister to work with all departments.",
