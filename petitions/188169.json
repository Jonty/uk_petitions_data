Hence St. David's Day is not a public holiday (unlike St. Andrew's Day in Scotland and St. Patrick's Day in Ireland). St. David's Day occurs on the 1st of March. Note please that this is a summary, not a quote.\r\nSource: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/st-davids-day-google-doodle-wales-welsh-lovespoon-leeks-daffodils-dragon-a7605041.html",

I don't see why this day shouldn't have a presence in the calendar. Wales is a very respectable part of the UK. Welsh culture is beautiful and deserves to be embraced. ",
