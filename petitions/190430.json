        "additional_details": "Both my sister and I were diagnosed as Coeliacs in 2009 and since, we have relied on prescription food as in supermarkets, this suitable food is over-priced. For example, \u00a33 for a loaf of bread that is half the size but double the price of an ordinary loaf yet after contacting the local NHS rep, we were told that bread and flour are not essential in everyday life which I strongly disagree with! \r\nPlease sign this petition as many people simply cannot afford to pay this extortionate prices!\r\n",
        "background": "Earlier this year, we were informed that gluten free food would no longer be available on prescription. In my opinion this is ridiculous and when my sister and I were diagnosed as coeliac, this service was incredibly helpful and I believe that this is not an area in which funding should be cut!",
