        "additional_details": "We as parents should have the choice to take our children out of school for the 20 days holiday that the government says we are entitled to as full time employees in this country. Schools should be open 50 weeks of the year with a only a week at Christmas and Easter as compulsory terms. All other holidays should be chosen by parents with a minimum of 4 weeks to be taken during the year but obviously not during exam times.",
        "background": "I would like to see the right to flexible school holidays passed to the parents and not just governed by local councils and schools. The old system is out of date and does not reflect modern living where both parents work. ",
