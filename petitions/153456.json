        "action": "Bring in informed consent legislation for elections and referendums.",
        "additional_details": "Many voters have said they did not fully understand the EU referendum. Politicians used false figures and misleading information in official campaigns to manipulate voters\u2019 decisions. This impinges on voters\u2019 right to self-determination, because they were not fully informed. There is legislation to protect the same rights in other professions, there should also be similar ones for politics and government.",
        "background": "It is currently legal for political bodies to use false or misleading information in the run up to a vote. Introducing Free, Prior, Informed Consent(FPIC) legislation for elections would hold politicians accountable for misleading or manipulating voters as well as make sure people are aware of risks",
