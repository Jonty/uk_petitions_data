        "additional_details": "- There is not a single tube line that runs along the south side of the river. \r\n- Only 5 tube lines extend over the river: District (4 stops only), Victoria (3 stops only), Bakerloo (3 stops only), Jubilee (hardly) and Northern.\r\n- Out of 270 tube stations there are only 29 in South London, roughly 1/10. \r\n",
        "background": "After moving away from West London and closer to the centre, it somehow now takes me longer to move around due to the lack of tube lines running south of the river. A new line with better links to Central London would drastically shorten journey times of South Londoners looking to travel elsewhere.",
