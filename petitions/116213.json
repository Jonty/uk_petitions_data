        "additional_details": "All schools are now required to promote \"British\" Values alongside their curriculum- as part of the spiritual, moral and cultural development of pupils, outlined in the educations act (2000). These values are listed as: Democracy, individual liberty, mutual respect and tolerance- all of which are fundamental principles, but by no means unique to Britain.This label excludes UK citizens who do not identify as 'British'. By renaming \"British Values\" Citizenship, we would negate this problem.",
        "background": "Teaching of \"British\" values in schools has become compulsory,  however the label \"British\" contradicts what these values stand for. Instead of promoting mutual respect, tolerance and individual liberty- it breeds exclusion. Renaming the scheme Citizenship solves this issue. You can solve this issue",
