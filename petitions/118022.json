        "additional_details": "Our Government should condemn them outright and make it clear they are not welcome in the UK. We want to ban Donald Trump for his hateful views, arguably Saudi Arabia are far worse for their archaic laws, executing gay people, atheist and women can never be justified and as a country that is supposed to stand for human rights we should stand firm. ",
        "background": "Saudi Arabia have just executed 47 people including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr which has inflamed tensions in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia also execute gay people and treat women as second class citizens. The way they treat their own citizens is abhorrent, it is not a justice system, it is barbaric. ",
