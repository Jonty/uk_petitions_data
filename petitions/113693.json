        "action": "Disallow the filibuster procedure on debates In the Houses of Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "Recently we have seen the act of filibustering by Philip Davies MP. The democratic process of voting on legislation is easily derailed if an MP or Party does not like or understand the importance of it.  The debate to have First Aid on the curriculum was stopped in its tracks.  First Aid teaches our children lifesaving procedures; It educates them on how fragile our bodies are; having first aid skills would even help save our precious NHS.  Alas this necessary life lesson has been filibustered. ",
        "background": "'A filibuster is a parliamentary procedure where debate over a proposed piece of legislation is extended, allowing one or more members to delay or entirely prevent a vote on the proposal'.  Filibustering is akin to the diabolical act of gerrymandering and should not be a part of our democracy.",
