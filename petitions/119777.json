        "additional_details": "There are countless cases where criminals have been convicted with the help of DNA finger printing as part of the investigation. There are also documented cases of wrongful conviction where DNA finger printing would have eliminated a falsely accused defendant at an earlier stage. \r\nSince it is virtually impossible for a member of the public to access and use this information then nobody has anything to fear. \r\nBy DNA finger printing at birth there maybe a case for it to be a deterrent to initiating a criminal activity in later life.\r\nWhy could anyone object?",
        "background": "I believe that everyone should be DNA tested and registered from birth in order to make it safer and faster to solve crime. I include any person who wishes to work in the UK for any period of time. I do not suggest we should test visitors coming to the UK on vacation.",
