The people have spoken and The E.U is not the democratic system we are led to believe. The people don't vote the politicians in. It's an elite club.  The N.H.S is over stretched, schools have far too big class sizes and blue collar work wages are the lowest in years. As for the firms, banks and businesses thinking of leaving; go! The loss of this trade will only result in more independent businesses.",
