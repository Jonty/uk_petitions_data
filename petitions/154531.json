        "additional_details": "Evidence\r\n\r\nWe have not won a major tournament in fifty years despite hosting the richest football league in the world.\r\n\r\nRoy Hodgson was the wrong appointment and has proven it over 2 abysmal tournaments; lacking leadership & tactical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe forerunners for the job are debatable: Gareth Southgate although doing a great job with the young Lions is noway near ready and Gary Neville didn't cover himself in glory at Valencia. If they were to get the role it would just be a job for the boys.",
        "background": "We the undersigned would like the opportunity to vote on who should be England's next national football manager.\r\n\r\nWe have lost faith in the English FA's ability to choose an able successor and believe the public should choose democratically. As a nation we should have a say in who leads our team.",
