        "action": "Personally apologise to HM Forces personnel dismissed due to their sexuality.",
        "additional_details": "Not one individual subjected to investigation and dismissal from HM Forces, has ever received an apology. \r\nIn 2007, the MOD provided a watery statement of recognition, but  many didn't know about it and it certainly wasn't personal. \r\nThere is a moral obligation to apologise for this treatment. The effects of these investigations are still very real for these people.\r\nGiven the law in this area was only repealed in the 2016 revision of the Armed Forces Bill, the time is right to apologise.",
        "background": "Thousands of serving gay military personnel suffered intrusive investigations into their sexuality, losing homes, careers and friends. Many faced homelessness, rejection and no suitable alternative career. Many experience unemployment and poor mental health, even now.\r\nWe demand a personal apology.",
