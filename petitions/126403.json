        "additional_details": "My experience is just one of many incidents in which Forces personnel are singled out and discriminated against. The Police can do nothing about it because the Armed Forces aren't recognised as a group in law. \r\n\r\nWith events in the past, such as the killing of Lee Rigby, it has become apparent that anyone with a Forces background is a potential target for hate crimes and discrimination. A change in the law will give the police the power to investigate and prevent further serious incidents.",
        "background": "I am, and always have been, very proud of the fact that I am an RAF Veteran. Recently though, when I tried to make a purchase from a retailer, I was told that the owner didn't work with \"Murderers and Terrorists\" He had seen a picture of me in uniform, and so decided I was, in effect, a terrorist.",
