        "action": "Investigate misrepresentation in the EU referendum. Hold another if necessary.",
        "additional_details": "E.g. claims regarding money sent to the EU, countries applying for member status, and economic viability may have misrepresented facts and impacted the referendum outcome, and thus our rights and status as EU citizens. There is no official authority to challenge the integrity of campaign materials provided. We call upon the government to investigate if these claims go beyond bias. If found to do so, we call for a 2nd referendum, where undemocratic misrepresentation to gain votes is prevented.",
        "background": "The undersigned believe there is significant cause to challenge whether during the EU referendum 2016 both the Leave and Remain campaigns spread misinformation, which went beyond campaign bias, in order to gain votes. Despite rebuttals, voters were not properly informed of this misinformation.",
