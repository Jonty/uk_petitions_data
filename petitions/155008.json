        "additional_details": "Transcript | Nigel Farage's European Parliament speech\r\n\r\n\"What I\u2019d like to see is a grown-up and sensible attitude to how we negotiate a different relationship. I know that virtually none of you have never done a proper job in your lives, or worked in business, or worked in trade, or indeed ever created a job. But listen, just listen\".\r\n\r\nMEPs booed. Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, called for order.\r\n\r\nThese comments do not help UK/EU international relations.  ",
        "background": "This petition calls on the UK Government to request Nigel Farage MEP to abstain from 'representing' the British people before a new Prime Minister is appointed. Mr Farage's comments to the EU Parliament on 28 June 2016 do not represent the official position of UK during a period of national crisis.",
