        "additional_details": "A large amount of plastics marked 'recyclable' are not recycled in the UK (mostly mixed plastics) and are instead sent abroad to be disposed of. As a result of this, we need to open far more facilities capable of processing and recycling mixed plastics. Our use of non-recyclable plastic is unsustainable, irresponsible and unnecessary. ",
        "background": "We need to stop thinking that plastic waste is being dealt with to the degree at which it is advertised. We do not need non-recyclable plastic, and this is evident by the amount we only use once - then throw away every day.",
