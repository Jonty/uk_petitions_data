        "additional_details": "It is criminal that insurance companies can be allowed to impose punitive action against innocent victims of crime.\r\n\r\nOur justice system and British values are built on innocent until proven guilty and punishing perpetrators of crime not the victims.\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear the Financial Conduct Authority is incapable of regulating the insurance industry and ensuring ethical behavior is enshrined into the financial sector and so we must pass laws to stop this diabolical behavior.\r\n",
        "background": "As a victim of more than eight hit & run accidents against our motor vehicle in four years, of which five were reported to the police with no action other than receiving a crime number.\r\n\r\nWe have now been declined renewal on our motor insurance.\r\n",
