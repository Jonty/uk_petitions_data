Whilst you should never judge anyone by their uprbringing and parental decisions, this policy will help readress the imbalance, elitism and career politics which has dominated recent years.",
        "background": "MP's today are often accused of being out of touch with the general public across all parties. The proposed policy will not only allow MP's to understand the realities of the majority of the public, but will help inform policy decisions and create a fairer society.",
