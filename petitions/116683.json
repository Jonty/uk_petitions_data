        "action": "Completely Ban the Practice of Conversion Therapy",
        "additional_details": "The UK health organisations have only condemned this 'treatment' by saying it could be 'Potentially Harmful and Unethical' this does not go far enough to protect individuals. Why aren't we also setting an example that Conversion Therapy not only is wrong and harmful, but you can't change someone because they are Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Polyamorous,  Intersexual, Asexual, Straight or Pansexual or any other sexuality. Ontario and 4 US states have banned the practice and soon shall Malta.",
        "background": "It is appalling that in a society today people believe that Conversion Therapy can help people who 'aren't' Heterosexual. The so-called therapy does significantly more harm than good on an individual and shouldn't be allowed to continue.",
