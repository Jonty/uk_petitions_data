        "additional_details": "We need to provide aid for civilians affected by the war, to help them maintain a way of life. A temporary closure of boarders could help us take stock and actually provide real help. We are all human and its not fair to cast aside devastated people because we are fortunate. The fear of extremist terrorism is tearing us apart which will help only give the terrorist what they want - us debating. ",
        "background": "Closing the boarders maybe a necessary action to avoid further devastation in a non-Muslim state, but it is not fair to refuse refugee's of a war ridden country a better way of life, so lets provide aid for them to build a safe community so they can live in their own country away from the warzones.",
