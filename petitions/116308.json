In England we still have to pay to visit the sick in Hospital if we take the car.What is even more alarming is that disabled drivers also have to pay the same fees.The Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt pledged that he would crack down on parking charges and fines. That has not happened and fees continue to rise. A total of 46 NHS trusts have admitted making more than \u00a31million a year each from parking charges of up to \u00a34 an hour. ",
        "background": "How have we allowed this to happen ? Paying to park in hospital car parks to visit our sick relatives or friends.
