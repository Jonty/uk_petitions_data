        "additional_details": "We do care because it involves OUR future. Statistics show that if 16 and 17 year olds were allowed to vote then 80% of the young adults would have voted to stay in. That says something about the world they wanted to live in. However, it was decided for US that we were to leave the EU by people much older than us that may or may not be affected by the consequences of such action. Stop deciding for us. Let us decide our future; Let us decide the world we live in. \r\nOur country. Our future. Let our voices be heard.\r\n",
        "background": "Power to the Youth is a campaign that was created by a group of passionate 16 year olds that care about the world we live in very much. WE are tired of being indocrinated.  Many of us young people are criticised by the media as not having enough care about politics and our country but we do.",
