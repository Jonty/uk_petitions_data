        "additional_details": "lowering student  fees would encourage more people to go to university. The truth is that the majority of young people are cut off from financial issues and their first year of university is normally their first experience of having to plan carefully with the money they have. if the students fee was lowered to \u00a36000 pounds more people would go to university because they might be able to afford it \r\n",
        "background": "Lowering tuition fees to \u00a36,000 would make a lot of people  less concerned about debt. It\u2019s a step in the right direction in terms of making it more possible for people to go to uni, but \u00a318,000 at the end of three years is still a lot of money to repay.",
