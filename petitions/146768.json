        "additional_details": "Promises already broken by the Brexit campaigne have already left many voters disillusioned. Many young voters not realising the value of their vote are now enlightened. There is also realisation by many who did not anticipate the disarray this decision would make to the British economy.  It is good to support buying British if it were affordable, much of our consumables are imported from China, not Europe. Invest in encouraging the liberal diversity that our country should stand for. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum is advisory and is not legally binding. Democracy is why MP's are voted to represent the people enabling experts to weigh up all factors in complex decisions. Brits will be disenfranchised from rights enjoyed as European citizens in an increasingly closer world. ",
