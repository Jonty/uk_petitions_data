        "additional_details": "If you plead not guilty to a summary only (magistrates court) offence and are found guilty after trial you will pay a court charge of \u00a3750. With prosecution costs and the victim surcharge this means that you can pay well over \u00a31,000 for not paying for a Mars bar. Yet you use a mobile phone whilst driving or drive at excessive speeds and get a penalty of \u00a3100. This is clearly wrong as sentencing guidelines for magistrates say that the punishment should be relevant to the offence.",
        "background": "The government introduced a new court charge in March 2015 which means that everyone convicted of a crime at a court of law has to pay a court charge. This means that for trivial of offences if you go to court you could pay over \u00a31000 in financial penalties. PUNISHMENTS SHOULD FIT THE CRIME!",
