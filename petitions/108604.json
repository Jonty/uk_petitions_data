        "additional_details": "By placing a cap on the amount of rent a land lord can charge for properties, many more will be available and families will be able to afford the accommodation required for their individual needs and those who Claim housing benefit are less likely to be exploited, by extremely high cost of renting. If there's a housing benefit cap, why not one for the cost of rent, depending on property size and location? Please do consider introducing a law that will prevent the extremely high cost of renting. ",
        "background": "The cost of Housing has become a major issue and, as a result many families are forced to live in cramped conditions. The cost of renting has increased dramatically, and therefore a limit and cap is needed. ",
