        "additional_details": "Although there have been extensive campaigns from organisations  to raise awareness of mental health, more needs to be done to educate young people, specifically young males, concerning mental health.\r\nSuicide is the biggest cause of death in males under 45 and education concerning this issue needs to be compulsory in schools to prevent the rising numbers of suicides. \r\nAccording to the Mental Health Foundation, nearly 1 in 10 children aged five to 16 are affected by a mental health problem and 70% of children who have experienced a mental health problem have not received the right method of support.\r\nEducation concerning mental health is necessary to ensure that children are aware that there is help for those suffering and that there is no longer stigma concerning mental health.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Education concerning mental health should be mandatory in all secondary schools across the UK to tackle the stigma concerning mental health issues, with specific regard to young males. \r\nNicky Morgan(education secretary) & Jeremy Hunt(health secretary) should ensure that pupils are educated.
