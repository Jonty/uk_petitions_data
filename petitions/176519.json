        "additional_details": "Rescue centres are being swamped with unwanted pets They are turning away animals that vets are having to destroy just because they are no longer wanted or cannot be afforded  A law that all domestic animals are neutered unless bred by legislated breeders could stop the puppy farms, and cruelty and neglect by ignorance and greed of casual breeding, and these innocent creatures of all ages could have loving homes  Check the websites of animal charities to see the levels of neglect and euthanasia ",
        "background": "Hundreds and thousands of pet animals are slaughtered as there are not enough homes. I have volunteered in pet rescue for  years and its now  worse as peoples lifestyle and priorities in 21st century have changed. Cruelty and neglect are commonplace. Reduce the numbers humanely stop them being born.",
