But as our MPs backtrack on their decision, it is estimated that 90,000 unaccompanied refugee children remain in Europe as they flee their war torn countries. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/08/dubs-scheme-lone-child-refugees-uk-closed-down\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38912428",

The Dubs scheme hoped to help thousands of refugee children & now Britain closes its door after allowing a mere 350 onto our shores. Tell our PM that this is unacceptable and must be reconsidered!",
