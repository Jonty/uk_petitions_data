        "action": "Make the purchase, possession and use of fireworks illegal without a licence.",
        "additional_details": "Traditionally, fireworks were set off on Bonfire Night and the New Year. Today, they are set off from early October to late January at all times of the day for no reason other than the fun of blowing things up.\r\nThe UK Police force and the NHS are wasting valuable time and money due to their misuse.\r\nFireworks are too readily available, particularly to children and are being used as weapons. They ruin human lives and the lives of animals everywhere.\r\nPlease restrict their use to special events.",
        "background": "Every year in October the daily lives of people and animals in the UK are made a misery four long months due to the misuse of fireworks. \r\nThis petition seeks the introduction of a licence for the purchase, use and possession of fireworks, much like the system in place in Northern Ireland.",
