        "additional_details": "British passport holders living abroad for more than 15 years, were denied the right to vote in the EU referendum. As ex-patriots, our lives will be drastically altered by this vote. Over 1.2 million British citizens are registered as living in the EU and many more world wide. Shouldn't we have had the right to vote? We therefore ask Parliament to veto the BREXIT decision and then if necessary hold another referendum allowing us as British citizens to be allowed to vote for our future.",
        "background": "As a British citizen, living in Spain for over 15 years, I was denied the right to vote on BREXIT. My home & business are based on being part of EU. Many of us have mortgages and businesses reliant on EU membership. We have been disenfranchised and request the right to make decisions on our futures.",
