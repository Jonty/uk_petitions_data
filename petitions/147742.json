        "additional_details": "The referendum only allowed to vote for \u201cRemain\u201d or \u201cLeave\u201d.  This means that those who were unsure, were essentially excluded \r\n\r\nIn Scotland & Northern Ireland, where powers have been devolved, the resounding outcome was to \u201cRemain\u201d.  There is a risk of further destabilisation (for the UK & globally) if one or more of the devolved areas makes a successful bid for independence. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we would request that Parliament passes a motion calling on the Prime Minister not to invoke Article 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The EU referendum was advisory and not legally binding\r\n\r\nThe proportion of people voting \"LEAVE\" only represents 37.3% of the registered electorate \r\n\r\nThe campaign was based on misleading information and there is emerging evidence that this has misled the electorate and skewed the outcome\r\n",
