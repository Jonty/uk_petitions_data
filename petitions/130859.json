        "additional_details": "The new plant now produces only 28Mw power is being built at risk (no EA permit) and is relying on the change process. The changes in the plant capacities move it DOWN the wast hierarchy not up. The new plant will disperse poisonous gasses over Essex prime farm land and historic housing. In addition the plant will produce some 500,000 tones of CO2 that is totally contrary to the current thinking and is not sustainable. The planners have allowed this to progress at risk. ",
        "background": "In 2010 the secretary of state approved an IWMF at Rivenhall with bio mass generator and an incinerators for solid recovered fuels. This was approved for planning without an EA permit on the 26th Feb 2016 via a S73 variation that reduces Bio Mass by 70% whilst increasing Incinerated waste by 60%",
