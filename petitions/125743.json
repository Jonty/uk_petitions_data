        "additional_details": "In the average school, 500 plastic bottles are used a day, ending in landfill. Alongside this is the countless sheets of paper and card thrown away by schools. The NHS similarly has little are no recycling bins for public use. This is replicated in parks and towns across the country, with all the plastic and paper waste we use when in public going to landfill, when it could, and should, be recycled.",
        "background": "Most public institutions, including some sectors of the NHS and many school and colleges across the UK don't recycle. This can lead to much paper and plastic waste, we normally recycle at home, being taken to landfill instead.",
