        "action": "Restrict HGVs overtaking during busy motorway periods.",
        "additional_details": "I don't have data of my own, however this is a widely-discussed topic (https://goo.gl/6CmzEM) and a similar restriction is already in place on a stretch of the M42 between the M6 and A42 in Warwickshire and Leicestershire (and possibly elsewhere).  My petition would propose to extend and uniformly apply this restriction on all motorways (at rush hours) and all two-lane dual carriageways (including for example parts of the M4), if a research project is able to provide suitable evidence.",
        "background": "As a frequent motorway user, I regularly observe traffic flows being obstructed by one HGV, at 57mph, overtaking another HGV at 56mph.  This behaviour causes dangerous driving behaviours in other drivers and should be restricted during busiest periods such as morning and evening commuting times.",
