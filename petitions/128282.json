        "additional_details": "I have been told the police no longer offer work experience by members of their staff and the security industry do not seem to provide apprenticeships, i see this as wrong because at a job interview all they will want is experience and without an apprenticeship you do not have that and they will dismiss you and hire an experienced Candidate.       ",
        "background": "After trying everything i have found there are minimal opportunities to get an apprenticeship in that professional area due to regulation on overtime and budget cuts more apprenticeships should be created in the security and policing areas to give people the experience required.
