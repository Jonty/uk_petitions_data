Business and industry often follow politics and one would hope that the same could be said if the Houses of Parliament were to re-locate to any of the regions.",
        "background": "Government is considering a multi billion pound refurbishment of the Houses of Parliament. It would seem that now would be an ideal opportunity to relocate from this outdated building and move to a more central location within the UK, near Manchester for example.\r\n",
