        "background": "The government has setup a commission to look to restrict or remove all rights under the Freedom of Information act - the act needs to be left alone and commission disbanded.  We have a right to open government and this should not be removed.\r\n\r\nWhat is the act? - https://goo.gl/ZEmhXL",
