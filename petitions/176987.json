        "additional_details": "Like many others I came to the UK to complete my MSc and now wish to remain working for NHS making differences to people's lives on a daily basis. I have been living here for over 7 years and working extra hours during nights/weekends to meet the threshold however it is not good enough to secure my place here unless something changes.\r\nSadly there are many others facing the same hardship and I believe that the threshold should be lowered to at least the average UK salary \u00a328,000 for NHS staff.",
        "background": "Since April 2016, Non-EU citizens wishing to remain permanently in the UK have been required to earn \u00a335,000 a year on a single contracted salary. I find this rule discriminates unfairly against those who chose to work in the NHS, where such a salary is impossible within first 5 years of employment.",
