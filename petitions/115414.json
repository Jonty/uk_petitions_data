        "additional_details": "If someone has waited for years to be entitled for citizenship and just before weeks/months gets points on license due to a minor offence then they need to wait more years to become entitled for citizenship until points are removed. How can someone's character be judged by looking at their driving licence especially when they have never been part of a criminal activity. \r\n\r\nSo we request Homeoffice not to mix motoring offences with criminal offences when it comes to judge someone's character.",
        "background": "Motoring convictions are different from criminal convictions unless serious such as drink driving or causing death due to careless driving. \r\nHence any minor motoring offences should not be considered to judge ones character as a requirement for UK citizenship application.
