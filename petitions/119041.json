        "action": "Provide humanitarian assistance for refugees in Northern France",
        "additional_details": "Whilst it is possible to appreciate the scale and complexities of the issue, it is unacceptable that national efforts will support refugees further afield but not take responsibility for those closest to us, on political grounds.\r\n\r\nThe government must offer humanitarian assistance, call on the French government to class these camps as refugee camps and stop blocking organisations wanting to offer aid, and work faster to find longer term solutions, particularly for the most vulnerable.",
        "background": "The influx of so many refugees to camps in Northern France is a humanitarian crisis. Yet because it is near our border people are being left to live in inhumane and unsafe conditions, with no humanitarian intervention by the UK government and no response to French restrictions on aid organisations.
