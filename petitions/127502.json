        "additional_details": "Regardless of which side you support - Remain or Leave, you must surely agree that it is unfair to call the EU something it is not. The EU is a political bureaucratic organisation with 28 member states. Europe is a continent along with Asia, North America, South America, Oceania, and Africa. Please don't mislead voters in the run up to the EU referendum in June. This is a huge decision that people need to make based on facts, not due to scaremongering.",
        "background": "Campaigners who want the UK to remain a member of the European Union constantly refer to it as 'Europe'. This is political scaremongering. Europe is a geographical continent of which the UK is a part. The EU is a political union of which we are a member. We can remain or leave the Union not Europe.",
