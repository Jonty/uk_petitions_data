        "additional_details": "Since 2010, the Education Department has been run by an accountant, a journalist, a solicitor and an economist. What qualifications do they have to decide on the best course of action for our children? The Government are too results driven. Schools should be places where children feel safe, where children go to enjoy learning, where children discover a passion for a given subject area. This is not happening under the current scrutiny from those who don't understand the education system. ",
        "background": "Education has been used to sway voters for too long now. With each new Government comes a new National Curriculum. New 'ideas' or 'beliefs'. It's time for stability and for education to be in control of professionals and not politicians, by forming an Education Council of former Heads and teachers.",
