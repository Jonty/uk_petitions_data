        "additional_details": "The \u00a3350 million saved from leaving the EU was an exaggerated amount and will not go towards the NHS funds.\r\nThere will still be free movement of labour, even after leaving the EU.\r\nLeaving the EU will likely lead to a Scottish and Northern Ireland referendum-dividing the nation further.\r\nPrices of everyday goods will increase.\r\nUnemployment will increase.",
        "background": "We ask that parliament disregards the choice made by the British public to leave the EU, given that many of the leave campaign's arguments were found to be false and misleading to voters, and that people given the present circumstances have had cause to change their minds.",
