All of our negative experiences are at the hands of one house building company. There are other horror stories across the Internet from other builders. There is no body or charter to hold them to account under \"snagging\", only NHBC. Customers need to be protected better post completion. Please sign and share to make it a positive experience for future buyers, your own kids, friends, family. Thanks.",
        "background": "The level of care we have experienced from a national house builder has been disgusting. We have researched for a body to complain to. There are none. A recognised body or charter must be established by the Government to ensure all customer needs are resolved timely where it is not an NHBC area.",
