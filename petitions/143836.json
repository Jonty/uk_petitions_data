        "additional_details": "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has the power to ban or change misleading commercial advertisements.\r\n\r\nThe Consumer Rights Act 2015 ensures that buyers have certain rights when they enter into a contract.\r\n\r\nPoliticians are able to mislead and mis-sell to the electorate. There is nothing which protects voters from 'buyer's remorse'. We view this as a gap which needs urgently addressed.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK has just seen one of the most vile political campaigns in recent times. Both sides made claims which were demonstrably false. There are no penalties or incentives which prevent this.\r\n\r\nWe urge the government to create an independent body to regulate political campaigns.",
