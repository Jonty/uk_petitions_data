People were misled and voted based on questionable or even false information.\r\nA Judge should look at what was claimed, if it was true and the impact false information had on the result.\r\nIf the Judge finds the result was affected by false claims the result should be set aside.",
        "background": "Many false claims were made, such as the amount the EU costs, that  savings of \u00a3350 a week would be spent on the NHS, that the UK did not control it's own borders.\r\nMany people voted based on this false information and no action should be taken until a Judicial Review makes it's recommendations.",
