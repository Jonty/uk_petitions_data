        "additional_details": "The referendum on remaining in the EU was very close.\r\n\r\nThe prime minister stepped down indicating he couldnt fullfil his mandate anymore. A new mandate should require a new election.\r\n\r\nOur political system is in disarray. Both internally and externally. An early general election would calm the waters giving confidence to the people and the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd allows the people to choose who they want to lead us in these unforseen times. ",
        "background": "We want a general election now!\r\n\r\nHowever a call for this can only be held if two thirds of the government vote for it. We would like a motion of this nature to be held immediately.\r\n\r\nIn negotiating a new deal with the EU surely the people should democratically decide who will be our spokesperson.",
