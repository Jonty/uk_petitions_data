        "additional_details": "The idea of the UK leaving the single market is unthinkable. It would cause lower investment, lower trade with European nations and loss of talented workers. \r\n\r\nThe single market includes free movement of people, capital, goods and services between constituent states. In other words, everything vital for a prosperous economy. ",
        "background": "This petition calls on the 450+ MPs who do not support Brexit to use their combined voting power in order to keep the UK in the single market. This needs to be passed immediately with emergency legislation in order to avoid long term damage to our economy and restore financial stability.",
