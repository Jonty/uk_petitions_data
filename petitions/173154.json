This could have led to an overdose. \r\n\r\nI have also just used the toilets at the UHW and attempted to wash my hands in three different cubicles. There is no soap in the dispensers and no running water in the sinks. ",

There are not enough doctors on and it is evident the longer waiting times are distressing the children and young people. ",
