Their defence bodies defend may not defend you so you may have to fund this yourself. You may struggle to get work until the conclusion, guilty or not. If found guilty you can't get work in anything compounding poverty. At the appeal they have that unlimited pool the defendant does not and then may have costs awarded compounding poverty. ",

Being charities they have deprived the taxman of money. They can bring about poverty as they do not allocate their charitable funds equally.",
