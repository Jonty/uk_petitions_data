        "additional_details": "Marie Stopes, the UK's biggest abortion provider, has just announced that it will be deprioritising Irish women who travel to their clinics seeking abortions. Irish women cannot undergo abortions on the NHS; the cost of private treatment, coupled with the expense of travel, means that abortion is only available to Irish women who can afford the expense. The UK has always enjoyed a special relationship with Ireland, and the right to free NHS England abortions should be extended to Irish women.\r\n",
        "background": "The 1967 Abortion Act, which established legal abortion, has never applied in Northern Ireland, and in the Republic of Ireland abortion is illegal unless to save the life of the mother. This means that Irish women often have to travel to mainland Britain for privately funded abortions.",
