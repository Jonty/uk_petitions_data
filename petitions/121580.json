        "action": "Replace the Wheelchair Symbol with a modern non-disability specific image.",
        "additional_details": "Supermarkets, shopping centres, stadiums, recreation centres - all of these are public places where many witness what they deem 'abuse' of Disabled Parking bays and/or Accessible Toilets. People become very indignant if people using either are not wheelchair users. It causes a negative view, which later becomes compounded by repeated accusations of, for example, benefit scroungers. Change the symbol. Produce communications that explain the reason for the change. Educate. Tackle discrimination.",
        "background": "The International Symbol of Access (ISA), also known as the (International) Wheelchair Symbol, was originally designed in 1968. This pre-dates current UK disability law by half a century and, while internationally recognised, is outdated in respect peoples understandings of/and types of disability.",
