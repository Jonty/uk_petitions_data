        "additional_details": "In 1975, 67.2 % of UK voters voted to stay in the European Community (the Common Market). The result of the EU referendum 2016 is marginal and representative of mere 1/3 of the eligible voters\u2019 opinion. The use of the advisory result of the EU referendum 2016 by the Government to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty shall constitute abuse of power by the executive and shall undermine the rule of law and separation of powers in the UK in contravention of the UK\u2019s constitutional requirements.",
        "background": "Section 1 (1) of the European Union Referendum Act 2015 states: \u201cA referendum is to be held on whether the United Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union\u201d. Because of the sovereignty of Parliament, the result of the EU referendum of 23 June 2016 cannot be legally binding in the UK.",
