        "additional_details": "I have gone from working hard all my life and never taking from the system to a person in agony most days, I need help with dressing, can't cook, can't drive, as a consequence of the pain all over my body I have become very depressed and fear for my future. I am no longer able to work and I am about to go on zero wages and will have to retire due to being too ill. I am 47. The only thing that helps me is my  medication which has taken 6 months to get right, but I now have to beg for weekly.",
        "background": "it is trying to reduce the misuse of prescription drugs.\r\nHowever , due to the stigma associated with Fibromyalgia & M.E, by some in the medical profession and the fact we are living with an invisible illness I feel many people living with Fibro & M.E are wrongly assumed to be misusing medication.
