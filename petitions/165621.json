        "additional_details": "Mental ill health costs companies \u00a326 billion and affects 25% of people, while the annual cost to the NHS is predicted to double over the next 20 years from \u00a3105 billion. With fast diagnosis and application of viable treatment, this could be alleviated.\r\nOur NCS Social Action project (government scheme run by Catch 22) aims to increase MHFA accessibility, thus enhancing mental health care and awareness, developing community support by removing stigmas and advancing knowledge.\r\nwww.mhfaengland.org",
        "background": "Mental Health First Aid courses teach how to identify the signs of key mental health issues, provide initial help and capably guide someone towards suitable support. Despite its benefits, many people haven't heard of MHFA; the course is not affordable for all (\u00a3300 per person) and centres are scarce",
