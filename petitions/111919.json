        "additional_details": "When someone is cruel to an animal or abuses them they face a fine, a ban on owning animals or a prison sentence of up to 51 weeks. This to me does not seem harsh enough. There is no deterant to stop the abuser and make them think twice about their actions. In a study it showed 1677 cases were bought before the courts and only 57 resulted in prison sentences. Banning an abuser from owning animals seems the most frequent court outcome and with animals so easily accessible this just isn't working!",
        "background": "Animal cruelty happens far too often in a country full of supossed animal lovers. Whilst many charities fight to help get justice for these animals not enough is being done when such cases are taken to court!  ",
