        "action": "Ensure the EHIC will remain available to UK citizens after exit from the EU.",
        "additional_details": "For many people with serious or chronic health conditions travel insurance can be incredibly expensive or insurers refuse to cover your condition. This can make travel insurance difficult to organise or a choice having to be made as to whether you cover your condition at great cost, or hope for the best. If EHIC becomes unavailable for British citizens after Brexit it is likely insurance costs will significantly increase as insurers will be footing the bill rather than through the EHIC system.",
        "background": "The European Health Insurance Card is relied upon by many UK citizens to access medical care when abroad within Europe. \r\nFor many travelers with health conditions this allows us to take affordable travel insurance without having to declare pre-exisiting medical conditions.
