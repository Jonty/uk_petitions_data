However, the existing situation is not quite as clear as this. The Church of England is the established church in England, the Church of Scotland is the national church in Scotland, reflected in the Act of Union 1707, and there is no established Church in Wales or Northern Ireland. It is not therefore clear what you would like a law to do.\r\n\r\nIf you could be more specific about the law you would like Parliament to pass, you could submit a new petition asking for that legislation.
