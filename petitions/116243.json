        "additional_details": "As of December 2014 all other provisions of the act have been repealed or subsumed into new legislation, however one of the most important provisions is still in act (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Act_1939), preventing the advertisement of alternative treatments for cancer. However there are many alternative treatments for cancer that have scientific evidence to support them but because of this act they cannot be advertised, preventing people from getting the treatments they need.",
        "background": "The Cancer Act 1939 was put in place within the UK to make further provision for the treatment of cancer, to authorise the Minister of Health to lend money to the National Radium Trust, to prohibit certain advertisements relating to cancer, and for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid.",
