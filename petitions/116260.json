The film can feature the first official UK stunt off: \"WAD vs. WONK 2016\".",
        "background": "Due to a lack of public funding for sports like 'Parkour' and 'Pro-Stunting', parkour and stunt enthusiasts such as members of the famous punk bands Wadeye and Wonk Unit are forced to settle their beefs in unsafe underground \"stunt offs\" which are completely unregulated and extremely dangerous.",
