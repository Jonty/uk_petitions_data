        "additional_details": "New legislation means married couples and civil partners with homes will, from 2017, be able to leave estates worth up to \u00a3850,000 without paying IHT. The figure rises to \u00a31m by 2020/2021. However, Family Home Allowance (FHA) only applies to direct descendants. Those who do not have children, stepchildren or grandchildren, will be excluded from benefiting from the additional allowance. This should be changed to give those who are childless the same allowances as those with direct descendants. \r\n\r\n",
