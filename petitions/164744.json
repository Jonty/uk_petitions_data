        "additional_details": "There now needs to be an independent oversight and scrutiny of the decisions and actions taken by the CEO and board of Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The Health Select Commitee and Department of Health need to intervene in the ongoing situation at Chorley and South Ribble A&E.  It is imperative the management of LTH is held to account for their decisions and actions around the downgrade of the A&E department in April 2016 and subsequent actions taken to reinstate A&E.\r\n",
        "background": "On 13th April 2016, it was announced that A&E department would be downgraded to an Urgent Care Centre. LTH said the A&E department would reopen in August but have now confirmed it will stay closed until a review in April 2017.\r\n\r\n",
