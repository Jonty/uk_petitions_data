He was truly an artistic chameleon.\r\n\r\nAn indefinable master of rock style, throughout his long and varied career, influenced everyone from Iggy Pop to Boy George.\r\n\r\nThe artist's hits include Let's Dance, Changes, Space Oddity, Starman, Modern Love, Heroes, Under Pressure, Rebel Rebel and Life on Mars.\r\n\r\nSir Paul McCartney described him as a \"great star\" who \"played a very strong part in British musical history\".",
        "background": "British-born David Bowie spent his entire career redefining the art of popular music. \r\n\r\nHe died of cancer at the age of 69 as one of the most influential musicians of his time, constantly re-inventing his persona and sound.\r\n\r\nA truly artistic chameleon who seemed to be in permanent revolution.\r\n",
