        "additional_details": "In light of the recent ruling there has to be an acceptable limit on charges for overstaying. \u00a3100 for staying as little as 5mins over a free or \u00a31 parking space is TOO MUCH.\r\n\r\nMotorists unite. This is the last way to stop companies like ParkingEye charging whatever they want. Why should they limit it to \u00a3100 after this court hearing? Sign up so we get heard.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-34721126\r\nhttps://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2015-0116.html",
        "background": "Being charged \u00a3100 for overstaying at a private carpark is unfair.\r\nFollowing the supreme court case Bevis vs ParkingEye, Parliament need to make an amendment to add a section to Schedule 4 of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, to restrict charges for overstaying to a much smaller sum (say \u00a310)",
