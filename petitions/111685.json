        "additional_details": "Theresa MAY has for many years been instrumental in the systematic destruction of the Police Service within the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nShe has repeatedly demonstrated how little she appears to care about Police Officers; by spearheading swathing cut after cut.\r\n\r\nPolice Officers face extreme challenges on a daily basis; but the challenge of being 'Crewed Up' with Theresa MAY is a challenge too far.\r\n\r\nIt must not happen.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently, petition reference 111075 is gaining momentum.\r\n\r\nPetition reference 111075 reads:\r\n\r\n\"Theresa May to go on patrol with a police force for a full set of night shifts.\"\r\n\r\nI am petitioning to prevent this from happening because no Police Officer should have to face such an awful challenge.",
