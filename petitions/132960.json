        "additional_details": "Our suggestions are for a self-exclusion based service being made available by banks to offer a more rigid deterrent to online gambling addicts from which is currently available. We'd also like to see stricter regulations in normal online transactions being made to gambling sites; and question marks being made where large sums are being deposited to help deter online gambling and aid those with addictions or potential addictions to gaming.",
        "background": "Many online gaming companies offer a self-exclusion service as part of responsible gambling. However, due to the large variety of online gambling sites, it is very easy for problem gamblers to relapse. We want banks to offer a similar self-exclusion service for such transactions being made.",
