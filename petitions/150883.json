        "action": "Remove all religious representatives from any Parliamentary institution.",
        "additional_details": "The lack of secularism in our society promotes inequality through the definition of people and organisations by their affiliation to religious institutions. To combat inequality, our Political Leaders must be independent of all religious influence, irrespective of the religion, so that all decisions can be made in a fair and balanced way. This independence cannot be accomplished whilst we have members of one religious institution in Parliament in any form. ",
        "background": "Our Government should be 100% secular and should have no religious bias from any religious group. This means removing The Lords Spiritual from the House of Lords and removing any religious ceremony or act from any part of Parliamentary processes.",
