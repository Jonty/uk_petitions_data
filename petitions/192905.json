        "additional_details": "A \u201chard Brexit\u201d ends the free movement of goods, services, capital and people within the EU single market. That means:\r\n1. Less money from selling our goods abroad, and more money needed to import (local producers suffer and supermarket food prices increase)\r\n2. Less jobs and more uncertainty, as the UK will no longer be the EU center of finance (big businesses will relocate abroad)\r\n3. You will pay more to travel, need a visa to live/work in the EU, and fewer tourists and workers will visit the UK",
        "background": "Theresa May is driving the U.K to a \u201chard Brexit\u201d, against the advice of industry experts, economists and many in her own party. We cannot prevent our exit from the EU, however, we CAN demand a \u201csoft Brexit\u201d to keep some of the privileges, agreements and freedom we previously benefited from.\r\n",
