        "additional_details": "There are different methods of charging, so to avoid the need to carry the weighty chargers with the E-bike and only carry an adaptor/lead.  The system would need to cater for these different methods.  The system I use would only need a socket for two bullet connectors plus a balance lead socket at the charger connection, where others would need  special adaptors which would need to be carried. The charger would need a cell type switch and a voltage switch for different charging voltages. ",
