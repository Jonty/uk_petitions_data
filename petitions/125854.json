See the Imgur link below:\r\n\r\nhttp://imgur.com/a/uD6Bd\r\n\r\nBut plenty of other publications do the same thing. Apologies should be prominently placed on the homepage of every publication. This will reduce the number of errors publications make as their mistakes will be more easily noticed and scrutinized much more closely.",
        "background": "Many publications make errors with what they print. Mistakes are fine, but apologies to those affected are often hidden or obscured from the publication's readers. This should be changed as many readers will never see the apology which causes unfair complications for those implicated by the mistake ",
