It's time for change. Government need to stop sweeping the issue under the carpet and come up with facts. Cannabis is a wonder drug that can medicate, fuel and clothe. Open your eyes people. ",
        "background": "We as cannabis users want to stop being criminalised for using our drug of choice. I have smoked everyday for 10 years since the age of 16 and have never come to any harm because of cannabis! Alcohol on the other hand is far worse yet legal. I want to see concrete evidence that cannabis is harmful. ",
