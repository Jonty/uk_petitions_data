        "action": "Reverse the decision to charge 3% tax on second homes   (retain for buy to let)",
        "additional_details": "This impacts you if you have your own home and purchase another property. This could be to help your parents, your children, your siblings, your friends. It has nothing to do with buy to let.\r\n\r\nMy sister looked after my parents as a single mum for 15 years, but they have both passed. She needs help to buy a home the Government can't provide. I will have to pay 3% tax on that home I can't afford.\r\n\r\nMany more people will be impacted.  Please sign this petition.  It will impact you unfairly one day.",
        "background": "The Government introduced a 3% tax on purchases of second homes (over \u00a340k) on 01/04/16. This was following a consultation on applying a 3% tax on buy to let properties. They did this to close a loop hole.  However, they haven't considered the consequences, or included it in any direct consultation.",
