        "additional_details": "After eight years of research, SPS  has visited hundreds of parks and have concluded that this form of skatepark construction is not conducive to a public skatepark environment. We feel materials such as composite plastic, fibreglass, and steel will require serious maintenance over time.  Over this time it creates a very dangerous situation for the end user. Therefore a concrete skatepark is best suited.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.skatepark.org/park-development/vision/2012/09/just-say-no-to-modular-skateparks/",
        "background": "Canterbury is an amazing city with many great things to offer, however for anyone into skateboarding, bmxing or scootering. It is hard to find anything suitable for our sports to be done. \r\nI think a  new skatepark should be created as the horrible metal skate-parks are simply dangerous and old. ",
