        "additional_details": "As an example, 2660 postmen/women were attacked by dogs in the last year some leading to a permanent disabling injury. As a postwoman myself I have had a dog bite, which fortunately wasn't serious, but have seen many colleagues that were not so lucky.\r\n\r\nA simple sign at the entrance to a property and by the letterbox could help significantly. By making anyone calling at a house aware of the presence of a dog, they can take precautions to ensure their own safety and that of the dog living too.",
        "background": "Many people may call on a household on a daily basis for legitimate reasons and dog attacks are a significant hazard.  While the number of attacks has fallen after the change in legislation and greater understanding through dog awareness campaigns, it still remains unacceptably high.",
