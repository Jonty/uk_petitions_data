        "additional_details": "The government has been using media to vilify the weakest in society, which are the poor & those with disabilities, yet vote themselves a massive 10% payrise & use our taxes to help reduce the cost of their alcohol whilst in government. This petition is demanding that the recent bill that has enabled cuts to ESA of \u00a330 a week, be reversed & no other cuts to disability benefits to adults or children be considered. These benefits are used to help those with disabilities live, it's not a luxury!",
        "background": "The recent cuts by this government to the disabled with the cut to Employment & Support Allowance by \u00a330 a week is attacking those who are the weakest in society & cannot work, as the government are trying to lead the rest of society in to believing! This bill needs to be reversed & no more threats!",
