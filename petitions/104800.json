        "additional_details": "Nursing tuition fees are free. \r\nNHS bursary is only around \u00a3450 a month maximum. People with children get more. \r\nStudents may be entitled to a maintenance grant. \r\nStudents also have to travel up to 90 minutes away from home to their placement and pay for their own travel.\r\n\r\nStudents shouldn't need to worry about money worries when they are trying to learn to become a nurse and save lives. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "More financial support is needed for student nurses. We are expected to work a 37.5 hour week learning placement as well as studying for essays and exams, plus working another job to earn money to live off and to look after other responsibilities (children etc). We can't cope to live, its stressful",
