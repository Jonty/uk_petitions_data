        "additional_details": "Theresa May has a small majority of 17. She also does not have a mandate for her version of Brexit, nor technically to be prime minister.\r\nWhoever won the election (which polls suggest would be Mrs May) would have the backing of the country for their version of Brexit. This would ensure a smooth Brexit, stronger negotiating hand and would also provide a democratic mandate.",
        "background": "Once Article 50 has been triggered the PM should go to the country in order to secure a mandate so we can stop the endless arguments about what form Brexit should take.",
