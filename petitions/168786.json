        "additional_details": "Both Telford and Shropshire have growing populations and accommodate different geographical locations; both current A&E units struggle - local healthcare needs expanding not retracting. Reducing to one A&E will cause unnecessary strain, and ultimately, deaths.\r\n\r\nIn 2014 the Health Secretary promised that \u201cwe commit to A&E on both sites and there are no plans to change that\u201d. Mr Hunt is called upon to ensure that commitment is kept.\r\n\r\nMoving WC services would be a waste of a \u00a328 million investment.",
        "background": "Future Fit ('FF') was tasked with improving care in the Telford and Shrewsbury Hospitals.\r\n\r\nFF's proposals include closing one of the two current A&E units and possibly moving Women and Children's ('WC') services, despite investment in a dedicated \u00a328 million facility in Telford just two years ago.",
