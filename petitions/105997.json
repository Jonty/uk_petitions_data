        "action": "Strengthen the 2004 Hunting Act",
        "additional_details": "Needless to say fox hunting is a barbaric and bloodthirsty so-called sport that has no place in a civilised society. Foxes are used as scapegoats for the deaths of lambs (despite the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, suggesting 95% of lamb losses are due to farm husbandry practice). Here at Keeptheban, we want to make a stand against this cruel past time and hope this petition can call upon the government to strengthen and enforce the act more rigorously. ",
        "background": "To 2010 there were only six prosecutions relating to registered hunts, despite the overwhelming evidence stacked up against a multitude of hunts nationally.  ",
