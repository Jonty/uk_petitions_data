The legalisatsion of cannabis is now widespread in countrys such as Holand, Canada and some states of the USA. It is proven that the money going to the government goes up and the rate of arrests goes down",
        "background": "People need canabis for medical use and it is being denied to them. If alcohol and tobacco are legal and taxed, then so should cannabis. One of the main drawbacks to cannabis is that it's a \"gateway drug.\" Legalise it and this will no longer be a problem ",
