        "additional_details": "Social media needs to offer more protection, help and support to its young, old, vulnerable and genuine members. Banning a troll member is not enough, as they can easily setup another account with a email address and start trolling again. \r\nSocial media needs to verify new members more throughly with debt / credit or electoral register info and ban for life those intent on causing harm to others. Encourage members to take more responsibility for their comments by showing they are a real person. ",
        "background": "Bullying on social media is out of control. It's so easy for someone to say hurtful things, to someone else online that would otherwise been deemed unacceptable in person. These comments are demoralising, hurtful and depressing and are often said without any thoughts of the person they're aimed at. ",
