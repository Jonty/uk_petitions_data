        "additional_details": "Sir Jeremy Heywood said: \"Civil servants can draft ministerial speeches and provide briefing on government policy for ministers... including those organised by groups campaigning for the same outcome as the government on the EU referendum.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35642296\r\n\r\nIt is wrong to use civil servants in support of either side.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of fairness, we respectfully ask Mr Cameron to stop using the British Civil service in support of the remain campaign.\r\n",
        "background": "It has been reported that Ministers can use the Civil Service in support of a remain vote in the upcoming EU Referendum whilst banning support for those wishing to leave.\r\n\r\nWe believe it is very wrong to use the Civil Service and taxpayers money to support just one side of this campaign.",
