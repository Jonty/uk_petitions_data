        "action": "Make Drivers have a fixed period of tuition with an ADI before a driving test.",
        "additional_details": "Over 20% of accidents involve new drivers between the ages of 17 and 25.  Many have had little or no professional tuition, relying on parents, who may have developed bad driving habits, to give them the skills needed to drive safely.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the national pass rate for the driving test is under 50%. A compulsory minimum period of instruction with an ADI would address this.",
        "background": "Approved Driving Instructors (ADI) must pass 3 examinations in order to give professional tuition. Yet anyone over the age of 21 who has held a driving licence for a period of three years may give tuition to a learner. This is not conducive to safe driving for life, as reflected by accident records.",
