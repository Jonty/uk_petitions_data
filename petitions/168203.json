        "additional_details": "I have been waiting for a routine surgical procedure for nine months. On ringing Salisbury hospital to enquire why I had not received a date, I was advised that the hospital was in crisis and many procedures had been cancelled. Later that week I discussed with my GP who confirmed that 'ALL' hospitals are now in crisis as the government will not fund the NHS. The crisis has nothing to do with immigration, or industrial action, but lack of funding.",
        "background": "One key argument for Brexit was that the NHS would benefit from additional funding. This has not happened, if anything, the situation has worsened and hospitals are now in crisis. Why should this be allowed to continue? It is requested that the Govt provide adequate funding to support the NHS ASAP.",
