        "action": "Remove the subsidies for the catering services in the House of Lords",
        "additional_details": "1.1 million people relied on food banks last year, public services will be cut by just under \u00a318 billion. Yet Peers in the House of Lords enjoy decadent 3 course meals and fine wines, at taxpayers' expense, plus a \u00a3300-a-day allowance for attending the House, and still have their catering subsidised at a cost of \u00a31.3 million. The extravagance of these unelected representatives is immoral.",
        "background": "Taxpayer subsidised catering services in the House of Lords caters for some of the richest in the nation.\r\n\r\nThis indulgence that runs rife within the House of Lords cannot be tolerated anymore.  This petition is a call for imposed austerity on the House's 1.3 million annual catering budget.",
