        "background": "According to the LGA it costs \u00a31.50 to clean a piece of chewing gum from a pavement. Not all chewing gum users are irresponsible about its disposal but it is wrong for general taxation to pay the clean up costs. A levy of 10p a packet (plus an explanation on the packet) will offset part of the costs",
