        "additional_details": "Some promises are made, but later found to be unworkable. Some situations change unexpectedly.  Yet in the recent EU referendum voters were forced to decipher which side was lying the most.  Both sides accused the other of lies.  On the morning of the referendum, Nigel Farage labelled a LEAVE claim of \u00a3350 million a week to be spent on the NHS, a mistake. In this type of environment, it is unreasonable to expect a member of the public to know who to trust or vote for; true democracy is stolen.",
        "background": "Every election and in recent referendums, politicians have been found to knowingly and intentionally lie about claims or promises they have made, to gain votes. This steals true democracy from the public who are relying on honesty from their politicians to make good decisions. It should be illegal.",
