        "additional_details": "Bring tighter controls on how Social Workers oporate and bring an end to their ability to lie through their teeth to push their own selfish ambition without regard for the child. Too many children are being taken from good mams and dads where they have been the victim of domestic abuse in the name of safeguarding children. Europe use a system that helps children stay in touch with their birth parents. Rapists and murderers get a lesser punishment than good parents who need help. ",
        "background": "There are too many cases in the press where Children's Services have lied through their teeth to push their own agenda and harm children rather than protect them. Children are often taken away from families where no crime has been committed or where they just need extra help. ",
