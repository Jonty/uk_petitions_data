        "additional_details": "Incontinence pads are there for children and adults who for whatever reason are unable to use the bathroom I feel it unfair and unhygienic that the allowance for this is 3 a day my son gets changed a minimum of 6 times a day he has Cerebral palsy spastic quadriplegia so he isn't aware of when he needs the toilet incontinence pads are an everyday need for him and for many others. Please please help me get this petition recognised and help others in a similar situation.",
        "background": "Being a parent to a young disabled child I have the same problems as other parents or carers of disabled children and Adults the 3 day limit on incontinence pads is ridiculous my son cannot manage to stick to 3 changes a day as he develops sores and it's unhygienic the limit needs to be increased.",
