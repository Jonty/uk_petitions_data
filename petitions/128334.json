        "action": "Stop charging extortionate Child Visa fees and NHS Surcharges",
        "additional_details": "If a Non-EU family of 4, 2 adults and 2 toddlers, needs to extend their stay in UK for 2 years, they would pay \u00a37160 Visa + Biometric fees and \u00a31600 NHS levy. Visa fee is irrespective of how short is their stay, means if an immigrant\u2019s spouse and a child granted 6 months visa they would still pay \u00a33580 in visa fees only. Fair fees are part of business ethics and Governments are also expected to conduct their business ethically. Be ethical and considerate and abolish child visa fees and NHS Levy",
        "background": "Dependent children of Non-EU immigrants are charged same visa fees and NHS levy as adults. It is appalling that child visa fee in a temporary visa category is as much as \u00a31790+ \u00a3200 NHS levy/year. They are not entitled to any kind of state benefits in the UK and shouldn\u2019t be charged hefty visa fees",
