        "action": "Introduce mandatory self-defence classes into UK secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "Children of today are regularly facing the threat of assault in a range of scenarios from bullying within schools to street abductions. I feel it is incredibly important to start equipping children with key self-defence skills in order to defend themselves against an attack effectively \u2013 without putting themselves in further danger. UK self-defence law should be taught as part of any self-defence classes or programmes introduced into schools; to prevent self-defence being used inappropriately.",
        "background": "I propose that the UK Government introduces mandatory self-defence classes, or a self-defence programme, into the Physical Education (P.E.) part of the curriculum in secondary schools to equip children with the skills they need to defend themselves against an attacker.\r\n",
