        "additional_details": "As evidence given by NHS Blood and Transplant, the current percentage of the population in England to whom have opted into organ donation lays at around 32 - 33%\r\n\r\nhttps://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets/1070/england.pdf\r\n\r\nAlthough the number is rising, it is only at a 1% increase each year. This increase does not correlate with those currently waiting for an organ transplant, which currently stands at around 50% of organs being transplanted compared to those on the waiting list.",
        "background": "At present, residents of England have to opt-in, or sign up to become an organ donor. As such the amount of organ donors in relation to those requiring an organ are vastly out numbered. This petition hopes for England to become an opt-out country, so that by default everyone will be a donor.",
