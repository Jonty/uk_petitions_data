        "additional_details": "Basic Life Support focuses on the two main requirement to sustain human life: breathing and blood circulation. Learning Basic Life Support skills requires no medical knowledge and doesn't involve the use of invasive tools or techniques, so quite literally every able-bodied adult or child above the age of circa 12 is capable of learning the life-saving set of skills.\r\n\r\nBecause the prompt intervention of someone with Basic Life Support training may mean the difference between life and death, and between full recovery and permanent disability, and because it doesn't require a long time or much effort to learn, this skill-set should be taught in every school as part of the national curriculum.",
        "background": "Basic Life Support can be a game-changer in terms of increasing survival rates of seriously ill and/or gravely injured individuals, as well as decreasing the chances of irreversible disability. It is quick to master and requires no medical training.",
