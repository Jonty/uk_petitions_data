        "additional_details": " More than 80 years of legislation is affected, encompassing child protection, family support and services to children in care, disabled children and care leavers.\r\n\r\nChildren's welfare should never be subject to political experimentation or privatisation. Evidence shows that Local Authorities' statutory duties have helped to protect services for vulnerable children in the face of severe government cuts. Removing safeguards will expose more children to abuse, which is unacceptable in a civilised society.\r\n\r\nWe call on parliament to reject clauses 29 - 33 of the Children and Social Care Bill.\r\n",
        "background": "The Children and Social Work Bill, which reaches Report Stage in the Lords on 18th October, contains clauses absolving local authorities of virtually all of their duties towards vulnerable children.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
