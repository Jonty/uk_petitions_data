        "background": "Companies like 'Get Me In' & 'Stubhub' allow tickets to be resold for insane prices. In some instances, they are on these sites before fans even get the chance to buy them. I propose that touting sites have a maximum of a 5% mark up so as to allow fans to go to events without being extorted!",
