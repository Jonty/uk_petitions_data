        "action": "Remove the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "He enforced his rule using the military, with the governors who ruled England under him ex-military generals who were extremely brutal. Although Christianity or being a Puritan isn't a defined good or bad trait, he forced all to follow his religion, forcing fasts, banning any form of work on Sunday and banning any fun, like Christmas or work.",
        "background": "Although he made change for the good, he still became a ruthless dictator. Why should the following be welcomed by parliament:\r\nKilling over 250,000 people whilst conquering Ireland, which Cromwell justified as the \"righteous judgment of God upon these barbarous wretches\".",
