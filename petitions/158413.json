        "action": "Hold a referendum on lowering income tax to 5% for earnings below \u00a380k per annum",
        "additional_details": "A reduction in income tax will give back control of finances to the British public to spend on whatever they deem is appropriate for the good of the country. This is reflective of the position on our EU membership.\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that local communities are supported through a boost to spending and that the public as a whole will be happier.\r\n\r\nWe believe that this petition is in the interests of the majority of the population and that a referendum would be appropriate.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Following the EU referendum, we have come to understand that the will of the people is absolute. Even when it is contradictory to expert advice, based on a foundation of lies and damaging for services vital to both the people and the economy.\r\n\r\nWe now call for similar action regarding income tax.",
