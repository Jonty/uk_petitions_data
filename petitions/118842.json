        "additional_details": "The term 'taharrush' roughly translates to 'collective harassment'. It refers to sexual assaults carried out by groups of men in public places. Surrounded by dozens of attackers, lone women are groped or raped. Police say the New Year's Eve attacks in Cologne marked Europe's first instance of taharrush.\r\n",
        "background": "On New Years Eve in Europe hundreds of women were assaulted by gangs of men carrying out Taharrush,a form of organised sexual violence. Women in Europe must be free to travel alone wearing what they want, without fear of sexual attacks. MPs must debate effects on women\u2019s rights given these assaults.",
