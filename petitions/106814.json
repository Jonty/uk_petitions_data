        "additional_details": "According to PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) commercial angora can only be obtained by plucking, cutting or shearing; typically with the rabbit stretched across a board with rope attached to their limbs.  Shearing can cause pain and easily tear skin; following which, most rabbits are confined to small wire cages in isolation, before the process is repeated 2-3 months later. \r\n\r\nPlease help to ban UK sales. References online such as those at peta.org.uk can be viewed. Thank you.",

Despite claims by certain industries that they use responsibly obtained or 'humane' angora, shocking video coverage has been uncovered.  Please support this petition to ban the product in the UK. ",
