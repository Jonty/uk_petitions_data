        "action": "Repeal the ban on ownership of handguns, and include personal protection.",
        "additional_details": "The UK is now as dangerous a place as it ever has been.  Citizens should have the right to carry and use in self defence personal protection weapons such as personal handguns.  There should be certification and provision made for suitable people to carry both openly and concealed in public with a view of being ready to protect property and threats to life.  This is only country that has a blanket ban on personal firearms and this is unjust and against our basic human right to protect ourselves.",
        "background": "The ban on ownership of handguns in the UK needs to be repealed, and this should include the ability to purchase a handgun for personal protection.  This should cover training, and certification for both open and concealed carry in public places.  We have a right to protect ourselves.",
