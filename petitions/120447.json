        "additional_details": "Although neither the Government nor Parliament can \u201cban\u201d a broadcaster, the independent regulator Ofcom does have the power to withhold a broadcasting licence in certain circumstances. Conditions for the granting of a licence are restricted by Parliament under the Broadcasting Acts of 1990 and 1996 and the Communications Act of 2003. Were a new licence condition to be added to these restrictions, Ofcom could revoke the existing licence held by Russia's station RT.  ",
        "background": "The Litvinenko enquiry has presented proof of Russian State involvement in murder. States that sponsor murder should not be permitted to broadcast in the UK. Parliament could change the law to add a new licence condition, making it impossible for the Russia-funded station RT to broadcast here.",
