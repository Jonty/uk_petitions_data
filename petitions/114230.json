        "action": "Abolish faith schools in England (excepting, perhaps Church of England Schools).",
        "additional_details": "I've taught psychology in many secondary schools, high schools and colleges. It is terrifying to see how religion can be and is used in schools to high jack individual spirituality and hold it to ransome. Government support for such a system is totally out of place in today's society that really needs to address the need for a cohesive and tolerant society that upholds our core beliefs (equality, freedom, justice etc.).",
        "background": "Faith schools cause divisions in society. Affiliations are created in schools that can then segregate one community from another. Religions are not always tolerant and inclusive. Our schools must be examples of tolerance and inclusive of all, whatever their creed, race, sex or colour.",
