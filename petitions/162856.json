        "additional_details": "In the past 3 months there has been several cases on the Separated Dads Forum, where ex partners are opposing staying contact, just to get more Child Support. Some have even gone to the extent of false reports to Police/Social Services what then stopped contact for months, while investigation is ongoing. Children need both parents, and the no staying contact amount should only be paid in extreme cases due to Child Protection/Welfare. The starting amount should be based on 53-104 nights contact.",
        "background": "Welfare Benefit Reforms mean the parent getting Child Benefit after separation can access the systems to get up to the income the law says they need.Child Support is not counted for means tested things, but more has to be paid if there is no Staying Contact, encouraging ex partners to try to stop it",
