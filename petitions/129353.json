        "action": "Bring Leasehold Housing into the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002",
        "additional_details": "If Leasehold Housing were brought into the current legislation leaseholders could gather together & form a committee and have the option to change the company or a Right to Manage. If Leasehold Housing stays outside the parameters of this legislation the only option leaseholders have is to go to a tribunal to challenge charges & if found guilty the company still cannot be replaced.Protection is required to regulate leasehold housing especially as many sites are now building on a leasehold basis.",
        "background": "There is a gap within the legislation to protect Leasehold Housing in the same way that leasehold flats are protected. Without that protection, management companies & maintenance companies can abuse the current system. House buyers need to be protected against escalating and unreasonable fees!",
