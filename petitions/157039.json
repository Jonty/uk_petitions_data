As the referendum result was very close, and as some studies show that it was the most influential and remembered element of the campaign, this statement may have made the difference between victory and defeat for the Leave side. This raises a moral question of the gravest nature, whatever the consequences for the country.\r\n\r\n",

They included the UK rebate in this figure. However, the rebate never leaves these shores. All were repeatedly told that it was untrue.\r\n\r\n",
