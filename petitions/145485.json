        "additional_details": "If we, the 16-17 year olds of the UK, had been allowed to vote in this referendum the result would have been undoubtedly different.\r\n\r\nI feel a vote should be given to the 16-17 year olds within England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The result of this should be added to the result of the prior referendum held on the 23rd June. This is our future and we should be allowed a say, the oldest members of our country could vote and they will not have to live with the outcome for as long as us. ",
        "background": "Hold another vote for the 16-17 year olds who weren't able to vote in the original EU referendum a chance to have a say in the future of their country. \r\n\r\nAs a 17 year old I find it unacceptable that my peers and I weren't allowed a say in a decision that will directly affect our futures.
