        "additional_details": "On January 27th 2017 it was announced that Theresa May had, on behalf of the Queen, presented President Trump with the offer of a state visit to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump is the subject of one of the most signed epetitions featured on this website requesting that he be barred entry to the UK for his comments on a number of issues. In light of this it is particularly abhorrent that tax payer's money should go towards funding a state visit for him.",
