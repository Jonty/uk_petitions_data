Two days later I went on to be induced and gave birth to him. Did I receive a birth certificate for him? No, but why?\r\n\r\nThe definition of a birth certificate is- an official document issued to record a person's birth and identify them by name, place, date of birth, and parentage. \r\n\r\nNo where does it state the child has to be viable for life.\r\n\r\n#HenrysLegacy",
        "background": "I believe all babies born no matter the gestation of loss deserve to be recognised. They lived inside the womb of their mother and were then born into the world. If a woman gives birth to a child, that child deserves a birth certificate, to be recognised as part of this world.",
