        "additional_details": "Why would this be beneficial?\r\nPortugal first became a recognized Kingdom in 1139 under the rule of Dom Afonso I, and since has undergone various periods of significance, including a temporary Spanish rule, transition into a Republic and decolonization. It has a rich history which is very useful and interesting, from a historical point of view, so would give students a vivid insight into the history of our longest allies.",
        "background": "The UK's longest standing alliance (and the longest standing in the world)  is with Portugal - the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, signed in 1386. Due to this, I believe that we should be taught about Portuguese History at A-Level to learn more about our oldest allies and their diverse history.",
