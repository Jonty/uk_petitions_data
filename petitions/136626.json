Thus, this is a petition about the basic democratic rights that should be given to the individuals who will form the basis of the future of this country. They should be able to decide upon what opportunities they want, since they are going to contribute to the future. Moreover, they were able to vote in the Scottish Referendum. Hence, surely similar opportunities should be extended to all 16 year olds in the UK.",
        "background": "It is absolutely important that 16 year olds should be able to decide upon their own future. The recent EU Referendum has showcased how the the young generation are unable to vote, even though they are going to be the most affected by the final results.",
