        "additional_details": "In Asian clothing stores they not only rob consumers blind with extortionate pricing. They have no refund policy once an item has been purchased and some will only exchange within 3-7 days. Shopping in these stores has not inly become difficult but very stressful when you make a mistake in choosing an item of clothing. Not only consumers are unable to get their money back, but when trying to exchange an item is a total nightmare - we need 10,000 petitions to get this to UK parliament.",
        "background": "Over the 20 years it has become more and more difficult to return or exchange an item of clothing in Asian clothing stores such as in Green Street, E7, Southall UB1 etc, as they have very strict store policies which make shopping a total nightmare.",
