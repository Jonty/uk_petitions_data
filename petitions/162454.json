        "additional_details": "From 2001-2009 Labour FoI paid for more than 60 MPs to visit Israel. The Conservative FoI also pays for visits (holidays) for Tory MPs. This creates a conflict on interest when MPs are looking at middle east issues. E.g, David Cameron, when Prime Minister and attending a dinner with the Zionist lobby, did not mention Israel's onslaught against Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Until we are free of this outside control, thoughts of independence and self-governance remain a fleeting illusion.\r\n",
        "background": "Leaving the EU supposedly gives back more control of our own affairs. However, there is a lobby group that courts MPs of all parties in order to have them represent its interests, even when these counter the best interests of the UK. This is the Labour/Conservative Friends of Israel.",
