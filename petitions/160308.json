        "additional_details": "The headlines of the sun and daily mail over a sustained time have been racist and based on inaccurate or wildly biased information.  Headlines such as \"1 in five muslims are sympathetic towards jhiadis\" fuel racial hatred and mislead the public. The media have a duty of care to report accurately and not to lie. Self regulation has failed and it is now time to pass laws to prevent the media from portraying facts inaccurately and where opinion is given it must be labelled as such.",
        "background": "Newspapers such as the sun and daily mail regularly print headlines which increase racial hatred and which are  wholy inaccurate and biased.  Channel 4 and other channels produce programmes such as border force which are edited in such a way as to portray minorities in a negative light.",
