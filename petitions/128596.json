        "additional_details": "The M4 relief road proposals including the Compulsory Purchase Order if successful would rob an area of the Magor Marsh reserve and bring dark times for the Gwent Levels as a whole and the nationally important wildlife that thrives here. The drainage system on the Levels is extremely complex and 2500m of ditch and reen, full of nationally rare plants and insects would be lost if the proposed relief road goes ahead.",
        "background": "The compulsory purchase order aims to take an area of wet grassland and ditch rich in rare wildlife that includes meadow thistle, otters, water voles and ancient pollarded willows to build M4 Relief Road.",
