        "additional_details": "The recent The 1975 concert is to be performed at the O2 Arena in December of 2016. The pre-sale for tickets begun on Wednesday 8th June. I was able to buy my ticket with all additional fees for \u00a336.88 in total. However, later that same day, I saw standing tickets on re-sale websites, like StubHub and Get Me In, from between \u00a370 to \u00a3200 each. This is an extortionate rate and is simply unfair for some people to have to pay considerably more than the face value price. ",
        "background": "Ticket resale website are a good idea. Many tickets are bought months in advance and no-one knows what they will be doing by then. However, they are often abused by people who wish to make an extortionate profit and therefore legislation must be put in place to limit this.",
