        "action": "Support Putin and Assad in defeating terrorism and bring peace to Syria",
        "additional_details": "Putin has now stepped in by request of Assad, (with the Chinese) to bring stability to Syria by defeating all the terror groups that oppose the Assad regime. The Russians, being long term allies of the Arab world understand the region far better than western countries. Putin's actions are tremendously popular among Syrians and Iraqis http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/611660/Syria-Iraq-Lebanon-Vladimir-Putin-Russia-Islamic-State-ISIS. The UK should do all it can to help Putin stabilise Syria.",
        "background": "The UK has followed the disastrous US/ EU policy of de-stabilising Syria by undermining the elected Assad government. This has led to the rise of terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al Qaeda (Al Nusra) and the FSA. The Syrian people were not deserting their country under the rule of Assad. ",
