        "additional_details": "This is an offence which keeps being carried out. This suggests the punishment is simply not robust enough. These are vulnerable people, who, at times, have no-one to speak for them. We are failing them as a society, if we do not draft specific legislation that protects them from physical, mental and psychological assault. ",
        "background": "The response to abuse of a cared for elderly person is that the perpetrators are given a warning, sacked or investigated. This is not robust enough as the offence keeps happening. Legislation is needed to make it a specific offence, punishable ultimately by imprisonment.  ",
