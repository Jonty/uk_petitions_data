        "additional_details": "As an example, a final salary pension of \u00a318k p.a. eats up 58% of the lifetime allowance before any further pension savings are made. It does not leave much headroom and will not equate to extravagant riches in old age. Please reconsider the lifetime allowance limit.",
        "background": "The current  lifetime allowance means we will not have enough pension income  in retirement. We want to have enough income so we are not reliant on the state and with a decent pension income, we will fuel the economy. This makes even more sense as the population is ageing. Please think again!",
