        "background": "Many false and misleading claims were made during the campaign which deceived people who were not able to judge the issues dispassionately. \r\nThese gross misrepresentations at the very least justify a second referendum to determine whether the result is truly the settled will of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
