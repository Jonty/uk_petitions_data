        "action": "Amend the Data Protection Act to exempt registration of household CCTV systems",
        "additional_details": "Details of households that register their CCTV system will appear on a searchable Public Register. See https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/cctv\r\n\r\nIn one London Ward alone, household CCTV covering the street has been submitted to the Police and has directly led to over 100 arrests for mostly burglary and other serious crimes in the past five years. If householders choose to turn cameras inwards to avoid this unfair charge then burglary rates will rise and detection rates will inevitably fall.",
        "background": "Following a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the UK Information Commissioner has ruled that household CCTV systems that film beyond the boundary of the property, such as the street, must now be registered. The ICO has implemented this with an annual fee of \u00a335/year per household.",
