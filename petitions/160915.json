        "additional_details": "As teachers we have a duty of care towards our children and if we are unable to mark correctly, the Department for Education is setting schools and children up to fail. We have not seen any good positive need for this marking system and we are now angry at having to use it over and above a perfectly good marking system used for many years prior. Children\u2019s minds should not be bogged down with a complicated marking system. Go back to A - U, keep it simple and teaching improves. ",
        "background": "There is no standardised system or coherent system that any one school can take and use. The system is failing children as schools are unsure how to use the new marking system so the children suffer. This petition is highlighting the need to revert back to simple but effective A - U marking.",
