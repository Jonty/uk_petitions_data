        "action": "Make Schools Amend SRE Policies Critical of Same-Sex Marriage and Relationships",
        "additional_details": "Many schools in England and Wales have Sex and Relationships Education policies including wording that insinuates homosexual unions cannot be considered equal to heterosexual marriage. Bishop Challoner School in Basingstoke even goes as far as to insinuate that \"homosexual partnership and a heterosexual marriage can never be equated\", and implies that the law still reflects this harmful view. This petition asks the Government to ensure that schools amend these policies to eliminate inequality.",
        "background": "Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 prohibited the \"promotion\" of same-sex relationships in the Sex and Relationships Education in England and Wales. In 2015, this law has long been off the books. Unfortunately, a small number of schools maintain SRE policies echoing this hateful attitude.",
