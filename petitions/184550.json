        "action": "Remove Corporate and Media Funding From the UK Political System.",
        "additional_details": "Electoral funding should be minimised. It should be financed with public money, by a process that reflects an equal distribution to either parties or MPs. A process to be decided by parliament, if the motion is agreed. \r\nMedia owners hold to much influence over voters. This does not benefit the electorate, but their own interests and is facilitated by their sponsorship of politics.\r\nThe same applies to corporations, in which MPs should be allowed no investments, financial (or positional) for life.",
        "background": "In order for the UK to have a true democracy, the interests of the electorate should be at the core of government policy. \r\nAs long a big business and the media fund political parties, the interests of their sponsors and a desire to remain in power, prevents a government from fulfilling its duties.
