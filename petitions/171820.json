It is estimated that 99% of all species that have lived on earth are now extinct, and over 150,000 become extinct every day. these animals have limited lives as it is, and it isn't right for us as a dominant and prosperous species to constrain the animals to a restricted life in a cage. ",

I am petitioning to end animal captivity and give every animal the freedom it deserves.",
