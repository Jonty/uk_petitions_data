For the past eight or so years my mother,a nd many others aroudn the nation, has been forced to endure a tedious and unsuitable appilcation process. On top of their impairment this far too complicated and produces failure after failure. The governments report details the loss of life that this process has forced. This effects the most vulnerable of our people. One simple step, it could make all difference.",
        "background": "There is concern from the public that the assessment process for these benefits has not been satisfactory. One small and widely popular step to increase efficiency, satisfaction and quality would be ensuring NHS medical professionals carry out assessments. Our disabled kin are worth that much.",
