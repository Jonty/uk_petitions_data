        "action": "Require all UK broadband/telephone lines to become fibre to the property (FTTP).",
        "additional_details": "The UK's broadband network is now a matter of national economic and social importance, but BT Openreach, the monopoly owner of the UK's broadband network focuses only on providing copper cables to the property (FTTC). Less than 1% of UK telephone and broadband connections have fibre all the way to the property, which is the only future proof method of delivering fast, reliable broadband. Broadband connects businesses and individuals to the trade routes of the 21st century and Portugal, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy all outstrip the UK in deploying fibre to the property. This must change if the UK economy is to thrive.",
        "background": "Less than 1% of UK telephone and broadband lines provide fibre to the property (FTTP). BT Openreach, the monopoly owner of the UK's broadband infrastructure continue to focus on copper connections to the property (FTTC). This is harming the UK economy and must change.",
