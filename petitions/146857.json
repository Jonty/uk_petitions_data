A general election will enable the electorate to\r\n inspect the integrity and truthfulness of the Leave Campaigners promises. It will enable political parties to explain and state clearly, the pros and cons of acting on the referendum. To prepare a manifesto that they can then be held accountable for. Before we exit we should sure that we have been told the truth and not sold a lie.",

BUT 75% of MPs voted differently to the country. \r\nParliament no longer represents the will of the people.The new Prime Minister should be chosen by the public via an election not by Party Grandees.
