        "additional_details": "The proposed location for the radio base station is New River, Ridge Avenue, Bush Hill.\r\n\r\nOnce homed, the radio base station will destroy the river bed and the habitat of the local swans. Additionally, radiation exposure can cause serious health problems, therefore extreme caution should be taken when in close proximity to the station. \r\n\r\nAside from the destruction and health drawbacks, the radio base station is an eyesore and will destroy the property value of homes in the Bush Hill area.",
        "background": "Telef\u00f3nica are looking to move an obscene radio base station to Bush Hill, including unattractively large equipment cabinets, antennas and palisade fencing.\r\n\r\nThis will devalue the area, interrupt the habitat of the riverbed swans and cause unknown radioactive damage to the local residence.",
