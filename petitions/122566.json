        "action": "Up the minimum wage from \u00a36.70 to \u00a37.50 for all workers above the age of 21.",
        "additional_details": "I feel it's not fair and should be taken into account for debate in the house of commons. This is discriminating towards people between the age bracket of 21-24 and I don't believe this is fair on people who are bullied into employment, having to take on any job they can possibly find at minimum wage. I don't see a problem with having to find a job to get by in life, but why does the government discriminate against people like us who struggle as it stands to survive on such a small income?",
        "background": "Workers above the age of 21 should be entitled to the same wage as workers who are 25 years and older. People within the 21-24 age bracket need to survive just as much as 25+ year old workers who are entitled for more. And for what reason gives them a higher entitlement as we are all equals?",
