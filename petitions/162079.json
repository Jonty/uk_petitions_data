        "action": "Make Cameron pay back extra severance payments to his aides.",
        "additional_details": "This 'bonus' has increased the cost to the taxpayer by \u00a3282K. It was justified by Cameron\u2019s private secretary by saying that Cameron was \u201cconscious that the situation they find themselves in is through no fault of their own\u201d.\r\nWe believe this is an insult to people made redundant with no golden handshake & to taxpayers whose money Cameron feels he can gift to his friends at will.\r\nIf Cameron feels so strongly he should pay the bonus himself, if not please reduce payments to what the contract says.",
        "background": "Cameron demanded that his closest aides be paid severance pay above what is in their contracts. The contracts they signed state that they are entitled to 4\u00bd months' severance pay, Cameron ordered John Manzoni, the head of the civil service, to pay them 6 months instead, against his strong advice.",
