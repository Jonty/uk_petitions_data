They should not act or take decisions in order to gain financial or other  material benefits for themselves, their family, or their friends. They must declare and resolve any interests and relationships.\r\n\r\nObjectivity\r\nHolders of public office must act and take decisions impartially, fairly and on merit, using the best evidence and without discrimination or bias. \r\n\r\nAccountability\r\nHolders of public office are accountable for their decisions and actions and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny necessary to ensure this. \r\n\r\nOpenness\r\nHolders of public office should act and take decisions in an open and transparent manner. Information should not be withheld from the public unless there are clear and lawful reasons for doing so. .\r\n\r\nHonesty\r\nHolders of public office should be truthful. \r\n\r\nLeadership\r\nHolders of public office should exhibit these principles in their own behaviour. They should actively promote and robustly support the principles and be willing to challenge poor behaviour wherever it occurs.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office",
