        "action": "Make it law to notify residents of newly released child sex offenders.",
        "additional_details": "On release from prison those who have committed sexual offences against children are managed to a degree with local police etc. but residents often carry on unaware of who lives around them. Some offenders may feel the urge to carry out the same offences and to prevent that from happening parents need to know so they can keep their children away from offenders. This is not to persecute further but to aid in the prevention of these crimes being committed again.",
        "background": "Make it law to notify residents within a 10 mile radius of newly released from prison child sex offenders. At present those who commit the most heinous crimes against children are free to live amongst children under minimal conditions. Parents have a right to know so they can protect their children.",
