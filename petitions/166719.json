        "additional_details": "The Oromo people are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia and make up 40% of the population. They have experienced discrimination at the hands of the government which has been dominated by the minority ethnic group Tigray for decades. \r\n\r\nThe situation in Ethiopia has become increasingly unstable since security forces repeatedly fired upon protests in the Amhara and Oromia regions in August 2016. \r\n\r\nFor more info: https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/09/08/joint-letter-un-human-rights-council-ethiopia\r\n",
        "background": "We believe that the UK government should stop enabling the Ethiopian government and that they should support calls for an international, and independent investigation into the treatment of the Oromo people. Most recently this has lead to the death of 23 Oromo prisoners in a fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
