The \u00a3350 million that goes to the EU each week \"will all be put into the NHS\".\r\n2. We will drastically reduce immigration once outside the EU. \r\n3. The economy won't be affected. \r\n\r\nAll of these have been shown to be incorrect. Something the leave campaigners have only admitted after the referendum had happened. \r\n\r\nI do not want people so prepared to manipulate the public in charge of this country!",
        "background": "1.The EU referendum should not have been held in the first place.\r\n2.The only way of overturning this terrible decision is a new party in power who have a cancellation of Brexit in their manifesto. \r\n3.I feel this is the only way to prevent Boris Johnson pushing an even further right wing agenda.",
