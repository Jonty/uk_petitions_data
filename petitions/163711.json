        "action": "Make it compulsory to fly the Union Flag on all public buildings.",
        "additional_details": "The UK is one of the only countries in the world where the flying of the national flag is actively discouraged by local councils and governmental bodies. This is a national & international disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe UK has decided that it no longer wishes to be politically associated with our European neighbours, rather to display our independence. Yet we are actively discouraged from showing our national flag as a symbol of that very independence.",
        "background": "The UK appears to have a most disgraceful fear of displaying our national flag on public buildings, on the grounds of either some misplaced sense of danger under health & safety legislation or for fear of offending some minority group.",
