        "additional_details": "France, Paris.127 dead with 200+ injured. \r\nLebanon, Beirut. 41 dead with 180+ injured. \r\nIraq, Baghdad. 26 dead with 40+ injured. \r\nThese are not the only attacks that have been held by IS this year. The death toll increases with beheadings and other atrocities committed by IS. These are attacks of war. They will not stop; this will escalate until they attack Britain and many more at their heart. We can act now, or become victims of our own incompetence to take action.\r\n",
        "background": "In light of the recent terror attacks on France, Lebanon, and Iraq, we have come to what I would consider breaking point and the time for action. The use of drone strikes is proving to not be enough and is only increasing the Middle East\u2019s distaste for the West. Drone strikes are clearly not enough.",
