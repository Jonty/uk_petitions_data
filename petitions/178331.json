        "action": "HM Gov must not force residents of Warrington to pay tolls on new Mersey Bridge",
        "additional_details": "This promise was not conditional on anything but the Conservative party getting elected.\r\n\r\nThis is an even bigger lie than that told by Nick Clegg and his infamous tuition fee pledge.\r\n\r\nThere is a suggestion that there is a threat of legal action from other local authorities. But the Government should have considered this risk BEFORE making such a critical promise.\r\n\r\nThe local Conservative MP won the seat with a very slim majority, and it is likely that this pledge swung the vote.",
        "background": "The Chancellor George Osborne made a pledge before the last election: that if the Conservative party was elected, it would scrap toll fees for the residents of Warrington who use the new Mersey Bridge. This promise has now been disgracefully broken, and we demand that this decision is reversed.",
