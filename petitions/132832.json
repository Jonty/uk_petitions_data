        "additional_details": "The government should BAN the fascist and racist Britain First from existing as a group.\r\n\r\nOther groups that incite racial hatred and intimidate individuals have been banned and so should these thugs!\r\n\r\nDemand that all social media sites are closed down entirely and if they are put up again, those responsible should be prosecuted!\r\n\r\nSay no to fear, intimidation and segregation that these thugs want.\r\n\r\nAll of Britain should stand together and rid the internet and our streets of vicious, insulting venom!",
        "background": "Britain First are an extremist offshoot of the BNP. Via the internet and social media the group spews out anti Muslim propaganda in order to fulfill their goal of an 'Holy War' against the Muslim community in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government must proscribe this party before they achieve their aims.",
