        "additional_details": "Critical to an EEA-based solution is the preservation of access to the single market (and associated conditions) as enjoyed by EFTA countries. The referendum was very specific regarding EU membership and did not prescribe any alternative scenario. Simply leaving the EU satisfies the majority who voted for it. Choosing an EEA-based relationship (as the alternative to membership) is a solution which is also the best possible alternative for the significant remainder, who did not wish to leave.",
        "background": "In the 2016 referendum the UK electorate voted to leave the EU by a narrow margin. No clear alternative scenarios were proposed by the various leave campaigns. An EEA-based relationship (akin to Norway) is the best outcome for remain campaigners whilst satisfying the overall referendum mandate.",
