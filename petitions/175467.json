        "additional_details": "There are now areas of sea across the world almost entirely covered in plastics, so often the result of thoughtless pollution of materials we consume readily every day - such as plastic bottles. This pollution has done great damage to the nature and sea and wildlife in areas where currents have taken these polluted materials. A charge would go some way to encouraging less pollution and as a result, less damage to our planet's natural environments and wildlife. It is also the case that many of the chemicals contained in plastic bottles are detrimental to both human and animal health; yet we consume these goods unknowingly and without due thought. ",
        "background": "Plastic bottles our damaging out health. There are toxic chemicals in plastic bottles, including polycarbonates which are linked to conditions such as cancer and an increased risk of diabetes.  Many bottles are also then polluted and ultimately damage animals and contribute to climate change. ",
