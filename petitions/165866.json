The groups are not accountable to anyone and nor are their financial records.\r\nMany start off with good intent but cannot cope when they are inundated with animals and have a lack of funding.",
        "background": "After a bad experience with an online animal rescue group, who illegally re-homed my cat, I learned of others who had difficulties with them. Animal suffering was also suggested. Anyone can set up an online rescue group; there are no premises; they need no licence; the RSPCA  find it hard to inspect",
