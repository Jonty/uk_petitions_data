        "additional_details": "Once our green land is gone, it is gone forever.\r\nNot only does this increase the risk of urban sprawl, what about our environmental responsibility to protect our dwindling countryside & dwindling native species?\r\nIt is deeply worrying that the once 'untouchable unless in exceptional circumstances' green belt rule is now so vulnerable. There are over 66,000 hectares of brown field left in the U.K. & thousands of derelict houses which could be redeveloped before we resort to losing our heritage.",
        "background": "Ministers will next month back building thousands of houses on green belt land despite environmental concerns.\r\nOver 300,000 homes around English cities are earmarked to be built with councils proposing an additional 22,000 homes for the green belt in their draft local plans.\r\n",
