        "action": "Introduce Laws that Ban Lorry Drivers out of the Inside Lane",
        "additional_details": "Almost all lorries on the road are limited, and that limit is almost always below 60mph, yet lorry drivers still feel the need to overtake another lorry on major roads - this slows all traffic. When this happens, often both lanes (or 2 of 3 on a motorway) are blocked and can't allow any faster traffic to proceed, sometimes waiting for several minutes for the overtake to be completed. It not only slows you down, but a whole line of traffic behind. Allow traffic to flow and speed up. Sign now.",
        "background": "How many times have you been slowed up on a dual carriageway or motorway because of a lorry overtaking? In many countries around the world, it is illegal for them to move outside the inside lane, I propose this law be brought to Great Britain to speed up traffic.",
