        "additional_details": "Belgium, Denmark, Norway & Netherlands have pledged $10m each (\u00a37.9 million) towards covering the \u00a3480 million shortfall caused by the US Mexico City Policy. The UK is now being pressured into helping to pick up the rest of the bill which could be in the tens of millions. This would be on top of the \u00a3334.9 million of British taxpayer's money that the UK Department for International Development has already committed to overseas programmes for population policies and abortion in 2016-17. ",
        "background": "At a time when the NHS is in crisis and other domestic budgets are being cut, we urge the Department for International Development to resist pressure from the Dutch Government to pour millions of pounds into the global abortion fund set up in response to the US withdrawal of global abortion funding.",
