Wether it's emotionally or physically, both condemn the same feelings, attitude and body language. We as Britain should be proud of our hard working country, but how can we let it slip and go unnotice? We may not be able to abolish the demonic actions in others, but we can prevent it. Stand with me, stand with the victims, and stand against bullying!",
