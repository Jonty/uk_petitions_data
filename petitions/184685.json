I have two young children and I married my husband from my hospital bed.\r\nAfter pioneering last resort radical surgery by Christina Fotopoulo my life was saved.\r\nDespite the cancer being very likely to return and unlikely to be caught in time without regular scans I was horrified to discover that the NHS do not offer check up scans to all high risk patients like me. \r\nHelp save a life.\r\n",
        "background": "I would like patients at high risk of their cancer returning or at high risk of being diagnosed with metastatic cancer to have life saving annual check ups no matter where they live. \r\nAt the moment this is a postcode lottery. \r\nPlease sign my petition. \r\nIt may save your life or a loved ones life.",
