        "action": "Ban shops from selling cotton as hamster bedding in all shops",
        "additional_details": "When hamsters put the cotton in their pouches, it can get stuck which could lead to an infection. The cotton can get wrapped around their limbs and hamsters will instinctively tug on it which can break or dislocate their legs. I have even heard of a case where a hamster has tried to chew their leg off. This can cause blockages in the hamster\u2019s intestines because it can\u2019t be digested. Cotton can cause respiratory issues.It may enter the lungs. This causes a slow and a very painful death.",
        "background": "All of the time, hamsters accidently swallow their bedding and this is completely fine (well, if the bedding is paper based). If it is not paper based (especially cotton) it can cause fatal issues for hamsters and quite easily, death.",
