        "additional_details": "Annual State Pension for British pensioners living overseas are only paid in 16 countries outside of the EU and Britain has not signed any new treaties for this since 1981. \u00a0When Britain exits the EU, the mechanism that allows pension increases to be paid there will also cease. \u00a0For this reason, we call upon the Government of the United Kingdom to ensure that when the UK leaves the EU, appropriate provision is made with the European Union to allow the payment of these increases.\r\n",
        "background": "Depending on what treaties are agreed for Britain's exit from the EU, some British pensioners living in the EU may lose their annual State pension increases. We call upon the Government of the United Kingdom to commit to maintaining these increases for all British pensioners living in the EU.",
