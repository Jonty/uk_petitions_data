        "additional_details": "Farmed chickens are already kept in horrific, crowded and filthy conditions. If the poultry industry is allowed to control and write animal welfare codes for all chicken farming, welfare standards will drop drastically (as the industry is only interested in making money).\r\n\r\nChickens are gentle, sentient beings who need protection. Giving the poultry industry control over their welfare will lead to more animal cruelty and abuse. Please Keep Animal Welfare Codes for Chicken Farming! ",

Move to industry led guidance - allow the poultry industry to control and write animal welfare codes for all chicken farming. \r\n",
