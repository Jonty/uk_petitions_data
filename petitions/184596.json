        "additional_details": "Fake news is a scourge and has been for some considerable time.\r\nIt creates distrust of information that is supposed to inform the public.\r\nNews media outlets are no longer reliable sources of unbiased news, they are in fact attempting to make news and drive public opinion politically in directions favourable to their owners own views.\r\nThe aim of the media is apparently to hold governments and others to account, yet no one is holding the media to account for faking news reports.",
        "background": "Fake news stories should never make it to broadcast status or be publicised.\r\nAll corporate media outlets whether broadcast news or printed should have to verify, validate and publicise their sources for reports or face criminal charges and heavy financial penalties for disseminating fake news.",
