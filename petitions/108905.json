        "additional_details": "Halal is an evil way of killing animals for meat. \r\nThey have there throats slit and bleed to death in excruciating pain. \r\nThis is not fair and in modern society I feel it is unacceptable way slaughtering animals. \r\nHalal slaughter is a barbaric practise and I feel that all non Muslims should have the option to opt out of consuming such food. \r\nPlease sign this petition and help give more animals the dignity and respect they deserve by making halal meat a choice and not something we have to accept ",
