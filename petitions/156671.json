        "action": "Create measures to prevent rise in racism & xenophobia following  EU exit vote",
        "additional_details": "Some sections of our society are using the EU referendum, and its results to bring to the UK a tide of discrimination and intolerance; blaming anything from school performance to job availability on immigrants; using the right to vote as an excuse to treat minorities in a hostile manner, to subject people who serve the UK in a hostile and abusive way. This has to be faced and tackled before it gets worse. Measures need to be put in place to stem racism now. Acceptance, not hate and ignorance.",
        "background": "Leading up the EU referendum there was a significant rise in racist/xenophobic comments and judgments.  Anti immigration views became the focus of the vote, rather than a consideration of what was best for the UK as a nation.  A Leave vote seems to have provided validation for negative racist views",
