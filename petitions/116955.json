Just in my local town there have been numerous accidents this year, and plenty on the news of drivers going the wrong way up the motorway and roundabouts as they lose ability with age. I think it's time this is seriously considered for the health and safety of everyone. \r\n",
        "background": "I would like it to be the law to have your basic driving skills tested every 5 years after the age of 60, after the tragedies on the road this year from elderly drivers, I really think the time has come this is seriously considered. Not only older drivers crash, but it is an clear flaw in the law.",
