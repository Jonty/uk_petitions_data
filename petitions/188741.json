        "additional_details": "Tried to get tickets to Arcade Fire. Payment failed twice and then the tickets were no longer available. Out of interest clicked on the links on the site to see if I could get them somewhere else. Available on both StubHub and Heatwave at a minimum of \u00a3129 per ticket, face value price \u00a355.\r\nIt seems obvious that either companies or individuals are buying tickets with the express intention of reselling them at a huge profit. This prevents all but the very wealthy from seeing the bands they love.",
        "background": "Like many people I have found that although tickets sell out within minutes of release they are instantly available at over twice the price on resellers websites.\r\nThis secondary selling only serves to make profit for a few with no added benefit for music fans. ",
