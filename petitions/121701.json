        "action": "That MPs should work full time as an MP and not have outside jobs.",
        "additional_details": "I am also fed up of watching parliament in progress with hardly any MPs in the chamber.They are answerable to the public as they are paid out of taxes and as such are public employees. Very few employees in the public sector are allowed to have second jobs, so why should they be allowed to be able to do this.",
        "background": "A large number of MPs appear to have numerous second jobs. My view is that being an MP should be a full time job. If they can find time to do many other jobs then they should be paid pro rata. If they have time to do other jobs then perhaps they shouldn't be an MP.",
