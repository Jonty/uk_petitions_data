        "action": "Parliament to vote on leaving the EU",
        "additional_details": "The EU referendum was advisory in nature with no legislative standing. If the new Prime Minister starts the process of leaving the EU by triggering Article 50 without consulting parliament there is a risk that the decision could be challenged in the courts.\r\n\r\nIf no agreement is reached within 2 years of triggering Article 50 then UK legislation is automatically nullified. This could happen without parliament ever having voted on the issue. Is that constitutional? A key part of the Leave campaign was to restore UK parliamentary sovereignty. Our parliament must have the opportunity to debate and vote on this decision.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to table a vote in parliament to decide whether to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. This decision has such far reaching constitutional consequences for the UK it should only be done by parliament. ",
