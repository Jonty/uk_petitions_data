        "additional_details": "This year, France bring into law legislation, stating that any image that has been digitally altered to change a model's body shape must be marked 'retouched photograph': Any companies found to be breaching these rules will be fined  37,500 Euros. I propose that the British government follow suit and pass legislation in order to make it unlawful for fashion magazines and advertising campaigns to fail to disclose that models' images have been digitally altered.

        "background": "Conditions such as anorexia and muscle dysmorphic disorder are more common than ever. We are bombarded by photoshopped bodies in advertising campaigns and magazines, creating unrealistic expectations of what a healthy body looks like. I wish for government legislation to be passed to combat this.",
