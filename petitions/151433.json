Options floated in the campaign include the \u201cNorwegian model,\u201d with UK still enjoying many benefits of EU membership.   Norway's part of the European Economic Area (EEA) & the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) allowing free movement and access to the single market.  \r\n\r\n It's reasonable to assume that many who voted \u201cleave\u201d thought this would be the model for Brexit.   The close result gives no mandate for anything more drastic.  ",
