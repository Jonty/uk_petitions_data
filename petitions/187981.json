        "action": "Restrict the amount of palm oil allowed in any product sold in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Palm oil has found its way into 50% of all packaged foods on the supermarket shelves. Policy has already been passed to ensure that all of these products state they contain palm oil, however, this is not sufficient as these companies (such as Iceland, PepsiCo, and many make-up businesses) are still producing products containing a large percentage of palm oil that are sourced from unsustainable practices that are not RSPO approved.",
        "background": "The palm oil industry is contributing to mass deforestation through the clearing of rainforests for palm plantations, destroying habitats and driving extinction.\r\nThis petition asks for regulations on the source of palm oil, and restrictions to the % amount allowed in products sold in the UK.",
