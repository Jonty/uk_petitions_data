        "additional_details": "Cigarette bins wouldn't cost much money, in fact they would save money because the road sweepers wouldn't have to come out all the time. Children with breathing problems like asthma have to walk through the smokers to get into the hospital. Our hospitals cost a lot of money and we should respect them. Fine the grown-ups who smoke and don't put their stubs in the bin and the money made from the smokers can be given to the hospitals to help them improve or have better facilities. ",
        "background": "My name is Callum I am 9 years old. I was horrified and furious at the state of the pavement in front of Alder Hey which was littered with millions of cigarette stubs. Just put a bin there. Alder Hey is a children's hospital and sick kids have to walk through all those cigarette stubs. ",
