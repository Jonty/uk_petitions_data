        "additional_details": "Hidradenitis Supprativa is a rare skin condition and chronic illness that affects less than 1% of the worlds population. The disease is incurable, not often manageable or controllable. It presents its self with lesions, boils in abscesses in areas such as the groin, inner thighs and under arm region. Treatments range pending of the severity of the condition but the affects are all the same. Bleeding, oozing, infections, a&e visits, uneducated medical practitioners and lack of support. ",
        "background": "Hidradenitis is a debilitating skin disease. Suffers lack the support and recognition that they deserve to cope with this disease every single day. I am appealing so that I, amongst 1000's of others feel that the state is finally and officially recognising the affects of this condition. ",
