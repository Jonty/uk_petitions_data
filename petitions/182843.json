It details how it causes harm internally, by causing blockages in the stomach and also wrapping round limbs which results in potential self-amputation.\r\n\r\nThe material needs to be banned from pet shops, it has claimed the lives of thousands of pets and continues to do so with the lack of awareness on the dangers.",
        "background": "Cotton style (Cotton, wool, vegetable fibres) nesting material is harmful to pets yet is still sold in a number of shops nationwide. See Additional details for further information. \r\nI lost two hamsters to the bedding and after discovering it had happened to hundreds more, I started this campaign.",
