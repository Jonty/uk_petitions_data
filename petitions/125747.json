MP's should answer directly any concerns  the public have in plain language \r\nCareer politicians use spinning to avoid questioning and therefore do not give the public the answer they are entitled too. \r\nThe people of the UK are entitled to and deserve real answers to issues they care about without the questions they ask being avoided. \r\nMP's should always serve the people not there own interests! ",

Instead politics is turning into one mans ego fighting another, scaremongering, name calling and bullying! ",
