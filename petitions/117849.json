        "additional_details": "I have had to pay 2 lots of council tax on several occasions. One single person discount in the property that I live in here I use all council services and 1 at 100% charge where it has been between tenants and no facilities at all have been used. This investment is my only pension as I am a sole trader and I am again being penalised.",
        "background": "Empty properties are now charged 100% council tax despite non use of local facilities. There isn't even an allowance for non person discount rather than single person discount. This penilases (again) landlords that are between tenants or are forced to sell.",
