        "additional_details": "In Northern Ireland you must have a reason to vote by post. \u00a0This may be because:\r\n-You are away from home due to work, study or a holiday during an election\r\n-You have moved home and are still registered at your old address\r\n-You have an illness or disability that prevents you from going to the polling station\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to press the government into bringing the rest of the UK into line with this common sense principle in order to further combat postal vote fraud",
        "background": "The current system of postal voting in England, Wales & Scotland is weak and susceptible to fraud. This petition seeks a change to the law so that electors must provide a reason why they cannot reasonably be expected to go to the polling station on a permanent or long-term basis",
