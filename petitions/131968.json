        "additional_details": "There are 1.2 million vegetarians in the UK and this is a lot more than the amount of vegans. This could be due to the ease of the lifestyle due to food products being labelled as vegetarian. I feel that if a vegan label was created the number of vegans could match the number of vegetarians which would be a great step within humanity, making the world a better place in terms of health, the environment and of course the lives of innocent animals ",
        "background": "The number of vegans in the UK has increased significantly to 542,000. This number could increase even more if this lifestyle was made easier ie. By food being clearly labelled as vegan! This simple step could encourage this lifestyle and help save and improve the lives of animals, and humans too",
