        "additional_details": "The situation has reached such farcical proportions that the government actually currently condones thieves stealing from feeble-minded and vulnerable members of society.  They permit thieves to steal by pretending to receive message from dead people and the government apparently sees nothing wrong with this.\r\n\r\nThose with more than two firing synapses should surely try to force the government to raise a law to prohibit such thieves from advertising or performing.  That, at least, is a start!   \r\n",
        "background": "Surely, in this day and age, education is of prime importance. How can we possibly BEGIN to educate when MILLIONS of people believe in things which do not exist?\r\nWHY should thieves be PERMITTED (and condoned by government!) to steal from unfortunate souls who believe in messages from dead people?",
