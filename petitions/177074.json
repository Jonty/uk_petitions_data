        "additional_details": "To avoid any biased government interpretations & calculations of our concerns and wishes, we propose the public always be given access to ALL government consultation materials: http://tiny.cc/gov-data. Our personal data (except postcodes for demographic analysis) should automatically be blacked-out from the outset, and the \u00a3 caps scrapped. And, if we are to have any confidence in published consultation results, a simple system to show whether we are FOR or AGAINST a proposal must be introduced.",
        "background": "The larger the public consultation the less public it is. That's because, if the cost of protecting personal data exceeds the \u00a3450-600 cap individual comments aren't published. This must change: in a transparent democracy our opinions must be seen, and a clear FOR or AGAINST tally system included.",
