        "action": "Stage new EU referendum before Article 50 to reflect changed voting demographic",
        "additional_details": "The advisory Brexit referendum produced a result which will not be formally acted upon until an as-yet unknown date, extremely and unusually remote in time from the date of the vote. By this date the UK population will not be the same as that which voted in June 2016, and the economic and political realities of the UK and EU will have changed in significant ways. A new vote should be carried out immediately prior to triggering article 50 to ensure the result is relevant, fair and representative",
        "background": "By the time Article 50 is triggered, the voting population of the UK will be significantly different from the population as it was in June 2016 by reason of people turning 18 and others dying. Such an important decision should be based on the wishes of the true eligible UK population at that time. ",
