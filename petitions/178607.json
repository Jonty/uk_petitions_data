        "additional_details": "We're living in a deteriorating climate, affecting every living species on Earth, but is our sole cause. The Paris Climate Agreement has masked some form of historic agreement, but its efforts are meaningless with no regulatory body; and so no motivation for the Government to do all in their power to solve this issue. \r\n\r\nScientists estimate that a safe level of Carbon in our atmosphere is around 350 parts per million, however, we're approaching 400. Action is needed to protect vulnerable species, including ourselves. \r\n\r\nGenerated revenue should be used to reduce income tax, or preferably re-invested into the renewable-energy sector. ",
        "background": "A tax upon activities which pollute via the release of Carbon should be introduced, let it be burning Fossil Fuels or Deforestation. This tax would allow consumption which involves Carbon pollution to be less attractive to the consumer, who instead would choose a more sustainable route.",
