        "additional_details": "Today's youth are among the most vocal, passionate and politically minded in history, they not only are capable of the chance to vote, but they deserve it too. \r\n\r\nJust like many say the EU is deciding Britain's policies, much of the youth believe that older generations are deciding their future. \r\n\r\nTwo years ago, Scottish youth were given the chance to vote on their nation's future. Today, I hope, the UK's youth will be given a chance to vote on their future.\r\n\r\nWill you give the youth a voice?",
        "background": "In the EU Referendum, no 16 or 17 year old was able to vote.  Yet they will have to live with a Brexit for longer than many 65+ voters have lived at all.\r\n\r\nHold a referendum for only 16-17 year olds, with its results added on to the current results to ensure a more representative and fair decision.",
