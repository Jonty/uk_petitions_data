The Scottish Government's BREXIT proposals clearly respond to the will of the majority of the Scottish people. Therefore, it is imperative that the UK Government positively act on this and agree a differential deal for Scotland based on a \"reverse Greenland\" precedent. ",
        "background": "The Scottish Government produced their paper \"Scotland's Place in Europe\" in 2016 to discuss options on how Scotland, together with the UK should negotiate its position within BREXIT. The UK government must act upon this document and actively aim to achieve and enforce it on behalf of all Scots. ",
