        "additional_details": "We spend less on healthcare (9.5% of GDP) than the rest of Europe. People in these counties also pay a direct fee to access health services e.g France spend 11.5% GDP and patients also pay \u20ac23 to see their GP.\r\nUnless the British public are prepared to pay a similar fee then funds must come from elsewhere.\r\nNHS efficiency savings are unsustainable and unrealistic. They have already cut to the bone and are being told cut further. We suggest that 1% on National Insurance be raised to pay for the NHS",
        "background": "It's time to face facts. If we want to continue having a health service that is free at the point of use then we need to pay for it.",
