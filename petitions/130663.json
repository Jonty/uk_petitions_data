        "additional_details": "Longer Separation Allowance (LSA) is currently paid to service personnel regardless of their family situation. As parents nowadays are expected to do an equal share it is unfair to parents with a deployed partner(or indeed ex partner with whom they share custody) to shoulder extra deprivations because of their partner's deployment. We ask therefore for a scheme to continue family life without undue burden.\r\nSee https://www.facebook.com/Help-Forces-Parents-821717114627365/ for more information.",
        "background": "Members of all three Services are currently deployed throughout the world. Many of these are parents, and deployment places an extra, unacknowledged burden on the families of personnel. We are asking for provision to be made for \"respite\" childcare allowances for all families with a deployed parent.",
