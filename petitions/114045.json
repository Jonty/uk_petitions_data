        "additional_details": "Indirect democracy, as it currently stands in the United Kingdom, does not provide the people with much real choice of direction. \r\nAn avenue for access to referendum would not affect Parliment's ability to function, but would likely limit attempts at implementation of broadly unpopular policies such as the poll tax or the Iraq war.\r\nAround 900,000 signatures would be required to gain 2% of the electorate currently - no small feat and surely enough to grant a true hearing of a petition. \r\n",
        "background": "In order to make certain that Parliment, in their decision making, acts in accordance with the will of the people, we ask for an avenue to direct democracy. \r\nSuch an option would likely dampen attempts to form policy considered extreme and keep the United Kingdom on a straighter path.",
