        "additional_details": "The EU referendum was the product of the present Tory government. It was fought with dirty tactics (including fear tactics) and plainly show us that the party is not united and is more focused on itself than on the public.\r\n\r\nOne of the major promises of the 'Leave' campaign was that we would Not be governed by people who were not elected to their position of power. The present government are not allowing this and THEIR party members are choosing our new PM.\r\n\r\nA vote of no confidence is needed.\r\n",
        "background": "On 24th June 2016, the results of the EU referendum were counted and made public. Thanks to a marginal difference in favour of the 'Leave' party, the UK will give up its EU membership. The Prime Minister then publicly resigned, leaving a divided nation in his wake. We need another general election.",
