        "action": "This petition calls for a total ban on the use of packs of hounds for hunting",
        "additional_details": "Police forces across the country readily admit that they have no manpower to monitor hunting. When faced with evidence of illegal kills, assaults on saboteurs , foxes bred in captivity to release for the hunts, they rarely prosecute. \r\nThe majority of UK residents would like to see a total ban on fox/hare/deer hunting with a pack of hounds. It's a \" sport\" that should be consigned to our history books. \r\nHunts continue to hunt illegally, ignoring the law and the will of the British public. \r\n",
        "background": "Fox hunting has been banned for a number of years. Hunts still kill ,claiming it was an accident. They can follow a man made trail legally but this leads to confusion in making a prosecution as the hunt readily admits the hounds are uncontrollable when catching the scent of a live fox. ",
