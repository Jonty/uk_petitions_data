        "action": "Introduce a fee to people who use A&E as a result of alcohol/drunken injuries.",
        "additional_details": " We have such a stretched national health service and the budgets and the balance sheets are the worst that they have ever seen surely there must be a simple way to claw some of this money back.  By introducing a fee for people who abuse this service with the drunken injuries this will not only reduce the amount of people who come in for the bumps and grazes but it will also and significant much-needed funds.  Please share and support this petition as much as you possibly can & help save the NHS",
