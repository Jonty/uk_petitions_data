The 2014 Scottish independence referendum established a convention giving 16 & 17 year olds the right to vote in decisions of national interest and long term implication. Given successive government and independent polls indicating a high probability of voting contrary to the result of the EU referendum within this age group a second referendum must be held with their inclusion.",
