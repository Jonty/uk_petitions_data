        "additional_details": "There is evidence that non-binary genders exist and are valid, for example the 'Scottish Trans Alliance: Trans Mental Health Study 2012', the figures collected in this study conclude that around 26% to 29% of trans people in the UK identify somewhere outside the gender binary (about 165000 people), which is not an insignificant amount of people, these genders should be respected and treated as valid, non binary individuals are often marginalized; this can have a devastating effect on them.",
        "background": "Non-Binary individuals in the UK have their gender identities invalidated and many are not protected by the Equality Act 2010, this means those which do not identify as a binary gender are not treated as if their gender matters. A binary understanding of gender is outdated and wrong. ",
