        "additional_details": "The EU referendum vote of 23 June 2016 may have been made on grounds of belief rather than fact on a simple 'yes/no' question that was not appropriate. The composition of government at that time has been swept away, as has its policy. Voters need the opportunity to elect a government on these policies, in the full knowledge of who will be in charge. It is also essential to give voters the chance to confirm their decision for Brexit in the light of outcomes",
        "background": "Just over one year since the latest General Election, the vote for Brexit has so changed the composition and policy of government that a further election should be held. And at this time a vote to confirm the Brexit decision can be held since so many of its implications have become clear.",
