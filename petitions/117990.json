        "action": "Keep Island Line in South Western rail franchise; not a self-sustaining business",
        "additional_details": "The proposals are set out in the South Western rail franchise stakeholder consultation document, which was published on 12 November 2015. The Rail Minister Claire Perry MP also outlined the plans in September: www.gov.uk/government/news/new-proposals-for-isle-of-wight-rail-services-announced\r\n\r\nThe Government are proposing that lesser-used community rail routes (such as Brockenhurst to Lymington) should be fully included in the franchise model. Island Line should continue to have the same support.",
        "background": "The DfT plans to turn Island Line into a separate self-sustaining business during the life of the next franchise (2017 onwards). We believe this essential service should instead - like other branch lines - continue to be supported within a wider network, with the franchisee required to invest in it.",
