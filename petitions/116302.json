        "action": "Make Visit Visas easier for parents of British Citizens",
        "additional_details": "Visit visas to the UK are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain for our parents who are from a non European country. All they want to do is come for a short period to visit their children and grandchildren who they would otherwise perhaps never or very rarely meet. \r\n\r\nWhy is it almost impossible? There's so many restrictions and criterion a person must meet making it even more difficult. It's only for a maximum of 6 months and they cannot get public funding. It should be made a lot easier",
        "background": "Many of us are lucky to have parents who live in the UK with us. We get to spend time with them and they get to share our lives with us. Some of us are not as fortunate. Some of us have parents who have never met our children- their grandchildren and it's heartbreaking every time a visa is refused",
