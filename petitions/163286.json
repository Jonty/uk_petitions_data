        "action": "Stop Privatisation of Lancaster Post Office",
        "additional_details": "The current post office is spacious which enables it to offer a wide range of services, it is on the ground floor, very close to town centre, is a couple of minutes walk from a large car park on Dallas Road and is next door to the local Royal Mail Delivery Office. W.H Smiths would offer non of these advantages except the fact it is in town centre because there is no nearby parking and having postal vans would have to go through a pedestrianised area.",
        "background": "Lancaster Post Office has become a historic local institution providing a wide range of services. Relocating it could reduce the service offered to customers in the long run, make access difficult for the disabled and the elderly and would be unsuitable for people who don't like crowded spaces.",
