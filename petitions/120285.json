        "action": "Extend the 2 year old 15 hours childcare funding to deployed military's children",
        "additional_details": "The extra money servicemen/women receive when deployed is spent on childcare if the other parent is working, or the other parent is forced to stop working, therefore taking away the incentive and consolation of being away from their families. The job requires short-notice deployments (often without a choice), meaning young children need professional emotional support and mothers struggle alone with children, often in towns faraway from the support of other family members and friends.",
        "background": "Often families are left struggling for support when servicemen and women are deployed for long periods of time, causing a disadvantage to their families, especially children below school age that do not have access to extra professional psychological support and the working parent left behind",
