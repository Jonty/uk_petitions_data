        "additional_details": "The leave campaign was manipulative and misleading.\r\nThe remain campaign failed to expose and educate people of the benefits and stability of being in the EU.\r\nMany people didn't understand the ramifications of their decision.\r\nDid people vote for the break-up of the UK (i.e Scotland)?\r\nWe appeal to the government to acknowledge the outcome,but to overrule in the best interests of the British public. That is the Governments role.  Leaving the EU will be too big a risk to our economy and way of life.",
        "background": "1.9% majority should not be sufficient to make such serious changes to British society.\r\nFew people know enough about economics, the EU, currency, inflation, trade agreements, politics etc to make such a momentous calculation.\r\nWe were not informed sufficiently to make an educated decision.",
