Any public authority may not use lack of resources as a defence. This IS what is currently happening. Cancer patients are being deprived of life extending/time extending drugs due to cost. After contributing all of their working lives and supporting cancer research/taking part in clinical trials...ultimately drugs are being denied. ",
        "background": "Axing and rejection of cancer drugs based on cost and overall survival rates is unfair. Many expensive drugs only come into play when other options are failing. At THIS point, overall all survival is a side issue. Extra treatment-free time is all that matters. UK cancer patients deserve this time.",
