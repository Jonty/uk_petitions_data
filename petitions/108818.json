        "action": "Airlines failing to pay passengers flight delay compensation must lose licences",
        "additional_details": "Under EC Regulation 261/2004, passengers of flight delayed 3+ hours are entitled to compensation of \u20ac250 to 600. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_Delay_Compensation_Regulation) Airlines continue to ignore this. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) would not enforce the Regulation in individual cases. The current state of enforcement is inadequate. CAA should be required to order airlines to pay flight delay compensation and to revoke the airline\u2019s licence if the airline fails to do so.",
        "background": "Airlines continue to fail to pay passengers \u20ac250 to \u20ac600 compensation for flight delays of 3 hours or more despite a clear legal requirement.  CAA (designated as the enforcement body) continues to fail to take appropriate action to compel them.  Offending airlines should have their licences revoked.",
