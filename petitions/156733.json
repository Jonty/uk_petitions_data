        "additional_details": "If a child isn't a social services child , and the other parent poses no threat then social services will not supervise,or provide centres. As a result it forces the supervisor which may be a family member or ex partner, to have them into their homes or be witnessed by others associating with a known sex offender. This may put the child's safety at risk .If the supervisor isn't educated about grooming they may inadvertadly put the child at risk.Why are our children not worth adequate protection?",
        "background": "Most children are protected by the law in areas that prevents child sex offenders having access to places where children are present . However children of sex offenders are not privy to the protection and given access to manipulators and grooming behaviour under supervision of unqualified people.",
