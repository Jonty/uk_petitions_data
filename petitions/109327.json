        "additional_details": "There are many examples of \u2018brake checking\u2019 uploaded to YouTube by cyclists with head cameras - a simple search brings them up:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=cyclist+brake+checking\r\n\r\nUsually the offender goes unpunished and even if they are taken to court they often just get points and/or a small fine for what is a deliberate attempt to endanger someone\u2019s life.",
        "background": "Cyclists often get \u2018brake checked\u2019 by cars passing them because the driver feels frustrated at being prevented from speeding. This is a deliberate attempt to cause an accident and should be treated as a form of aggravated assault and not simply a careless or dangerous driving charge.",
