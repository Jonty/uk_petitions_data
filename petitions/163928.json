I hope there will be a time when you can go to the shopping centre with no worry about the food and if it is Halal. Halal meat is meat that is killed by cutting the spinal cord which means that the animal dies a painless death. Please help me bring about a big change in the UK for all people no matter what their religion. Thanks in advance, no matter who you are!",
