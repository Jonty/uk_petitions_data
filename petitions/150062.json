        "action": "Force David Cameron to remain PM for full term, whilst UK negotiates Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "The country is at risk of developing divisions within society, whilst the markets are left unsure of the future. Our ongoing relationship with Europe, with whom we need to make favourable progress as we negotiate the terms of our exit, is impaired by delays. Whilst Cameron may feel he has let the UK down, he must face this music and follow through. He is best positioned, considering his established leadership status and relations with key members of the EU, to lead the UK through this great change. ",
        "background": "The U.K. needs stability at this time of change. Cameron has asked the people what to do and the voters have delivered their will. It is Cameron's responsibility to follow through and expedite that will as best he can without delay. The U.K. needs clarity and decisiveness, not a rudderless ship. ",
