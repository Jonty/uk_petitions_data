        "additional_details": "The public gave an answer to a very simple question. This answer should be respected and acted upon. We cannot allow our democracy to be diluted by those who do not agree with the decision. Allowing a repeat referendum will render the entire concept of what a referendum should be as pointless. We cannot keep voting until we arrive at a conclusion that a certain section of the public are happy with.",
        "background": "This wonderful country is based on democracy. If we arrive at an unambiguous, clear and obvious result after a referendum then the public, as well as MP's, should respect the result and any demand for an immediate, repeat referendum should be declined by those in Government at the first opportunity.",
