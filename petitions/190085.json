        "additional_details": "Im not saying ban it! But lets stick it in a separate section in the supermarket that is out of sight and not the first thing you see as you walk in!! Don't glamourise it in front of our kids but don't make it a forbidden fruit either!! Keep it out of the local all night stores and remove the ads that glamourise it from our tv, magazines and billboards! Lets have some balance, some honesty, some education please!! We all know where the alcohol is and if we want it, we know where we can buy it!!",
        "background": "Alcohol is promoted on tv in every ad break, its at the entrance of every supermarket and at the end of every aisle! In the summer the ads and supermarkets tell you its not summer without a beer, you can't enjoy a bbq or dinner party without wine, that wine makes you better company around friends!!",
