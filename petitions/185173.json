        "additional_details": "Furthermore, students would be benefited from this because their work would actually be at use by the time exams come around. Learning for year 8 would allow year 7 to be a year where you deciede what subjects you want to take at GCSE and with 4 years of learning this would allow students to possibly take on more GCSEs due to the increased learning time.",
        "background": "I believe studying a GCSE is incredibly hard from personal experience, I have found that learning and subject for less that 2 years at GCSE isn't very usefully as it's hard to lear alll the content I believe that from year 8 we should start doing GCSE work because it would alllow for more practice.",
