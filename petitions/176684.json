        "additional_details": "Our existing animal welfare legislation is rooted in times when animals were seen as possessions, chattels, or tools of a trade. The current maximum sentences available do nothing to deter the people who indulge in deliberate cruelty for \"fun\", or who take part in dog fighting or other illegal activities. The introduction of a minimum custodial sentence on conviction of say, three or four years, with no remission or parole, would act as more of a threat to these people and make them think twice.",
        "background": "The existing penalties for animal cruelty are far too lenient and do not act as a deterrent. The sentencing guidelines for offences under the Animal Health Act need reviewing to introduce much tougher sentences for deliberately & wilfully causing suffering and death to animals, eg minimum sentences ",
