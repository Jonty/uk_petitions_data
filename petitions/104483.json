        "additional_details": "British born citizens are not immigrants. The government is discriminating against it\u2019s own people many of which worked in the UK for years.\r\nThere is talk of increasing this limit to 6 months, maybe more which is fine, immigrants shouldn't be entering the country expecting to be supported by the benefits system, but UK passport holders should be exempt from this, we should look after our own people first. Some people have no choice, they have to come home, they need help not rejection.",
        "background": "British residents have to wait 6 weeks to claim Job Seekers Allowance and other benefits ?\r\nEU nationals entering the country have to wait 3 months, BUT If you have lived abroad and return to the UK you are classed as an immigrant in your own country and made to wait 3 months too.",
