        "additional_details": "Nigel Farage has stated on This Morning that the pledge to the NHS was a 'mistake', and Daniel Hannan MEP said on Newsnight that there won't be a reduction in immigration because we will still have 'free movement of labour'. Whatever your views on the EU, and however you voted, the Leave campaign has blatantly lied to the British public and therefore the referendum results should be declared void and we should hold another referendum.",
        "background": "The Leave campaign's claimed that they would spend \u00a3350 million per week on the NHS, and that they would drastically reduce immigration. Less than 24 hours after the result these 2 claims have been admitted to be false. We should repeat the referendum now we know the truth.",
