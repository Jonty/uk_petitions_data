Hence why this requests a debate for a vote of no confidence as this is one way to trigger the process.  \r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/122946\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06111\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The 52/48 result was too close and the whole campaign was built on misleading information and mistruths.  \r\n\r\nIf a vote of no confidence is lost, parliament has 14 days to create a new majority, if they fail then a general election is called.  We cannot request a general election directly.  ",
