The pieces of legislation governing abortion in Northern Ireland are sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and sections 25 and 26 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1945 \r\n\r\nAn offence under section 58 is punishable with imprisonment for life or for any shorter term.\r\nhttps://goo.gl/NOlwpP <Wiki>",
