        "action": "Hold public inquiry into whether BBC bias led to EU referendum result",
        "additional_details": "There was a concerted campaign by forces favouring Brexit to influence BBC coverage. Sites such as http://bbccomplaints.com/ and social media campaigns forced the BBC into a bias against rational argument and for perceived 'balance'. With an equal weight, and equal criticism, of both sides the voting public were left undecided. The BBC failed in it's mission to educate and inform and this caused the Brexit vote.",
        "background": "People trust the BBC and looked to them to inform on issues around the referendum. Pressure on the BBC by pro Brexit influences caused them to give equal weight to rational argument and hyperbole. The public could not discern and were undecided and voted emotionally. Did BBC bias cause Brexit?",
