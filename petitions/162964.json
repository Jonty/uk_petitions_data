        "additional_details": "This risks the selection of leaders at the polar ends of their respective parties because party members do not represent the middle ground occupied by most voters. The recent leadership tribulations of both main parties illustrate this only too well. \r\nLegislation should be introduced in support of representational democracy to make it compulsory for all parties with more than 49 sitting MPs to give their MPs the sole responsibility for electing their leader",
        "background": "Current Conservative and Labour Party rules leave the final choice of party leaders exclusively in the hands of party members. This is neither fair nor democratic. Party members do not represent the full spectrum of the electorate supporting their party at the polls, unlike elected MPs.\r\n\r\n   ",
