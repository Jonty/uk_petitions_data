        "additional_details": "Thousands of people a day sit in the traffic queues that start on the M67 and continue through Mottram-in-Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle. People have been campaigning for the Longdendale Bypass (also known as the A57/A628 Mottram-in-Longdendale, Hollingworth & Tintwistle Bypass) for almost 50 years. In 2014, the Conservative government approved funding and said phase 1 (Mottram Bypass and Glossop Spur) would go ahead. Since then, the government has refused to give a start date. ",
        "background": "After an 50 year wait, the government in 2014 [yet again] gave the go ahead for the A57/A628 Mottram-in-Longdendale, Hollingworth & Tintwistle Bypass to be built. Since then, locals and local politicians are unable to get a start date. We ask the government to name the day work will commence.",
