        "additional_details": "We want \r\n1. The driver vision standard to be linked to a repeatably measurable snellen acuity. \r\n2. Motor insurance to only be provided with evidence of an in date eye examination and purchase of vision correction where needed. \r\n3. The right for opticians and other professionals, on becoming aware of a person not meeting the vision standard, to advise the DVLA without fear of prosecution under patient confidentiality as it is in the public interest. \r\n4. Back up spectacles in the car ",
        "background": "Self referral to the DVLA for poor vision does not work and results in people with vision far below the legal standard remaining on our roads causing accidents and deaths. This is unacceptable and can easily be remedied.",
