        "additional_details": "Scotland voted to remain in the EU by an overwhelming majority. The vote to leave the EU was carried by voter sentiment in England and it is categorically unfair to force a politocal choice on Scots when just 3 short years ago, they voted to stay in the UK with the assurances that this exact scenario would not happen.",
        "background": "The Prime Minister has said she will not grant permission to the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum on independence for Scotland. We believe this contravenes a long held view that Scots should decide for themselves their political future & proves that Scotland is not an equal partner in the UK",
