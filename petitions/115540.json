        "additional_details": "Despite the UK being democratic, as citizens we have little right to 'out' a government that has lost our support. We can however register that we wish, as our representatives, for our local MPs to vote by a 2/3rds majority in favour of an early general election (in line with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011). Personal political views aside, if you are unhappy with the current government, sign this petition in the hope it will result in the chance to vote democratically for a new one.",
        "background": "I, as a citizen of the UK, have lost faith in my elected government\u2013for my own reasons, regardless of the view of others\u2013and wish to register my support for my MP to vote in favour of an early parliamentary general election. I support the early end of David Cameron's Conservative government.",
