        "action": "Give all UK households the choice of free nuisance call blocking.",
        "additional_details": "Companies such as BT should not be able to cash in on nuisance calls and I am petitioning to give UK households the choice to have call blocking capabilities installed for free. Every UK resident should be able to relax in the comfort of their own home without being hounded by these UK and oversees call centres. As phone companies seem unable to protect us from this they should offer the blocking ability for free.",
        "background": "Many households throughout the UK are plagued by nuisance callers, whether they be PPI claims, accident claims or telephone surveys. The majority are from oversees who do not abide to the TPS code of practice. Currently residents in the UK have to pay for call blocking capabilities. ",
