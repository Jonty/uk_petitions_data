        "additional_details": "Getting children off the streets and into the classroom during the summer period only serves to strengthen the future of Britain's youth. Please sign this petition to have the summer schools funding for disadvantaged pupils program reinstated. The Conservative party have already taken grants away from the poorer adults in society. Don't let them do something similar to our children. It's not fair. ",
        "background": "Summer schools funding was introduced as a coalition inititave to enable disadvantaged pupils to attend summer school at no cost. This helped lots of young people off the streets and into school over summer. Recently this was scrapped. This funding is necessary for the growth of British youth.  ",
