        "additional_details": "Both Theresa May and Sir Michael Fallon have stated that there is no need for a second Independence Referendum during the current parliament, which runs to 2020. \r\n\r\nIt must be the Scottish Parliament, as the elected representatives of the Scottish people, who make decisions on Scotland's future. \r\n\r\nThe Scottish Parliament must have the freedom to call a second Independence Referendum, and decide Scotland's future relationship with the EU, and the rest of the world.\r\n",
        "background": "The Scottish Government was elected on a promise to hold a second Independence Referendum should Scotland be taken out of the EU against the will of its people. As a result of the Brexit Vote, Westminster must not impede the Scottish Parliament if it votes to call a second Independence Referendum.",
