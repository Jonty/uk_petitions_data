I have witnessed cases of children not being listened to and having to email the teacher to be heard. Sign for your child's rights.",
        "background": "In schools, teachers have complete over-riding control over what children say. If they are falsely accused of doing something which they believe they have not done, or they do not believe they do not deserve a certain punishment, it is labelled as \"talking back.\" \r\n",
