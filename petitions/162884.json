        "additional_details": "Whilst the tiered licensing system has its merits, and rightfully deserves to stay, a rethink on the upgrading process for riders must be considered.\r\n\r\nIf the automatic upgrade that was in place before the 2013 update is not satisfactory, perhaps some type of competency test on a larger motorcycle could be implemented, to ensure the rider's skills are still satisfactory - an advanced version of the CBT for riders with existing qualifications who wish to advance through their licenses.",
        "background": "On 19th January 2013 the motorcycle licence restrictions changed for new motorcycle riders. \r\n\r\nThis meant that in order to upgrade from an A2 motorcycle license to an A motorcycle license requires the rider to pass the exact same test that they passed two years prior on an arbitrarily smaller bike.",
