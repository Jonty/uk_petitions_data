        "additional_details": "Who paid for Cameron's education? And how did they pay for it (given they were using offshore investment funds)?\r\nWho gave Cameron the money that has allowed him to buy his house which he now rents out, earning \u00a345k?\r\nCameron has openly spoken out for transparency YET now publicly is being shown that he has acted as opaquely as he possibly can.\r\n\r\nBritain deserves an honest leader who does not acts under such dire standards and hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nHelp Britain to remove Cameron as PM. \r\nResign David Cameron.",
        "background": "It took a leaked document before he said anything. \r\nIt took 5 different public announcements to get a (more) honest response about his tax benefits/offshore fund investments. \r\nHe lobbied against regulation of offshore funds.\r\nHe said those dodging tax were immoral. \r\nHe is immoral;\r\nResign.",
