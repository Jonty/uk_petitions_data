So I, Tope Owolabi along with Nik Thakkar and everyone who has had enough of these killings petition the UK government as one voice to start a dialogue in a public forum with President Obama to facilitate change on a global level. Please help us to help them.",
        "background": "Today I saw Alton Sterling & Philando Castile take their last breath on videos posted to social media. My heart is heavy and I cannot comprehend why there is a blatant systemic abuse of human rights and power by some of those who are supposed to protect and serve the very people they are killing.",
