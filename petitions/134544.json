        "additional_details": "We understand that the result of the referendum has been disastrous for the party, however we believe that Jeremy Corbyn is the man to take our party forward into the 2020 general election. Our increase of membership before and after Jeremy\u2019s leadership race is evident that he is fully connecting with young people all across the United Kingdom. We believe that party memberships may be effected if Jeremy is given a vote of no confidence and we hope that this petition is enough to show our support.",
