I have, along with many other people who post to facebook, seen people homeless and almost on deaths door from cold, hunger and without water or even a hot drink.  10/12/15 a woman posted she had seen paramedics called to a homeless man outside central station as he appeared to be dead.  The UK government must help out its own citizens as much as people from elsewhere.",
