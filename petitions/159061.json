        "additional_details": "Like many of the UK population I cannot see any reason to accept the current referendum vote as meaning we actually leave. This vote was influenced by many irrelevant factors which had no relation to what the public were meant to be voting about and based on lies. And now obvious personal political manoeuvring has been involved in this process as well which it should not have been. The media has also been more interested in sensation than facts.\r\nhttp://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201516/ldselect/ldeucom/138/138.pdf",
        "background": "There is no legal requirement for us to leave, the protest vote about various issues should be noted. Parliament should vote to remain in the EU as the best future for the UK. The majority of the vote out issues can be resolved by working within the EU where we have a vote. Outside we have none.",
