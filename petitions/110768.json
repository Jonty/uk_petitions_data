        "action": "Demand changes to prevent indicators being masked & obscured by vehicle lights.",
        "additional_details": "There is widespread concern that modern vehicle design permits and encourages light clusters that embed flashing indicators within other steady light units. This frequently produces indicators that are masked & obscured by other lights, such as running or headlights at the front and/or brake lights at the rear. This design flaw is common to commercial and passenger vehicles. We call for a change to the vehicle approval regulations that allow this to happen.",
        "background": "Modern vehicles are being fitted with integrated light clusters, where design and production factors seem to outweigh the safety purposes of the lights. Almost invariably, modern vehicles \"hide\" flashing indicators within the design, with the result that front/rear lights make indicators invisible.",
