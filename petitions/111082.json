        "additional_details": "www.savesnibston.com - Snibston is one of many popular heritage museums which preserves the nations coal mining past and due to lack of funding closed\r\n\r\nOther museums include the National Railway Museum were at risk, until large donors came forward to save them\r\n\r\nI think the Government should act in proxy as donor for 1 financial year, re-investing any generated profit in the local community to aid regional development and thus improve the UK economy, whilst granting the right of all to learn",
        "background": "Many museums in the UK are not funded through large grants and thus become threatened when any grants are cut. As all museums preserve something, the government should step in and provide financial assistance for 1 financial year to allow new owners to come forward to help preserve our nations past",
