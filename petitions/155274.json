        "additional_details": "Article 50 says; \u201cAny member state may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.\u201d\r\nA fundamental UK constitutional requirement is that withdrawal from the EU requires the approval of parliament & an Act of Parliament. Triggering the UK\u2019s exit from the EU without parliamentary approval would be legally ineffective under domestic law, would fail to comply with the requirements of Article 50 & would not be effective in European Law.",
        "background": "Through our membership of the EU, British citizens have a host of conferred legal rights, including statutory rights. The UK Government cannot use common law to remove or nullify these rights without parliamentary approval; its prerogative power cannot be used to overturn statutory rights.",
