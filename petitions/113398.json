        "additional_details": "Tickets for Carl Frampton vs Scott Quigg sold out in less than 10 minutes but 10 minutes after that were for sale on reselling sites at 4-5 times face value. This is just a recent example. We ask that touts are prevented from selling at more than face value or a cap be placed on the mark up that is allowed so that it is not worth their while denying genuine fans the opportunity to attend events.",
        "background": "Section 166 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 and section 53 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 has all but ruled out ticket touting in football. We ask the government to extend the same protection to all sports and performance events to prevent touts profiting from genuine fans.\r\n",
