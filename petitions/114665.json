        "additional_details": "The motives of recent military actions, in particular Iraq, have been spurious to say the least. Military actions like this create and feed extremism, thus placing the security of UK citizens at further risk from terrorism.",
        "background": "The constant state of war supported by the UK government is an obstacle to peace. Military action is too often contrary to public opinion.  We therefore submit that a bill be passed through Parliament to ensure that all wars or military action can only be decided by the outcome of a public vote.",
