        "additional_details": "Recently a high court ruling of a case in Ireland was won by a widower. They had been a couple for 10 years and had recently become engaged. Tragically her fianc\u00e9 died at 43 years old. She was then told by the pension company that she wouldn't be eligible to claim his pension due to not being married. She then had to fight and with the support of a crowd funding page\r\nsuccessfully won her case. ",
        "background": "More and more people choose to live together without feeling the need to marry. However we still have certain pension company's that still refuse to recognise that you exist as a loving and committed couple if you don't marry. This needs to change. Please sign and show your support. ",
