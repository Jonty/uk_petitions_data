        "additional_details": "Problems:\r\n- Memory based.\r\n- Favours those who prefer exams conditions.\r\n- It keeps competent young drivers off the roads.\r\n- It drains the money of millions of young people\r\n- It wasn't deemed important years ago so why is it important now? ",
        "background": "The driving theory test that is required in the UK is a complete nonsense. It wasn't deemed necessary in former years and it shouldn't be relevant now. Why should a memory test dictate whether you are suitable to drive? It is simply a money making scheme, which is highly unfair on young people.",
