        "action": "Review CAA regulations for return to flight of ex military aircraft.",
        "additional_details": "British aviation was once the envy of the entire world leading the way in technology and ingenuity, aircraft like the Vulcan, Nimrod, Lightning, Buccaneer,Jaguar, Concorde and Harrier, all now having served so valiantly sadly now nothing but taxi or museum pieces or in the Vulcans case soon to be so. Safety has to be paramount but regulations make it virtually impossible and these incredible machines are in many cases rotting away and dissapearing from our hearts and minds.",
        "background": "The return to flight of Avro Vulcan XH558 in 2007 should have heralded a new era for similar projects to honour and remember times when British aircraft were the envy of the entire world, instead XH558 remains the only major success story due to the stringent rules and regulations in place.",
