        "additional_details": "The Scottish Parliament reduced the voting age from 18 to 16 which meant that a whole generation was allowed a say in the independence referendum held on 18/09/2014. The turnout was a massive 84.6% - truly representative.\r\nVoting at 16 is already law in the British Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Young people there are trusted to vote in elections on those islands; why the difference in England, Wales and Northern Ireland?",
        "background": "We've been talking about lowering the voting age since 1999. It's now 2016 and we still haven't got any further. 16 year olds are deemed mature enough to take the momentous decision to have sex, they can pay tax or serve their country as soldiers; they must be given the vote. It's only right.",
