        "additional_details": "I want to call for action against Nigel Farage as well as the other leaders of the leave campaign, who used this piece of information to entice the electorate to vote to leave the EU. This is because the public were ill-informed and I believe that provided that this was the main incentive for voting to leave, in my view the results of the referendum is a consequence of this. Thereby, I believe there should be repercussions for this given that the public voted under false pretences. ",
        "background": "I believe the main argument the leave campaign had in order to support their cause is the fact that the \u00a335 million that the UK gives to EU everyday will, instead, be invested in the NHS. This was a valid argument until Nigel Farage admitted that he cannot be sure that this will happen. ",
