The Act doesn't extend this protection to referendum campaigns. \r\n\r\nI believe the British people have the right to make informed decisions and that making statements such as \"We send \u00a3350 million a week to the EU and will spend it on the NHS,\" which is now described as a \"mistake\", is toxic to our democracy and shouldn't be allowed.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that the making of untrue and misleading statements severely influenced the recent EU referendum result. We call on the Government to extend the Representation of the People Act to make this a crime, as it already is in an election campaign.",
