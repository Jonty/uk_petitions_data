        "additional_details": "If you run out GP is closed and a pharmacist wont sell you one, you have two options, go to a walk in centre where they can treat you if you are having an attack, but not supply you with meds. Or you can go to hospital, where you will be warded, nebulised, be given a full examination and chest x ray and then be prescribed an inhaler. Making asthma medication available will save money for the NHS and let people breathe when they need to. Chemists will sell you Viagra but not an inhaler!",
        "background": "Being Asthmatic, its hard to judge when your medication will run out as some days you need more medication than others. If you run out you have to wait 48 hours form your GP to get a new prescription or please with a pharmacist to loan you one or sell you one. Asthmatics need direct access to meds.",
