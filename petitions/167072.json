        "additional_details": "At present we have no balance, both houses are full of highly educated individuals most from privileged backgrounds.To restore balance we need a house to represent the not so fortunate of the UK i.e low paid workers, people who live in poorer areas,  people without an education, people without the chance to change their lives. I propose we dissolve the House of Lords and replace it with a cross section of society who are selected in much the same way we already make selections for Jury service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We are in a situation where the house of commons appears to not represent the working class people of Great Britain. It is seen by most working class people to be an extension of the House of Lords. We need a balance of wealthy people and poor people to correctly govern the UK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
