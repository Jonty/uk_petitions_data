        "additional_details": "Great Britain is a wonderful country which is strong enough to stand alone and given the right attitude of the people it can and will. \r\n\r\nThe bitterness and vitriol from some over the referendum result is childish petulism. \r\n\r\nThe time for argument has passed the time the people have spoken and the majority of a record voting turnout wanted to leave the EU. The time now is for moving forward as a country. Please sign this petition to show acceptance of the referendum result. ",
        "background": "The \"losing\" side of the EU referendum have well and truly thrown some toys out of the pram. \r\nI urge the government & the people to accept the result and move our country forward in a dignified, strong, inclusive and ambitious manner & deliver a Britain that is a beacon to the world on all fronts.",
