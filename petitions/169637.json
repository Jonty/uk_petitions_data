        "additional_details": "A focus on memorization leads to a bias towards students who have a good memory, but not necessarily a good understanding. The amount of information needed to memorise has recently been increased by Ofqual.\r\n\r\nCoursework has recently been removed completely from all non-practical subjects. This increases stress drastically to the point where it may have physical effects. Many students also struggle to perform under stressful conditions which means they do not get results that reflect their ability. ",
        "background": "What needs to be done: \r\n-\tThe amount of memorization needed to do well in the subject needs to be reduced.\r\n-\tCourses should focus more on coursework due to the stress of exams.\r\n-\tThe core subjects need to be changed in order to benefit the child outside of qualification.\r\n",
