        "additional_details": "Every day in the UK innocent dogs are put to sleep, not because they have shown aggression, but because of the way they look. Gentle family pets are taken by police or dog wardens because they look like a pit bull type dog. \r\nThere is no breed standard for a pit bull so their fate is decided by measurements and appearance. The dog can be held for many months, sometimes years awaiting an assessment. This causes owners great upset and causes the dog untold stress. \r\nThis is a huge and unnecessary drain on valuable resources (up to 20 police officers can be sent to seize one dog), also tax payers money.\r\nThe lengthy and costly process needs to be abolished by getting rid of the Breed Specific legislation clause in the Dangerous Dogs act 1991, and replace with a deed not breed philosophy.\r\n",
        "background": "Breed Specific Legislation was introduced in 1991, it has been wholly unsuccessful in reducing the number of dog bites, or attacks in the UK. The new alterations in the Dangerous Dogs Act October 2014, covers all eventualities. There is no longer a need to discriminate against certain breeds.",
