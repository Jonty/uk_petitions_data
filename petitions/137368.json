        "additional_details": "The in-out EU referendum is a case in point. Fewer than half the voting public voted for change but change will happen because insufficient people voted for the status quo.\r\n\r\nNon-voters who weren't really concerned, or who didn't vote because they thought the status quo would win, should have their 'vote' counted.\r\n\r\nTo make a significant change (eg leaving the EU) more than half of the voting public should vote for it, ie not half of the voters.",
        "background": "People who vote do so to express their choice.  By not voting, people are saying they are not really concerned either way.  If they held a strong conviction they would have voted.  Change should not be imposed without taking these non-voters into account.",
