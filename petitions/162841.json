        "action": "The government should raise the funding for music education in primary schools.",
        "additional_details": "To make a film better, we add music. To improve a dining experience, we add music. To make shopping experiences better, we add music. To make schools better, we take away music. This is wrong and should be undone. The government cut funding for a vital part of education for primary school children. These children now no longer learn anything in school about music: something every child should understand, at least on a simple level. The funding should be increased.",
        "background": "This government has cut funding for musical education in primary schools. The funding should be increased back to what it was in 2010 before the conservatives came to government. Despite Nicky Morgan's claims, music is a necessary part of education, and should be something no child should lack.",
