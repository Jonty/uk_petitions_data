        "action": "Refunding toll charges in the event of long traffic delays",
        "additional_details": "Accidents, incidents, maintenance works, weather conditions etc. - lost working time, disruption to family life, and increased stress levels.\r\n\r\nToll charges contribute towards improving the quality of driving and reduce delays. When this fails it would be fair that the operators refund the toll charges during the event of traffic delays.\r\n\r\nRail commuters are entitled for a refund on their season tickets. Similar performance indicator must be operated to toll roads.\r\n",
        "background": "The purpose of this petition is to request a provision for refund and / or compensation to the drivers on the toll charges who loose time and money due to long traffic delays whilst crossing the toll operated roads, bridges or tunnels on regular basis. Journey's take 5 times longer in long delays.",
