        "additional_details": "Rabbits, dogs & other animals are often forced to inhale toxic substances, have chemicals injected into them and chemicals rubbed into open wounds. \r\n\r\nIn 2013 it became illegal in the EU to test on animals but with the growth of China (who insist that products are tested on animals) big brands are still testing their products on animals. Some brands claim to be cruelty  free but are owned by companies that do test on animals for other brands they sell - which is misleading consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "My name is Nicola Franks. I wear make up and I recently became aware of the shocking practices taking place involving companies using and abusing animals to test their make up and cleaning products. \r\n\r\nMany best selling brands use animals for testing but they don't make it clear to their customers.",
