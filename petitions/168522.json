        "additional_details": "This ban should also cover imported meat where antibiotics have been used. In many countries throughout the world animals use more antibiotics than humans. \r\n\r\nThe use of antibiotics in farming represents a critical threat to public health. If antibiotics stop working, which is a distinct possibility, the outcome could be apocalyptic for humanity. We would go back to the days where a small cut or infection could be fatal.\r\n\r\nNo new antibiotics have been discovered since 1987.",

There must be a total ban on \"preventative antibiotic use\" where animals are given the drugs to prevent infection or speed up their growth.",
