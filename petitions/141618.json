        "additional_details": "Technology has now reached a sufficient level where the security, integrity and validity of an online voting system can be ensured. There are no technological reasons why a vote cannot be cast online. This petition does not aim to replace postal and physical voting, it aims to add a vital and missing piece of the process. ",
        "background": "The vast majority of UK citizens now shop, bank and interact online. The voting system should be expanded to allow people to cast their vote online. This would encourage a higher voter turn out, encourage younger generations to interact with politics and fundamentally improve our democracy. ",
