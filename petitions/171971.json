        "additional_details": "There's no better time to bring the show back to the world.  Everything's gone mad, and the only way to make sense of the new world order, post-Brexit, post-Trump, post-Intelligence is to take the mick out of everyone with equal fervour.\r\n\r\nSpitting Image helped us understand our world, but pointing out how ridiculous it all was.\r\n\r\nWe need an anchor in the storm.\r\nWe need safe harbour.\r\nWe need guidance.\r\n\r\nWe need Spitting Image.",
        "background": "In the current age, frankly, the world has gone crazy.  It's no longer possible to determine farce from fact or satire from reality.  We need a new baseline.  We need a champion for social change.\r\n\r\nSpitting Image dealt with everyone equally, everyone knew where they stood.  We need it back.  Now.",
