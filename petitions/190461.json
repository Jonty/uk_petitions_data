        "action": "In the next Scottish independence referendum Scots ex-pats must be given a vote.",
        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister determines whether or not a second referendum will take place. In the event that she decides that it should, we petition her to make it a condition of the referendum that ex-patriot Scots who were born in Scotland should be allowed a vote.",
        "background": "Many people that were born in Scotland now live abroad but still have a heavily vested interest in the future of Scotland. They may own property, run businesses and employ people here. Many will intend to return to Scotland. To deny them a vote in Scotland's future would be unfair and undemocratic.",
