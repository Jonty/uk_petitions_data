        "additional_details": "This is to 'prove' that the CGCS registered engineers 'Go above and beyond the required health and safety requirements'... Essentially, they are trying to say that anyone not on the scheme is doing the bare minimum and the people willing to spend who knows how much on membership are 'safer' and 'more reliable' This is a multi million \u00a3 money making scheme that for now is 'voluntary' but watch for the media to get hold of it then everyone will want a CGCS registered engineer!! Total scam!! ",
        "background": "\r\nAs a Gas Safe registered Engineer that worked hard to attain my qualifications, i think its absolutely obsurd that Capita are going to undermine all of our qualifications with this new 'voluntary' Scheme. They run Gas Safe already so this is a monumental, MULTI- MILLION \u00a3 MONEY MAKING SCHEME!!",
