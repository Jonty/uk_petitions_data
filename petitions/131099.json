        "additional_details": "Although David Cameron pledged to \u2019protect\u2019 the NHS budget, over this decade spending will only increase by 1.2% a year. That is way down on the average 3.7% that health spending grew each year between 1949 and 1979 and the 6.7% extra that Gordon Brown added annually.\r\n\r\nAn NHS deficit of \u00a330 billion is predicted by 2020. \r\n\r\nAs Nye Bevan said: 'The NHS will last as long as there are folk left with faith to fight for it.'\r\n\r\nSigning this petition is proof that you are prepared to fight.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Of all the major European countries, we spend the lowest percentage of GDP on our health system. Research shows that the majority of people living in the UK would willingly support paying an extra penny in the pound if it meant a safer, stronger NHS.\r\n\r\n.",
