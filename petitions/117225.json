        "action": "A full public debate to question if Islam is compatible with western democracy.",
        "additional_details": "Sharia (Islamic Law) is already practiced in the UK and surveys have shown up to 40% of Muslims believe  it should be a parallel legal system. Sharia also condones polygamy, underage marriage, the murder of apostates, punishments by beheading and amputation as well as the subjugation of women to a second class status - None of which is compatible with western democracy.",
        "background": "Unlike other religions Islam is also a political, social, and personal belief that governs strictly all aspects of a persons life. Islam also teaches that the no law is higher than its own which is in direct conflict with civil law and the ideals of western democracy.",
