For those that are suffering they will be able to know where they can get help, and they will learn skills on how to cope. Mental health issues are seriously ignored and this needs to stop. By getting young people to be aware of these we can end the stigma and help people that are in need. ",

Some people are embarrassed to say anything, some people can't understand how they are feeling. If mental health education was brought in people would know what they were experiencing. ",
