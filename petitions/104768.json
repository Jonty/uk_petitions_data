        "action": "Increase the bereavement award following a fatal accident.",
        "additional_details": "The law tells us how much relative(s) can receive following the death of a family member in a e.g. road accident or accident at work.  The compensation was for the \"bereavement\" and public recognition that the death was wrongful.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the award is considered on a case by case basis. In one recent claim for a loss of a child, the parents were awarded \u00a3100,000. In England & Wales they would have received \u00a312,980. \r\n\r\nSupport us to change the law to make it fairer to grieving relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The loss of a loved one, a WIFE, HUSBAND or CHILD according to the law is worth a pitiful \u00a312,980, whilst celebrities can be compensated over \u00a3200,000 for hurt feelings/breach of privacy. We appreciate no amount of money can compensate for the loss, but the level of the award should be increased.",
