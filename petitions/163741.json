        "additional_details": "A museum dedicated to the artistic and creative contributions of the late David Bowie would be a fitting tribute to an outstanding poet, artist, lyricist, musician, singer, actor, mime artist. His unique artistic process should be available to the public so he can continue to inspire generations to come. He was one of the most fascinating, talented individuals of this century, and beyond. The V&A Exhibition, Bowie Is, is evidence of the level of interest in this great British icon.\r\n",
