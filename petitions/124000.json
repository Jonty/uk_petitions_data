        "additional_details": "New MoD figures show the three services are short of nearly 6,400 trained personnel, more than 4,000 of them soldiers.\r\nYear 13/14 The Army rejected 336 applications because of offensive or inappropriately placed tattoos, as well as piercings.\r\nElizabeth Lee from Capita said: 'Tattoos have become increasingly acceptable and common in society, including among potential recruits considering a career in the Army. 'Greater flexibility over tattoos on the neck or hands will remove a barrier for a number of people currently interested in applying for a job in the Army, without compromising its image as a professional force.'",
        "background": "The British Army on 1 August 2014 brought in a revised Tattoo policy which allows for body art to be displayed on hands and rear of the neck.  The Army and Capita, who assisted with the revised policy, agree that tattoos do not inhibit operational functionality or compromise the Army's image.",
