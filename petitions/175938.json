        "additional_details": "By allowing citizens to either 'opt in' or 'opt out' through their annual tax return, HMRC will still be able to collect the tax from those who wish to pay it while allowing others to pay their contribution to their preferred, domestic, budgets. Overall, the actual percentage size of the budget will reflect the proportion of citizens willing to pay for overseas aid.  ",
        "background": "The international aid budget is out of control and management of it is not fit for purpose since much of it is wasted through ill advised means of spending or just plain poor management by, amongst others, unelected staff with their own agenda. Many UK citizens believe 'charity begins at home'.  ",
