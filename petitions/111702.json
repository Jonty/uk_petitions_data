        "action": "Remove TV license charges for individual students living in halls of residence",
        "additional_details": "Students are having it increasingly bad in the UK with the tuition fees, cuts to maintenance grants and increasing living costs. So as to charge students for a TV license individually is preposterous and an unnecessary expense on the average students already tight budget. Such solutions are:\r\n(a)- spread the charges across an individual flat or the block of accommodation, or\r\n(b)- remove TV licenses completely because they are archaic, and instead run advertisements on BBC programmes. ",
        "background": "This petition aims to remove individual TV license charges for university students living in halls of residence. An alternative would be to charge each individual flat or block a single charge which would be incorporated into the price of the annual accommodation. ",
