        "additional_details": "Numerous people who voted to leave now regret this decision due to either misinformation or misunderstanding of the consequences of the UK leaving the EU prior to the referendum or due to new information coming to light on a daily basis of the severe consequences of leaving.  \r\n\r\nLeaving the EU would therefore now be contrary to the will of the British people or their best interests, and certainly that of people in British territories other than England and Wales.  Parliament should recognise this",
        "background": "In the best interests of the UK, its national security, economy, welfare and existence, and the security and economy of Europe and the rest of the world, this petition calls on Parliament to vote, as soon as possible, to reject the EU referendum result and for the UK to remain part of the EU.
