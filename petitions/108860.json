        "additional_details": "An online Hazard Perception test facility will enable more  learner drivers to attend the theory questions in  test centres and facilitate a quicker progress for those on the waiting list. \r\nLearner drivers could first attend the Hazard Test online, and then book the other portion online using either a certificate number/pass code, allowing fewer chances of failure and more candidates at the test centres too.",
        "background": "Recent study shows that up to 50% of learner driving pass the theory test. The said test is divided in to two parts, the questions and answers and hazard perception test. In order to pass the test, learner drivers must be successful with both. The hazard perception test could be done online. ",
