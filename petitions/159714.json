        "action": "Southern Rail MUST improve service or compensate passengers",
        "additional_details": "1. Trains are regularly late, cancelled and overcrowded causing unnecessary stress and delay to passengers.\r\n\r\n2. Prices increase every year and service declines. Delay Repay is not enough.\r\n\r\n3. Delays and cancellations are not communicated in a timely or effective manner. Platforms displayed at the last minute cause a stampede for trains, creating a health and safety risk.\r\n\r\n4. Consistent overcrowding leads to cramped and unbearable conditions, leaving passengers degraded, frustrated and stressed.",
        "background": "Southern Rail must be held accountable for its rising fares and diminishing service, which causes misery to thousands of passengers. Further cuts to the timetable means reduced service for the same amount of passengers who have already paid their season tickets and have no other way to get to work.",
