        "action": "Guarantee Permanent Residence for EU nationals currently resident in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "My son's primary school friends, whose parents came to the UK in good faith and all work hard and pay taxes, are worried they may have to leave in two years if the exit deal goes badly for them. No one should see their own and their children's future bargained away in a trade negotiation. This uncertainty is damaging and wrong, and easily resolved by a legal guarantee that any EU citizen resident in the UK today will be offered the option of Permanent Residence in any exit settlement.",
        "background": "Both sides of the referendum debate agree that no one lawfully resident in the UK today should be forcibly expelled, but this is not guaranteed in law. Whatever happens to future arrivals, this uncertainty is unfair on our neighbours and friends and risks a damaging exodus during exit negotiations.",
