        "additional_details": "There are roughly 2 schools for every care home in the UK, and the government predicts that we need to double the number of elderly care facilities over the next 20 years.\r\nThere already exists major concern, and huge gaps in the system. Workers in this field could certainly benefit from the involvement and support of the larger community.\r\nIt is well researched how beneficial generational integration is to elderly folk and youngsters alike. I feel it a wasted opportunity to not connect the two. ",
        "background": "The most beneficial thing we can do as a society is to find positive & mutually beneficial ways to integrate different groups. \r\nWe should link schools with care homes etc, & have the children/young adults spend occasional classes helping at the facility, to develop relationships across generations.",
