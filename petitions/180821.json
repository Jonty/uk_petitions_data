        "additional_details": "An assured shorthold tenancy is a type of assured tenancy with limited security of tenure. The landlord can regain possession of an assured shorthold tenancy without giving any specific reason if s/he follows the correct procedure.\r\n\r\nThe most common reason for somebody becoming homeless is the end of an assured shorthold tenancy.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure stability and reduce homelessness the government should make amendments to legislation to scrap Assured Shorthold Tenancies.\r\n",
        "background": "Possession for this tenancy type can be obtained after service of a Notice under s21 of the Housing Act 1988. By scrapping Assured Shorthold Tenancies & reverting to Assured Tenancies as the default tenancy type, Landlords would require a legal reason to end tenancies giving tenants stronger rights.",
