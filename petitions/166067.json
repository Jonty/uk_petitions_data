        "additional_details": "We all pay thousands of pounds a year to travel into London or elsewhere via Southeastern railway and each year it gets more expensive and the service gets worse and worse with signalling problems, delayed trains, cancelled trains etc. \r\nIt needs to stop so that everyone pays a FAIR amount for the poor service we are getting. I'm sure most would agree that we would be happy to pay the amount we are paying if the trains ran on time and without delays and if we all got a seat on our long commutes. ",
        "background": "Southeaster railway continues to increase annual season ticket fares each year but never improve upon the service they offer. It was voted one of the worst ways to commute to London in 2016. \r\nTrain fares have been reported to increase twice as fast as salaries in the past 5 years. ",
