        "additional_details": "Currently schools only issue letters advising parents about head lice. Bringing back the school nit nurse would lower outbreaks. It is unfair on parents who spend every night checking & de licing there children's hair just to send them back in school for them to catch them again and usually from the same child whose parents don't bother. This is a massive issue in schools and I believe if parents face being issued a fine for failing to treat there children's head lice the cases would be lowered",
        "background": "Head lice is a massive problem in schools and for parents. Despite schools issuing letters when a headlice case is highlighted parents are still failing to ensure they delice there children's hair. ",
