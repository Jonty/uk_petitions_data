        "additional_details": "The RSPCA reported in 2015 that dogs, cats, horses and even exotic fish are being stolen.People's homes are being broken into to steal expensive pets.Some are taken when left tied up outside alone, even walks in the park and being let out in the garden isn't safe anymore. If a dog is let off its lead, it may be taken in the back of a van and never seen again. Give vets the right to scan animals when they go to the vets for routine appointments and reduce pet thefts in the UK. ",
        "background": "I would like to help to prevent animals from being stolen.Many animals in the UK are stolen and are never reunited with their rightful owner.There are thousands of family pets stolen every year, many owners never know the fate of their beloved pet.Many of these pets are pedigrees and are sold on.
