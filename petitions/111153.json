        "action": "David Cameron should encourage Brussels to exclude the UK from the vaping TPD.",
        "additional_details": "A report published by Public Health England (PHE) recently, an agency sponsored by the UK's Department for Health, has concluded that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional smokes. In addition, it's recognised their potential to help people quit.\r\n\r\nDavid Cameron should get the UK excluded in the current renegotiations of UK`s membership. Let`s keep vaping progressing and saving more and more lives. Over regulation and greatly increased costs will kill vaping.\r\n",
        "background": "There are over 2.5 million vapers in the UK. Many of them will return to smoking as a result of the TPD costing the NHS a lot of resources and money. \r\nThe TPD is a voteloser if it doesn`t go away without our Government making a fight to have the UK excluded.\r\nMAKE IT A RENEGOTIATION CONDITION.\r\n\r\n",
