        "additional_details": "It is the 21st Century and we still consider Sunday as a day of rest. Well, why? I work Monday to Friday and sometimes I am too tired to shop mid week. On my day off I have to rush after working all week. If people do not agree with Sunday business trading for religion purposes then they can stay in. You should get with the times and give people and businesses freedom to trade as normal. If we want to shop on a Sunday and businesses want a full day trading then let them. ",
        "background": "Years I have thought this and so many others have. Why should you restrict us and tell the public and businesses what day is special and not let us shop at our own free will when we have worked all week and see the weekend as 'playtime'?   ",
