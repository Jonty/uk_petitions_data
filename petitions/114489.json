That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to backbench or Opposition Members.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of an MP is a decision for that individual, not for the House of Commons as a whole."
