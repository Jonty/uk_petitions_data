        "action": "To not consider holding a second referendum on staying in the EU",
        "additional_details": "The turn out was over 70%, much more than most elections and everyone in the UK had more than fair warning for the opportunity, the majority of those that voted, voted to leave and it was only a choice of 2 options and not complicated. If a second referendum was held, it would be a mockery to the democratic system and divide the country much more than it is now.",
        "background": "We the undersigned ask the UK Government not to consider holding a second referendum on membership of the EU. We feel that a fair and honest referendum has been held and the population has made it's decision which we must abide by and unite behind that result.",
