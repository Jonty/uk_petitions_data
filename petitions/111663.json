        "additional_details": "There are many, many women out there that have an incompetent cervix, yet the NHS and many doctors believe these length checks shouldn't be done unless the woman has previously suffered a second term loss. \r\nThis I feel is wrong, why should the woman lose her baby before something can be done the next time they are pregnant?  if someone is checked and their cervix is shorter, at least then they can be monitored accordingly, this can prevent many losses and many preterm births if detected early.",
        "background": "Cervical length screening checks are not routinely done during pregnancy scans unless there is a special specific reason for this to be done- ie. a previous second trimester loss- which was most likely lost due to the incompetent cervix. \r\n",
