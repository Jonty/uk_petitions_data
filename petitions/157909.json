I have an appointment now to have a full hysterectomy (my choice as I want no risk of anything returning). As the cyst is classed as suspicious. \r\nI believe if you arrange for ultra sounds to be done at the same appointment as women having smear tests. We can reduce the risk of other women living with these possibly life threatening undetected growths.",

It turns out I have a 17cm cyst on my ovary ",
