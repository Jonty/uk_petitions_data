        "additional_details": "Not only would an updated voting system be a step in the right direction but also it wood make our country look better and more fair. People may also be able to trust an electronic voting system more than the current paper-based one.",
        "background": "By moving forward from the outdated paper-based voting system you will squash a lot of the rumours of a rigged election as many people do not trust the governing body. I know many people who do not vote because they believe that their votes are essentially changed due to having to use a pencil.",
