        "additional_details": "Health education should be a core principle within the curriculum. Starting from KS1, children should learn the importance of food and how to cook simple receipes. Throughout the stages, students should learn how to cook a variety of healthy dishes, the importance of macro and micro nutrients, physiological and psychological impacts, body measurements, dietetics, metabolism etc. This should come within education. Many families/homes are now uneducated in this and heavily rely on processed foods.",

It should be a priority within the N.C in light of increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, cancer and other conditions. A large percentage of the population are uneducated on nutrition. ",
