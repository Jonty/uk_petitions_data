        "additional_details": "Nobody can say that we can't take these people in because, if we were in the same situation, we would expect to be given shelter and food at the very least. We cannot turn our backs on these people, our government helped to create the very nightmare they are in right now. They don't want our jobs or benefits..they just want a safe life!",
        "background": "British people don't want to see fellow human beings being treated with such contempt. Images of people, esp children being washed ashore is horrific and enough is enough. It isn't about migration, this is a war effort and we are duty bound to help because our Govt helped to make this situation.",
