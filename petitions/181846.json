        "action": "All carriers of passengers to the UK should obtain proof of health insurance",
        "additional_details": "with one person alone costing a half million pounds to the NHS when it must have been obvious that she was in late stage pregnancy yet still allowed to fly makes the carrier complicit.  There are already sanctions in place to prevent the carrying of illegal immigrants and can be extended to cover the matter of insurance.  There would be no possibility of discrimination as many countries require certification of innoculations and means of self support.",
        "background": "Recent revelations have shewn that fraud on the NHS by 'Health tourists' has grown to astronomical scale.  Carriers of passengers into Britain should be held responsible to ensure that adequate Health Insurance is carried by passengers.  Failure to do so should make the carrier responsible for cost.",
