        "additional_details": "A number of political commentators have been waxing lyrically since Friday looking for excuses to try and undermine the legitimate and democratic vote that resulted in the UK taking the majority decision to leave the political entity known as the European Union. \r\nA petition calling for Government to ignore the results and even to implement additional measures, thereby moving the goalposts, is undemocratic and should be rejected outright.\r\nWe voted Leave so let's get on with it!",
        "background": "The EU In/Out referendum was clear in stating that a simple majority of the votes cast would be honoured. A healthy 72% turnout is a good democratic proportion of the electorate and the majority by 1,269,501 of eligible votes gave the Government the mandate and authority to act decisively.",
