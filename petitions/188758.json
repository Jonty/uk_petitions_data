Mrs \"X\" was also intimidated on the day of the case verbally with the suggestion from the Respondent's Barrister to drop the case to avoid costs. The low payouts inevitably mean that the Claimant will be poorly represented. This kind of behaviour is not inline with the concept of accessible justice for employees in ET cases.",
