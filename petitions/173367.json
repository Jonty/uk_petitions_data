        "action": "Preserve the UK bat population by banning wind farms",
        "additional_details": "At 29 of the 46 UK wind farms examined 194 were killed monthly- a likely gross underestimate. Carried over to the 6,954 onshore turbines the carnage is tens of thousands.\r\nDr Lintott suggests turning off turbines during high risk periods. \r\nOn October 2016 227 megawatts (just 0.6% of the 36,759 mW being used) was from turbines, 70%from coal; 21% nuclear; 8% from abroad.\r\nWe need forms of reliable renewable energy to deliver electricity at competitive prices that do not devastate the bat population.",
        "background": "All species of UK bats are protected by the law. Wind farms are killing thousands of them each year.Bats have been around for 30 million years able to fly without the risk of colliding with spinning objects. They deactivate their sonar when near turbines and are attracted to the bugs drawn to them.",
