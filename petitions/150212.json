        "additional_details": "The significantly differing EU referendum results in Scotland and Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK, means that the break-up of the United Kingdom is now a likely result of leaving the EU and was unforeseen by many voters. The people should now be given the chance to vote on EU exit plans by each political party, or indeed NOT to invoke Article 50 to save the United Kingdom itself should this be an overriding factor for them (if that be an option in any General Election party manifesto.)",
        "background": "The EU referendum result was only advisory, and so we hereby call for a vote in Parliament to delay invoking Article 50 until AFTER the next UK General Election. Parties should now be given the chance to put forward their exit plans OR ALTERNATIVES TO EXIT in their next General Election manifestos.",
