        "action": "Parliamentary inquiry into deceitful claims to sway an election or referendum",
        "additional_details": "There is a growing tendency for candidates to field statements that they know to be wrong merely to gain a vote for their party or themselves.

        "background": "The Brexit campaign dishonestly pledged \u00a3350 million per week for the NHS in full knowledge that this was was an impossibility.  This is just one example of a growing trend in British politics. \r\n\r\n",
