        "action": "Abolish the Early Years Teacher Status",
        "additional_details": "Whilst the EYTS qualifies a practitioner as an Early Years teacher, it does not align itself to QTS and the pay of a teacher with QTS. Therefore, many holders of EYTS are paid substianirslly less than teachers and their are very limited opportunities. Many schools will opt for a holder of QTS than EYTS. In addition, due to, a lack of clarity many nurseries are unsure of the role, the qualification and the rate of pay meaning some Early Years Teschers are paid minimum wage. ",
        "background": "The Early Years Teacher Status was introduced in an attempt to provide children in the Early Years with specialist practitioners. These specialists would be responsible for providing high-quality early education, something many lower qualified practitioners already do on a daily basis.",
