        "action": "Make NHS gender service waiting times easier for transgender people",
        "additional_details": "Lots of trans patients suffer with gender dysphoria, which in turn causes depression and suicidal feelings. Not being able to begin treatment can have a severe impact on mental health.\r\nMany trans people take hormone blockers. This is a drug which is completely safe, 100% reversible and prevents trans people from going through changes which don't match their gender identity. All I ask is that the use of hormone blockers in the waiting period is considered, so their general wellbeing is improved.\r\n",
        "background": "I am asking to ease the long waiting times for gender services in the UK, by allowing trans people to begin reversible treatment before they are seen by a specialist. This would prevent them from struggling with crippling gender dysphoria while they are on the waiting list, which can be over a year.",
