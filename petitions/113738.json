        "additional_details": "The PKK rescued thousands of Yazidi civilians threatened with genocide in 2014. Its sister organisation the YPG has protected Christian communities in Syria.\r\n\r\nThe PKK's strategy is to pursue peace talks while encouraging democracy in Kurdish areas. They embrace women\u2019s rights and oppose every aspect of the reactionary ideology of Daesh/Isis.",
        "background": "The PKK (Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party) is fighting Daesh/Isis on the ground, defending Kurdish and other communities from its barbarism. It is proving extraordinarily militarily effective.\r\n\r\nThe UK should be supporting the PKK, not proscribing it. ",
