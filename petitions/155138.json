        "additional_details": "This new referendum will seek to ensure that the will of the majority that voted to LEAVE is not watered down by weak UK negotiators who, to gain free trade arrangements, might give away the control of free-movement-of-labour that was voted for. \r\n\r\nOr secondly if the EU is dogmatic and unwilling to include UK control of movement-of-labour this vote effectively gives those who voted to REMAIN  a second referendum. ",
        "background": "Suggested:\r\nThe UK will shortly be leaving the European Union; How should the UK continue trading with the EU? \r\n1. Trade on the terms of the draft Exit treaty  between the UK and EU? \r\n2. Trade with the EU only on World Trade Organization rules, until a better Trade Agreement with the EU is agreed?",
