Repealing the Fixed Term Parliament Act, would not create a mechanism which would allow the public to call for an early election. This would most likely see the power to call an election be placed back in the hands of the Government. The Fixed Term Parliaments Act gives the power to trigger a general election to MPs in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nYou might be interested in signing the following petition which calls for a mechanism to allow the public to force an immediate election: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/118616"
