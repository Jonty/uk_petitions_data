        "action": "Cameron to apologise to Corbyn for branding him a 'terrorist sympathiser'.",
        "additional_details": " In Cameron's use of 'terrorist sympathiser' it implies that to sympathise with Syria in any way is to sympathise with terrorists which is a major generalization and wholly distorted propaganda. This is both misleading to the public and may stop them from displaying any emphathy for the civilians in Syria for fear of being branded a 'terrorist sympathiser' too. He has refused to apologise but should for such misleading accusations.",
        "background": "David Cameron has branded Corbyn a 'terrorist sympathiser' simply for opposing air strikes in Syria. Such a false allegation is unjust, for the reason Corbyn in no way sympathises with terrorists, but with the civilians who could be caught up in the air strikes the UK will sanction. ",
