        "additional_details": "The official figure in 1979 was about 10,000 men using marriage as a means to live in the UK. Therefore at least 300,000 men are living in these islands as a result of Mrs. Thatcher's Government not keeping its promise.\r\nForeign husbands are enabled, thanks to equality laws, to deprive Britons of work and promotion.\r\nIt is also clearly unjust that some people have the privilege of having two (non-EU) countries in which to live, while others do not.\r\n",
        "background": "In their 1979 election manifesto the Conservatives promised to end the concession whereby foreign men can live in the UK through marriage.\r\nBut Mrs. Thatcher's Government did not keep its promise.\r\nEngland is overcrowded, and the UK has more young men than young women.\r\n",
