        "additional_details": "When I ate in wasabi today I asked if the sushi contained alcohol, I was told the sushi and curries contain alcohol and it's up to the consumer to ask the ingredients they shouldn't have to make people aware of the alcohol in the food. Mortified my child had just eaten the food, I was told it was my fault for not checking before hand. It's time to label food containing alcohol clearly.",
