        "additional_details": "It was claimed that the UK loses control of \u00a3350 million per week due to its membership of the EU and that should we leave this money could be spent on the NHS. Immediately after the result was known this was declared to be false by Nigel Farage. It was strongly implicated during the campaign that immigration could be reduced if we leave the EU, by contrasting this with the current situation where the free movement of people makes this impossible. This was declared false by Nigel Evans MP. ",
        "background": "Immediately after the EU referendum result was known, key claims made by the leave campaign were declared to be false by leading leave campaigners. As it is possible that voters based their decision on these disingenuous clams, the result cannot be said to be based on informed consent. ",
