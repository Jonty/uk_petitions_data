        "action": "Make roads safer for cyclists by implementing a tougher prosecution system.",
        "additional_details": "Many road users encounter cyclists on a day to day basis, as it is a clean and healthy way to travel. However, it can be found that cyclists do not always abide by the rules of the road. \r\nCyclists are often seen ignoring red lights, either by simply riding through them or by moving to travel on the pavement temporarily without a cycle path or toucan crossing, and riding unsafely or in an inconsiderate way, such as riding in an unnecessary position in the road as to obstruct larger vehicles.",
        "background": "This petition calls for there to be a crackdown on the unsafe cyclists on the UK's roads, for their safety and the safety of all other road users. A licensing system and making bikes identifiable in a similar way to cars would mean that rule-breakers can be punished appropriately.",
