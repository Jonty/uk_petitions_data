The situation of national governance is archaic & critically endangering national security. It is in need of complete reform.\r\n",
        "background": "The motion \"That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government\" is to be called as to initiate a legal vote of no confidence as laid out in the Fixed Terms Parliament Act 2011.\r\n\r\n",
