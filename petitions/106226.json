        "action": "All children in school should be taught the truth about the farming industry.",
        "additional_details": "Children should be shown the harsh reality of meat and dairy production and it's affects on health, the planet and our ability to be a compassionate race. I think if children were shown the truth behind where their food comes from, many would not eat meat or dairy products. This petition promotes freedom of thought, compassion of nature and the truth. Brainwashing children and people and letting cruelty to other beings continue, is simply not acceptable in this day and age.",
        "background": "Children today have the capacity to change to future of the earth. Children often do not get to decide what they eat and why, in a moral sense, as they simply eat what their families do and grow up with similar habits and ideologies.",
