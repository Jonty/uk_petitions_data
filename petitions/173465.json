        "action": "Stop Private Railway Operators from wheel clamping under Railway Byelaw14",
        "additional_details": "They enlist private Contractors to handle this duty, and as a result, are generating thousands of pounds in revenue from excessive use of wheel clamping and by applying disproportionate penalties and release costs, for aggressive commercial gain.\r\n\r\nIts time this ended, so please sign this petition if you believe the Department of Transport should take action, to ensure Railway Operators and their private clamping Contractors have to abide by the same Laws as anywhere else in the Country.\r\n",
        "background": "Vehicle clamping by private companies was deemed illegal in England and Wales in October 2012. However, Private Railway Operators can still legally exploit an old Railway Byelaw(14) which allows them to continue an aggressive campaign against railway passengers parking in their car parks.\r\n\r\n",
