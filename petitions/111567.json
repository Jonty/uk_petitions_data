        "additional_details": "A total of 2,134 women aged 18-45 who currently have regular periods were polled as part of the research. A large percentage of the money goes on essential sanitary items and pain relief for cramps. 100% of the 2,134 women stated that they thought feminine hygiene products such as tampons and sanitary towels should cost less money than they do at present. It is only right that women have access to free hygiene products in the United Kingdom since it is completely unavoidable. ",
        "background": "Despite the fact that a menstrual cycle is an unavoidable part of being born a female, research has revealed that British women spend as much as \u00a318,450 on their periods over the course of their lifetime. It should not be a luxury but a right to have access to feminine hygiene products at all times.",
