        "additional_details": "This referendum is a significant event with consequences both profound and far-reaching. It is vitally important that the result is a true reflection of the will of the people and it appears that the will of the people has been grossly distorted by the misrepresentation of decision-critical information during the campaign.\r\n\r\nWe seek a method by which we can register our distress and alter our voting position, either to switch to 'Remain' or to nullify our 'Leave' vote.",
        "background": "The signatories of this petition voted 'Leave' in the EU Referendum based on information given by the Leave campaign which many considered to be critical elements in their decision, and which is now being contradicted or disavowed by various spokespersons for the Leave campaign.\r\n",
