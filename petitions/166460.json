        "additional_details": "Football, a \u00a320bn industry, is headed up in England by the FA. There is shocking opacity in it's arbitration processes and we cannot allow a FIFA situation to arise. Football fans have had enough of this organisation using fans money to make the rules up as it goes along. It should be independently regulated like any other legitimate organisation is in UK. Football has recently been proved to be a murky industry and the fans of the UK will not accept this in 'our' game, the beautiful game.",
        "background": "The FA is a self-governing organisation, recently exposed by ex-Referee Halsey's allegations that he was asked to lie in order for them to punish unfashionable players - despite their innocence. Football fans demand transparency and independent regulation to enforce this tarnished organisation.",
