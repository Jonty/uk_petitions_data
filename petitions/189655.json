It is making those changes through the Children and Social Work Bill, which is in Parliament at the moment. If that Bill becomes law, all primary schools in England will be required to teach age-appropriate relationships education, not sex education. Age-appropriate relationships and sex education will not start until secondary school.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about sex and relationships education and the Government's proposed changes here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06103"
