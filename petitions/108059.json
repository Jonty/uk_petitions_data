I fully understand what the intensions were when it was set but not every child has problems with their weight or their teeth and should all the rest suffer because of it surely not drinking enough is as bad as drinking squash ",
        "background": "My daughter like many children don't like drinking water . The school removed her bottle containing squash from her in the morning and returned it to her at the end of school only leaving her with what was in her lunch box . Like many she had extremely little to drink .  this is not healthy for her ",
