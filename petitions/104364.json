        "additional_details": "I drive a 1.6Lt Renault Grand Scenic. I fill it usually twice a month approx \u00a3130. I pay currently \u00a315 car tax. You could literally add approx 15p to a litre, which sounds a lot, but over the 100 litres I roughly use, it would equal the same. If I use my car less I pay less tax. If I travel further in a month, I pay more. Might even encourage people to walk to the shops/school etc saving them money,the environment and giving free exercise at the same time. This is is just an example.",
        "background": "Car tax system is ridiculous and too complex. The simple thing to do would be to add it to petrol. Everyone pays, even visitors in vehicles from abroad. The bigger/less efficient the engine the more petrol it would use and more tax is paid. Seems simple to me. Plus one less department to pay for.",
