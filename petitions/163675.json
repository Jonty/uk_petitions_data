        "action": "Reform of the UK's honours system, reflecting achievement, not money donated.",
        "additional_details": "It seems incredulous that people are given knighthoods for doing Whitehall jobs they have been handsomely paid for anyway, yet doctors, nurses, consultants, teachers, firefighters, police etc all struggle to get recognition for saving lives and transforming society.\r\n\r\nHanding honours to people who have helped individuals achieve office by money or political manoeuvring is sheer cronyism; the current system must now be overhauled to stop its dishonourable use and restore its proper status.",
        "background": "The honours system has become discredited to the point that highest bidders win high honours, irrespective of their achievements and merit to the country.\r\n\r\nHonours should only be given for real, tangible, honourable acts or achievements - not for political donations or doing a Whitehall job.",
