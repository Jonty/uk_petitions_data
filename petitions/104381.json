        "additional_details": "I was an RAF pilot and flew both Canberras and Vulcans. The Canberra is allowed to fly even though I would say, as a former pilot it is more dangerous on one engine as opposed to the Vulcan on 2 engines. XH 558's attendance at airshows increases attendance by some 25% which means that not only do the organisers benefit but also the numerous charities who use Airshows to raise money. Consider the people watching across the country on the weekend of 26/27th June",
        "background": "The iconic Vulcan XH 558 is the last flying Vulcan and technically is able to fly for at least one more year. The grounding appears to be because of CAA categorisation of the Vulcan and Marshalls/Rolls Royce's refusal to support the Vulcan administratively.  \r\n",
