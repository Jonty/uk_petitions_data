        "action": "Only one councillor should represent a ward in the local councils.",
        "additional_details": "In Derby there are total of 17 wards and every ward has 3 councillors. Interestingly if all three are from the same party then it becomes quite pointless to have them. There is no job description and position doesn't have any accountability. One tory councillor kept on getting paid while he lived abroad. Also councils like Sandwell only have Labour councillors and that has been the case for ages. Local democracy is failing and need urgent reforms.",
        "background": "Derbyshire PCC Mr Hardayal Dhindsa is a local councillor as well. PCC role is quite demanding and a full time position, still Mr Dhindsa decided to continue as a Councillor. This shows that three councillors aren't needed to represent a ward specially when in Sandwell 71 out of 72 are from Labour.",
