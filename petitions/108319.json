        "additional_details": "Children's childhoods are getting shorter and shorter, why should 4 year olds have to start school just because their 4th birthday was in June/July/Aug when they have classmates already a year older. They grow up and loose their childhood so quickly nowadays please give them & parents a chance to enjoy their 4 year olds and let parents who know their child best have the choice of starting at 5 in Reception class instead of them feeling guilty if their child misses that vital Reception year",
        "background": "Children whose 4th birthday falls in the summer should be able to have their school start date deferred for a year without being punished for it by making them miss the all important Reception class and making them go straight into year 1 with children who have already been at school for a year.",
