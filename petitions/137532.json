        "additional_details": "For example, some voted in the belief that the UK would save \u00a3350 million/week which would be spent on the NHS. The Leave campaign have now indicated that this will not be happening.\r\nMany people voted on the basis of strict controls on immigration, whilst the MEP Dan Hannan has indicated that the free movement of people will continue.\r\nThe terms of a Brexit haven't been formally outlined, and thus a 2nd vote is needed to ensure that the people of the UK have an informed vote on the proposed plan.",
        "background": "The British public is split, with 51.9% of the voters voting for Brexit, whilst 48.1% vote to remain in the European Union on the 23rd June 2016.\r\nIn the first 24 hours following the none legally binding vote, it is clear than many of the terms that people voted on have changed. \r\n",
