        "additional_details": "This petition is sponsored by the Cruising Association (CA). We believe that the current, voluntary, arrangements and guidance have not been adequate and that the number of call-outs, by the RNLI and coastguard, to small craft disabled by fouled propellers and rudders shows the significance of the problem.\r\n\r\nWe hope that all stakeholders will work together, with DEFRA, to find a solution, particularly one that is cheap and practical for our fishermen.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, urge the Minister of State (DEFRA) to improve the way static fishing gear is marked for the safety of all small craft at sea. \r\n\r\nThe current, voluntary, guidance is not adequate.\r\n\r\nWe ask that DEFRA seeks views regarding enforceable regulation among other options.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
