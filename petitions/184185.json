        "action": "Parliament to vote to honour UK\u2019s Dubs Amendment commitment To Refugee Children",
        "additional_details": "There are still 90,000 children travelling alone, without basic protections and at risk from traffickers.\r\nParliament has previously demonstrated via a vote its desire to commit to helping these children. For the Home Office to disregard this democratic process should be taken very seriously. At the least, it should be debated in Parliament as to how to collaborate with departments in future decisions, and a vote should be allowed to re-commit the UK to the previously ratified Dubs Amendment.",
        "background": "Home Secretary Amber Rudd has stated that once a new target of only 350 vulnerable refugee children have been allowed into the UK, the Government will effectively override the previously agreed amendment of 3,000 children resettled and stop receiving refugee children by the end of March.\r\n",
