        "additional_details": "My husband has been in the UK since April 2014 and has been legally employed since July 2014. Like other migrants in his position, he has been paying National Insurance and tax, thereby contributing to both the NHS and the country. He is happy to earn his keep and contribute to the country, but it is unfair he is being penalised by being charged twice for the NHS through NI Contributions and the surcharge. Even if he does not use the NHS, he would not be entitled to a refund of the surcharge. ",
        "background": "The NHS Surcharge is a \u00a3200 per year charge to all migrants from outside the EEA if they stay in the UK for more than six months. It is unfair to those migrants who are working and paying National Insurance contributions which go towards the NHS, meaning they are paying twice. ",
