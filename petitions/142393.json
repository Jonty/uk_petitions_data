        "action": "Make it law that only one referendum can be held on an issue in a 5 year period",
        "additional_details": "A 2nd EU referendum would cost millions of pounds more of tax payers money and be inflicted on a public who generally don't have the appetite for a 2nd referendum. This would be the case in future referendums on other issues too as a precedent would be set now if a 2nd referendum was called.",
        "background": "Following the result of the EU referendum which took months of campaigning and cost millions of taxpayer's pounds, some people who voted remain are attempting to have a 2nd referendum called because they weren't happy with the majority vote. A referendum should be a one time vote on an issue.",
