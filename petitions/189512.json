        "action": "Reinstate the Dubs Amendment: bring unaccompanied refugee minors to the UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government's  appointed independent anti-slavery commissioner stated  that the \u2018Dubs Amendment\u2019  represented an important safe and legal channel through which vulnerable unaccompanied refugee children have been transferred to safety in the UK. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, at no time has the Home Office sought to find out how many placements are available for unaccompanied children and young people. Local authorities claim they have capacity and are willing to take on more refugee children.",
        "background": "The Dubs Amendment, tabled by Lord Alf Dubs, provided a legal route to the UK for unaccompanied children but was brought to a premature end in February by the Government. 350 unaccompanied minors were brought to the UK under Dubs despite the large numbers of unaccompanied children in Europe.",
