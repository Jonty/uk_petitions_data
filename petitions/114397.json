        "additional_details": "As mentioned this happens every PMQ's. Jeremy Corbyn always handles the situation with dignity. However we can not sit by and watch this bully boy behavior continue! Most recently the vote took place whether to bomb Syria, I can't think of a more serious issue to come to parliament in a long time, yet when Corbyn tried to make a most serious case he was met with Jeers of the worse kind. Children behaving like this in a classroom would be expelled, and we should expect no less of our politicians.",
        "background": "Each and every session of PMQ's we have seen Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition, bullied, heckled and derided. A dignified man, a serious and committed politician, is each week treated with utter contempt by Tory MP's. This childish, yob mob behavior needs to stop, it is an affront to Britain. ",
