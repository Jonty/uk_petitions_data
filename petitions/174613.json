This will be for all children and young people who used the scheme. The options now available are included in the following link.\r\nhttps://www.metrobus.co.uk/childstudent-eligibility-and-id-requirements/ \r\nThis has the potential to have an impact on children's opportunities to travel to their chosen school as not all parents can afford the rising costs.",

Metrobus, Crawley has only provided a 25% discount to 16+ as long as they are a full time student. This will cause travel costs for parents double especially if under 16.  ",
