        "additional_details": "This petition calls for an independent body to be created with the express purpose of providing the electorate with confidence that official information upon which a vote may be cast is valid. It should be a requirement that claims are formally endorsed or appraised by this body before being used in an official capacity to influence the will of the people. Claims should be clearly presented in the context in which they are confirmed as valid, whether subjective, caveated or otherwise. ",
        "background": "The EU referendum is the latest political campaign to have been fought by both sides on rhetoric and deliberate ambiguity. Democracy should not be about \u2018winning\u2019, it must be about eliciting the genuine will of the electorate through verifiable facts and a proper understanding of the implications. ",
