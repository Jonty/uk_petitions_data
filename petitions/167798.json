        "additional_details": "What other steps in life in England and Wales generate such uninamous opinion compared to the house moving process? The majority - and in this case - a very clear majority, agree that this needs an overhaul.\r\n\r\nWhat is surprising is that (a) this is never properly addressed; (b) politicians are happy to address far more trivial matters.\r\n\r\nIt would not take much effort to introduce a process that would augment our system for all parties involved.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The house purchase and sale process in England and Wales is not fit for purpose. It renders house moving unnecessarily inefficient; costly; while creating uncertainty far too late into the process. Ultimately this is a system that should be, and can be, improved significantly with little effort.",
