        "additional_details": "This intends to be a message to the British and the European government.\r\nWe, the migrants, have a life. It isn't always easy, but is our life. We can't accept to live with the thought of the uncertain future that you are creating. We often catch up with life and we struggle to make ends meet. But we do that with a salary that in most cases is not even 10% of your salaries, and that doesn't include any reimbursement. \r\nEarn your salary! Do a Brexit negotiation without using us as bargains chips.",
        "background": "It looks like both the UK and EU Government intend to use the 5 million people that migrated from/to UK to EU and viceversa, as bargain chips for their own political game. \r\nWe have nothing to do with you, we don't want to be involved, we don't want to be used as a tool for your negotiations.",
