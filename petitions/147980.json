        "additional_details": "PM should address the nation, urge MP's to put personal ambitions aside, regardless of which side of the debate you're on, the people have spoken and it's time to come together to make it work for the best interest of the country. Tell the world that Britain is capable & strong. We've made it through tougher crises before and we'll make it out of this one. We need a stable Government in place, the uncertainty of a General Election is the last thing the country can afford now.",
        "background": "Brexit won the vote, the country is in crises, no one knows whats going on and who's running the country. Investors are hysterical the people are in fear. Never has the country required stable leadership as is required now. Things have changed since Friday the PM needs to step up and stir the ship.",
