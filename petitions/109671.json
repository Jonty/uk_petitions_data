        "additional_details": "As seen in recent news articles, mobile speed cameras have been spotted with their operators in the back of a horse box, a tractor etc.. \r\nSpeed cameras are supposed to slow motorists down at accident black spots and stop children being knocked over. \r\nIf cameras are well signed and stand out they are more likely to cut speeds. The Department for Transport have axed the original guidelines with no announcement or consultation and this is completely unacceptable. ",
        "background": "The Dept of Transport have scrapped guidelines on how or where speed cameras should be placed. \r\nThis means that the Police can hide in ridiculous places such as a tractor to catch motorists.\r\nThe objective of a speed camera should be to slow traffic down, not issue thousands of tickets.
