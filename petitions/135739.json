We have no income, as individuals need time to get a job or go into further education - this can be very costly depending on what uni/tech you would like to attend. ",
        "background": "I was on the train going to Lisburn, the conductor asked me what age I was, I replied \"16\". He then went on to say I cannot give you a child ticket as you are 16 proceeding to give me a lecture on how it is illegal to ask for a child's ticket.Yet you are still considered a 'child' till you are 18.",
