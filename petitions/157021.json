        "additional_details": "The Leave negotiations are of fundamental national importance. The people need the chance to express their wishes about them to their representatives. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011, the House of Commons can trigger a general election by voting a motion of no confidence in the government. We demand this vote in order to give the nation that chance, and make sure that the coming negotiations reflect the considered and democratically-expressed wishes of this country.",
        "background": "Neither government nor Leave presented a clear plan about negotiating Brexit. There is no plan. Government, Parliament and MPs need a real mandate about this crucial process. Under these exceptional circumstances, we need a General Election for the sake of national unity and direction.",
