        "additional_details": "we have seen an explosion with private hire vehicles in central London, especially with the company Uber. Lowering the time it takes to complete the London Knowledge will simply add to an already congested city. It will increase pollution at a time when 7000 people a year die from related illnesses and it will mean it will be much harder for the existing 26000 black taxis to earn a good living. Essentially it will not be worth becoming a black taxi driver anymore. Standards raised, not lowered. ",
        "background": "The London Knowledge is more then just a process  for learning the streets and places of interest, it is the forging of a person's good character and sense of pride for being the most iconic and famous taxi service in the world. It is essential that no changes be made to the knowledge process. ",
