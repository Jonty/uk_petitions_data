        "additional_details": "The policies of Mays government are significantly different to those that Cameron claimed to support in his election manifesto. With such an extreme shift of policy direction an election to prove support is essential. \r\nMay made her first speech at conference last week defining her vision for the UK. The response of the international financial markets was one of the biggest dips in the value of our currency ever seen. This suggests that our economy is under serious threat due to her decisions. ",
        "background": "May is unelected and international financial markets have shown this week that they have no faith in her policy. If she believes she has a mandate to lead us out of EU she should clearly define Brexit terms and then hold general election to prove her support. If not she proves we have NO DEMOCRACY. ",
