We further believe that to achieve this, there must be cooperation between nation states on tax matters. \r\n \r\nWe deplore any attempt to encourage tax competition and to foster a race to the bottom on corporate tax rates putting at risk the social investment that citizens rely on. \r\n",
        "background": "The Conservative government has suggested that if we do not get sufficient access to the single market when the UK leaves the EU, the UK would be forced to lower corporate tax rates to attract business to Britain. This is not the future we want for our country. ",
