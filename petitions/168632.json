As you may know this is a serious issue. Due to the school's phone line being busy and the fact that mobile phones are not aloud, he was unable to be contacted by his father and the hospital. It resulted in his father going through serious pain alone for hours until he was out of school. There are various issues like this in our country and its a serious issue. ",
