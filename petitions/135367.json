        "additional_details": "There is currently a petition calling for a second referendum to decide our fate yet again. The petition has already attracted over 100'000 signatures and counting therefore it will be addressed in Parliament. They argue that a win of under 60% and a turnout of under 75% is not a clear indication of whether Britain wants to remain or leave. \r\n\r\nIt is our responsibility to go and vote, we even had a 2 week extension to register! The results are what WE wanted so let's keep it that way. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "17.4 million British people voted out compared to the 16.1 million who voted to remain in the EU. Allow the British people to have their majority wish and sign this petition so we as leave voters can be heard in parliament and prevent our wish to leave the EU from being opposed. ",
