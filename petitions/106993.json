        "additional_details": "How is it fair that someone should be given NHS funds for luxuries such as summerhouses to help aid their health and wellbeing, whilst someone who is dying of cancer is denied medication to extend their life? How is it fair that someone should be given a holiday funded by NHS to help them reconnect with their children whilst someone else is on the verge of suicide and has to wait two years for any therapy? I suffer with mental illnesses and I think it's a disgrace. Stop funding luxuries!",
        "background": "It's been announced in the media today that an investigation by Pulse magazine has found that NHS funding is being spent on luxuries such as summerhouses, satnavs and holidays. Meanwhile, cancer medication is facing a cut in funds and the state of the mental health service lays in tatters. ",
