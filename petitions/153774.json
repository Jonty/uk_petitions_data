        "action": "Ask public about immigration before negotiating new EU deals",
        "additional_details": "Some have claimed that immigration was a key factor in the result, but it is impossible to say for certain that a majority of those who voted leave did so to prevent free movement of people. The government should take steps to more effectively gauge public opinion on the nature of Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, so that it can act on facts, not speculation. The issues of environmental legislation, the EU arrest warrant, and the court of human rights should also be included in the poll.",
        "background": "On June 23rd the UK voted to leave the EU. A number of public figures have suggested which factors swayed voters, but the question asked makes it impossible to know public opinion on specific issues. We believe the government cannot claim a mandate to negotiate a new deal without polling.",
