        "additional_details": "In 2015 24.5million people voted for Conservative, Labour, SNP & LibDem parties on the basis of a pro EU mandate. UKIP was the only party to have a leave mandate and gain a seat in Parliament with 3.8million votes.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 17.4million people voted leave in the EU referendum resulting in immediate demise of the UK Economy, revelations of deception by the leave campaign, the likely fragmentation of the UK and the resignation of the elected PM & replacement with an assertively pro-leave Government",
        "background": "The only way to stop the UK leaving the EU is to stop a pro-leave government enacting Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The only way to do this is for Parliament to enact a vote of no confidence resulting in a general election before David Cameron hands over power in October.",
