        "additional_details": "We live in a society where a disturbingly high proportion of the population has discovered that making a false allegation of rape against someone is an effective way to use the police force and the judicial system as a weapon. No evidence is needed, and it does not matter how far fetched the claim as long as the complainant does not change their story. A false allegation of rape can destroy a person's life, and is too easy to do.",
        "background": "Currently, anyone can make a false allegation of rape/sexual assault maliciously. They can have no evidence, they can warn the victim before hand and still be safe in the knowledge that as long as they stick to their story their victim's life can be ruined. This must change.",

In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the law.\r\n\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/\r\n"
