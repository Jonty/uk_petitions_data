        "action": "Ask the EU to put the brakes on Brexit action as 16 million did not vote out.",
        "additional_details": "I fervently believe that this debate was spun and politicised without a clear vision or factual discussion of either outcome of the debate, leaving many confused which way to vote in safety. The Brexit result has shocked many and should not be rushed into or perceived that all citizens of the UK want Brexit because of a simple majority. We need a better discussion about our relationship with the EU and its relationship with member states to halt the fragment and prevent further issues all round.",
        "background": "Todays vote should never have been In/Out. The UK and EU have had a long term involvement in each others politics and is so far ranging and complex that In/Out was never going to allow us a truly representative decision. MPs and EU leaders should not act rashly and reconsider the relationship.",
