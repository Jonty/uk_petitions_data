        "additional_details": "Similar laws have been put in place in San Fransisco and France. It is more cost effective to do this on new buildings than retrofit existing buildings.\r\nFor more information:\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/20/france-decrees-new-rooftops-must-be-covered-in-plants-or-solar-panels\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/21/san-francisco-adopts-law-requiring-solar-panels-on-all-new-buildings",
        "background": "Partially covering roofs with solar panels would help to reduce the building's carbon footprint. The plants would be used on roofs which don't face south. The plants would produce oxygen and also reduce the amount of energy needed to heat or cool a building and also create a place for birds to nest.",
