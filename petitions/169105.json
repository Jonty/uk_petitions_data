Most young people who move to the capital are forced to live with guardianship companies. As a guardian you have no rights and live in conditions unfit for living. Toilets are converted into shower cubicles. If you persist to have something fixed or complain about parties in the properties you can be asked to leave or get evicted. I was evicted couple of days before Christmas. ",
