Britain\u2019s failure led to communal strife, violence and mass displacement of more than half of the Palestinian population before expiration of its Mandate.\r\n\r\nThe Balfour declaration of 1917 clearly prejudiced the rights of Palestinian people and sealed their fate, leading to untold suffering. Since then, seven million Palestinian refugees, more than half the Palestinian population have had to endure this historic injustice, a blatant denial of their human rights.\r\n\r\nHM Government bears responsibility for the plight of Palestinians and has a duty to ensure proper restoration and reparation for its historical failure. ",
        "background": "We call on Her Majesty\u2019s Government to openly recognise British responsibility for the plight of the Palestinian people. The colonial policy of Britain between 1917-1948 led to mass displacement of the Palestinian nation. ",
