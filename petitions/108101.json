        "action": "Ban the use of ALL animals in circuses",
        "additional_details": "In England there are still two circuses that use wild animals as part of their acts - Circus Mondao and Peter Jolly's Circus. Only Cyprus, Greece, Malta, and Bolivia have banned the use of all animals in circuses, with a further 13 countries banning wild animals only. Prime Minister, David Cameron promised to ban circuses that use animals by January 2015 but the bill has repeatedly been blocked by other Conservative members. Lets not leave the year 2015 with animals still performing in circuses.",
        "background": "We are now in the 21st Century and we are STILL using wild and domestic animals in circuses. This is archaic, and not to mention mercilessly cruel. These animals suffer from chronic physical and psychological problems, abusive treatment, and are denied the rights to live a free and natural life.",
