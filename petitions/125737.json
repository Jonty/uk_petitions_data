        "additional_details": "Britain used to be a strong and powerful country, but this is no longer the case. British citizens believe we should help our people before we offer help to Migrants . We feel let down due to: 1) lack of housing, 2) lack of jobs, 3) cuts to medical care, 4) education spending cuts, 5) cuts to policing, 6) cuts to military, 7) increase in tax cost for the working class 8) lack of humane care for the elderly. We feel this wouldn't be the case if the Government had put US first and not Migrants!",
        "background": "1)Migrants that want to be British Citizens should need to have either a high intelligence or trade our country needs. \r\n2)Migrants to be required to provide evidence of enough money to survive for 2 years and a job prepared. \r\n3)They shouldn't be allowed to claim ANY benefits for the first 5 years.",
