We need to implement a system similar to the Scots whereby you face a penalty once you have committed to selling or buying a property.",
        "background": "Our daughter has spent the past year trying to buy a property. spending time and money in doing so. They have had 2 offers accepted but with no end in sight as to when contracts will be exchanged and no one legally bound to follow through on the sale. Everyone I talk to calls the UK system useless.",
