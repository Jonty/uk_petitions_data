        "additional_details": "The results of the recent referendum are being questioned because of the alleged lies made by both campaigns. If these allegations are true then a critical decision that will effect generations to come is being made under false pretenses and the entire democratic system is under threat. An investigation should either establish the integrity of the result or set a precedent that only campaigning of the highest integrity will be deemed acceptable in the UK.",
        "background": "Order an independent inquiry into the claims of both campaigns during the EU referendum. Investigate whether voters were deceived by misleading or factually inaccurate messages. If it is found that voters were misled the result should be voided and rules revised to prevent future misguidance. ",
