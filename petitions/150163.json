        "action": "Disregard the referendum results, and remain in the EU",
        "additional_details": "Articles are surfacing that shows that many voters were foolishly making a protest vote, as the assumption was that the UK would ultimately stay in the EU, and now regret their Leave vote.  For such a crucial issue, protections should have been in place to help prevent protest voting.\r\n\r\nThe referendum result is not legally binding on the government, and we the undersigned call upon MPs to either raise a second referendum, or to simply disregard the result as an anomaly of protest voting.",
        "background": "HM Government should disregard the referendum result to leave the EU. It is clear from the shock result that rules (such as in petition 131215) should have been implemented to help safeguard the country from protest voting. Therefore the result should be ignored, or subject to a second referendum.",
