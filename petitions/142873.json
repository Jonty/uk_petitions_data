        "additional_details": "It is confusing to sell petrol by the litre when fuel economy is expressed in terms of miles per gallon. My height and weight, for medical purposes, are expressed in meters and kilograms yet distances on our roads are expressed in miles! A cold day is recognised, for example, as minus 4 in Celsius but a hot one as 82 in Fahrenheit! There is a tremendous confusion in our system of weights and measures; let us have our British system back and have clarity and simplicity.",
        "background": "Metric measures, such as metres, kilograms and litres were imposed upon us by Europe. Now is the time to express quantity in terms that are traditionally British and with which the majority of its people are more familiar. ",
