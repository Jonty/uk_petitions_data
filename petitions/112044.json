In turn this will lead to greater transparency on the London Stock Exchanges. \r\n\r\nAIM in particular seems manipulated by the Market Makers.\r\nActually defeating their roll of creating a real and fair market for investors. \r\n\r\nAltering spreads to hide the status of transactions isn't transparent. \r\n",
        "background": "We believe the current system works against the private investor as buys are shown as sells and vise versa according to the ask and bid price set by the market makers at the time of trading. We believe this is wide open to manipulation and misinterprets the facts.\r\n\r\n",
