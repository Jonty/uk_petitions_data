        "additional_details": "The referendum is not legally binding. MPs have a mandate to review the results in open debate and determine whether or not to endorse the referendum result. \r\n\r\nThe country is divided. 75% of young people (aged 18-24) voted to remain and 61% of over 65s voted to leave. There was a difference between 'remain' and 'leave' of 1.2 million votes. This result should be re-evaluated in Parliament. \r\n",
