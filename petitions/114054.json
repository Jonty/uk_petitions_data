        "additional_details": "Please sign this petition to stop Judges acting with impunity when they:\r\ntell witnesses to lie in court\r\ntreat people with contempt\r\nJudge themselves have lied in court\r\nrefuse to allow witnesses that will prove parents innocence to be included on the witness list\r\nfail to refer lying Social Workers even with video evidence to the CPS for prosecution or advocates for perverting the course of justice even with transcripts & court audio recording\r\n\r\nThe law needs to change to allow Judges to be sacked.",
        "background": "Currently any Judge who acts outside of the Code of Conduct cannot be sacked; they can only be asked to resign. When a judge acts outside of the law the solicitors and barristers normally let them get away with it for fear of reprisals. Even when a Judge makes a racist comment he is not charged.",
