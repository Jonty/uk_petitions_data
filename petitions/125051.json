        "additional_details": "We believe that a cap on tickets resell prices at face value +10% needs to be introduced to tackle this head on.\r\n\r\nJust today tickets for Radiohead's 3 shows at the Roundhouse in London sold out in minutes. Moments after this Viagogo were selling on tickets for 17 times their original value. We need action on this to ensure music and sports fans are not priced out of attending the events they want to.",
        "background": "Music and sports fans are consistently being priced out of popular culture events due to ticket touting and official ticket 'marketplaces' like Viagogo who have formal partnerships with events where they can sell on event tickets for well above the original asking price.",
