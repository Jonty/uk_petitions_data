        "action": "Change the laws on cats fouling on neighbours land making the owner responsible.",
        "additional_details": "Gardeners, bird lovers, veg growers and parents will often agree that fouling, hunting and destruction caused by neighbourhood cats can be a real problem that can be expensive and incovenient to try to prevent. As cats are currently excluded from the fouling and trespass laws victims of their behaviour have no legal standing against the owners of cats. It is unfair to expect a person to have to continually clean up after fouling cats, dispose of dead wildlife and have plants and veg ruined.",
        "background": "The ongoing problem of neighbourhood cat fouling, hunting and causing damage to other peoples property and affecting others abilities to enjoy their home should be the responsibility of the owner of the animal. The cost and burden of preventing this should not be expected to be met by the victim.",
