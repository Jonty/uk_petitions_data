        "action": "Reconsider the EU referendum in parliament. The public vote is not binding",
        "additional_details": "It is a huge concern that the Brexit vote not only undoes decades of work within the EU, but also shows potential to undo the bonds we have held for so long within our own nation, with parties in both NI and Scotland calling for new referendums. Also the people most effected by the Brexit - taxpaying immigrants and their families - had no or little say in the outcome.\r\n\r\nI am British born, but cannot live in a country where my child's German grandparents might not easily be part of their life.",
        "background": "The result of the EU referendum was too close to be truly fair to the nation, with less than 4% between the sides. We are already seeing disastrous economic repercussions, and a potential split within our own nation. In addition Leave campaigners misled voters on key issues like funding the NHS.",
