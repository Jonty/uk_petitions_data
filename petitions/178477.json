        "additional_details": " Only 37% of the electorate voted \"leave\". The vast majority of the electorate want conditions to improve following any parliamentary vote on Article 50. MPs must be able to assure the public that if they vote to trigger Article 50, trading relations will not be worsened and restrictions will not be placed on financial institutions that will damage our economy. Therefore before any parliamentary vote on Article 50, MPs must publish in full all the arrangements that will then come into effect.",
        "background": "MP's would be stupid to trigger Article 50 without first knowing the trade rules that would come into effect as a result. The referendum ballot did not permit MP's to be irresponsible. The public have a right to know what trade rules MPs will put in place if they decide to vote to trigger Article 50",
