        "additional_details": "The wider issue here is the governments neglect of the mental health services in the United Kingdom. I realise there are probably many cases in towns, villages or cities where these centres are being closed down and I would encourage those effected by these changed to petition against them too. ",
        "background": "This centre is my sole source of free support where I, like so many others, have crucial appointments with a psychiatrist. The closure of this centre means appointments would be held in Wigton. But for people who cannot drive and have anxiety when using public transport this will made be difficult.",
