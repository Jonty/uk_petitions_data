Essex has no funding at all and in Luton they offer 3 cycles how is that worked out to be fair ?. Also some postcodes no funding at all is offered for same sex couples or if one of you have a child from a previous relationship you won't be funded.",
        "background": "The area you live in decides how the nhs will fund fertility treatment (ivf) some postcodes will fund 1 some will fund 3 and some get no funding at all. Infertility is a really hard battle already and treatment should be the same for everyone not dictated by your postcode. ",
