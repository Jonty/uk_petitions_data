        "additional_details": "The 18-21 age group of the electorate have less legitimacy than other groups because of a lack of political experience and education because a select few take it at college and understand politics. A GCSE Politics would increase the education of this age group, and stop donkey voting and apathy among this age group as more people will gain a larger range of education. Also, without a GCSE Politics we can not drop the voting age to 16, as they will be in the same boat as other 18-21 year old's.",
        "background": "Due to only a select few taking Politics at college, many of the 18-21 age group of the electorate may not vote legitimately, as they are apathetic due to lack of education or donkey vote because of the same reason. A GCSE Politics, which isn't a course with any exam board, would be beneficial.",
