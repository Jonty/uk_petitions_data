        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister has stated that, in the event of a Leave vote, he would want to stay in office to negotiate the best deal for Britain. It would be an abdication of his responsibilities for him to not start planning for this outcome now. There are many areas that need to be considered e.g. trade deals with non-EU countries, examination of EU rules and directives and their formal incorporation into UK law or abandonment, the recovery of our fisheries, UK subsidies to farming, etc. ",
        "background": "H.M. Govt., like all responsible organisations, needs to look into the future and produce contingency plans for all potential outcomes which would significantly change the status quo, and which have a high probability of coming about. e.g.How will we get the best Trade Deal and Curtail Immigration?
