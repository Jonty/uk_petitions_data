        "additional_details": "The Blue lagoon is an old clay flooded pit, accessed by a vehicle track from Arlesey. It has a jetty and small beach leading to the water. The lake is about 12 metres deep. In the water can be found huts, hoppers, bogies, boat wrecks a training base at 6m and some rather large pike! ITS AN AREA OF OUTSTANDING NATURAL BEAUTY THAT NEEDS TO BE SAVED. \r\n\r\nFilling in the pit will exacerbate, not solve the existing problems at the site. Do not let the cornerstone of our community be destroyed. \r\n",
        "background": "For years locals have been calling for action to make the site safe, following the 2001 drownings, they set up a safety group. The safety group still wants to establish a park but it is now owner Mr Wilson wants the land used for housing and Arlesey Town Council is keen to see the lake drained.\r\n",

This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n\u00a0\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf \r\n\u00a0\r\nYou could also contact your local MP, who may wish to request the decision is called in if they agree with you.
