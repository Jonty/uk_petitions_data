        "action": "Stop vaccination with the Influenza Nasal Spray Vaccine in our schools.",
        "additional_details": "If it is true that non consenting children are exposed to the GM viral particles or to the vaccine strains of influenza in school, the Nasal Spray Flu Vaccine Programme would appear to directly contradict the Secretary of State\u2019s declaration in The Health Protection (Vaccination) Regulations 2009. This states that 'there is no provision for imposing or enabling any restriction or requirement which has, or would have, a significant effect on a person\u2019s rights'.",
        "background": "There is parental concern about the use of the Influenza Nasal Spray Vaccine in schools. There may be a risk of inhalation of the GM viral particles to those not consenting and evidence shows that recently vaccinated children may transmit the vaccine influenza strain to others in their community.",
