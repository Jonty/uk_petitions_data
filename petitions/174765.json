        "additional_details": "The safe haven law allows unharmed children under 3 weeks of age to be surrendered anonymously and safely to a designated place with no questions asked. This insures that babies are not abandoned in cold or dangerous conditions or worse still neglected. \r\nWhilst this is a highly emotive issue, this law will not encourage pregnant women to abandon their children, what it will do is protect societies most venerable and those that need it most the babies. Please help me protect the these babies.",
        "background": "Around 500 babies are abandoned each year in the UK, that's 9 a week! Here in the UK its currently illegal to leave a baby in a safe place if the parent feels they can no longer look after them, but in all 50 states of America they have a 'Safe haven' law to protect vulnerable children and parents",
