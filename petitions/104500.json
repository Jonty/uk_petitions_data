        "additional_details": "It is an insult to the public to have a bar in parliament that the tax payers pay for & that ministers can use when they wish. There should be absolutely no alcohol available in parliament, a place of work! If a minister is too drunk to drive, they are too drunk to vote! They should also be mandatory drugs tested too. You can not credibly debate or vote on issues relating to the population when you are under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The bar in parliament do be closed down",

No where else can you drink & work yet you can in The House of Commons & the House of Lords. This needs banning outright.",
