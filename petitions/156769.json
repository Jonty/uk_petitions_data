        "action": "To appoint an independent judicial body to review the EU referendum campaign",
        "additional_details": "We propose that the House of Commons appoints an independent judicial committee, comprised of senior Commonwealth judges, to review claimed deceptions in the campaigns leading up to the poll of 23 June 2016 on the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union.\r\n\r\nGiven the advisory nature of the referendum, this would enable a review of the alleged deceptions and their impact on voters, with the findings reported to Parliament- the ultimate arbiter on when article 50 should be implemented. \u00a0",
        "background": "There have been considerable concerns regarding the statements that were made during the EU referendum campaign & then their subsequent retraction. Our aim is to investigate & hopefully to establish why such things happened during the course of the campaign & to learn the lessons for the future.",
