        "additional_details": "When responses are dismissive or ignore the core concerns of the people, it increases disillusionment and leads to disenfranchisement. In order to improve the power of this democratic tool to hold the government to account, there needs to be a clear, open and visible way for the public to reply to the government responses. \r\n\r\nPlease provide a way for the public to reply and engage with government responses to improve the power of this tool.",
        "background": "The petitions website was set up as a way for the electorate to influence policy and hold the government to account. While this is an excellent tool for improving communication between the public and the government, the responses are frequently dismissive with no recourse for the public to reply.",
