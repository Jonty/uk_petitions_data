This simply is not reflective of the love, hard work, sacrifice and determination to give the future the best possible start in life. As a childcare worker there is no greater joy than helping a child succeed at being a child and being happy, healthy and confident. But job satisfaction can only take you so far when a roof over your head is needed.",
