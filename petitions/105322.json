        "additional_details": "NATS in particular have made changes to departure routes from Heathrow (in particular the Compton departure route) with no warning, no public consultation and have responded with outright refusals when demands have been made to revert the changes. \r\n\r\nGiven the huge impact these changes can have on the public it is extremely important that the public know how organisations such as NATS deal with their responsibilities.",
        "background": "Private sector organisations such as NATS provide vital support for our national transport infrastructure but carry out their duties in an extremely opaque way. They should be made subject to FoIA so that the public can have confidence in how their activities are carried out.",
