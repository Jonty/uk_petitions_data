        "action": "Bring in regulation to reduce media distortion and bias that harms our democracy",
        "additional_details": "Media bias had a marked impact on the 2015 General Election (http://tinyurl.com/jx3ag56); on the Brexit vote in 2016 (http://tinyurl.com/jfe5b5u); and on perception of the Labour Party leadership (a study by the London School of Economics found that 75% of press coverage unfavourably misrepresented Jeremy Corbyn (http://tinyurl.com/zkf956a)). Demonisation of refugees fleeing conflict and of recipients of sickness and disability benefits creates scapegoats and worsens our democratic deficit.",
        "background": "Measures are needed to reduce the damage to our democracy caused by large-scale and persistent misinformation, bias and demonisation by major media organisations, which had a significant effect on the 2015 General Election, the Brexit vote, and on public perception of the Leader of the Labour Party.",
