        "additional_details": "The UK electorate has now had the opportunity to examine the consequences of the referendum but it has had no voice in saying how the country will pursue its future foreign policy and its trading relationships.\r\nThere is anecdotal evidence that the vote was used as a protest against the current political establishment.\r\nA second referendum, if positive, will provide political legitimacy to the current government.",
        "background": "The UK has voted to leave the EU, but it does not know what it wants or how its elected government is to put its wishes into effect.\r\nProposed second referendum to ask:\r\nAre you sure?\r\nTo which answer,\r\nYes, leave EU at any cost,\r\nNo, remain in EU and seek changes to EU constitution ",
