        "additional_details": "The BBC has a unique position in British life; funded by the people individually, it belongs to all & has an ethical & constitutional duty to provide accurate & unbiased information & balanced comment. It has lamentably failed this duty in recent years, in Referendum debates, and even more so afterwards by hysterically talking down the future prospects of the country, increasing division, distrust, & anger & encouraging anxiety & fear in the young\r\nmore at http://www.facebook.com/BBCNewsPetition",
        "background": "Giving Ofcom the power to enforce this policy, for accurate information is essential to democracy. At present the BBC is failing the nation, discarding all pretence at impartiality and balanced reporting, becoming a voice for an international elite, & suppressing news not welcome to its own agenda.
