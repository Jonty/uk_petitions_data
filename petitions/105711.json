There must be space at one of these MOD facilities to accommodate them.  With barracks closing why can't they be used for homeless veterans?  Why can't the empty properties be used for rehabilitation centres? There is an existing infrastructure that is going to waste, and in some instances becoming derelict, and thats just in North Yorkshire!!!",
