        "action": "Make the electoral system proportional and the House of Lords democratic",
        "additional_details": "Proportional representation must be introduced to give people direct influence on the shape of government the direction of legislation. The referendum results showed large voter engagement, because there were no \"safe seats\" as it was not down to the constituency borders. Also the system of unelected governance, was criticised in Brussels. We have such a body in the UK in the House of Lords. They must be removed or reformed to give people the same freedom here demanded from the EU.",
        "background": "Following the upheaval and uncertainty of the EU referendum result, now is the ideal time to further increase the quality of democracy in Great Britain. Many people voted because they want direct influence on policy and lawmaking. Proportional representation offers direct influence for every vote.",
