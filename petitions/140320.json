        "additional_details": "With the petition for a second EU referendum gaining mass attention and support, it's important we consider what was so wrong with the initial one - a major problem being denying the right to vote on something so crucial to those it'll affect the most. Young people have a voice that deserves to be listened to, please don't ignore it a second time around. ",
        "background": "The result of the first EU referendum, to leave, affects the future of everyone within the UK - especially of the younger generations. Not allowing 16-17 year olds to vote is denying them their say in what happens to their future, their education, their rights as well as ours (people aged 18+).",
