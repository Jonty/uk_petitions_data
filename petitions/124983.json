        "additional_details": "In any private sector work place there would be repercussions any many would be fired for such gross misconduct or face financial sanctions.\r\n\r\nParliament should lead by example. You wouldn't expect the job centre to let someone to fall asleep on the job without repercussions.  They would incur a 2 week (minimum) sanction.\r\n\r\nMP for Beckenham, Bob Stewart, slept during a debate on cutting \u00a330 ESA for the most vulnerable in society yet woke up to pass vote.  He was caught on the cameras live.  ",
        "background": "Elected MP's, paid for by the British public,  are failing to perform their elected duties by sleeping on the job. \r\n\r\nTherefore this is a call for any MP caught sleeping to be sanctioned and loose 2 weeks pay, like at the job centres.",
