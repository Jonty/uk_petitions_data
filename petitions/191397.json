        "action": "Trigger a Motion of No Confidence in current HM Government",
        "additional_details": "A motion of no confidence will trigger an early general election giving the People of the United Kingdom the power to elect a Prime Minister and suitable party. This will prevent premature triggering of Article 50 and BREXIT and allow the People of the United Kingdom adequate time to collect true facts and therefore give the People power in BREXIT negotiations and any foreseeable Referendums.  I reiterate Theresa May was not Britain's chosen Prime Minister.  ",
        "background": "Theresa May plans to trigger Article 50 for BREXIT prematurely.   The House of Lords, Scottish Government, E.U and Westminister cannot reach an amicable agreement with the interests of the people as priority.  There are too many discrepancies. Theresa May was not the people's choice for PM. ",
