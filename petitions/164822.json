        "additional_details": "The Monarchy still retains a lot of political power for an establishment that is unelected, being able to influence our laws on a daily basis, this is well known.\r\nThe Monarch retains the powers to appoint and dismiss Prime Ministers that we elect by a democratic majority whenever they choose, the last time this happened was in 1974.\r\nOfficially, we are subjects and not citizens of this country from the day we are born.\r\nAlso, we spend far too much on the Monarchy, this money could be spent better.",
        "background": "We the undersigned, want to abolish the Monarchy due to many reasons.\r\n\r\nMainly due to them being out of touch with the majority of the public in the 21st Century, their unaccountability and constantly showing us how unequal we are in this country we call a democracy.",
