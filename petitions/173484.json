        "additional_details": "Petroleum based plastics will not break down in landfill sites. Yes they can break down by a process known as photodegradation (needs the sun) but this process releases extremely harmful toxins  back into the environment. \r\nThe solution is to have biodegradable cups plates & cutlery. \r\n",
        "background": "France has passed a new law to ensure all plastic cups cutlery and plates can be composted and are made of biologically-sourced materials. The UK needs to do the same. Plastics are an ecological disaster that continue to threaten our planet.",
