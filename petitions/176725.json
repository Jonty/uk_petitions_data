        "additional_details": "If all parents checked their childrens hair on a regular basis head lice wouldn't be such a problem in schools. Nit nurses should be in schools at least once a week to check all the childrens hair and give advice on treatment for those who do have lice. Treatment for head lice is free where I live (South Tyneside) yet they are still such a problem in schools. Some parents clearly aren't checking/treating their childrens hair. ",
        "background": "As a mother with 4 daughters the ongoing problem with head lice in schools is often a source of frustration. At the moment all schools will do is send letters home advising parents there's been a child with head lice but not all parents bother to check their kids hair regularly. ",
