        "additional_details": "This idea was first suggested by Norman Lamb, Lib Dem MP, and has had broad support from the health profession and at one point pre-election seemed to be accepted in principle by Jeremy Hunt, the Current Secretary of State for Health. A multi-party set up would be one solution to the politicising and constant changes to the NHS. Another option might be a Royal Commission allowing independence like the Royal Colleges and BBC",
        "background": "The NHS is an institution deemed integral to our societal set up by the Public, and works for and is funded by the public, not any political power. As such, much like the BBC, its independence is vital to ensure it has the licence to act in the public's best interests free of political manoeuvring ",
