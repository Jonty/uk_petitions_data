        "additional_details": "The world health organisation recommends breastfeeding until 2 years and beyond. A consultant at the breast clinic at the RVI hospital in Newcastle told me recently 'your little boy is 16 months anyway, so just stop breastfeeding'. This was after telling me the pain I had was just sore lactating breast tissue. I have now been diagnosed with thrush. We need more people trained at recognising problems encountered during breastfeeding who can be supportive rather than dismissive. ",
        "background": "The NHS promotes breastfeeding as it gives you and your baby the best chance of being healthy. However, when/if you have any problems they don't have the support available to help you continue breastfeeding. The breast clinics in hospitals don't even have breastfeeding experts. This needs to change!",
