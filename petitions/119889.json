This is a huge cause for concern as this is impacting the lives of our future generations. Not only, it is impacting current day and our health. This becomes a burden on public health services as 29,000 deaths a year are pollution based, and also life expectancy is shortened by six months on average.We need to start acting now, and not encourage these industrial areas to harm our lives any more.\r\n",
        "background": "Local trading estates are exploiting British Citizens to harmful levels of pollution. Production occurs on a 24hour basis and this is massively contributing to the pollution levels coming from the UK.I propose that the government begin to time-cap production hours to a sensible 12 hour working day.
