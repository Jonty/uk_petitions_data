You have one chance and that is it.\r\n\r\nThe petition for a further referendum has gained sufficient signatures to be debated therefore I feel it only correct that there should be a counter petition to this...please sign to support this petition in just the same way when you turned out to vote Leave",
        "background": "On the 23/06/2016 The United Kingdom held a national referendum to decide whether to leave or remain in the EU. The leave campaign won and the history of our great nation took a new route. \r\n\r\nA petition has been raised by the losing remain camp to have a second referendum because they lost.\r\n\r\n.\r\n",
