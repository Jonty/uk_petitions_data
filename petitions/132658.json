        "additional_details": "I feel this is pretty self explanatory, please review how the fines system is worked, it is an unfair system that currently penalises only people with smaller incomes.\r\n\r\nWhilst not acting as a deterrent at all to high income earners.\r\n\r\nIf the system was worked off a percentage of total income then it would be much fairer to all, no matter how much money they have.\r\nThe percentage could increase the worse the crime, this may be a larger deterrent to all offenders.",
        "background": "It would be a much fairer system if the system had a set percentage of total income for any fines handed out, as such the detterant isnt the same to a someone with a high income as it may be to someone on a lower income.\r\nIt also lessens the penalty if it is having no effect on the offender.",
