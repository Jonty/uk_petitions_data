        "additional_details": "I am a 16 year old male currently studying for my GCSE's in my last year of high school. I had came across this advert whilst watching some TV and I thought nothing but I heard it again that same day and noticed it doesn't acknowledge the fact that men can receive abuse in relationships also. I again heard it on the radio in the car and asked my Dad if there is something I can do about it, he didn't really give too much help so I've done a bit of research and decided to start a petition.",
        "background": "The UK Government backed and funded the \"Disrespect NoBody\" campaign. The campaign video doesn't acknowledge that men can be the one experiencing abuse in a relationship and uses key phrases like \"Do you turn to violence when your GIRLFRIEND disagrees with you\" Link to ad http://youtu.be/V9GjpheIMro",
