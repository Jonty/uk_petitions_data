        "additional_details": "In other EU countries they have found that when doing these medical and dental checks 9/10 are lying about their age. The 'children' brought over are not vulnerable and look older than 18 we as the British people want proper confirmation of age. We want more than oral interviews and documents, we want proof these 'children' are the age they say they are. When Britain said it was bringing in vulnerable children we expected the very young, orphans, the weak and the disabled. We have been mislead. ",
        "background": "The government is refusing to properly check the age of all these migrant 'children' as it could be seen as intrusive.  We should be ensuring that anyone coming into this country meets the under 18 age requirements. ",
