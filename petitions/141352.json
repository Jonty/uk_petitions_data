        "action": "Parliament should exercise its sovereignty and block leaving the European Union.",
        "additional_details": "Any move to leave the EU needs to be supported by parliament. The British parliament is sovereign and needs to exercise its sovereign powers to protect the nation from the damage that will be caused by Brexit. A majority of 4% in the referendum does not justify the catastrophic consequences of this decision. The elected MPs of a representative democracy must at times make decisions that go against popular opinion in the interests of the nation. Today, Britain can only be great within the EU.",
        "background": "The referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union voted leave by a narrow majority. It is merely advisory and as the majority of MPs support continued membership they should exercise parliamentary sovereignty in the interests of the nation's future to prevent invoking Article 50.",
