        "action": "Halt the triggering of Article 50, in the light of presidential election result.",
        "additional_details": "There has been a very significant change since the referendum, with political and economic ramifications that require due consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is no urgent need for Article 50 to be invoked. In the light of recent events, current haste would appear ill-judged.\r\n\r\nIt is sensible in the current climate to adopt caution - the UK risks alienating itself from its European allies, when the need for togetherness may be at its greatest.\r\n\r\nMore deliberation will produce a better decision for the UK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The massive geopolitical change resulting from the US presidential election so increases the risk and uncertainty surrounding the proposed withdrawal of the UK from the EU, that it is prudent to call a halt to the triggering of Article 50, to have time to consider all the implications for the UK.",
