ITV/Cardiff University/YouGov poll: (30 June-4 July) REMAIN would win by 2.01 million (6%)\r\n3. Independent/ORB poll: (5-6 July) 12% of LEAVERS want a second referendum, suggesting REMAIN would win by 3,083,185  (9.2%)\r\n4. The BBC News/ComRes poll: (7-10 July) 7% of LEAVERS want to stay in the single market with the current rules on free movement suggesting REMAIN would win by 1,168,003  (3.48%)\r\nSee www.no2brexit.com",
        "background": "All Brexit polls since 23 June show that the 3.8% majority for LEAVE is now reversed. REMAIN would win any referendum as a small but significant number of leave voters have changed their minds. REMAIN is now the will of the UK (www.no2brexit.com) so we call on the government to recognise that fact.",
