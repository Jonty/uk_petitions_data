Why should the DVLA hold onto our money.\r\nAs soon as a car is taxed online the DVLA must be made to give an immediate refund on the car that has been sold. Money is taken electronically therefore should be refunded electronically.",
        "background": "There is no period of grace buying a car to taxing it The DVLA obtain immediate monies\r\nRefund from selling a car takes up to 6 weeks.\r\nYou only get the refund from the following full month. That means there is an awful lot of surplus cash sitting somewhere. \r\nThis practice needs to be stopped. ",
