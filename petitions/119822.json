        "action": "Do not retroactively change university loan repayments",
        "additional_details": "The changes to university grants include a freezing of the minimum income that has to be reached to pay back the loan. This means that over time inflation will make people who have less available income have to pay back the loans. The big issue is that they plan to change this for all students dating back to 2012 and as such are retroactively changing financial contracts. This would be illegal for any private company to do so why should it be okay for the government?",
        "background": "The government are freezing the minimum income you need to earn to start to pay off your student loan. The worst part is that they are freezing it for all students since 2012 meaning they are retroactively changing their financial contracts with the students.",
