        "action": "Reinstate legal aid for students and people on a low income",
        "additional_details": "When legal aid was discontinued this meant some types of case were no longer eligible for public funds - including divorce, child contact, welfare benefits, employment, clinical negligence, and housing law except in very limited circumstances. (BBC news) \r\nThis petition should be looked into by Houses of Parliament and even if only a few were reinstated for legal aid such as child contact being the main issue as every parent and child should be together and some parents can't afford legal costs.",
        "background": "Many people need the help of solicitors and courts all around the UK for various reasons but can't afford the costs by themselves. The 1st of April 2013 saw legal aid was discontinued. This petition will see that people are able to receive help in many cases that legal aid covered.",
