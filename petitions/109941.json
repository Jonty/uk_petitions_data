        "action": "Reinstate the personal income tax allowance for people earning over \u00a3100,000pa.",
        "additional_details": "There has been much debate about the so called top rate of income tax on earnings over \u00a3150,000pa , which was increased by Labour to 50% & reduced by the Conservatives to 45%. Whatever feelings about these levels, it is surely wrong to tax at 60% a much lower marginal income. This is not affecting fat cats, but some of the hardest working in society, including doctors & senior teachers & police officers.    ",
        "background": "The current system introduced by the last Labour government imposes a marginal income tax rate of 60% up to a current income level of \u00a3121,200pa, plus 2% NI, leaving the worker with only 38% of this slice of income. ",
