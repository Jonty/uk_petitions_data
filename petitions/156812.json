        "action": "Replace London with Edinburgh as UK capital",
        "additional_details": "To counter a sense of grievance, felt by many in Scotland over England\u2019s dominance in the Union, particularly after the EU referendum. The capitals of the USA, Canada, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, are not simply their largest cities. Relocating the capital to Edinburgh will move the political centre of gravity to Northern Britain, where it is sorely needed. Anything that reduces the dominance of London over the UK without diminishing it\u2019s global influence worldwide has to be welcomed.",
        "background": "To foster a sense of UK-wide cohesion and inclusiveness, among Scottish people in particular. I believe that replacing London with Edinburgh as the UK's administrative capital would go some way in achieving this.",
