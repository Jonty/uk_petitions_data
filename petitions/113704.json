        "additional_details": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-34909649\r\n\r\nThis reduction in Britain's maritime projection completely contradicts the latest government policy of preparing more rapid strike forces able to intervene in trouble spots around the world.\r\nThe continual run down of the Royal Navy seriously risks us destroying the skill base and maritime culture that has allowed us to maintain a strong naval fore for centuries and in this time of uncertainty scrapping an old but capable ship is ludicrous.",
        "background": "It was announced on the 24th November 2015 that HMS Ocean, the Royal Navy's only carrier of any kind will be decommissioned before the HMS Queen Elizabeth is fully operational leaving us with a two year gap in our ability to provide air support to amphibious operations. This is utterly unacceptable!",
