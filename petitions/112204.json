This includes meeting renewable energy targets. Failing that, the Government should explain why such targets haven't been met and take action.\r\n\r\nShe misled Parliament and the public on such an important issue. To honour her responsibility, she should resign her position. ",

This is in contrast to her position in a leaked letter, admitting that the UK is not on course to meet those targets.\r\n",
