        "action": "Decriminalise cannabis use and cultivation for medical purposes.",
        "additional_details": "Our police force would save a large amount of money every year that could help our NHS as well as fund schools.\r\nIt would also save the police a lot of time \r\nwhich can be used for investigating and cracking down larger scale crimes.\r\nCrime rate would go down since our medicine could be produced by us rather by criminal organisations.\r\nWe can already see how the other countries have benefited from implementation of medical cannabis with great short time results to excellent long time results.\r\n",
        "background": "Cannabis is the most widely used drug in the UK, and its also one of the oldest medical plants on our planet. \r\nSince legalizing this particular drug cannot happen,we the people ask for small medical  amounts of cannabis to be decriminalised so that our police force can focus on larger crimes.",
