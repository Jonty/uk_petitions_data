        "action": "Take citizenship from any British citizen who goes abroad to join terrorists",
        "additional_details": "There's been several incidents where British citizens have joined terrorist groups and some where the person has been jailed at taxpayers expense. I believe these people should not be jailed at our expense but have there citizenship removed and left in or deported to whatever country it was they went to in first place. The moment they decided to join a corporation that wants to harm British citizens was the moment the government should banish them from ever re-entering our country",
        "background": "This petition has been started to take away British citizenship from anyone who leaves country to join terrorists and also people within country who persuade and help others to join terrorist groups",
