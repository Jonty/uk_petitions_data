        "additional_details": "As a former soldier and trainee at Deepcut I wanted to start this online petition to get the government to start opening up about what went on at this place. I was recently involved in the BBC 2 documentary \"The Army's shame\" During my time there I was subjected to and seen physical brutality on a number of levels. \r\nThe government cannot ignore the goings on in Deepcut any longer!! Please take a minute to sign this petition and let's get the ball rolling to getting it discussed in parliament.",
        "background": "Deepcut Army Barracks in Surrey has been the focus of the recent inquiry into how Private Cheryl James died at the barracks. \r\nNobody will ever know the truth unfortunately but the hard fought battle of the James family has opened up some very searching questions into the home of the RLC",
