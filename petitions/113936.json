They have the same costs, basically pensioners are discriminated against by their age, if they were younger they could claim benefits.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion for the Government is;\r\n\r\nA. Cap benefits in line with the Living Wage Calculation (16,328 per annum)\r\nB. Use the savings to increase the State Pension to the same level as the Living Wage calculation (16,328 per annum)",
