        "additional_details": "There has been great uncertainty about the future financial impact of the vote to leave the European Union. Now that the leave process is in progress it should be possible to calculate the ongoing costs of the decision to leave. It should also be possible to have a clearer idea of the future impact both for what we would save and for what we are likely to expend. This would inform us all of the net financial benefits of leaving the European Union.",
        "background": "The government should set up an independent body to record and publish the ongoing and projected costs to the country and the people of leaving the European Union. This is essential for everyone to understand the financial impact of the referendum vote and any future decisions made.",
