        "action": "A petition to stop proposed police cuts! A vote of no confidence in Teresa May.",
        "additional_details": "Planned government spending cuts will see at least 22,000 police jobs being lost, leaving the public protected by the lowest numbers of officers since the 1970's.  With a rapidly growing population and an increasing crime rate a prominent risk is presented to both police and the members of society who pay for a  public service. \r\n\r\nOver 17,000 officer posts were eliminated in the last round of cuts under the Conservative-led coalition government between 2010-15. It's time to take a stand!\r\n",
        "background": "In the light of the current government cuts this petition will highlight the public's and the police's rebuke for the current policing cuts. \r\nThe proposed cuts pose a risk for both the officers on the streets as well as the members of the Great British public. \r\n\r\nProtect The People Who Protect Us",
