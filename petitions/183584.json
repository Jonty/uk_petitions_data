This is purely a money making scheme and nothing else. ",
        "background": "Council's should display more signs & have road markings identifying restricted/permit parking areas. Currently, they only have to have a sign on the entrance of the road. These signs can be easily missed, then consequently people are being fined up to \u00a370. This is unfair and needs to be changed. ",
