        "additional_details": "The circus in question also had a family of monkeys locked in another lorry-cage, amd camels, llamas, ponies and goats. \r\nOne of the lions had a spiked chain collar on and all of the big cats were pacing their cells looking distressed. \r\nThis sort of thing should be banned across Europe.",
        "background": "While enjoying a family holiday at a campsite in Brittany, France, a circus arrived to set up their show. \r\nWe were horrified to see two lions and two tigers (one an albino) locked in tiny cages on the back of a lorry. \r\nSurely it is time to ban live animal acts across Europe?",
