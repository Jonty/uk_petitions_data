        "additional_details": "It is important for our democracy and our future that the public are properly informed before making a decision that has such far reaching consequences. The referendum is only advisory, not mandatory, and the UK government can choose not to implement it.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. \u00a3350 million will go to the NHS on leave campaign battle bus. (Google it for a video) \r\n2. Statements regarding the control of free movement of labour (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36628894)",
        "background": "Many statements made by politicians in the EU referendum campaign are turning out to be untrue or at best misleading, yet the future of our country has been decided on the basis of these statements. The referendum results should be nullified as a consequence, as the public have been misled.",
