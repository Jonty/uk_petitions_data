        "additional_details": "If an MP is fairly elected as a party leader by party members AND supporters then it is not democratic that he should resign against his own wishes due to pressure purely from his own party MP's if there is still a huge amount of support from his party supporters. A vote should be cast by Labour supporters as well as Labour Party members to decide if Jeremy Corbyn should remain as the Labour Party leader.  ",
        "background": "On Saturday 12 September 2015 Jeremy Corbyn was voted in as Labour leader with a landslide amount of 59.5%. The voting was completed by Labour Party members and registered and affiliated supporters, using the alternative vote system. It's only fair that a similar vote is taken to decide his future.",
