        "additional_details": "Schools are still left to write their own health and safety policies including those relating to allergies within the school setting. Adopting good practice (such as advocated by Allergy UK) in setting up School Allergy Action Groups/SAAG will enable school staff, pupils, parents, governors and providers (e.g.caterers) to collaborate in ensuring school is as safe as possible for those affected by life threatening allergies. It will reduce risks\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f, save time, money and potentially lives.",
        "background": "Cases of Anaphylaxis are rising in the UK. Schools have a statutory duty of care to support children with medical conditions. Allergies can be life threatening. We believe every school should adopt good practice in the way of School Allergy Action Groups as soon as practically possible.",
