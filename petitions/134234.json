        "action": "Hold a referendum allowing London to exit the UK & join the EU as a city state",
        "additional_details": "As a city state in the EU, London would get all the benefit of the EU membership and our status as a world leading city without any of the burden of the rest of England.\r\n\r\nThis would allow the City of London to invest all of our tax back into London infrastructure, the people who live and to attract international companies. This would allow London to become the best city in the world to live and work.",
        "background": "During the recent EU referendum the city of London voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, this is in contrast to the rest of England. I believe that London would be better in the EU as a city state and to spend our tax money on London instead of providing a large portion to the rest of England. ",
