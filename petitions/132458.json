        "additional_details": "For too long, the UK has been lenient when it comes to illegals trying to get into our nation and we must set an example to defend ourselves from possible terrorists posing as migrants (as seen during the Cologne and Paris attacks). And also to prevent further actual refugees from risking their lives trying to get into the UK.\r\n\r\nI ask the Government to deploy warships into the English Channel to; stop and turn around illegals, deter further illegals from risking their lives in the effort to get into the UK, and if necessary use lethal force to defend British waters. ",
        "background": "Over the past few weeks there have been known several incidents of illegal migrants trying to cross the English Channel to get in the UK. So far only one of the attempted crossings have been successful but it is inevitable that more will get into the UK. ",
