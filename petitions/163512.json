        "additional_details": "Britain has a big coastline, and the proposed tidal lagoon in Wales could be the ideal starting point and testing ground, though I personally think the artist's impression is awful and I think the whole thing should be hidden away out of sight, which it could be if designed properly, a bit like the Cruachan hydroelectric generating station in the mountains in Scotland.",
        "background": "Tidal power is totally reliable and always available. It does not rely on ANY fuel, the wind, or the sun. There is NO waste, it is totally green and works 24/7/365. The tide timing is different in different places, so there are no big gaps. If designed properly, they could be virtually invisible.",
