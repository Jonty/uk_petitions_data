        "additional_details": "The Brexit vote was negative and gave no indication of how to go forward. Now that the effects of Brexit are more clear, parties and voters can make more informed decisions. All parties must decide their view of our future relationship with the EU and lay out detailed plans for the future. Without an election there is no mandate for how exactly to withdraw or, given the mood in the country, whether to withdraw at all. A general election is necessary to give clarity and help reunite the country. ",
        "background": "After the Brexit vote the country is divided. It gave the British people no way to vote for a positive alternative to current EU membership. A general election is the only way to decide this detail and give legitimacy to any negotiations. Parties must present their positive policies for our future.",
