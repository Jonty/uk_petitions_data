        "additional_details": "For such a substantial transition it is crucial that the people have a say in the terms of the exit and how Britain will be taken forward after leaving the EU. We therefore call upon HM Government to hold a General Election in 2016 and give each political party the opportunity to set out a clear vision of what post-EU Britain will look like under their leadership. Allow us to exercise our democratic right by voting to elect the government we feel best equipped to lead Britain outside of the EU.",
        "background": "On 23rd June the people voted on whether or not to leave the EU but not how. Therefore we the undersigned call upon HM Government to hold a General Election in 2016 to give British citizens a chance to exercise their democratic right to vote on who will govern the UK during and after leaving the EU.",
