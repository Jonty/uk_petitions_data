On our busy streets their is no place for sports cycle racing, its highly dangerous with cyclists often racing three abreast and not moving in on narrow roads to allow faster traffic to pass. clubs should rent tracks to race on cars and motorbikes have to , cyclists pay no road tax,have no insurance etc, pleasure cycling and commuting should be encouraged on cycle paths only but racing banned\r\n",
