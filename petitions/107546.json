        "action": "Urge Israel to grant right of return to Palestinian Refugees fleeing Syria",
        "additional_details": "At present, Europe is absorbing a large number of fleeing refugees from Syria, many of whom are Palestinian refugees forced from Israel as a result of occupation and displacement since 1948. It would make sense then that right of return be granted by Israel as part of a solution to aid this international crisis, given the scale of the current situation, the proximity of Israel to Syria and the fact that these people originate from this territory of the Levant.",
        "background": "Since the establishment of the state of Israel, Syria has absorbed around 500,000 Palestinian refugees through forced displacement or fleeing persecution.  The current political situation in Syria has resulted in further forced displacement and a significant humanitarian crisis.",
