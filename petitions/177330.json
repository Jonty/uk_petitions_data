        "additional_details": "There is a night time world & a night time economy that should not be forgotten about, many of us take great solace & enjoyment from Janice & Alex's shows.\r\nReplacing them with a loop of repeated shows is culturally myopic and not what the BBC should be about. \r\nTo the outside world the UK=Music, we should be providing more outlets for our bands & songwriters not axing a treasure like Janice with her vast music knowledge.\r\nI'm sure people can suggest other ways Radio 2 can make these cuts ...",
        "background": "Using repeats in place of real human DJ's after midnight on Radio 2 is shortsighted.\r\nBoth Janice & Alex provide a beautiful service to the people of our country that can't be measured in finances. \r\nNight workers, insomniacs, students, lorry drivers, music lovers & the lonely NEED that human touch.",
