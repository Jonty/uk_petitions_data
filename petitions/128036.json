        "action": "Spend revenue from closing tax loopholes on carbon capture & storage technology",
        "additional_details": "There is a technology called Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS). This captures up to 90% of the carbon from fossil fuel power stations and other industry when it is fitted. If more money was invested in this technology, it would reduce the manufacturing cost more companies could start fitting it to new power stations and possibly existing power stations and industry thus reducing emissions.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "I think a percentage of the money the government gains from closing tax loopholes should be invested. The single biggest threat facing the world is global warming. A lot of money is being invested in renewables but not enough into capturing carbon from existing fossil fuel consumption.\r\n",
