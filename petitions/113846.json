As rideshare drivers, police and the general public will want to immediately jump to the conclusion that we were at fault. \r\n\r\nSexual Harassment \u2013 Discouraging It and Defending Against It\r\n\r\nThis differs depending on whether you are a male or female driver.  If you are a female driver, having a visible dash cam can prevent men riders from being too friendly.  \r\n",
