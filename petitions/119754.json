        "action": "Make vaping bans illegal and regulate vaping fluid ingredients.",
        "additional_details": "This petition is for the good of public health.\r\n\r\nIf vaping indoors was a legal right, more people would invest in electronic cigarettes out of convenience alone. More people would make the switch and save the NHS millions in the long term, while nicotine tax would continue to provide government revenue.\r\n\r\nPoor quality vaping fluids are the reason why people think vaping is unsafe. Pre-mix vaping fluids need only contain nicotine, base and flavour, as is already available but it should be the law.",
        "background": "Vaping is much safer than smoking, and causes no unpleasant odour. If the ridiculous bans on vaping of many establishments was made illegal, many more smokers would make the switch.\r\n\r\nMany vaping \"pre-mix\" fluids contain needless toxic ingredients for \"a smoother vape\" and should be regulated.",
