While EMA exists across the UK, policy relating to its operation is a devolved matter, as such the UK Parliament could only raise the acceptance level for England without changing the law on devolved powers.\r\n\r\nIn Wales, the Welsh Assembly is responsible for EMA. The Welsh Assembly has its own Petitions Committee. If you'd like to see the level of acceptance raised in Wales you could send your petition to the Welsh Assembly, you can find out more here:\r\nhttp://www.assembly.wales/en/gethome/e-petitions/Pages/e-petitions.aspx"
