        "additional_details": "We have all seen the horrific images of Bob Geldof flicking the \"V\" towards the hard working fishermen on the United Kingdom. In a shocking display he took away the right of every person to protest and that being the way the EU have forced their rights above that of the British fishermen and British leisure angler. He is a multimillionaire and has used his money and influence to drown out the voice of the people to which was a legal demonstration.  As such this man should be stripped of this.",
        "background": "Bob Geldof has shown nothing but contempt for the hard working British fishermen and with that contempt for every hard working person in the British isles. A knight of the realm should not use his influence and money to drown out the voice of the people he is supposed to defend.  ",
