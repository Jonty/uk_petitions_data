        "action": "Improve broadband bandwidths in all areas of London",
        "additional_details": "As a country having a lot of problems domestically, especially with immigrants, asylum seekers and economy, we should fund new ways to deal with future demands. By employing a boost in broadband bandwidths as an initiative we can take a long step towards managing our problems and even help those in need by reducing unnecessary expenses like Australia and Denmark have done before. ",
        "background": "Especially rural, improving broadband bandwidths would take a lot of cars off the roads and even make employers to allow workers to work from home, meaning big structural changes can be reassessed. Saving on commuting costs, would allow people to have more to spend.",
