This needs to be addressed immediately.\r\n\r\nSo we do hope that this turns into reality because homelessness is no joke. How would you feel if you were homeless? Who would you turn to in your hour of need? Why is the Government not taking responsibility for this disturbing crisis? \r\n\r\nSign this petition today or it could be you living on the streets tomorrow.\r\n",
        "background": "We want the Government to build more houses because the more houses there are, the cheaper they will be. The Government should introduce a new rent cap so that people can afford a house to live in. It's not a laughing matter and the Government cannot let this carry on because it is destroying lives!",
