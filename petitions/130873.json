        "action": "Make the exclusion from any society/club based on gender, age or race illegal",
        "additional_details": "It should be illegal to exclude any person from joining any society or club based on gender, age, race, or any other form of discrimination. It is unacceptable behavior to do so and whilst it may go against 'traditions' or 'long held beliefs' for certain organisations, it does not match the positive attitude towards diversity that we should be supporting in this country.",
        "background": "In light of the recent decision by Muirfield to exclude female members for joining the club as members clearly a change is required. We no longer live in a society where the exclusion of any individual based on gender, age or race is deemed acceptable. Discrimination should be a criminal offence.",
