HMRC use the figure to calculate the extra tax I pay out my salary.  I pay more to CSM and earn less through HMRC.  It can't be taken both ways, it needs to be fair.\r\n\r\nOthers have done OT in previous years to pay off joint debts as I did.  But the system now uses this against you.  In essence it punishes you for working harder and/or being successful.  It needs reviewing.",
        "background": "The new system uses gross income to estimate earnings via the HMRC.  In my case I receive company benefits which the CSM source from HMRC and have decided I earn \u00a315,000 per annum more than I do.  The company car is a necessity to my work and the system should be based on net earnings.",
