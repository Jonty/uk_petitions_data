        "additional_details": "By letting the owner know that their beloved pet has been hit could be the difference between the cat surviving or passing away, those few minutes after an accident are crucial and could give the pet owner time to get to the vets and potentially save the cats life! I know this will not bring my cats back and it wont prevent more accidents.  But it would mean not so many people lose their pets if they can get them to the vets in time.",
        "background": "In less than 2 years I have had 3 cats killed after being hit by cars.  All 3 of my cats have just been left either in the road or at the side of the road and nobody has had the decency to let me know. I think it is about time that accidents involving cats should be reported as is the law with dogs.",
