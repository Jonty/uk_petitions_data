Why doesn't the UK?\r\nEvery child deserves the right to both parents if both are willing to offer their love to that child. ParentalAlienation denies a child that basic human right -'The deliberate manipulation of a childs mind'. \r\n20,000+ children a year may be affected by Alienation in the UK, however it is not recognized in the UK courts. 5% of children involved in separation will experience it. \r\nwww.parentalalienation.org.uk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
