        "action": "Train operators should provide more rolling stock to give all commuters a seat",
        "additional_details": "This is self evident to thousands of commuters who use the trains everyday and put up with poor customer service. Part of the franchise should enforce investment in rolling stock to fully meet peak demand. ",
        "background": "Train operators habitually operate trains with 4 carriages at peak times causing dangerous levels of overcrowding. Many at non-peak times have up to 12 nearly empty carriages.  They justify this to get rolling stock into position. If they were to invest in enough stock this wouldn't be necessary. ",
