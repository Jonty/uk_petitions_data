        "additional_details": "Its about time we started to realise that no dogs are dangerous, only owners. We have known this for centuries yet we still allow criminals to breed these types of animals excluded within the Dangerous Dogs Act and we have almost zero accountability over our pet owners within the United Kingdom. \r\n\r\nWe must propose a new system in which owners/breeders are held accountable for their animal no matter what breed and encourage education rather than destruction with this issue. ",
        "background": "Everyday innocent dogs around the UK are dragged from their homes, stuffed into kennel's with other petrified dogs away form their owners and are 'destroyed'. A large number of these dogs are just puppies and have never shown any signs of aggression. They are dying due to breed discrimination. ",
