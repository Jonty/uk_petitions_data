        "additional_details": "As of now if you have at least one child in a primary school and you apply for the September start for a younger sibling, the government can now ignore common sense and force you to be at 2 different schools at exactly the same time.\r\nThey need to bring get back the old \"sibling\" question into the application for a school place so parents are not put through so much mental stress facing the prospect of having to be on opposite sides of a town at the same time.",
        "background": "The government need to rethink the enrolment of children into schools. They have lost a common sense approach and as of this year are forcing parents to accept their ridiculous decisions on school placements.",
