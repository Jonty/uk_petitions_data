        "action": "increase the sentence for those convicted of causing death by dangerous driving",
        "additional_details": "The recent case of Najeeb Hussain ( Bradford crown court 18/2/15) who was sentenced to just 4 years do the death of an innocent pensioner on his mobility scooter, highlights a massive injustice. Those who speed, take no regard for the responsibility they have as a driver and drive in a dangerous, selfish and aggressive manner are, in fact, prepared to risk the lives of innocent people. \r\n\r\nI urge the government to debate a review on the sentences and bring these in line with murder convictions.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "With the huge cut in roads policing budgets and an increase in dangerous driving causing serious injury or death, we ask the government to review and increase the sentences handed out to those convicted to bring them in line with attempted murder.",
