        "additional_details": "This is not acceptable \"Theresa May has indicated that Brexit could be delayed as she said she will not trigger the formal process for leaving the EU until there is an agreed \u201cUK approach\u201d backed by Scotland.\" How can you get Scotland to back anything that requires common sense and logic if the SNP are involved. They would rather be controlled by an undemocratic block of 27 foreigners who would have to impose austerity because of the deficit they run with. Lets get rid of them ourselves. ",
        "background": "Scotland do not like us, the SNP are undemocratic, Scotland are a drain on the UK, They don't pay for University places, prescriptions, NHS parking etc. They are trying to blackmail us over the EU, so let them go. The EU would not have them and if did they would have to adopt the Euro.",
