        "additional_details": "It is incredibly degrading and infuriating for those aged under 25 to be paid less than others older than them; especially when they are doing the same job. Age is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act 2010 (meaning they are protected in terms of discrimination) therefore is this new \"Living Wage\" technically discrimination? Yes I think so, especially if a 21 year old and a 25 year old are doing the same job. It is important that we strive for equality. ",
        "background": "The National Living Wage 2016 sees employees aged 25 or over being paid at least \u00a37.20 per hour (if not in first year of an apprenticeship). I seek to see this be changed from 25 years old to 18 years old. \"Discrimination due to age is one of the great tragedies of modern life.\" - Johnny Ball",
