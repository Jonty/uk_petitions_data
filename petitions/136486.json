        "additional_details": "In a democratic society when a Referendum is called upon to make such big decisions for our country it is important they are upheld..it is unfair and unjustified once votes have been cast, verified and announced to oppose the winning side and call for a 2nd referendum based on the minority not winning..help counteract remains petition and help stop any call for a 2nd referendum and for Brexit to continue uninterupted until the people of this countrys decisions have been upheld.\r\n",
        "background": "We live in a so called \"democratic country\" where majority rules. Yet after winning the referendum to Exit, Remain has petitioned to call for a 2nd referendum. Democracy is NOT to repeat voting until you win! But to uphold the majoritys wishes.Sign to keep OUR Dream of exiting the EU a reality.",
