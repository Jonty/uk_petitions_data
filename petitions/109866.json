        "additional_details": "The current national speed limit of 70mph does not reflect advances in motor vehicle safety technology or changing conditions.  many motorists find it to be outdated and frustrating.\r\nThis would reduce congestion in built up traffic, reduce accidents in poor conditions and give motorists the freedom to cover longer distances in shorter time.",
        "background": "Using smart motorway signage:\r\nOn straight roads with very little traffic and good visibility a no speed limit to be put in place in the fast lane.\r\nIn congested traffic, poor visibility or if there is a hazard ahead appropriate limits between 30mph and 70mph and/or lane closures to be put in place.",
