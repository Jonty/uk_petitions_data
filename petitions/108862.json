        "additional_details": "Without bevacizumab, hundreds of women annually with late stage cervical cancer will be denied a drug that has shown to increase the median survival by 3.7 months with a small impact on quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe removal of bevacizumab, which had just started to fulfill a large and unmet need, will result in a hugely detrimental impact on end of life for cervical cancer patients.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re calling on NHS England and Pharma to resolve this issue and come to an agreement on affordability.",
        "background": "Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust is calling for the drug bevacizumab (Avastin) for cervical cancer to be reinstated onto the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) list after the announcement that it will be de-listed for cervical cancer treatment from the 4th November 2015. \r\n\r\n",
