        "action": "Allow all people with terminal conditions access to trial drugs.",
        "additional_details": "The current process of drug development for the terminally ill leaves patients with little power or hope. It feels like what the patient wants is being ignored. In some cases drugs are denied from the rest of the patient population for years after being shown to save lives in the condition, allowing avoidable death on a massive scale. There are many terminal conditions that share this frustration affecting adults and children and babies. Everyone should have the right to the best chance to live.",
        "background": "Developing drugs is a lengthy process. When drugs first display effectiveness, the path to approval for use is a long one, to ensure the benefits outweigh any potential risks. But nothing is more risky than death and the terminally ill may be denied potentially life saving treatments in this wait.",
