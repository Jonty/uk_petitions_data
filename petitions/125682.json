        "action": "Adjust financial exemption on Fianc\u00e9 and Spouse visas to include ESA",
        "additional_details": "Fianc\u00e9 and Spouse visas require the sponsor, the British partner, to either earn 18.6k or have 62.5k in savings of more than six months. If in receipt of a disability allowance the sponsor is exempt from these restrictions, and although ESA is considered a disability allowance, it is not considered so by the Home Office who do not feel it justifies exemption. \r\n\r\nYet another example of inequalities imposed upon the disabled people of Britain.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/browse/benefits/disability",
        "background": "I am currently in receipt of ESA and I am forbidden to marry my Russian fianc\u00e9, or to bring her over if we manage to wed abroad, because I do not meet financial restrictions imposed by the Home Office. My disability truly hinders my ability to meet the demands.",
