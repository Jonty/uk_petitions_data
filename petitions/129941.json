        "additional_details": "Drive by inspections are fraught with difficulty. What may be perfectly acceptable for a cocooned motorist  may well severely disable or kill  a cyclist. Highways inspectors should experience the real world on two wheels. \r\nTrmac and skin do not make good bedfellows.\r\nPlease support and pass to all fellow cyclists , clubs and parents.\r\nNext time it could be YOU!\r\nPetitioner is a 62 yr old Sky Ride leader , Cycle instructor and holder of BCF gold racing licence , cycling up to 3000 miles per annum.",
        "background": "I call upon fellow cyclists to support this petition?I believe if accepted it will at the very least save considerable pain ,suffering lost work time, NHS costs and not least lives of fellow cyclists.\r\nMotoring by and confirming a road is not defective is to miss the very defects that kill cyclists.",
