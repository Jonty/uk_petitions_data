        "action": "Legally mandate all large vehicles to have an external CCTV system",
        "additional_details": "I would like to see the government make it a legal requirement for all vehicles with a wheelbase greater than 2 metres, or with obstructed view (i.e. small vans and transit vans) to be fitted with external camera systems with visual displays in the cab. This would provide 360 degree visibility to the driver helping prevent needless deaths on our roads. Rear stickers warning of a vehicle's blind spot are a clear admission that they are dangerous and not fit for purpose, and are not good enough.",
        "background": "Too many cyclists and pedestrians are being killed on Britain's roads by large vehicles and busses. This is an especially big problem in London where to date 18 people have been killed on the roads, at least 7 of those by lorries or coaches. The technology is available and cheap enough to install.",
