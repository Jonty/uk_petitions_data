        "additional_details": "CPR being taught in schools in the physical development classes would benefit everyone living in the UK.

Not enough people know how to give CPR and I believe it should be something everyone knows how to do. More people could be saved....",
        "background": "After a recent event that caused me to use CPR out of hospital (I am life support trained) and discussions with my close friends and family afterwards I have come to realise that many people do not have any idea on how to give CPR or any basic life support at all. This is a scary thought. ",
