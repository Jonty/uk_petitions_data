        "additional_details": "Jo Boaler, professor of maths education at Stanford University, believes getting children to be tested in this way will increase maths anxiety.\r\n\r\nShe said that although some children were fine with timed tests, others weren't. But she said the message of timed tests was that being able to memorise things quickly was the same thing as being good at maths.\r\n\r\n\u201cGovernments saying everybody has to memorise their times tables to 12x12 is absolutely disastrous,\" she added.",
        "background": "Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has announced that pupils will be subjected to yet more relentless testing as they'll be expected to know all tables up to 12x12, with the skill being measured using a new examination to be rolled out in 2017. ",
