The result was in fact a net obligation to the EU of \u00a3136 million per week. This sum whilst appearing large to the man in the street is insignificant when one considers the weekly cost of the UK pension payments stated at \u00a392 billion - that is just under \u00a32 BILLION per week. As a percentage the EU cost 6.8 % of pension cost ",
