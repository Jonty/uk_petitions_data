        "additional_details": "The MHRA is the government body which licences medicines in the UK, it has been criticised for many years because it is closely linked to several of the big pharma companies. \r\nThis link and influence adversely affects the options available to patients in the UK. \r\nWe call on the Department of Health and Minister Jeremy Hunt MP to exclude pharmaceutical influence and control.\r\n",
        "background": "We call for UK patients to have access to cheaper alternative treatments and natural therapies. \r\nBig Pharmaceutical corporations exert control over UK healthcare, as a result, many inexpensive but effective treatments are not licensed in the UK, denying patients of choice!
