        "additional_details": "I had my 1st cervical screening at 25, i had asked to have one previously through personal issues but got refused for being to young. My results from my 1st screening came back and i got told i had a 50% chance of already having cervical cancer after a few weeks wait and tests i was fortunate to have NOT had cancer however i know this result can be different for so many other people at such a  young age. Its optional to go for your screening now so it can still be optional with the age lowered.",
        "background": "I want the age of cervical screening to be lowered from 25 years of age to 18 years of age, 7 years can make so much of a difference to alot of people.",
