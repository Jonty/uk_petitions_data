In other cities the wait in weeks varies Lancaster 8, St Albans 11, Cambridge 13 and Nottingham, as Norwich, no dates until 2016. Newport its 7 weeks whilst at Pwllheli there are no dates. In Scotland the wait at Inverness is 8 weeks half an hour away in Alness there are no appointments until 2016. The Motor Schools Association call upon government to resolve this inequality quickly.",
        "background": "The current situation where, in some parts of GB, the waiting times for driving tests is just 6 weeks, while in other places, such as Norwich, no driving test appointments are available until 2016, is unacceptable. It is making it impossible for learner drivers to take training in a planned manner.",
