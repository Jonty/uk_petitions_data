            "details": "The Winter Fuel Payment is a cash lump sum paid to people over the qualifying age for Pension Credit to help with winter heating costs.  Cold Weather Payments (CWPs) are weekly payments of \u00a325 made to claimants of certain means-tested benefits during periods of very cold weather.  CWPs aren\u2019t limited to pensioners, and can be received by people on income-related ESA, whether in the Work-Related Activity Group or the Support Group.  But if a person only gets contributory ESA, they won\u2019t be eligible for CWPs.\r\n\r\nWe're therefore not sure what action you would like the Government to take. If you could explain more clearly, you could start a new petition. "
