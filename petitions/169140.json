At the end of the day these food could have been collected and distributed to those that are in need.1000's and 1000's of people across the globe dying of starvation where this food could have at least covered some percentage of poverty. \r\nIt is quite sad to see that you can regard recycling for a cleaner environment which is a good thing but you disregard feeding a human being in need of food. Ban shops/hotels from throwing food. ",
        "background": "Plenty of big supermarket chains and hotels throwing away good food either because the packaging  is torn or nearing its sell by date. \r\nThe hotels are throwing away breakfast and other meal buffets because they were not eaten on that day. I mean what harm would it do to feed the poor and homeless. ",
