        "additional_details": "There is no magic cure for muscle spasms. There are certain medicines such as Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Baclofen ect but many patients do not benefit from them orally. To treat severe muscle spasms, many patients are offered the insertion of a Baclofen Pump instead. A recent cost analysis by the MS Foundation has found that it is cheaper to prescribe Savitex than insert and regularly maintain a Baclofen pump. Savitex trials have proved positive in reducing muscle spasms. Please support our campaign - it is cost effective. MS sufferers are allowed the drug why can't all people suffering with neurological conditions in the UK have access to it ?",
        "background": "The Welsh NHS have authorised the use of Savitex medicinal cannabis for MS sufferers only in Wales to treat muscle spasticity. However, there are many people in the UK with other neurological conditions such as Cervical Myelopathy and Myelomalacia who also suffer with severe muscle spasms.",
