        "additional_details": "The government has committed to undertaking a wholescale review of the impact of LASPO by April 2018. We support Amnesty's call  for the review to commence immediately and for the government to take steps to ensure the right of the most disadvantaged sectors of society to access justice is adequately protected. \r\n\r\nFor more information on the impact of legal aid cuts on access to justice, please see the Amnesty International report here: https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur45/4936/2016/en/",
        "background": "The government has dramatically reduced access to legal aid for tens of thousands of people in civil cases. In doing so it has stripped away a vital element of support for a fair and just legal system. Those hardest hit are some of the most disadvantaged and marginalised people in our society.",
