        "additional_details": "Many have described this decision as an overtly nationalist move, which designed to appeal to Scottish unionist and anti-European sentiment. It has been described by MP Elfyn Llwyd \u201cas a retrograde step\". Joan McAlpine has called it \"insensitive\". The government has recognized this for Northern Irish drivers who will be except from the initiative due to sensitivities over the flag. This petition calls for choice to be extended to all UK drivers licence holders, not just those in Northern Ireland",
        "background": "This July the British Government decided to add a Union Flag to new and replacement driving licences. Many UK driving licence holders see their identity as being primarily English, Welsh, Scottish or European, and object to having the addition of this national symbol driving licence.",
