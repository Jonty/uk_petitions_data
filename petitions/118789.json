        "action": "Reopen the Richardson Eating Disorder Service outpatients department (Newcastle)",
        "additional_details": "Due to NHS cut backs, the REDS team have lost all of their outpatient care and now only operate a day service for patients. The unit can only hold around 30 patients and once discharged they receive no outpatient community care. The BMI criteria has also been lowered so now unless patients have a bmi of <16 cannot be seen by professionals. Patients cannot be left without outpatient support as the risk of relapse is high. The funding must be raised so the outpatients department can be reopened.",
        "background": "The North East of England has the highest proportion of eating disorders, yet it has little to no support for treatment. Recently the NHS pulled funding on the REDS outpatient department for eating disorders in Newcastle so vulnerable adults now cannot receive community support.",
