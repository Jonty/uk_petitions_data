Those that hurt animals should be subject to a full psychological examination, and should be sentenced to a jail term to reflect upon the harm they did to an innocent and defenceless creature. ",
        "background": "A small pup, was kicked and punched, leaving him with a broken neck and leg. The  youths who brutalised him then set him on fire, fed him drugs and dumped him in a rubbish tip in Margate, Kent.  The sentence given was a 5 year ban on keeping animals.  \r\n\r\nThis heinous crime warranted a jail term. ",
