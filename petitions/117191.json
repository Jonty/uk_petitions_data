        "additional_details": "Patented in 1867, barbed wire has also been used in violence against humans and was the method used to detain prisoners in concentration camps in the Boer War in 1899 and by the Nazis in concentration camps in the 1930s and 1940s (Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nIt's time to ban the use of this diabolical method of human and animal restraint.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "After seeing the injuries suffered by my dog after he ran into barbed wire, I and all signatories of this petition call upon the UK government to ban its use. Barbed wire is dangerous to many animals, including horses, foxes, badgers, birds and bats as well as domestic animals and 'livestock'. ",
