        "action": "STOP reducing Revenue Support Grant to Councils. Provide adequate funding.",
        "additional_details": "Councils have to have a 'balanced' budget. Therefore, to achieve this the cuts to local services across the country will be so drastic and services such as transport, road repairs and potholes, children's centres, libraries, citizen's advice bureaux, local welfare support, house related support, community safety, fire & rescue, youth services, heritage will be affected. In fact, the list is endless. Please sign the petition to let the Government know you are not happy about this.",
        "background": "The Government have, since coming to power in 2010, consistently cut the grants to local councils (district, county and unitary). The main grant that councils relied on was the Revenue Support Grant (RSG). However, over the next 4 years the government intends to virtually eliminate the RSG. ",
