        "additional_details": "Currently UK law states that no one under the age of 18 is allowed to buy, shoot or handle an air rifle and that they must be locked away in a robust cupboard and pellets ideally kept separately.  Clearly though this does not deter improper use of rifles and irresponsible users to shoot where serious, injury, maiming or even death can occur. ",

My children play in the same garden this horrific act of cruelty took place we ask for tighter rules for fear of further tragedy to ours or other families",
