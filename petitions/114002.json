        "action": "Re-assess the decision to freeze the student loan repayment threshold until 2021",
        "additional_details": "When the last government introduced top-up fees, it said the \u00a321,000 threshold to pay back student loans would increase each year in line with average earnings. Now, this figure has been frozen, meaning graduates will end up paying back more; similar to a bank changing the T&Cs of your loan after you'd taken it out.\r\n\r\nThe Department for Business, Innovation and Skills revealed 84% of students consulted voted against the notion. To go ahead with these plans despite this would be undemocratic.",
        "background": "In his Autumn statement, The Chancellor announced his decision to freeze the student loan repayment threshold for 5 years despite their own government consultation showing an 84% vote against the idea. This will leave graduates \u00a32,800 worse off than expected when they first took out their loans.",
