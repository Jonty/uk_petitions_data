        "action": "Don\u2019t spend billions on HS2,but on education and NHS as we matter more than HS2.",
        "additional_details": "I have got all my evidence from reliable sources, such as dependable newspapers and the BBC. I hope that my small voice gets heard and people see that the value of education, Universities and the NHS is more important to fund than a train; money is tight so lets spend it on something that will affect the greater good.\r\n\r\nLet's see if an ordinary voice can be heard.",
        "background": "I want action because I think that lives matter more than a 42.6 billion train. I want action because I know that the heart of the Chilterns is about to be ripped out. I want action as I know that schools' funding has been cut, University prices are soaring, and people rely on a dying NHS.",
