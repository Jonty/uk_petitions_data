        "additional_details": "The application process can be found under this link:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate/how-to-apply\r\nAs can be seen the panel may require further \"proof\" that you are living in the role. Despite sending a plethora of information and evidence this panel can decide to refuse your application.\r\n Under conclusions & recommendations of the Transgender Equality report para 7 recommends trans people are allowed to determine their own gender. This needs to happen in this parliament\r\n",
        "background": "Currently the only way for UK person to change their gender is for them to apply to the Gender Recognition Panel. It costs them \u00a3140 for the privilege of having to do this. The panel can then turn around and refuse the legal recognition. Even if they have had surgery and lived in the role years.",
