        "action": "Make all technical sporting goods in the UK tax free to encourage participation",
        "additional_details": "The Olympic success in 2012 and 2016 has shown that the UK has the ability to be a great sporting nation. We should encourage more sporting participation and a healthier lifestyle by allowing tax free purchases on all technical sporting goods and not just for those in full time employment. Clothing would be exempt but hardware would be tax free. E.G bicycles, helmets, running trainers, weight training equipment, trekking poles, climbing equipment etc anything which encourages sporting activity.",
        "background": "Cycling has increased in popularity immensely since the success of the 2012 Olympics and due to the Government's cycle to work scheme allowing tax free purchasing of cycle equipment. I would like to see all technical sporting goods to be tax free to encourage more people to take up sport in the UK.",
