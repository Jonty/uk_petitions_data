        "additional_details": "All that needs to be done is ban and make the process illegal. Perhaps many people wont sign this petition due to the fact that they are the ones who buy extra tickets when they finally get through to purchase some. If everyone had to upload a photo of themselves which is printed onto the ticket even if if cost extra, then this would surely bring an end to the misery caused to the nations genuine fans who just want to see their idols and shows ",
        "background": "It is becoming ever more impossible for genuine fans to buy the tickets that they set their heart on getting. All because of greedy touts bombarding ticketing websites with bots and hundreds of accounts to snap up tickets and resale them on at a massive profit. Maybe introduce photo id tickets only",
