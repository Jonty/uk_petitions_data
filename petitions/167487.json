        "action": "Make using all types of snare trap illegal in the UK",
        "additional_details": "A free-running snare is supposed to slacken when the animal stops struggling, while a self-locking snare can only become tighter. The frantic struggles of the trapped animal can quickly cause the wire to knot so that it tightens and the animal dies of strangulation.  It would be illegal to kill any domestic animal by such a method but the welfare of wild animals is not protected by the law to the same extent. The traps are inhumane and there are many other humane, safer traps on the market. ",
        "background": "It is currently legal to use a free running snare in England, but is illegal to use a self locking snare. Free running snares cause horrible injuries to animals and often trap and kill domestic animals. When placing these traps no one can guarantee which animal will get caught and potentially die. ",
