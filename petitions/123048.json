        "additional_details": "Recently I told a traffic warden in Burnley that the lines on Hall Street were illegal. He responded by saying \"It's irrelevant\" Wardens are over zealous and breaking the law in order to make money for the council. It is breaking the law and there seems to be no one who can bring them to task.",
        "background": "Lancashire County Council issued me with 2 over 11 years, both were challenged and cancelled because of illegal road markings. Traffic wardens are trained in the law. If they are trained then they know the lines are illegal and are committing fraud when they issue tickets. It is a money making scam.",
