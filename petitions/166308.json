She has distanced herself from the 100 million pound a week extra for the NHS, and now she is saying we may still pay money into the European Union after Brexit despite being no longer a member. This is unacceptable and if you had said this in your race for number 10 you may not even be in office right now.\r\n\r\nGive the people what they voted for not what we have now with no membership to Europe Brexit means Brexit!!",
