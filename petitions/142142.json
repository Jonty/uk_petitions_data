        "additional_details": "The good thing about the Norway model or EEA is that it protects the rights of people here and Brits abroad, and keeps access to the Single Market while leaving behind some of the more contentious bits of the EU (like CAP). Plus if you are someone who wants a more radical break with the EU, it provides the stability Britain needs to negotiate that too. This should be the common sense middle ground we can all unite behind for the time being.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adamsmith.org/blog/time-for-the-eea-option",
        "background": "Markets are panicking over our future trade relationship with the EU. EU citizens living in the UK are worried about their future status here. We urgently need a plan to calm the situation. Leaving the EU but staying in the European Economic Area (EEA) is the best compromise for now.",
