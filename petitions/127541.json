Think about that: ONE CHILD PER WEEK KILLED BY THEIR PARENT(s).  Source:http://straightstatistics.fullfact.org/article/how-many-children-are-murdered-britain-every-year\r\nIn a supposedly civilised society, this simply cannot go on.  The government need to do whatever it takes - spend whatever is required - to make sure this never happens again",

I'm calling on the Government to substantially increase the resources allocated to child social care and child protection, to try to make sure it never happens again",
