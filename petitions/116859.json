        "additional_details": "Many terrorist suspects have entered the EU as refugees. They have later used the freedom of movement agreement to gain access to the UK, France to plan acts of terror. Whilst this crisis continues, we should restrict freedom of movement to only those born in the EU.  Whilst this measure will not eradicate the threat completely, it will improve security the UK against the recent threat posed by ISIL and allow the UK to better control which refugees it accepts in the UK",
        "background": "Whilst there is a very real risk of terrorist organisations penetrating UK borders after being given citizenship by member EU states, the UK government should restrict freedom of movement to only those citizens that are Europeans by birth. Any exceptions would need to apply for a visa to gain entry",
