        "additional_details": "Under the new code all broadcast and non-broadcast political adverts should require approval for public dissemination PRIOR to being launched. There is not time during a campaign for the public to complain about a false claim or discriminatory material, and to have it removed. By then, too many people may already have been influenced by a lie. The consequences of misleading and/or hateful messages are too grave for us not to take pre-emptive action.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Following the lies and racial hatred disseminated in the recent referendum, we call on John Whittingdale, the Electoral Commission and the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), to work together to develop a new code to regulate broadcast and non-broadcast political campaigning in the UK.",
