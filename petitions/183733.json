He cannot now chair the 20th February debate as he cannot call to speak MPs in a fair and balanced way. \r\nJohn Bercow also dispensed with the constitution by not liaising with the speaker of the House of Lords before his outburst., and has brought the position of Speaker into disrepute.",
        "background": "John Bercow has said that President Trump should not be invited to speak in the Houses of Parliament. Irrespective of your views on Trump, John Bercow has overstepped the mark as Speaker and should stand down. This power to veto democratically elected leaders must be stripped from both speakers.\r\n",

However, we're not sure how you would like these decisions to be taken - whether by the Lord Great Chamberlain alone, or by some other body or person. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
