        "action": "Allow charities to create drug consumption rooms for over 18's.",
        "additional_details": "We believe that this will reduce the harm caused by drugs, as well as allowing addiction specialist to offer help to those who need it more easily. This policy has proved highly successful in countries around the world, including Canada and the Netherlands. This harm reduction policy would save the NHS money, help people recover addiction as well as preventing the negative social effect, such as drug taking near children.",
        "background": "We wish for the creation of a legal licencing system that would allow charities to create drug consumption rooms, were adults can legally take drugs in the presence of a doctor. In these rooms we wish for harm reduction provisions, such as providing syringes or other 'clean' and 'safe' paraphernalia",
