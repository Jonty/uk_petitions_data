        "additional_details": "Prior to the result being announced, 22 people (BBC News website, 26th June 2016) had signed a petition for a 2nd EU Referendum IF a winning margin & voting threshold were not reached. Over 3 days, 3.4 million people have signed the petition, with the result known. Whilst we agree a certain margin & voting threshold is useful in elections it was not applied to the EU Referendum, so the result should be recognised. Otherwise, the whole idea of the democratic will of the people is in jeopardy.",
