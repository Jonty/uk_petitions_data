        "additional_details": "3 million unsafe abortions for 15 to 19 year old girls are carried out each year, the World Health Organisation estimates, leading to lasting health problems and, in some cases, the mother\u2019s death.\r\n\r\nCampaigners fear the ban will choke off funding for maternal health services and work to combat Aids, malaria and the Zika virus.\r\n\r\nThe Department for International Development must continue its work in promoting the health and education of poor women around the world and contribute to this fund.",
        "background": "Donald Trump has reinstated a rule that bans international NGOs with US funding from providing abortions or offering any information about the same.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government is leading an international campaign to raise $600m (\u00a3480m) to compensate for the Trump administration\u2019s ban.",
