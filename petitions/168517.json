        "additional_details": "A lot of my teachers are unsure what to teach so suddenly with these new specifications. How are we supposed to achieve and excel with even our teachers not being sure on what we need to know? A one to two year gap until it is taught will ensure teachers can prepare properly, rather than a sudden change. Grades 9-1 are hard to distinguish for students, parents, teachers, and even employers. Did they really need to change so suddenly?",
        "background": "Since Year 7, we have been taught under curriculum supporting the old GCSE system. Now, we are suddenly being forced to suddenly change this, and this means students are already struggling and are less likely to reach their full potential.This is affecting our futures and it needs to change.
