        "additional_details": "On Thusday 23/06, 72.2% of those eligible to vote placed their votes in the EU Referendum. Results were subsequently announced on 24/06 and showed that 52% of those who voted had voted to leave the UK whilst the remaining 48% had voted to remain. If either side achieved over 50% they would be considered as the majority and hence win the referendum. These figures are actually a misrepresentation of the British public. In reality, 52% of our total population have not voted to leave. The actual results are actually as follows:\r\n\r\nVote to leave - 37.54%\r\nVote to remain - 34.66%\r\nDidn't vote - 27.8%\r\n\r\nOnly 37.54% of our population actually voted to leave.\r\n\r\nI feel the result is fundamentally incorrect. The British public are being lied to, and this is something we will not tolerate.",
