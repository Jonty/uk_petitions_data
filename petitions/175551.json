        "additional_details": "The inquiry will rate the viability & outlook for each deal plainly.\r\nIt will report within a timely period.\r\nIt will also propose solutions to the concerns of all voters.\r\nSuch as:\r\n* Local government powers/funding to manage migration growth within the UK internally.\r\n* Dual UK/EU citizenship application.\r\n\r\nThe referendum will provide a distinct range of Brexit deals: hard to soft to halt brexit.\r\n\r\nPlease complete both actions before triggering a break-up.\r\nThis applies to all UK territory & countries",
        "background": "If the vote to Brexit starts either:\r\nThe break up of the UK, or\r\nSeparate EU treaties for separate UK countries.\r\n\r\nThen Brexit will not cover the whole UK, as voted on.\r\n\r\nSave our unity by:\r\nAn independent Public Inquiry into Brexit Viability, and then:\r\nA Referendum on the Brexit Deal.",
