        "additional_details": "In 2016 Train Drivers hold the country to ransom whenever they want a pay bump, or even more favourable conditions. The average transport for London driver earns \u00a355k, in the south, the average is \u00a339k. No part of their job requires a human. It's time for progress, guarantee these people jobs until retirement, hire no new drivers - and slowly automate away the skill gap so that the current drivers don't suffer, but that no drivers can come along to make the rest of the country suffer.",
        "background": "It is ludicrous in 2016 that huge swathes of the country should be held to ransom by union action over something as silly as who controls the doors - personnel are paid far too much to press a button and move a lever. The technology has existed since the 70s to automate all of this.",
