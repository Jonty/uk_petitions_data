        "action": "Re-open the railway line between Matlock, Bakewell, Buxton and Manchester.",
        "additional_details": "A feasibility study was carried out in the past and although financially unviable at the time, a decade has now passed and it's a whole different situation. Passenger numbers have grown astronomically, all but one of the stations along the current Derwent Valley Line have seen passenger numbers more than double over this time. Rail travel is also in demand more than ever. Tourism and the local economy would undoubtedly be boosted in the town of Bakewell, as well as other areas the route covers.",
        "background": "We need an efficient and environmentally friendly transport network for the future and increasing reliance on energy hungry private vehicles is poor sense in a world with finite resources. Furthermore reopening this line can only be good for the economy of the local area and bring more tourists.",
