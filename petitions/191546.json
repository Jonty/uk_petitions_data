        "additional_details": "We call upon Mrs May and the Westminster government to re-evaluate and rescind the develoution agreements within the whole of the UK.   We the people feel Devolution has failed, not just in Scotland where the Scottish government has misused the power given, causing friction between the people of the United Kingdom.    In Northern Ireland the assembly recently collapsed, and  nobody knows what purpose the Welsh Assembly  serves.   The Lord Mayor of London is acting like a dictator while demanding more devolved powers.  New elected Mayors are springing up all over the Country paving the way for devolved regions.  We the people of the UK,  request that all regional assemblies are dissolved and all powers be brought back to Westminster again.  ",
