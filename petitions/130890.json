        "action": "Increase government expenditure to antibiotic research",
        "additional_details": "By 2030, antibiotics will be almost completely ineffective, and by 2050, around 10 million people could die yearly. That's even more than cancer alone. These statistics are shocking, but will become a harsh and brutal reality if we do not take action. Already within the UK, 5,000 people die from antibiotic resistant infections in a year, according to Antibiotic Research UK. We need to take action now, if not for us, then for future generations to come. We're the only ones who can prevent it.",
        "background": "Antibiotic resistance is becoming a major problem and threat to human life as we know it. With the abuse of these drugs, they're starting to become ineffective and   infections are becoming resistant to even the strongest antibiotics. We need to increase expenditure to avoid the inevitable.",
