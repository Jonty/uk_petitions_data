        "additional_details": "As a Merseyside resident working for an organisation in the Halton Borough why should I be asked to fund an extra \u00a31080 per year to go to my place of work. My employed will not cover these costs and I pay the same amount of road tax, fuel tax and VAT as somebody living in Halton who maybe commutes to Liverpool. \r\nThis is unjust and will leave me unable to continue with my employer of 15 years. ",
        "background": "The new Mersey Gateway crossing is expected to be completed in 2017. The government have already declared that Halton Residents can benefit from free unlimited crossing. This should be extended to cover everybody. Residents of neighbouring Merseyside use the bridge to commute to jobs in Halton.",
