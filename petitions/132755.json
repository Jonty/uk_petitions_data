        "additional_details": "Whilst it has been illegal to use a handheld mobile phone when driving since 2003, there is significant research that shows motorists continue to use their devices incorrectly:\r\n\r\n- 95% of motorists stated that they regularly see other drivers looking at their phones in stationary traffic \r\n\r\n- DoT figures show that motorists using their phones were involved in 3,611 crashes between 2009 and 2014. \r\n\r\n- 1 in 5 UK motorists admit accessing social networking sites on their mobile phone while driving.  \r\n",
        "background": "The most recent awareness campaign was in 2012; since then the role of devices in our lives has hugely increased.\r\n\r\nWe believe a national safety campaign should be created that clearly and memorably restates the law and highlights the dangers and impact of using a hand-held device when driving.\r\n\r\n",
