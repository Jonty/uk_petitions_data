        "additional_details": "There is a wind turbine in the hands of local planning at the moment and this one is going to be built in the middle of a lovely landscape. None of the electricity produced will be used by the person/s as they live miles and miles away instead they will just be getting lots of money from the FIT estimated roughly at \u00a3220000 per year all paid for by tax payers  ",
        "background": "Stand alone wind turbines are getting taller (75 - 125 metres tall ) being built close to small picturesque villages. They are far too tall, harm the local wildlife, over bearing and make people feel uneasy (akin to a bully standing over your shoulder). The Feed In Tariff is far too generous.   ",
