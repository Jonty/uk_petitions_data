        "additional_details": "My mum was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma 2 yrs ago after 6 yrs of symptoms and numerous misdiagnoses. she was given 2 Weeks to live a yr ago but still fights on.Mums diagnosis came too late for her to have life lengthening surgery,and at every turn we are told there is nothing that can be done. Many Drs haven't even heard of the illness.No trials are ongoing for a cure because \"drugs companies won't make enough money due to the relatively small number of people with the disease\"",
