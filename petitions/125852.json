        "additional_details": "Corporation tax dates from a time when the biggest enterprises were steel works and railways, not search engines and social networks. We should stop complaining about tax havens and become one.",
        "background": "Corporation tax is as outdated as window tax. Only small and poor companies pay it, the big and rich companies do not. It is a pointless, optional tax that diverts brainpower away from constructive applications. Scrap it. A land value tax of 1% will bring in more money and cannot be dodged.",
