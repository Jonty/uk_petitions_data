        "additional_details": "This isn't the first time. While the government may defend their position, claiming to have made measures reducing tax avoidance, these companies agreed to a rate of tax when they began trading here, and should pay it.\r\n\r\nWhile small to medium sizes business pay their fair share, and the self employed are penalised with fines should they fail to pay, big business such as Amazon, Google, Starbucks and numerous others get away with paying a greatly reduced sum.",
        "background": "George Osborne has just negotiated a reported 3% tax rate for Google. Amounting to a \u00a3130 million tax bill for a company which made \u00a36 billion in profits in the UK between 2005 and 2015.\r\n\r\nIn this age of austerity, we need individuals and big business to pull their weight.",
