        "additional_details": "We see healthy eating campaigns, flu jab campaigns and no smoking, why not have posters asking if we need a \"mind check-up\" too? It's just as important as a flu jab, and could truly reduce NHS costs, as the problem is tackled before it grows into something more serious.",
        "background": "The government claim to care about mental health. Now it's time they proved it. We believe that every NHS patient should be made aware of the help on offer, and directly offered an assessment, so that they know the option is there. This will help to remove the stigma attached to asking for help.",
