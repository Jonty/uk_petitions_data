We were waiting for case notes as to the reason why and it normally says takes 4-6 weeks which it has gone over and there is a deadline date to appeal their decision. I believe that my wife being Russian and my son, this may have something to do with their nationality. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fightformorrisonfamily/",
