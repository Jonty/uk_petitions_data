        "action": "Give British Transport Police Officer's equal powers as Home Office colleagues",
        "additional_details": "The public, when they see a police officer make no distinction between police force. Officers seek to protect the public and this is what the public expects. Having a visible police force with 'second rate' powers risks damaging public confidence in policing as they may not be able to intervene effectively.\r\n\r\nThis amendment would give security to BTP officers who are acting in the public interest to prevent and detect crime as well as ensuring good order in society. \r\n\r\n",
        "background": "BTP officers have limited Jurisdiction dealing with matters non rail related. BTP officers are trained to the same standards as Home Office Colleagues and often assist in mutual aid scenarios. In order to protect the public, and BTP Officers, this petition proposes parity with Home Office powers. ",
