        "action": "Stop plans to turn every state school in England into an academy.",
        "additional_details": "There is no evidence that academies make any difference to the success or failure of a school in the main. There are good and bad state schools and there are good and bad academies. The difference is that academies are profit driven and the lie that they give 'freedom and autonomy' to schools can't be ignored. If a school has freedom to do what it likes, then they would be allowed to scrap SATs, scrap needless testing and drumming in of irrelevant learning. Teachers, parents and educational experts have not voted for this and have had no say in this. ",
        "background": "Education and profit should never be mixed. State schools should be run at a local level by local authorities who understand the issues in their area, who work together with other childhood experts (mental health, special needs etc) to create inclusive, fair and decent education for all.
