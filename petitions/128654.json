        "action": "Allow shotgun certificate holders of ages 15+ to purchase their own firearms.",
        "additional_details": "Counter productive to this, it is required that a certifcate holder over the age of 18 to purchase the items for them, this can be a problem for potential young shooters who would like to get involved in the shooting sports but doesn't know anyone over the age of 18 who possess a valid shotgun certificate. I am proposing the lowering of the law to purchase a shotgun and ammunition to 15 which is the legal age for possession, when accompanied by their parent/guardian who signed their certificate.",
        "background": "The law currently states that a shotgun certificate holder can own and possess, a shotgun and ammunition from the age of 15.",
