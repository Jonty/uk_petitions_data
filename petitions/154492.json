        "additional_details": "It is proposed that a referendum shall be binding on the Government if either of the following criteria is met:\r\n- The votes for the winning side total at least 50% of the total number of those eligible to vote plus one, or\r\n- The winning side is supported by simple majorities in at least three of the four home nations, and by at least two-thirds of the total votes cast.\r\nIn all other cases, the Government shall be required to take note of the result of the referendum, but is not bound by it.\r\n",
        "background": "The EU Referendum highlighted the problems of using this democratic tool in the U.K,: a small majority, rejection by two home nations, and purely advisory in nature.\r\nThis vagueness, uncertainty, and unfairness is plainly unsatisfactory and must be addressed before any future referenda are held.",
