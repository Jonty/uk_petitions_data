        "background": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap#Rugby_union\r\nThe elite tier of club rugby in England has operated a \"salary cap\" since the late-1990s, as a method of keeping overall costs down and to ensure parity between teams so wealthy teams cannot entrench dominance by signing many more top players.",
