        "action": "Remove the 2026 deadline for claiming historic rights of way",
        "additional_details": "Under the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 rights of ways had been recorded through village council led surveys often omitting historic routes. Under Sections 53 to 56 of the CRoW Act 2000 all unrecorded pre-1949 rights of way have to be registered by 2026 or shall be lost.",
        "background": "In 1949 rights of way were surveyed however many routes had been left off the map due to a pro-farming consensus. Our paths have developed over centuries yet shall be lost if not claimed by 2026. Therefore I propose to remove the deadline and encourage government to take an active role in recording.",
