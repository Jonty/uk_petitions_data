        "additional_details": "Obama lied about the deal as everyone knows.His clueless foreign policy is just to gain him anything of a legacy but he clearly understands nothing about the roots of terror and cares nothing about Israel's security. But our government should know better than to always bow to Obama. Phillip Hammond made a fool out of himself by trying to deny Iran wants to destroy Israel. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown would never have signed this deal and the Tories dare to claim they are more pro-Israel than them",
        "background": "The deal is a bad one, as everyone knows. It allows Iran to obtain nuclear weapons and missiles even quicker, thus endangering the security of Israel and the rest of the world. We want an end to this shameful and dangerous mistake at once.",
