        "additional_details": "Results of a study examining 1530 incidents of resuscitation attempts following sudden cardiac arrest (\"Resuscitation\", Vol 78:3 (Sep 2008), p. 275-280):\r\n- where a public access defibrillator was used, in 26% of these cases the patient recovered well enough to eventually be discharged from hospital.\r\n- where defibrillation did not occur until the arrival of medical personnel, in less than 3% of these cases did the patient recover well enough to eventually be discharged from hospital.",
        "background": "It has been proven that someone who has a sudden cardiac arrest is much more likely to survive if they receive early defibrillation than CPR alone. A national database of publicly accessible AEDs would allow bystanders to quickly locate the nearest one and improve the patient's chances of survival.",
