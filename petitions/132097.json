        "additional_details": "ABP was formerly the British Transport Docks Board.  Other industries formerly in the public sector have legal duties to consider historic buildings (e.g. in Water Industry Act 1991, section 3 and Electricity Act 1989, Schedule 9).  The law should be changed so that ABP (and other bodies formerly in the public sector) are subject to similar duties.",
        "background": "Grimsby was once the largest fishing port in the world.  Associated British Ports (ABP) is demolishing the 19th century buildings at the heart of the historic port of Grimsby.  ABP have permitted development rights - no planning application is needed.  ",
