        "action": "Move the UK government to a Northern city. Westminster needs massive renovation.",
        "additional_details": "Westminster refurbishment creates a golden opportunity to move UK government to Sheffield, Leeds, Manchester, Liverpool or another suitable location. The effect of moving the UK government to a Northern city will be to create a true and lasting Northern powerhouse through the building of airport, rail & road infrastructure and the services needed to support them. It will create lasting employment in all sectors & through wealth creation will lead to a more financially balanced United Kingdom.",
        "background": "The UK is suffering from the fact that many issues that are important are  centred on the Southern part of it. Scotland wants to break away from the union. The need to refurbish the Palace of Westminster means that moving government can re-balance the nation both politically and financially.",
