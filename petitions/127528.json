        "action": "Provide safe, secure parking for HGVs with decent facilities at reasonable cost",
        "additional_details": "Drivers are required by law to take daily rest periods of 9-11 hours and rest breaks of up to 45 minutes. Due to the high cost of MSA parking and poor security many companies can't or won't pay and leave drivers to risk parking up in laybys and industrial estates. This leaves them at risk of being hit by passing high speed traffic, assaulted and robbed, and fuel and goods being stolen from the vehicle. There are no facilities in these locations for basic needs such as going to the toilet and  washing.",
        "background": "We need more dedicated HGV parking in secure, fenced locations with cameras and security and decent facilities without breaking the bank. The motorway services charge over \u00a320 a night and offer poor quality facilities and a potholed bit of tarmac to park on. ",
