        "additional_details": "To The Rt Hon Stephan Crabb MP\r\n I would like to have the inconsistencies addressed for war disablement pension to be disregarded altogether as income as this is compensation awarded to the injured party and not a standard pension or income. All these issues have been addressed under the new universal credit scheme and is now left to a 'postcode lottery' as to whether our war veterans are put in hardship or not.",
        "background": "Soldiers/veterans injured receive say \u00a371.00 per week and claims ESA the DWP only allow \u00a310 and take the rest away. This is compensation given due to injury and to have it removed when others on DLA are not effected or those on Universal Credits are not effected but those still on ESA suffer.",
