Now is the time to design a 2nd Avonmouth crossing, take local traffic for Portishead off at junction 18 (or use a design similar to J5-6, M20), bulldoze Gordano services, redesign junction 19, put in SMART motorway, widen the carriageways and if necessary re-route the motorway for long distance traffic from junction 15 to a new junction 19A.",
        "background": "Due to the design of the Avonmouth Bridge, the 3 mile long queues to leave the M5 at junction 19 (Portishead) both morning and evening, repeated accidents between junctions 18 and 19, in part due to road design, inpart due to careless driving, life on the M5 is now intolerable.
