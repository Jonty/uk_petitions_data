        "additional_details": "My son was diagnosed with tongue tie at 9 weeks old at this point our local hospitals wouldn't treat him so as we were referred to a much further away hospital on a waiting list and by this point his weight gain was suffering, he was frustrated during feeds and I was in a lot of pain so we went private which isn't cheap. Because the tongue tie went so long undetected I now have damaged vessels in my breasts. If this was picked up in the early days we wouldn't have any of these issues. ",
        "background": "Lots of babies have tongue tie which gets missed so leads to problems with breastfeeding including low weight gain and pain for the mother. Sometimes it isn't detected until a late stage when hospitals will no longer treat baby. If baby is checked early a lot of problems can be avoided.",
