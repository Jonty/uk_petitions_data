The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. The concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to MPs who are not acting as Ministers. "
