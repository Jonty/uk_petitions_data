        "action": "Prioritise taking those seeking asylum from war zones, over other immigrants.",
        "additional_details": "Current UK immigration policy means that levels of immigration are reducing and the government is attempting to cap these. \r\n\r\nOur aim: to reduce the levels of illegal immigration and therefore the profits of criminal enterprises that smuggle people across the world, while choosing to save the lives of those in immediate danger abroad.\r\n\r\nDue to policy differences, we do not expect this petition will change immigration levels. Instead we would like to see asylum-seekers prioritised. ",
        "background": "The long-term aftermath of the Arab Spring rise of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria since have resulted in a massive crisis of the emergency migration of asylum-seekers.",
