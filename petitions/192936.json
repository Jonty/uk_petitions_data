        "additional_details": "At the last GE, labour lost its leadership, Lib dem lost its, conservatives lost its leadership at the referendum and ukip too has changed. What are the party manifestos now? It is has become clear that not even the conservatives, who have \"control\" since the GE, know their own manifesto - reflected by the budget and a few other recent items.",
        "background": "Since the last election, and compounded by the referendum, not one major party has the same leadership. A general election is critical to ensure democracy functions and all political parties clearly state their manifesto. This will ensure Brexit is navigated by a government voted in by the people.",
