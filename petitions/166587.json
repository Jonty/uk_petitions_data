        "additional_details": "Since 2014 when the Scottish people decided by an overwhelming majority to remain part of the UK we have been bombarded with threats of a second independence referendum by the SNP.\r\n\r\nThis does not only undermine democracy, but may also lead to economic trouble as businesses may not wish to invest in Scotland with such uncertainty hanging over its future. \r\n\r\nWe ask that Westminster assures us that any motion for a second Scottish Independence Referendum is blocked for at least a generation (25 yrs)",
        "background": "In 2014 Scotland had the option to become an independent country or continue to be part of the United Kingdom by way of a referendum. \r\nWhen we voted in this referendum we were told this would be our only chance in a generation and to vote wisely. \r\n55.3% of Scotland voted to remain part of the UK.",
