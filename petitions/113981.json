        "additional_details": "In many other countries, e.g. USA and most of the EU, there is a statue of limitations on when criminal proceedings can be brought agents a person. In the UK the only statue of limitations that we have are for \"summary only offences\" I would like to suggest that we have a statue of limitations period on all crimes, apart from murder, rape and anything related to the abuse, neglect, or taking advantage of children.\r\nThis will save a lot of money and also free up the police focus on current issues.",
        "background": "Introduce a limitation period to set the maximum time after an event when criminal legal proceedings and police actions may be initiated. There is currently only a limitation period for civl matters and not \"criminal offences\".",
