        "action": "Mandate our EU representatives veto further EU expansion instead of Brexit",
        "additional_details": "I have watched countless TV programmes interviewing the supporters and voters of the leave  campaign. This appears to be the main issue, with many saying that the migrants that are here should be allowed to stay. By mandating our power of veto, this would facilitate the UK staying in the EU, with the benefits it brings and stop the EU from expanding by increasing the member countries. ",
        "background": "Much of the leave campaign support seemed to surround the potential for Turkey and other countries joining the EU. Rather than leaving the EU, we should mandate that we use our power of veto to ensure that this does not happen.",
