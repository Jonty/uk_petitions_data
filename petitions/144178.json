        "action": "Decide not to trigger Article 50 prompting EU exit negotiations.",
        "additional_details": "Once Article 50 is triggered, the UK will be on a fast track to exiting the EU, most likely without a deal being agreed for future UK-EU relations. This will put us outside of the trading and free movement area. This will result in a long recession which will mean prolonged austerity and destruction of UK public services. UK citizens risk losing their right to live, work and study in the EU without restriction, while EU citizens in the UK suffer prolonged uncertainty over their future.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The referendum is advisory not legally binding on parliament. The result of the EU referendum shows a narrow majority for Leave over Remain. Some voters have expressed regret about voting Leave, while 28% did not vote.  Consequences of triggering Article 50 are likely to be devastating for the UK.\r\n",
