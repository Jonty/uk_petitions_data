        "additional_details": "England and Wales: Rape\r\n\r\n(1) A person (A) commits an offence if\u2014\r\n(a) he intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis,\r\n(b) B does not consent to the penetration, and\r\n(c) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.\r\n",
        "background": "Currently in the UK rape is an offence only a male can commit, as law states rape is a crime committed only with penile penetration. This means that any foreign object forced into a male or female can only be classed as sexual assult. We want this changed to a stricter law on what rape is.",
