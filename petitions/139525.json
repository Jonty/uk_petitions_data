        "additional_details": "The UK Statistics Authority told the Leave campaign the \u00a3350 million a week figure was misleading, Leave continued to use the figure. \r\n\r\nThe Leave campaign stated that the level of immigration is putting pressure on the NHS. Since the result a Leave MP has said that the Leave campaign wish to \"control\" immigration, not necessarily reduce it. \r\n\r\nUKIP used an image on a poster showing migrants crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border, with the phrase \"breaking point\" to imply they were entering Britain.",
