        "background": "David Cameron gave us, the British people, a vote to decide whether we remain in the EU or Leave it.\r\n\r\nWell the public voted and as we all know, the outcome was a majority in favour of leaving the EU. This wasn't a vote to renegotiate terms, nor was it a vote to hang around for a few months after!",
