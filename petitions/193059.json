There is a cycle track runnin parallel with the road, it should be used! This happens in a lot of places around the country",

When the cycle track is available it should be a legal requirement to use it, not to ride on the road at that point. The cycle track is only there on roads which are dangerous without it, this is a danger for bikes and cars!",
