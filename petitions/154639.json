        "additional_details": "There are reports that lawyers are working hard at finding ways to overturn the stated will of the people of Great Britain and that David Cameron's successor (whoever he or she may be) may not want to implement Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty for fear of making mistakes in negotiations with the EU and ruining their career. The will of the people of Great Britain has been asked for and, now that it has been stated, it should be honoured; David Cameron should do this now.",
        "background": "The will of the people of Great Britain has been asked for and given; it should be put into action without allowing delaying tactics, especially as there are people working at trying to overturn or delay it indefinitely and thus act without integrity.",
