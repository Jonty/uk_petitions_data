        "action": "Remove the pension 'triple-lock' to redistribute the burden of Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The triple-lock arrangement ensures that those receiving the Basic State Pension will receive an increased income commensurate with the inflation precipitated by voting to leave the EU.\r\n\r\nGiven the anticipated contraction in the economy following Brexit it's unlikely that the majority of taxpayers will see wages increase in line with inflation. The state pension is paid for by national insurance contributions, which come from the wages of people working today.",
        "background": "The electorate was split on the EU referendum: predominantly working age voters wish to remain, pension age voters wish to leave. It is unreasonable to expect those of working age to fund the pension increase guaranteed by the triple-lock when their incomes are expected to decline in real terms.",
