        "action": "Allow the registration of 15 year olds, enabling them eligibility to vote at 16",
        "additional_details": "Younger people are becoming increasingly interested in politics at a local, national and global level. It seems unfair that people under 18 should be excluded from a process that has implications on their lives and shapes their long term future. I am calling on the UK parliament to extend the right to vote to all 16 year olds. While recently campaigning, talking to young people indicated to me that they are showing a real enthusiasm and interest in how politics affects their lives.",
        "background": "Young people should be allowed to vote in all local and national elections and referendums. During the recent European referendum, an increasing amount of younger people were voicing frustration at not being allowed to take part in the democratic process. ",
