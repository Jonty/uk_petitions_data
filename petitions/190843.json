        "action": "Maintain the current first MOT date for cars at three years",
        "additional_details": "In 2016, the UK saw a fall in the number of road deaths. Attributed to improved vehicle safety, the current three-year first MOT identifies potentially fatal vehicle defects, including 47,000 brake failures that were detected on three-year-old cars at their first MOT. The three-year MOT has proven to be an important safety milestone. In 2011, TRL research revealed motorists would fail to properly maintain their vehicles without the pressure of a MOT deadline.",
        "background": "The current MOT system ensures vehicle defects are remedied quickly to ensure drivers\u2019 and other road users\u2019 safety. Around 17% of cars fail their first MOT on their initial attempt, so extending to four years will result in an extra 400,000 unsafe cars on the roads and risk higher accident rates.",
