        "additional_details": "Whilst inconsiderate people will continue to be litter louts, reintroducing a deposit scheme on aluminium, glass, and plastic drink containers may help reduce the large amount of carelessly discarded litter blighting our villages, towns, and cities.  Many areas now look more like rubbish dumps then neighbourhoods.  If there is an incentive to return these items in exchange for cash like was done in the good old, cleaner days maybe people who think twice about tossing these redeemable items on the ground.",
        "background": "The litter problem in the UK is getting worse and worse by the day with discarded takeaway and beverage containers being the majority of the items thrown everywhere but in bins. I for one am sick of it.",
