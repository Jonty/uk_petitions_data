        "action": "Stop the decline in high streets by ensuring equity in businesses.",
        "additional_details": "In many towns high rent and rates have sent many small businesses to the wall to be replaced by charity shops contributing little to the local economy getting free stock, using volunteer workers, getting breaks on rates etc. Coupled with the growth in online sales this means that it is harder for small businesses to compete. Giving new business the same breaks given to charity shops and ensuring online and retail business are treated the same way in terms of tax etc. would help small business. ",
        "background": "High streets in small towns in Britain are in decline. This is seen in the unoccupied premises and in the plethora of charity shops. While charity is important so is the diversity of the high street. Online business is also impacting on the high street.",
