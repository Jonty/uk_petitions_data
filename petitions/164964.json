        "additional_details": "\"Lane-hogging\" frustrates drivers, slows down traffic during busy times, and encourages dangerous \"undertaking\".\r\n\r\nDrivers in the UK receive no compulsory training for motorway driving, and knowing which lane to drive in on a motorway is not something which is obvious to many drivers.\r\n\r\nIt is very common to see the right lanes of a motorway full of cars, all travelling close together, way under the speed limit, while the far left lane is empty.\r\n\r\nThis simple sign could make a huge improvement.",
        "background": "In order to seriously improve the flow of traffic on UK motorways during busy periods, I propose to use the overhead variable message motorway signs to show the message \"Keep left unless overtaking.\"\r\n\r\nThis would promote better use of all lanes, and could improve safety, while reducing congestion.",
