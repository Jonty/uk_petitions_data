        "additional_details": "Microeconomics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources.\r\nIt differs from macroeconomics, which is a branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets. \r\nWith microeconomics, macroeconomics is one of the two most general fields in economics.",
        "background": "Understanding why we make the decisions we do makes an individual a better decision-maker.\r\nPeople make poor financial decisions every day, from payday loans to impulse purchases.\r\nEducating the young to make them better decision-making adults is an highly worthwhile investment in the future.",
