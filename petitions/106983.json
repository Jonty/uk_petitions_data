        "additional_details": "We make no judgement as to whether the refugees deserve asylum in the UK. All we suggest is that the problem can be solved by following the existing rules for granting or refusing asylum. Just in financial terms the impact on business has been huge, as has the cost of security, fences and fixing damage. Truck drivers and families run a gauntlet. Conditions in the camp are poor and charitable actions stave off the spread of disease. Whatever your political view, this must end.",
        "background": "The camp of around 5000 in Calais is causing problems for diverse groups including refugees, truck drivers, families and businesses. It could stop overnight. We propose safe transport for the refugees to the UK, processing of their asylum applications and then grant or refuse them asylum. ",
