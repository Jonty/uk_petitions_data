        "additional_details": "Fixing overcrowded railways will turn out way same as fixing overcrowded motorways, the more you build the more crowded they become. With driverless cars around the corner, let's jump a stage ahead and move commercial traffic to the railway system and focus on making commercial communication better with the best internet the world has seen so far.\r\nWe and the next wave of innovators would all benefit from the side effect of hyper fast and super efficient internet in ways not even thought of yet.",
        "background": "HS2 makes no difference to the vast majority and solves old world issues. The disruption over a long period make the cost uncertain, with little benefit to the vast majority of the public and industry. Let's build the very best internet instead and make the UK the worlds leading tech nation instead!",
