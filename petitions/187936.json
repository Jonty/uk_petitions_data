        "additional_details": "This statistic has a shocking survival rate of only 8%. During an out of hospital cardiac arrest, and a defibrillator is used within 3-5 minutes, the survival rate is increased from 8% to 74%.  \r\nI recently signed a petition for all Ryan air flights to have a defibrillator on board in case of a cardiac arrest, and it succeeded. So my aim for this petition is to raise awareness to the government and the individual train companies to obtain a defibrillator on each train. ",
        "background": "During a conversation with my dad (a guard for a midland train line) it was brought up that the trains do not have defibrillators on board, and train guards are not required to be first aid trained. Each year it is estimated that around 30,000 people suffer an out of hospital cardiac arrest.",
