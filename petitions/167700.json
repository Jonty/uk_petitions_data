        "additional_details": "Mark Carney presented wildly inaccurate forecasts on the impact of a \"Leave\" vote in the Brexit referendum as credible despite the evidence of hard facts to support them. Mark Carney continues to talk down the British economy's future prospects despite factual evidence to the contrary. Mark Carney actions on interest rate cuts and quantities easing are at complete odds with the factual data on the economy post the vote to \"Leave\" further damaging his credibility and that of his role of Governor.",
        "background": "Mark Carney's forecasts of wildly inaccurate future economic data post a \"Leave\" vote in the Brexit referendum and continued talking down of the British economy's prospects have damaged the credibility of the Bank of England and diminished the standing of the office of Governor of the BOE.",
