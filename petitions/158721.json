        "action": "Debate the motion that there shall be an early parliamentary general election",
        "additional_details": "This petition arises from the following circumstances:\r\n1. The party in power are electing a new leader, who, unless they intend to simply adopt the manifesto pledges of David Cameron, are seeking to follow a new agenda without a mandate.\r\n2. The official opposition are no longer able to form an alternative government and are in the midst of a crisis of legitimacy best resolved by putting the cases of the various factions to the electorate.\r\n3. And, damningly, no-one in elected office has a plan to cope with one of the only two possible outcomes of the most significant choice made by the electorate in over forty years.",
        "background": "This petition requests that the following motion, that there shall be an early parliamentary general election, be debated in Parliament. The provision for an early parliamentary general election is allowed for under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, Section 2, subsection 2.",
