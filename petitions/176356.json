        "additional_details": "As an ex NHS nurse, I remember when hospital car parks were free.  I can also remember, that when charges came into force, I had to claim the money back from the NHS when I was visiting a patient!\r\nMy local hospital Trust has collected over \u00a34m in car parking charges over the last year.  I am sure this money goes over and above the required amount to operate the car parks.  Scotland and Wales provide free car parking. There is a definate disparity in fairness and policy.\r\nWHY?",
        "background": "Scotland and Wales do not charge for parking at their NHS hospitals.  Why do England charge us to park for essential visits to hospital?\r\nPeople are being charged extortionate amounts to access healthcare when they have already paid taxes and National Insurance.",
