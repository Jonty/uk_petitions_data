        "additional_details": "How are the next generation supposed to get on the housing ladder. Massive private rents mean, no savings.  Therefore no deposit. And in many cases,  living hand to mouth. \r\nThe housing crisis could be eased, if rent wasn't allowed to be inflated by the greedy affluent property owners/developers. House prices would fall and settle at an affordable level.  And the greedy wouldn't want them so much if they weren't allowed to extort money from the less well off",
        "background": "It's time something was done about the astronomical prices of renting a house through a private landlord. Fat cats,are buying all the houses, then renting at inflated prices.  If it was capped in line with council rent. The housing crisis would be helped significantly.  ",
