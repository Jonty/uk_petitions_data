        "additional_details": "We call upon Parliament to change the legislation on fixed term parliaments to prevent the people being governed by a leadership in which only party members have had a say.  UNLESS: A general election has already been called, or would under the fixed term legislation, take place anyway within four months.  A General Election shall be called by the incoming leader of the governing party, who shall be installed as interim prime minister, to take place as soon thereafter as practicably possible.",
        "background": "A change in the leader of the party in Government, or the major partner in a coalition, resulting in a new Prime Minister being created without a popular vote, shall automatically trigger a General Election regardless of the other provisions of the law on fixed term parliaments or party expediency.",
