There is also a risk that the threat of deportation causes migrants in the UK to become undocumented. \r\n\r\nWe are calling on the Government to suspend Dublin transfers and allow residents with connections here to stay. \r\n\r\nYou can read our report here: https://www.scribd.com/document/341947352/Roads-to-Nowhere\r\n",

People who have suffered extreme trauma will be sent to countries that they claim have mistreated and abused them. Parliament should not allow this to happen. ",
