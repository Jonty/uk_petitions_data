        "additional_details": "The problem is that the amount of silt in rivers has been allowed to build up for years, thus raising the level of the river beds. With the river beds raised then they cannot hold the amount of water in them and this goes on to cause flooding of surrounding land. The environment spend billions creating higher flood defences but what good will this be if river beds are allowed to rise. with the river beds rising this creates more problems with the water table rising stopping water draining away",
        "background": "The Environment agency has got it wrong with their understanding of U.K rivers and waterways. For many years now they have done NOTHING about cleaning out rivers like what used to happen in days gone past when we didn't have the extreme flooding as we are having now. ",
