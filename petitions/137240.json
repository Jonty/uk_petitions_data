        "additional_details": "The EU referndum has been held and a majority of over 1 million voters chose the Leave option. A hardline minority of Remain campaingers have baulked at the result and are now tring to manipulate a democratic voting system by calling for a percentage ruling change. \r\n\r\nThere is no actual evidence presented by parliament to support either option in the referendum as to the benefits or negatives of being a member of the EU. \r\n\r\nAny government leader that chose the remain option should now stand down.",
        "background": "To ensure fairplay in all referendums, the first and only vote is the one that must stand as the result. As a democratic society, any vote with a majority cannot be challenged just because some of the electorate are not happy at the result. There must be no TMO in this situation.",
