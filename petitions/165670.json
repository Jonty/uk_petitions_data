        "additional_details": "The quality of our park is very dated compared to Idle and Sailtaire for example they're all concrete, perfectly smooth & safe to ride our parks worn & not flush with the ground thsi is a hazard. \r\nAlso a new park would help with businesses such as McDonald's as youths today hang round there if they had a park it could also help them to find a new hobbie. \r\nNunroide was also featured in sidewalk mag as the one of the worse skatepark in The UK and for the skaters & the comunity this should change. ",
        "background": "A lot of people have been injured or put off by the poor quality of ramps at nunroide, we either have to travel to other parks or pay to skateboard in a indoor park which is expensive...A new park would also help youths of today it would give them something to do instead of being on the streets.
