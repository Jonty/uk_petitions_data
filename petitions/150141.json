        "additional_details": "What will be the terms of this new deal? Will we be in the Single Market? If so, will we have to accept EU migration in order to join that market? We don't know.\r\n\r\nThis is major constitutional change and cannot be approved behind closed doors without the clear consent of the majority of the British people.\r\n\r\nIf the Scots can have a second referendum because of a new constitutional reality, so should the rest of the UK, particularly when the margin of the EU vote was twice as close.\r\n",
        "background": "Following the Brexit vote, an un-elected Prime Minister will negotiate a new deal for the UK's future over which we will have no say. There is no consensus over what this deal should be, even among Brexit supporters. We need a vote on whether to leave on the new terms, or remain in the EU as before.",
