        "additional_details": "Many studies and reports show the negative effect on our younger generation of being constantly subjected to images of such extreme and artificial body images. By forcing the producers of such media to include a link to the original image (by way of, say, a reference number or QR code or similar) the media would be more transparent to such harmful image manipulation.",
        "background": "Our children and young adults are surrounded by media portraying unnatural and mostly unattainable body images. In many cases that media has been considerably digitally manipulated (eg, airbrushing) and I propose legislation for such images to include a link to the original unenhanced image.",
