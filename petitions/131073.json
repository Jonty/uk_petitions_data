        "additional_details": "Most of Europe uses proportional representation such as Spain,italy\r\nIceland,Greenland,ireland,\r\n\r\nWith proportional representation if 20% of the county votes for party A they have 20% of uk seats in parliament ,making it simple for the public to understand and not to be scared of voting but also more fair and show what the public truly think\r\n\r\nI put fouth the idea of a referendum to see if British should stay with first past the post or proportional representation.",
        "background": "Within British society individuals want to vote for party's that shows what the people want. However with first past the post in a area 20% may vote for party A ,but 35% may vote for party B. The 20% votes are forgotten not getting a say in Parliament. ",
