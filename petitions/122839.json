        "additional_details": "The Speaker is the highest authority in the House and as such has full authority to make sure MPs follow the rules of the House during debates. This can include:\r\n\r\ndirecting an MP to withdraw remarks if, for example, they use abusive language\r\nsuspending the sitting of the House due to serious disorder\r\nsuspending MPs who are deliberately disobedient - known as naming\r\nasking MPs to be quiet so Members can be heard.\r\n\r\nCensure John Bercow and ensure he performs his role, or elect a successor.\r\n",
        "background": "The Speaker of the House is meant to keep order in the House when it is hearing debates, and for such occasions as Prime Minister's Questions, including forcing members to be silent while questions are being asked or answered. John Bercow is failing to do so and has reduced the House to a farce.",
