        "action": "Issue a two-year flight ban for travelers who cause disruption on airplanes",
        "additional_details": "Increasingly there are stories of drunken and rowdy passengers causing problems on flights in and around Europe. Unfortunately, many of these are British travelers. At a time when airline safety is critical, this unwanted behaviour is creating added pressure and fining the travelers is often not a strong enough sanction. A two-year flight ban would hopefully be a more suitable sanction and also act as a deterrent. ",
        "background": "Airplane security is essential not only when combatting terrorism but for travelers to feel generally safe and ensure there are no added risks to flying. Recently, poor or drunken behaviour by some travelers has caused distress and has even required planes to be diverted.",
