        "action": "Raise the minimum wage to \u00a310/hr and ban 0hr contracts.",
        "additional_details": "The cost of basic foods such as eggs, milk, bread, flour etc. has nearly tripled in the last 10 years. (+%300) The NMW however has only incrased a fraction compared to that. This move would not only improve the quality of life for britain's poorest working families but also take many people of benefits and even encourage more people to work thereby freeing up money to be spent elsewhere. This petition is also aimed to stop employers exploiting 0hr contracts.",
        "background": "We the undersigned hereby demand that the national minimum wage is to be raised to \u00a310/hr and continue to raise it in line with inflation. Additionally we also demand that the government ban zero hour contracts. ",
