        "additional_details": "Wirral UNISON and other school unions do not want children in this country to miss out on a decent education, supplied by dedicated teachers and support staff with sufficient resources.\r\nAverage primary school cut is \u00a387,000 or \u00a3339 per pupil.\r\nAverage secondary cut is \u00a3405,000 or \u00a3477 per pupil.\r\nVisit http://www.schoolcuts.org.uk/#/ for more information.\r\nEarly indications had shown Wirral losing \u00a310,759,698, figures now show this to be \u00a315,696,153. \r\nThat is 421 teachers or 872 support staff !\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The government is imposing real term funding cuts on schools by freezing per-pupil funding while inflation and cost of employer pension and national insurance contributions increase. This affects all schools and academies alike. Without further funding schools will lose \u00a33bn in real terms by 2020.",
