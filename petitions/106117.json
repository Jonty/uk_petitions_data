            "details": "The subject was addressed by Professor Huw Strachan and his team when they produced the \u201cReport of the Task Force on the Military Covenant\u201d in September 2010.  The Government subsequently implemented Professor Strachan\u2019s recommendation for a veteran\u2019s privilege card which can be used to access commercial discounts or privileges both locally and nationally. This includes the Defence Discount Service (DDS) which was launched in recognition of the Armed Forces Community as a whole and is the only Ministry of Defence endorsed scheme.\r\n\r\nThe DDS is seen as an important element in developing the Armed Forces Covenant across the UK. The Covenant is an agreement between the Armed Forces community, the nation and the Government. It encapsulates the moral obligation to those who serve, have served, and their families.\r\n\r\nFor minimal cost the Defence Privilege Card (DPC) allows members of the Armed Forces Community to save in stores, restaurants and venues. This in turn allows people to recognise the commitment, great bravery and distinction of the Armed Forces, their families and veterans within their local communities. When an individual signs up for the DPC they have an option to state on the card if they are a veteran and also their former Service.  \r\n\r\nThe DPC is a valuable and tangible part of the nation's recognition and appreciation of the Defence Community; it is increasingly seen as an important aspect in developing the Armed Forces Community Covenant in local communities across the UK. \r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence",
