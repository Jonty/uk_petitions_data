        "additional_details": "The current Government has created record NHS deficits \u2013 \u00a32.45 billion and rising. 3.9 million people are on waiting lists for treatment. Last year, 1.8 million people had to wait 4 or more hours in A&E \u2013 a fourfold increase since 2010. A quarter of patients have been forced to wait a week or more just to see or speak to their GP or a nurse \u2013 some cannot even get an appointment. And now the Sustainability & Transformation Plan (STP) could mean Islanders losing 30% of NHS services.",

We demand that:\r\nComprehensive, high quality, place based systems of care be maintained at least at their present level on the Isle of Wight\r\nGP and dentistry services are safeguarded\r\nResources for community mental health services are increased",
