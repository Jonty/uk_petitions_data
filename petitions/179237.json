        "additional_details": "The UK should demonstrate its commitment to ensure that refugees receive protection and assistance regardless of religion, nationality or race. Discriminatory policies such as this ban should be met with swift action to remind the world that human rights are inviolable. Although some of the families may have ties to the US, in the current atmosphere of hate and bigotry they may chose a more compassionate nation to receive them. Let the world know that President Trump's policy is not our policy.",
        "background": "The United States ban affects refugees whose application have already been approved. The US vetting procedure is the most stringent, which guarantees that those who have already been approved for resettlement pose no threat. ",
