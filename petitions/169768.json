        "additional_details": "We need to stop this decision from happening. Bring back these subjects. \r\nUniversities will die out because people won't want to go knowing they have only English or Maths to do as a degree. \r\nThey are NOT 'soft' subjects. \r\nWe as a free citizen of the UK in a 'supposed democratic society' should have the option to study Film studies, Theatre, citizenship studies, History, Art.\r\nBring back Cameron who actually did stuff right and didn't mess with peoples futures!\r\nSTOP MESSING WITH EDUCATION!",
        "background": "Please help me stop this absurd decision that the Conservatives and Michael Gove have made to cut such vital subjects from GCSEs and A levels. Why are they trying to stop people's creativity? And also industries such as film, history, and engineering are absolutely vital to have in the UK. ",
