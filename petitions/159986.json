        "additional_details": "If we sign up to the EEA we will get the best of both worlds. We will gain access to the single market which means tariff free trading and the freedom to work/study/live anywhere in Europe. Being in the single market means access to the EHIC and lower data roaming charges. Being in the EEA instead of the EU means we aren't tied to some EU regulations and restrictions. So I think we should remain in the EEA as we will be in a decade of uncertainty if we don't.",
        "background": "The EEA is an agreement which provides for the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the internal market of the European Union (EU). It was established in January 1994. It is participated in all EU states and countries such as Norway and Iceland. ",
