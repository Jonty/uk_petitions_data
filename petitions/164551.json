        "additional_details": "Both Isle of Wight ferry companies (Red Funnel and Wightlink) are charging a lot of money to travel, especially when there is events on the Island.  This restricts people financially (especially residents as they have no choice in using these two companies) in travelling either from or to the isle of wight.  This is damaging businesses on the Island that rely on tourist trade which is in decline,  families are also restricted in seeing each other. ",
        "background": "I personally want to travel to Portsmouth to see my daughter but i have to go via Southampton as i am priced out by Wightlink due to their excessive fees. The IOW residents especially need regulation to stop the companies from monopolising on the services they provide. This is one of many examples.",
