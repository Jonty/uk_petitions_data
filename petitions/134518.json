        "action": "Make smoking in and near children's parks and playgrounds against the law.",
        "additional_details": "Secondhand smoke has around 4000 chemicals, 50 of which cause cancer, and many others which are very dangerous, especially for children and pregnant women.  Thirdhand smoke is the smoke that is leftover as residue on surfaces.  If, for example, someone is smoking on a seesaw, the dangerous chemicals from that smoke will then be touched and possibly ingested by the children who will next use that playground equipment. Dogs are banned from kids' parks. Smoke should also be banned in and near them.",
        "background": "Yesterday a woman asked if it would bother me if she smoked in the playground while on the seesaw with her young daughter.  When I said it would bother me, she told me that my one year old son would turn out to be \"arrogant\" and smoked anyway.  Secondhand smoke, even outside, is dangerous for kids.",
