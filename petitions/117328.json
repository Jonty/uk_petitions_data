        "additional_details": "Health Trusts are reporting increased incidences of assault on staff, as are Unions and Staff Colleges. \r\n\r\nThere are few frontline staff who have not been verbally abused and/or physically assaulted during their career. \r\n\r\nMany in pre-hospital and A&E roles are frequently abused as well as assaulted.\r\n\r\nAssaults are frequently accompanied by damage to equipment and the combined cost of treating injured staff, sickness absence and replacing medical equipment, is a drain on already limited resources.",
        "background": "Healthcare Professionals are frequently assaulted.  Paramedic, Nursing and other staff are at higher risk as they are the first point of contact and as such more vulnerable. Because of this such assaults should attract an automatic custodial sentence to deter criminal acts and protect staff.",
