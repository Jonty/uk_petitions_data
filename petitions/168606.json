        "additional_details": "Buying and selling houses is such a life changing and costly process it should not be subject to people changing their minds in a whim.  Many families can suffer heartache when a house chain collapses due to a person simply changing their mind.  I propose that before people enter a bid on a house they should get a survey and any searches competed and be in a position to pay a deposit.   This would add an a strong element of security to the house buying and selling process. ",
