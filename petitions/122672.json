        "additional_details": "A prime example of John Bercow not doing his job occurred during the EU debate on the 22/02/16. The Torys thought it was acceptable to jeer the Jeremy Corbyn while he delivered his speech. This showed contempt for an elected member of parliament and the electorate. It also showed they don't take the issue of the U.K's position in the EU seriously. An issue like this deserves more respect as does the Labour leader. John Bercow did nothing to control the childish behaviour from the Tory benches. ",
        "background": "John Bercow has shown Tory bias during many debates in Parliament and it's only getting worse. On top of that he shows no restraint when spending public funds and is turning the office of the speaker into a joke.  ",
