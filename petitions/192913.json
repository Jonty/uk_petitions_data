        "additional_details": "This is not a call for a second referendum. I would like to see MPs meet with leave, remain and non voting constituents, and ask each individual about their concerns, frustrations and lack of confidence in the EU. These reasons should be discussed in Parliament and collated in a report sent to the EU. Britain must work with the EU to act on these concerns and reform laws to the benefit of everyone.\r\nWe could remain in the EU under the terms of leave voters, which may satisfy a majority of the UK.",
        "background": "9 months after the referendum and the country is still heavily divided. The future of the UK is in serious doubt, with abuse, threats and anger abundant from both sides. The country is not coming together. It is time for the Government to reassess it's response for the good of the country.",
