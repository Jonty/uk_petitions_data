Let's also stop politicians who have zero experience in health or education from making policy, and leave instead trust these tasks to panels of experts.  Only this way can be bring stability to, and take forward, our beloved organisations.",
        "background": "The NHS and Education are perpetual footballs for politicians.  They see them as their way of \"making policy\" and \"changing Britain\".  In the same way as was done with the Bank of England, both the NHS and Education should be taken out of politics, and run by independent, expert organisations.",
