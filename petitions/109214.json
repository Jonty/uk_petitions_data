        "additional_details": "At around 8 a.m. on 21st, a large group of police armed with batons and pepper-spray destroyed a Syrian refugee camp in Calais. With no warning, vans pulled up and rushed up to 300 refugees off to the \u2018Jungle\u2019, 2.5 miles from the town. Tents were destroyed, possessions were lost, and the place that these people called home was turned into a wasteland. Two similar evictions were carried out that morning, with police also destroying tents on the edge of the Jungle. This is sickening brutality.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "On the 21st of September, World Peace Day, the Gendarmerie destroyed a Syrian camp located in central Calais, and went on to bulldoze tents at the edge of the Jungle, throwing away possessions, passports, immigration papers and phones. These refugees need our help - they have been through enough.",
