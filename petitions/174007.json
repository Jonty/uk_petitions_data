        "action": "Overrule MOT Exemption for Cars of Historic Interest.",
        "additional_details": "Insurance company data proves that Historic/modified Vehicles are rarely involved in Motor Vehicle Accidents. Through the course of a vehicles life some items such as brakes or suspension components are upgraded. This can be to improve safety or because original parts are too scarce to find. Under proposed EU laws, modified classic cars could be forced to undertake Basic IVA tests which they could not possibly pass. We are leaving the EU so now do not need these changes banning modified cars.",
        "background": "Pre 1960 cars are at present MOT exempt and this is being extended to all cars over 40 Years Old. These laws are from the EU and are not wanted by classic car owners. Once these laws are passed MOT exempt cars will need to pass an inspection to prove they are not modified from standard specs.",
