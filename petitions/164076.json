        "action": "Change the 40 year rolling exemption for classic vehicles to 30 year.",
        "additional_details": "My vehicle is a classic car and is 26 years old. It is on classic car insurance as there are only 30 of my vehicle on the road and is classed as a classic vehicle by my insurer so why shouldn't I get historic car status in 4 years time.",
        "background": "I feel that the standard should be revised from 40 years to 30 years. Many cars over 25 years now are classic cars and are on classic car policys which do little mileage per year. Cars over 20 years are rarely seen on the road on a daily basis so I think the above should be revised.",
