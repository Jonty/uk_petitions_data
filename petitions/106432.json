        "additional_details": "I was at a park, there was a man standing at the swings, he was smoking whilst watching his child. I watched as the smoke blew towards the other children and as one parent had to remove her child from the area to ensure he wouldn't breathe it in.\r\n\r\nSmoking, although illegal in public buildings, not in public parks. We need to ban it. Smoking around you can disrupt your children playing, you leisurely walking or casually sitting. Even the sight of it isn't something we want to see. Sign today.",
        "background": "This should be illegal, people should be allowed to enjoy their time in parks without smoke around them. There are hundreds of thousands of public parks across Great Britain. These include nature parks, sport parks, play parks among others, yet it is still legal for people to smoke in these areas.",
