        "additional_details": "BSL is a discriminating law and should be abolished! If racism is wrong in humans the why not in dogs too! You would never (hopefully) be hateful to someone of a different race, so why be hateful to certain breeds of dogs! Sure, pitbulls for example have more power than say a Labrador but they are both still friendly breeds! Quote: judge the breed not the deed! Personally, having a breed that many people call aggressive is horrible because I feel bad for kaos (my dog) when people glare at him!",
        "background": "BSL bans American Pitbulls Terriers, Dogo Argentinos, Japanese Tosas and Fila Brasileiros because they are seen as aggressive breeds! No breed of dog is naturally aggressive and it is unfair to discriminate against certain breeds! In conclusion BSL is racism to dog and it is the owner behind the dog",
