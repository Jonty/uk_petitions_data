        "additional_details": "Presently, just a few banks allow customers to deposit cash using their debit cards.\r\nThe bank closures are forcing personal & small business customers to deposit cash in a local Post office using the customer's paying-in slips, with delays of 2-3 days before crediting the customer's account: This is profitable to the banks to the cost of their customers.\r\nThis petition asks the Government to only allow future bank closures, if the bank has put actions in place to stop this unfair practice. \r\n ",
        "background": "The Banks\u2019 closure programmes are unfair, particularly to their rural customers, personal & small business, and those who cannot travel far. The Government must oblige all UK banks to provide instant debit card cash deposit facilities via the Post Office as part of their branch closures programmes",
