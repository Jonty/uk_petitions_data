        "additional_details": "I\u2019m sure there is not a fisherman out there who has not seen people taking fish illegally in a carrier bag to eat, or trollies blocking our rivers. When I was  a child there were shoals and shoals of silvers, now you have to hunt miles and miles of riverbank for these shoals, the fish in every river are disappearing. Please sign and share this petition link to everyone and every site ,forum or page you wish! 10000 sign and it has to be acknowledged,100000 and it has to be considered for debate!",
        "background": "It is becoming obvious in the fishing communities that we need a crackdown to check licences and stop people taking fish illegally. I\u2019m 38 and have NEVER been checked. We need full time rangers on every river checking licences and keeping rivers clean and clear!",
