        "background": "Sexism is an everyday problem that should be a concern to all of us. Even if we think that it is gradually improving as time moves on, it isn't. Catcalling and gender stereotyping and targeting is a huge issue, and much of the younger generation seems to find it acceptable because of many influences",
