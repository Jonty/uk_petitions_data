        "action": "Add law classes to the secondary school curriculum in an attempt to lower crime.",
        "additional_details": "If law was put on the national curriculum, it may reduce crime. Even though law is a College/University course, it usually sounds dull to the age group. Also, it may be too late to likely join, because if you have a criminal record, you will be less likely be allowed to join that course. So put it as a compulsory secondary school lesson to increse the rate of unknown crime knowledge.\r\n\r\nLastly, in a time with telephone/ fraud it may help the general public to distinguish what offenders might say.",
        "background": "When growing up, I was only taught about the basic laws I.E. Robbery, murder and drugs. But I was not taught about more crimes. If people are taught about more crimes, it might cause people to identify if they will be committing a crime before they carry out their plans.",
