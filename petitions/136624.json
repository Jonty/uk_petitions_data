        "additional_details": "The UK Government has a range of options in a post-Brexit UK. These range from no trade deal at all with the EU to maintaining our current tariff-free access to the single market. Leaving the single market would be harmful to the British economy, according to the IMF, the CBI, the IFS, the OECD and 88% of economists. Outside of the EU, the UK should fight for economic prosperity. According to UCL, as labour moves freely in the single market, UK growth is boosted.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call for a deal with the EU that is mutually beneficial. The UK will soon leave the EU, but the details of the deal between the bloc and our country are yet to be decided upon. This deal should be modelled on Norway's acclaimed one, guaranteeing a thriving economy.\r\n",
