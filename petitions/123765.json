However, this has not happened and my house Facebook chat has only seen an increase in the levels of passive aggressiveness decrying the state of our living arrangements.\r\n\r\nBy taking a stand against my own housemates I hope to start a movement, to set a precedent, to try and change this world for the better.",

I want you to stand with me in my plight.",
