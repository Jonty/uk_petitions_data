        "action": "Newspapers must issue retractions at the same prominence as the original article",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for a law demanding that any retraction must be published at the same place of prominence as the original article - so that if the erroneous piece was a headline story, the correction must be too. It will also ensure that corrections and clarifications are legally required to be published as soon as the original article is found to be misleading or incorrect. This will serve to increase the integrity of reporting, and reduce the flow of incorrect news to the British public.",
        "background": "It is an unfortunate fact that newspapers will often get facts incorrect in the rush to get the 'inside scoop'. Unfortunately these often go unchallenged as retractions (if they are issued at all) are relegated to a small corner where they will never be noticed.",
