        "additional_details": "Not only is this reassessment traumatic enough for disabled people, with the potential consequence of losing their ability to confidently leave the house, assessors are in a position where they have to justify their performance through means of denying access to a certain number of people, thus looking to deny future access to a blue badge wherever they see fit. Recently, a family member who cannot walk 50 feet was told her blue badge is being revoked, due to 'evidence' that they can walk fine.",
        "background": "A GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE JUDGED UPON HOW IT TREATS ITS LEAST FORTUNATE CITIZENS \r\nWe are in a period of time where disabled people all across the country are being re-assessed for their needs, including their access to a blue badge. Please put a stop to the 1000s of disabled people losing them unjust.",
