Residents from around Washington are uniting in this common cause to stop the rot. Photographs of the litter, the overflowing bins, the fly tipping,  the overgrowing trees and shrubbery and the grass verges along our roads and highways that are causing disruprion and becoming a danger to motorists. We need to stop this NOW. We need an independent voice and independent Council!!",
