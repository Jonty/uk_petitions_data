        "additional_details": "It appears the prices have become worse since the Government has made it illegal to take your children out of school during term time.\r\n\r\nThere should of course be some exceptions, for example if the child is taking formal exams that year, but in the case of 'less important years', taking a week's holiday as a family can offer important life experience.",
        "background": "Holiday companies both inside and outside the UK charge extortionate rates for holidays taken during the UK school holidays.  Parents should be allowed to take their child out of school for 1 week per year without penalty so low income families have a chance of a holiday together each year.",
