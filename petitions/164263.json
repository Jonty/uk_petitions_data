        "additional_details": "Recently, a heavy goods driver, Paul Stephen Stanyard, passed away in Italy of natural causes.  Due to the driver being on rest/break, as required by law, the insurance company of the haulier Matthews International, refused to repatriate the driver, and Matthews International would not pay for repatriation. One can only imagine the grief that the family must be facing given the news by text message of their loved one so far away, without the additional worry of the cost of bringing him home. ",
        "background": "It SHOULD be part of any hauliers insurance policy that any driver, anywhere, and for any reason, be repatriated under any circumstances.  Please make it law that insurance companies do not have optional repatriation insurance, but is standard practice. ",
