        "additional_details": "It is unfair that a party (who's name will not be mentioned) received over 5,000,000,000 votes and only has one member of Parliament in Cabinet, the method I perceive to be best is an order of Political Parties ranked from 1 to 5 - 1 being the most favourable and 5 the least. During election, the top 5 parties will be chosen and the Public should order these 5 in the order they choose to be best suited to run the Country. This is a simpler, fair approach to how the current elections blind us.",
        "background": "The current Voting system is outdated, unfair, and in the modern age unjustified. We need to put in place a more accurate, fair and simple Voting method for the People of Britain to choose exactly who runs our Country.",
