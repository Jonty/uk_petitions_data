        "action": "Make it a legal requirement that all cats be microchipped",
        "additional_details": "Since April 2016 it has been UK law that all pet dogs be fitted with a sterile microchip. This aids in identification when pets go missing, are stolen or get injured.\r\n\r\nCats enjoy roaming over vast areas around their homes.  In too many unfortunate cases cats are lost, injured or stolen and many are not fitted with microchips, making it nearly impossible to locate their owners. And with the worrying number of cat murders in the South East, it is especially important to chip your cat.",
        "background": "The UK Government should change the law to make it a legal requirement for all cat owners to have their pet(s) microchipped.",
