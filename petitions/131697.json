        "additional_details": "Many NHS trusts simply refuse to make a mental health diagnosis if the individual is under the influence of alcohol.  Without an assessment, an appropriate referral cannot be made and treatment cannot be given, leaving the individual to continue self-medicating while their physical and mental health deteriorates. \r\n\r\nSectioning or suicide shouldn't be the only options left. \r\n\r\nEarly intervention is vital. More funding is needed. More training. More communication. More person-centred treatment. ",
        "background": "When mental health problems and substance misuse co-exist, this is known as a dual diagnosis. 22-44% of all adult inpatients in England also have a substance misuse problem and 22% of all suicides are linked to alcohol use.\r\n\r\nWhy are so many people falling through the net?\r\n ",
