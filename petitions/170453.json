        "action": "Never sign a trade deal like CETA/TTIP which cede UK sovereignty to corporations",
        "additional_details": "The main tenet of the Brexit campaign was to \"take back control\" from the EU. UK ministers have voiced strong support for CETA/TTIP which seems contradictory given that such trade deals put the sovereignty of government in doubt and give corporations the ability to sue governments under Investor-State Dispute Settlement powers before special international tribunals. This would effectively bring an end to the cherished principle of equality before the law, all in the name of greater profits.",
        "background": "Once Brexit has completed, the UK will be able to enter into trade deals by itself. Ministerial support for TTIP/CETA which are aimed at eroding national sovereignty and giving multinational corporations the right to sue governments if policy adversely effects their profits is a serious danger.",
