        "additional_details": "An ethical rating should be founded on the following core principles:\r\n -Environmental impact\r\n -People (wages, working conditions, exploitation of employees)\r\n -Animals (animal testing, welfare of animals)\r\n -Political activity\r\n -Product Sustainability (Organic, Fairtrade, Positive Environmental Features)",
        "background": "Our current consumption culture focuses on price. The true cost of buying that product is rarely reflected in the price.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of an ethical consumption traffic light system at brand level will enable conscientious consumers to easily make informed decisions about what they buy.",
