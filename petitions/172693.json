        "additional_details": "The local Council have been informed about this road on numerous occasions and choose to only fill in the odd pot hole here and there but leave others which then get progressively worse. The road surface is also deteriorating more due to the vast volume of traffic which uses it. These include heavy lorries, farm vehicles and even horse-back riders! \r\n\r\nWe urge you please to sign this petition and make Crowhurst Village Road safe and welcoming again. ",
        "background": "Crowhurst Village Road is used by thousands of drivers. Half of the road was recently re-surfaced and is wonderful, but the other half was not. The amount of pot holes is also increasing daily and makes for very dangerous driving. \r\n\r\nPlease sign this and make the road safe again!",
