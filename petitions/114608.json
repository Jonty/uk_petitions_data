        "additional_details": "Often, patients leave the service without a discharge plan or care plan. Their transition into adult services is forgotten by professionals who simply do not have the funding to support them. Those who must go without support are at an increased risk of suicide, left vulnerable, and forced to navigate a new mental health system alone. \r\n\r\nThrough either having a specialist transition programme, or a service especially for young adults, the situation could be drastically altered for the better. ",
        "background": "Some CAMHS services stop offering help at 16, others at 18. This means that young people must use adult MH services.\r\n\r\nThere is very little help available for young adults transitioning into adult MH services. Transitions are poorly managed, which results in young people falling through the gaps. ",
