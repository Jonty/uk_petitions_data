        "action": "Stop the government reducing state pension for people contracted out of SERPS.",
        "additional_details": "I will have worked for more than 50 years and paid enough NI to qualify for the full pension. After advice from the government I contracted out of the SERPS payments but still paid NI. Despite paying more into the basic system I now find my projected state pension will be reduced. Why is this so when I have paid more than someone who did only 35 years and never paid a penny into SERPS?",
        "background": "Revise the government decision to reduce the basic state pension amount if a person has 'contracted out' of SERPS at government advice. If a person has made the minimum required NI payments in their basic wage then they should get a full state pension PLUS any additional SERPS pension.",
