        "action": "Improve the morale of NHS working staff by reducing the disparity in wages",
        "additional_details": "I have had firsthand experience in this matter, visiting hospitals once a month for the last 10 years for treatment. After speaking to numerous members of the nursing staff, it became apparent that a large majority were unhappy with the working conditions and the difference in pay between themselves and more senior doctors in the NHS. I wish for this matter to be discussed, and for the balancing of wages to be considered by a committee. ",
        "background": "The morale of the working staff in the NHS is at an all time low ebb. So it's no surprise that they take little pleasure in going to work, and that enthusiasm is lacking. A committee is needed to balance the difference in wages and working conditions between the different tiers of the hierarchy.",
