All owners should be on a data base which can be checked before selling anyone a dog. Anyone breeding accidentally or on purpose should have to pay to be checked by an authority to make sure that are fit & have the education to rear the puppies properly. Anyone not abiding by these rules should be prosecuted/jailed. People need to start taking responsibility for their actions!",
