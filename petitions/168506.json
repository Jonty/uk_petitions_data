        "additional_details": "Many girls are also child soldiers, even though many believe that it is only boys. These girls get tortured and raped by several men, also by the boys who are child soldiers but get forced to do this. This is ruining the whole childhood of a child who deserves to be safe, have education and they have the right to live a normal life.\r\nWar violates every right of a child \u2013 the right to life, the right to be with family and nurtured and respected\u201d. (Grace Machel, UN, 1996)",
        "background": "We want action against the use of child soldiers as they are being declined of their basic human rights. They are too young of age to stand up for themselves. This affects them as they have to carry out dangerous tasks; being taken away & taking drugs which affects their mental and physical health.",
