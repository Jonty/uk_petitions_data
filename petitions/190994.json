        "additional_details": "5 of 7 of the court martial panel found him guilty, if that were a civilian court this would be almost a third of the jury. The least he could expect would be a retrial normally.\r\n\r\nOur brave service people are fighting for our freedom, but are prohibited a trial by jury unlike those they fight for.Typically the sentences are far in excess compared to their civilian counterparts, again is this a fair system, why should a service person receive a harsher penalty just because they wear a uniform?",
        "background": "At least give accused service personnel the choice of court martial or trial by jury.\r\nAs the recent case of Marine A has shown, this archaic system of supposed justice is totally flawed. Service personnel need  a right to trial by jury of their peers and not by a panel of serving officers. \r\n",
