        "action": "Prioritise Christian refugees from the Syrian crisis.",
        "additional_details": "I understand that this petition seems discriminatory. The Christians of the middle east have been systematically targeted by Muslims for more than a thousand years. The last genocidal attack was perpetrated by the Muslim Turks In 1915. They slaughtered two million Armenian Christians.\r\n\r\nIn the birthplace of Christianity, the Christian genocide is almost complete. \r\n\r\nThose Christians left will continue to face Muslim discrimination on a daily basis and will continue to be vulnerable to persecution in the future.\r\n\r\nThe displaced Muslims, in this Muslim conflict, will not face anything like this in the Muslim countries they seek refuge in.\r\n\r\nHence my petition.",
        "background": "It is the Christian minority that is being exterminated in Syria. Their churches destroyed, their children being taken as sexual slaves, their men beheaded for their faith.",
