Therefore to restrict the age this way it would help keep down the number of old people voting and put more decision in the younger generations. ",
        "background": "In the referendum most young people- 17 or below did not have the chance to decide their future, where old pensioners were allowed to vote and decide our future for us! We want more control for young people! ",
