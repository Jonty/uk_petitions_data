        "action": "Remove the age limit from apprenticeships to help less experienced job seekers.",
        "additional_details": "Anyone older than age 24 should be given a fair chance to gain employment as an apprentice. There are many unemployed people lacking the necessary training and experience in their desired field. \r\n\r\nEmployment should not be ageist. \r\n\r\nIf raising the age limit is beyond the Government's funding ability, they can introduce an option to allow the apprentice to take out a loan for the funding which could then be payed back in a similar fashion to higher education / university degree loans. ",
        "background": "People age 24+ are very unlikely to find employment as an apprentice in many fields due to funding. We would like to change this so that apprenticeship vacancies no longer discriminate those in need of the training and experience required. We propose that the upper age limit be lifted.",
