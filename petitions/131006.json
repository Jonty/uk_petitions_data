        "additional_details": "I recently attended a first aid course. To see someone preform CPR on a small, lifeless baby (in this case it was just a training doll) hit me hard. I have three children. My youngest is just under a year old. And in an emergency, before that day, I wouldn't have known what to do. \r\nThe skills I learnt that day made me realise all new parents should be offered basic training as part of the many after care checks taken by health professionals. One day, that parent may end up having to use it. ",
        "background": "In an unresponsive child, the first few minutes of first aid that is administered can be the difference between life & death.\r\nIf parents were given the opportunity to learn lifesaving CPR skills, more infant deaths could be prevented. ",
