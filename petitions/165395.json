        "additional_details": "I am a mother of an autistic child.  I see the effect even just a week half term has on my son, so how does the government expect him to cope with 6 whole weeks?!  I am not the one parent that feels the holidays are far too long for these children. The government have been saying for years they will cut the archaic 6 week holidays yet they haven't made any adjustment.",
        "background": "Children that suffer from autism etc find summer holidays a distressing upheaval to their usual routine. This can cause them to violently lash out. \r\nThese children struggle after six weeks and find it very hard to settle back into a routine at school which is distressing for all those around.",
