        "additional_details": "An Arsenal season ticket costs up to \u00a32039, whereas Bayern Munich's costs just \u00a3104. An Arsenal match day ticket costs between \u00a325.50 and \u00a3126, whereas Bayern's cost between \u00a313 and \u00a360. This evidence shows that the BPL ticket prices are unnecessary and are ruining football-it is clear that big clubs such as Bayern can survive with lower ticket prices, so why do Premier League clubs continue to rob their fans and ruin the game?",
        "background": "Increasing BPL ticket prices are getting ridiculous as they are beginning to ruin football. In many cases only the rich and wealthy can make the games, meaning poorer supporters struggle to go and see their team due to the unnecessary ticket prices. The story is much different elsewhere in Europe.",
