        "additional_details": "The government spent millions building the London Designer Outlet in 2013 but yet we youths see our centres being closed or not improved. This doesn't help the young people comence together and therefore we need as many signatures to prevent more of our centres being closed here in Brent and stop government cuts for the youth clubs.",
        "background": "Brent is a big area and it's an area known to be very diversed and this is a huge bonus for the community. Recently Wembley has been rebuilding and redesigning in hope of more tourists advancing in and this helps the economy grow. However, as youths, we feel there is not much being done for us.",
