        "additional_details": "In the Phase 2 material, it is stated that flight paths have been devised based on feedback from Phase 1 consultation.  Proposed preferred flight paths C5 and D0 would fly directly over an area the consultation stated would be unaffected.  They are therefore unviable according to the rules governing changes to existing flight paths. One of the airport\u2019s key criterion is noise impact on fewest people below 7000ft.  Population data from 2001 was used, showing 2k residents when it's closer to 10k.\r\n",
        "background": "Edinburgh Airport is proposing changes to their current flight paths.  They issued a consultation last year which did not include Winchburgh, therefore discouraging residents from responding. The new proposed flight paths now include Winchburgh meaning residents have been mislead.",
