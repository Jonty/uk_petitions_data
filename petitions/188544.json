        "action": "Make it a specific criminal offence for attacking staff within the hospitals",
        "additional_details": "Apart from the NHS staff, the cleaners, car park attendants and security officers are also often attacked by the members of public, patients and the relatives of the patients. The NHS contractors also contribute towards the well-being of the patients as they also have duty of care but if they are attacked, the prosecution is usually very week and the offenders get away with it and can do it again, so in light of this, we urge you to take tougher actions and make it a specific criminal offence.",
        "background": "The NHS staff and the employees of the NHS partner companies are often threatened and attacked within the hospitals by visitors or the patients themselves. I would like to start this petition as stronger measures should be taken against it by the authorities and be made a specific criminal offence.",
