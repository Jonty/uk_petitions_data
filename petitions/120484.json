        "action": "Disband the Planning Inspectorate and stop the right of appeal",
        "additional_details": "The appeals process is very costly.  In these times when the public purse is severely stretched, it's an unnecessary expense.\r\n\r\nLocal people and local authorities have first-hand knowledge of all the circumstances and resources that prevail in their locality and it is for them to decide how and where to meet their housing targets and what is acceptable within the NPPF and local policy guidance. Decisions of national importance can still be called in by the Secretary of State for central decision.",
        "background": "The Localism Act was supposed to devolve powers to local authorities. When a planning application is refused, the applicant can already reapply with either a duplicate or changed application, so no need to lodge an appeal to be decided centrally by an inspector from the Planning Inspectorate (PINS).",
