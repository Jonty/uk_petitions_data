        "action": "Reform the way voting in elections and referendums is carried out to avoid fraud",
        "additional_details": "A lot of voters have raised concerns over election fraud so the system needs reviewing. There should be a public record of the vote kept, so people can go back and check their vote has been correctly counted after the result has been announced. ie voter card AB123456A voted leave. Then after the result has been announced the voter with that number can check on the vote list to make sure their correct vote was recorded. I have carefully thought out many options to allow this to be done.",
        "background": "Many people in the UK feel that the current system of voting, be it in person or postal, is open to fraud and misrepresentation. With the EU referendum, the London mayoral and local elections happening this year it would help to ease fears of this happening again.",
