        "additional_details": "The government currently have not done enough to proactively investigate the risks to the environment associated with this practice.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Ocean Conservancy, plastic has been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and 100% of sea turtle species.\r\nIngesting plastic has life-threatening effects on wildlife & this plastic eventually ends up being digested by humans.\r\n\r\nThe scale of this issue is huge & the UK are contributing to it. Please support the ban on exporting our plastic waste.",
        "background": "The UK uses 3.3 million tonnes of plastic each year & around two-thirds of that is sent abroad to countries such as Malaysia, & Indonesia with no guarantee that it will be recycled.\r\nMany of these locations do not have the infrastructure in place to deal with plastic & so it ends up in our oceans.",
