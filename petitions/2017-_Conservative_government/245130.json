        "action": "Boris Johnson: Apologise for comments about historic CSA investigations",
        "additional_details": "First, Boris said \"some investigation\", this shows utter contempt for the alleged victim(s) involved and child sex abuse (CSA) abuse survivors everywhere. Secondly, Boris used the most disgusting phrase \"spaffed up the wall\" in reference to the \u00a360 million investigation, if you do not know what this Google it, but it is NSFW. This is disgusting terminology to use when talking about child sex allegations. It's really unbelievable that a man aiming for high office, an elected Member of Parliament and former Mayor of our capital city has insulted so many survivors of child sex abuse in such a derogatory way.\r\n\r\nWe demand a public apology and donation to charities that help CSA survivors.",
        "background": "On Wednesday 13th March 2019 (yes, 2019!) Boris Johnson said that \u00a360 million has been \"spaffed up the wall\" by investigating historical allegations of child sex abuse.",
