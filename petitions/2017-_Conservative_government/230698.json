        "additional_details": "The future of our nation will be affected profoundly by leaving the EU. Our representatives in Parliament must be able to have a meaningful say and make binding amendments on the terms of the final Brexit proposals made by Government negotiators. To not do so undermines our democracy and silences parliament. A rushed ill considered \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d vote would adversely affect our nation for generations.",
        "background": "The British people voted in the referendum on our membership of the EU and our politicians must organise a coordinated withdrawal in the best interest of the nation. Our democratically elected representatives must not be stripped of the power to analyse and amend any deal before passing it into law.",
