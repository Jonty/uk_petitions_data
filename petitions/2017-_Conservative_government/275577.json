        "additional_details": "According to RSPCA, approximately 44% of the UK\u2019s population has one or more pets. The number of households in the private rented sector in the UK increased from 2.8 million in 2007 to 4.5 million in 2017, an increase of 1.7 million (63%) households (ONS).\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, with less people able to purchase their own property, surely tenants should have rights to have a pet if they want.\r\n\r\nOf course I propose rules are put in place:\r\n- Pet deposits\r\n- References from previous landlords or vets",
        "background": "The Consumer Rights act (2015) dictates there should be evidence and grounds for a landlord to refuse a tenant or label their property as 'No pets'. However at no point have I ever been asked to provide evidence, with tenants simply turned away with a blanket 'strictly no pets' statement.",
