        "additional_details": "A close friend had attempted suicide and did not receive any support thereafter other than a phone number. This led to a second attempt that was unfortunately successful. Personally, I am aware of 6 attempted and 4 successful suicides in the last year alone! If more support was available, this could stop people committing suicide and guide them to counselling and groups which could save lives. In 2017, there were almost 6000 suicides in the UK alone.\r\n",
        "background": "Those who attempt suicide should receive more help than what is currently available. There is not enough support for those who think their only way out is to take their life. There needs to be more funding for counselling and psychologists to help those feeling suicidal and those who attempt suicide",
