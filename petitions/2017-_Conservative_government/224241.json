        "additional_details": "Tampons and towels are still classified as 'luxuries' and are taxed at 5%, whereas men's razors are considered 'essentials' and are VAT free. Smoking, shaving and use of contraceptives are all personal choices, yet having a uterus isn't a decision which can be controlled. The most obvious solution to this problem would be to provide menstrual products free under the NHS to anyone who needs them on a low income and even provide them for free in schools where they are needed unexpectedly.",
        "background": "Why is it that people get periods and still have to pay for something they cannot avoid, whereas contraception (specifically condoms), nicotine patches, abortions and even housing is paid for by the government, but menstrual products are not?",
