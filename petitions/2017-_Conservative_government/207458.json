        "action": "Create a Charter for Families Bereaved through Public Tragedy",
        "additional_details": "The Charter will include commitments by public bodies to change in relation to transparency and acting in the public interest. By adopting this, the Government will show that it has learned the lessons of the Hillsborough disaster and ensure that the perspective of bereaved families is never lost. We\u2019re concerned that the Grenfell public inquiry isn\u2019t taking into account the views of bereaved families, survivors, and local community affected. They can be spared the indignities, pain and suffering Bishop James Jones describes in his report as \"The Patronising disposition of unaccountable power\".",
        "background": "The Bishop's review of Hillsborough families' experiences recommends the creation of a Charter for Families Bereaved through Public Tragedy. The Government must implement this recommendation. This petition was started by bereaved relatives of family members who perished in the Grenfell Tower fire.",
