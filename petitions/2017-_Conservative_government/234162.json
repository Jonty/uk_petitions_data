Trillions are know to be hidden in the offshore banking systems. Closing down the tax loopholes exploited by multinationals and the super-rich to avoid paying their fair share will reduce the deficit.",
        "background": "Currently 75% of 'Government Cabinet Ministers' - within parliament are Millionaires. This is disproportionate representation. The tax and banking laws are made by theses people that allow the use of loopholes they created. The inland Revenue estimates \u00a334 billion a year remains uncollected.",
