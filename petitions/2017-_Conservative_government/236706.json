No family should have to wait a year to lay to rest such a precious life, let alone have to watch as he received a third reduction in sentence for pleading guilty after 11 months of denying it.",
        "background": "We are calling for a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years when an offender kills a child through shaking the infant. This should also mean that they are not eligible for the reduction in sentence when pleading guilty to get a lower jail term.",
