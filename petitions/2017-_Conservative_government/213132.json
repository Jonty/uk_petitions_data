        "action": "Change the Yellow Box Junction Law to allow motorist to wait for upto 20 seconds",
        "additional_details": "The intention of Honourable MPs for the Yellow Box junction law were not to generate money but to ensure smooth flow of traffic from the right in the event of heavy traffic on the main road. If the council were not stopped they will also convert KEEP CLEAR and T- Junctions into Yellow box junctions and will install CCTV to generate millions.",
        "background": "The law is being misused by Local Councils as a business by installing more cameras and Yellow box junctions and generate millions by issuing tickets for few seconds.\r\nA 20 second exemption should be given  to wait due to unavoidable circumstances and, also in the event no obstruction is caused.",
