Are we to assume that if an animal is not sentient that a person can no longer be prosecuted for animal cruelty. It would be hard to be cruel to an animal If it had no natural feelings.",
        "background": "The recent Commons vote on the question of the 'sentience' of animals Baffles me. It is plain that Animals have feelings. The result of the vote was based on Religion and Money, rather than logic or compassion. Ask the people their opinion.",
