        "additional_details": "It is quickly becoming a new trend for people to jump into a vehicle and drive it into a crowd, this is a problem on several fronts including terrorism. \r\n\r\nThe courts deal with the criminal aspect by handing out custodial sentences, however when the convicted party leaves prison they are allowed to reapply for a licence or continue driving as the bans handed out are normally spent whilst in prison.\r\n\r\nIf these offenders were convicted of Animal Cruelty they would receive a lifetime ban.",
        "background": "If a person gets into a vehicle and ultimately uses that vehicle as a weapon then they should get an automatic lifetime ban from driving on top of any convictions that the courts see fit to administer.",
