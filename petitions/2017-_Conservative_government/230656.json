Communities have been betrayed and forced by the government to give up there farms and it\u2019s created more divisions as there\u2019s no sense of community! By stopping any more building works or development on fields. This means it will build better relations between this small community! \r\nEvidence is everywhere look where you live there\u2019s building we are not thinking about the environment!",
