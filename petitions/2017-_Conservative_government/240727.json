        "additional_details": "This means they don't have time to have a life, and with homework, that's even less time. They can't go shopping if they need stuff for a project, they are unable to go after school and meet up with their best friend who goes to a different school. They have less time to study and reach their full potential. Is this fair?",
        "background": "Children have been unable to concentrate in lessons because of fatigue. This is leading to children unfairly getting punished when this problem could be simply solved. In many grammar schools school ends at 16:00, and many students live far away, so they end up getting home at around 18:30.",
