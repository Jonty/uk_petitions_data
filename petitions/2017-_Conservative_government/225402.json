        "additional_details": "In 2015 there were 6,639 suicides in the UK and Republic of Ireland, but we still believe that there were more that weren't recorded. Half of the people with mental health problems as adults present with symptoms by the age of 14. But only 8% of mental health funding goes to services for children and young people. If these numbers were highlighted we believe that more could be done to alleviate the problems and reduce the risk of someone taking their own life, and not looked upon as a sin.",
        "background": "Reaching a verdict of suicide demands the case must be made \u2018beyond reasonable doubt\u2019, the criminal standard of proof. This skews the figures hiding hundreds more suicides. If the level of proof were changed, there would be greater urgency to fund mental health services for young people.",
