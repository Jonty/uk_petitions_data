        "additional_details": "The average plastic bag you pick up at the grocery store, or carry your takeout in, has a lifespan of about 12 minutes. When discarded, they clog sewage and storm drains, entangle and kill an estimated 100,000 marine mammals every year, and degenerate into toxic microplastics that fester in our oceans and landfills for up to 1,000 years.",
        "background": "By the year 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish and it is estimated that In 2016, a global population of more than 7 billion people produced over 320 million tonnes of plastic waste compared with 1.5 million tonnes in 1950 and by 2034, this figure is estimated to be double.",
