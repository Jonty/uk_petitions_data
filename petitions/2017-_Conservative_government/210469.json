        "additional_details": "Teresa May can never represent the people as she does not know the people. Her mind and views are fixated with those of the rich, to help them avoid tax, whilst the public sector continues to crumble. Her policies neglect the needs of the majority and whilst the downfall of the nation is evident she continues to ignore it. Under Teresa May, reports show that integration levels have decreased, whilst unemployment, racial attacks and homelessness have drastically increased. #getmayout",

The housing and economical crisis have reached new heights and Great Britain as we once knew it is no longer Great. Get May Out!",
