        "additional_details": "GP's and Health Visitors all seem to have different ideas on baby and child sleep. This ranges from:\r\nHow much sleep they should have,\r\nWhen they should wake from their last nap,\r\nStarting solids to get babies to sleep,\r\nUsing Piriton (drugging them),\r\nLetting them cry themselves to sleep,\r\nAssuming all babies and children will just fall asleep when they are tired,\r\nCutting naps from already sleep deprived infants,\r\nYes, I have heard all of these. Science and research needs to be taken into account now.",
        "background": "To provide all NHS GP's and Health visitors with an accurate basic knowledge on baby and child sleep. Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest causes of mental health problems in parents and the advice given is very mixed, inaccurate and could cause families more harm.",
