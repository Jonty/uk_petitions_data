By limiting the scope of candidates you reduce your chances of hiring the best and worthiest candidates for the job. So called \u201cpositive discrimination\u201d job advertisements, like all female shortlist\u2019s for example, should be legally prohibited as, no matter the excuse, discrimination is discrimination and merit is the only thing that matters.",

We know fighting fire with fire never works, so it\u2019s time the government legislated against discriminatory job ads that bizarrely seek to \u201cend discrimination\u201d",
