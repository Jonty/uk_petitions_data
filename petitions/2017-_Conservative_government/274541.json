        "additional_details": "The death penalty is normally cited as the classic example of disconnect between politicians and the people they represent, one where a majority of MPs consistently oppose the death penalty and a majority of the public consistently support it. This is pretty much true (whether it is a good or bad thing is an entirely different matter!)\r\n\r\nSO SURELY IT SHOULD BE THE BRITISH PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE THIS ISSUE (35 MILLION VOTES ROUGHLY TO DECIDE AGAINST 650 MPS VOTING IN THE PARLIAMENT",
        "background": "The British Public want parliament to allow the british people to decide whether we bring back the death penalty or not in a national referendum once we leave the EU on the 31st October 2019. A simple yes or no on the ballot box",
