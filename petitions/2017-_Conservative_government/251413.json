This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. \r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a particular policy or decision that's the responsibility of Government or the House of Commons, you could start a petition about that. \r\nPetitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want. \r\n\r\nYou might like to consider signing this petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/245426"
