        "additional_details": "I've seen first hand queues in corridors to get to A&E ward, then endured the wait of waiting for a bed for a loved one.  I've also seen that the only bed available was in a ward with drug abusers receiving care and witnessed on daily visits their demands and their abuse towards nursing staff, some even attempting to attack.  I am also aware that its a recurring situation for the same one's to be discharged only to go back a couple of weeks later.",
        "background": "Our NHS is being abused daily by drunks and drug abusers determined to self-inflict. The NHS is overworked and these people take up precious time of paramedics, they also can take up precious beds needed for non self-inflictors. It will be paid from benefits or wages before they receive either/or.",
