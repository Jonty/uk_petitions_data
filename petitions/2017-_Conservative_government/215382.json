        "action": "Bring back the convalescent homes in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The rural areas have a lack of home care provision brought about by low wage levels and pay conditions which deny payments for travel time and mileage. This means that the rural areas are not easily served. Hence these care providers have a high turnover of staff. For the majority of single elderly, a return home after major surgery is one with no care. Convalescent homes would allow a low level of staffing serving more patients.  Benefits to patients is safety, peer competition & high morale.",
        "background": "The A&E departments are oversubscribed because there are insufficient beds in the hospital's due to the lack of care providers for discharged patients . This deficit in care provision is because the care sector is underpaid especially because of pay and conditions. We need convalescent homes back.",
