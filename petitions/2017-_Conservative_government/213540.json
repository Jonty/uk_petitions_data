        "action": "Hold a public inquiry into the decision to incentivise diesel cars & its effects",
        "additional_details": "Two very serious effects of this decision fully justify a public inquiry, to ensure such grave policy mistakes aren't repeated and to consider public compensation:\r\n\r\n1. Air pollution now causes 40,000 early deaths in the UK and costs the country \u00a327.5bn a year, according to the government's own estimates. MPs have called this a \"public health emergency\".\r\n\r\n2. People encouraged to buy diesel cars now face punitive costs and barriers to their use. This reversal is grievous public maladministration.",
        "background": "In 2001 the government decided to link car tax (VED) to CO2 emissions. In 2002 company car tax also became emissions-based. People were encouraged by such incentives to buy diesel cars. Health-damaging air pollution has worsened dramatically and diesel car owners now face punitive charges.",
