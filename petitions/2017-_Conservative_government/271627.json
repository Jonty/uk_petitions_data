It's a decision for the person chairing the debate as to whether the MP speaking is breaching those rules or not. The House can also vote to bring a debate to an end early in order to secure a decision. This is called a \"closure motion\". \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly what further action you would like taken.\r\n"
