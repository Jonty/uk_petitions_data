        "additional_details": "Over 60 submissions of evidence were provided to the EFRA Select Committee in the 2015/16 Parliamentary review of greyhound racing, and we believe the majority of the information was dismissed with no improvements resulting from the inquiry. The industry should be phased out within 2-4 years.",
        "background": "GBGB figures show 1,003 dogs were killed and 4,837 were injured as a direct result of greyhound racing in 2017 alone. These figures could be grossly underestimated because the GBGB are not independently audited. Dogs can be legally killed on economic grounds and not necessarily by a vet.",
