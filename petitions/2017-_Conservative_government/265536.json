        "additional_details": "The average age of death for homeless people is 44 for men and 42 for women. Available literature has reported the dietary intake of homeless women and children living in temporary accommodation in north-west England to be poor with many women failing to meet the recommendations for energy, protein, fibre, calcium, iron, vitamin C and folate. Key issues affecting problem drug and alcohol users include irregular meal patterns, not eating anything on certain days, and concerns around weight loss.",
