        "additional_details": "The traditional boundaries of NHS jobs are expanding at pace, with a smaller workforce, larger population and more people accessing healthcare, job descriptions and boundaries have changed. \r\nIt is time to re-visit all bands and their associated pay grades to make the NHS workforce modern and exciting, to retain staff and encourage new staff to the NHS professions. \r\nIf we want to keep an NHS we need to reward the workforce for the jobs they do in very difficult circumstances.",
        "background": "Agenda for change was adopted by the UK NHS in 2004 to replace all previous NHS pay scales. This well thought out piece of work placed NHS workers into a pay band based on the responsibilities of their job role. Being 15 years old it is fair to say that all jobs will have developed and need review",
