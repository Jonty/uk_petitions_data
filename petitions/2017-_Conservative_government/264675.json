        "additional_details": "The Business Rates system is based on the estimated renal value known as the Rateable Value (RV) of a property. In order to calculate rates payable the RV is multiplied by the Uniform Business Rate (UBR). The system could work whereby supplements or discounts are applied to the UBR depending on the EPC rating. This will drive behaviour for landlords to improve their EPC ratings.",
        "background": "All commercial properties have Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and are graded A to G. These EPC ratings can be linked to the Business Rates system (tax on commercial property occupation) so that either efficient buildings pay lower rates or inefficient buildings pay higher rates or both.",
