        "additional_details": "In response to a previous petition the Government have clearly stated it is their intention to end the live export of animals but that they were only able to do so once Brexit has occurred. Given the current uncertain nature surrounding the delivery of Brexit, especially if there was an extension to Article 50, we are asking that parallel negotiations take place to allow the Government to end this cruel and barbaric practice regardless of the outcome of Brexit.",
        "background": "EU rules currently force the UK to allow transportation of live farm animals overseas (export) for fattening/slaughter. As a definitive date for Brexit is unknown, the Government should negotiate with the EU to overturn current EU laws and end this cruel practice in the interim before Brexit occurs.",
