        "action": "Hold a 2nd Brexit referendum with options for \"deal\", \"no deal\" and \"remain\"",
        "additional_details": "My first draft of this petition (276868) was rejected on grounds of similarity to another.\r\n\r\nThe petition in question (257130) requests a vote on the PM's Deal, a New Deal, or No Deal. Unlike mine, it doesn't include REMAIN - this is a CRUCIAL difference.\r\n\r\nThere is already significant discord. A new, 3-option referendum based on clearer information would at least give everybody a chance to register their opinion, thereby helping to heal wounds. I therefore request that you reinstate my petition.",
        "background": "The 2016 referendum was a simplistic 2-way vote that ignored the wider ramifications. Leave campaigners twisted facts, the Remain campaign was complacent and subsequent events led people on both sides to change their minds. In order to start healing our divided nation, people's voices must be heard.",
