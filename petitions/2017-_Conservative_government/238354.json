        "action": "Introduce Early Primary Teaching degree/postgraduate in Scotland for ages 3-8.",
        "additional_details": "The early years are imperative for children to develop and learn. Neurological research shows that early years play a key role in children's brain development. Children's early experiences, bonds, relationships with parents, peers, and teachers all impact and shape their future. It is necessary that Scotland's Early Primary Teachers are experts in understanding children's needs to support children beyond an academic level. This degree provides an opportunity for successful early learners .",
        "background": "This Degree would provide Scotland's educational system with a wealth of knowledge on child development and behaviours to support and nurture children through a crucial stage of life, helping to motivate and stimulate children's learning abilities that an ordinary Teaching degree does not suffice.",
