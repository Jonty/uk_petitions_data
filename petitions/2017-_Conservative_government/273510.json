        "additional_details": "Community Public Access Defibrillators (CPADs) have been installed widely in localities across the UK.  With a cardiac arrest emergency the sooner lifesaving treatment and defibrillation is applied the better the chance of survival.  A programme to explain to the General Public what a CPAD is, what it looks like, how you find it, how it works and how people can save lives by administering CPR and the defibrillator as soon as possible prior to the arrival of the ambulance service is needed.",
