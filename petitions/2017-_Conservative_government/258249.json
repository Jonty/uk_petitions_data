        "additional_details": "After many hours of driving on motorways during peak hours cars cannot do the national speed limit on the road because there are vehicles over 7.5 tonnes trying to overtake each other. It takes many miles for them to overtake and in this time the traffic of cars has built up hence slowing the road down. With the ever increasing commuters, this only going to cause a bigger problem if its not resolved.",
        "background": "During peak hours (6am to 10am) and (3pm to 7pm)  all vehicles over 7.5 tonnes should not be allowed to overtake on a motorway or dual carriage way as during this time if one vehicle pulls out to overtake it slows the entire road down.",
