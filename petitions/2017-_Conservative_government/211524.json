        "action": "UK Government to ban the sale of electronic training aids for dogs.",
        "additional_details": "This petition urges the UK Westminster Government to ban the distribution, sale and use of any electronic training device for dogs, and ensure it is an offence to cause pain or distress to dogs through the use of such devices in England.\r\n\r\nThis petition also recognises that some specific devices, such as collars which only vibrate, offer potential benefits in certain circumstances such as when dealing with dogs suffering from hearing loss.",
        "background": "The Scottish and Welsh Governments, using their devolved powers, have already committed to ban the use of electronic shock collars.\r\n\r\nThe power to ban the sale of these harmful devices lies with the UK Government, which has failed to introduce controls on their use. This must change.",
