LA's offered \u00a3\u00a3 to overbuild through 'new'/ 'affordable' homes bonuses. \r\n30m people live around GB. 30,000km of public rights of way. 250kha quality agricultural land. 89000ha SSSI.\r\n220000ha mixed woodland. \r\nWe say:\r\nReview new homes targets. \r\nBrownfield not green belt.\r\nNo new homes bonuses.\r\nCease all current/ future plans to develop the green belt.",
        "background": "Successive Gts have failed to plan for UK future housing need. Local (housing) plans require local authorities to plan for future housing plans in that area. Authorities are offered huge financial incentives. Gmt targets are unrealistic and 220,000+ homes are currently planned for the green belt.",
