        "additional_details": "We do not want to be governed by Europe. We do not want a European army & we want no 39 Billion divorce bill. The people are fed up with politicians squabbling & playing party politics for their own gain, so no extension we want to leave when the law says on the 29th March. We want our sovereignty & country back!",
        "background": "Leave the EU on the 29th March. No Deal is better than a bad May deal. Save democracy, people voted to leave the EU not make deals with the EU. Any deal would be worse than the bad deal we already have with the EU. It's time to break free & have belief in the UK people to make Britain Great again.",
