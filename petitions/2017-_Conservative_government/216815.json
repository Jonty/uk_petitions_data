        "additional_details": "We ask that teachers are trained in delivering an unbiased education and are checked to ensure they are free of any political indoctrination, militancy and or subversion. Many political activists sight themselves as being teachers or university professors. An active political activist isn\u2019t a suitable kind of person to be entrusted with molding young minds. Indoctrination is not an education, we need to ensure people do not take advantage of their authority in this way, it can\u2019t continue.",
        "background": "We demand that the government and OFSTED ensure any attempt to teach a politically biased agenda, in the classroom, is a sackable offense. Our children deserve to be sure of a politically unbiased education, when in the care of any paid professional, such as teaching staff, tutors and professors.",
