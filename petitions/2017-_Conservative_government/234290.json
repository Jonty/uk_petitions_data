        "additional_details": "We want to reach an agreement and stay on the friendliest of terms as a no deal departure would damaging to both sides.\r\nWe start from a position of leaving with no deal on the 29th March 2019, do not accept the EU's insistence on a withdrawal agreement as a precursor to trade deal negotiations. All aspects need to be negotiated again concurrently. We could start from the Norwegian agreement or Canada plus, plus and add parcels of agreement that can be quickly accepted or rejected by either side.",
        "background": "If the UK signs the Withdrawal Agreement we will have to negotiate at the whim of each individual EU nation, France has already stated there will be no deal without fishing access to UK waters. We will be in such a weak bargaining position, there is no telling what we will have to concede.",
