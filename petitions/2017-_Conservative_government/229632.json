An armed robber was caught on CCTV wearing a burka, so his face was covered as he held up a branch of Gulf Bank.\r\nMustaf Jama suspected murderer fled the country wearing a niqab. Many more account across Europe.\r\nMany robberies have happened with people wearing a balaclava. \r\nNot only are face coverings not necessary in the west, it isn't compulsory for anybody to have to hide their identity. Let's put security first.",
        "background": "Full face coverings in public shouldn't be aloud. It is a security threat. What is the use of CCTV if a persons face is completely covered. It is also very intimidating walking down the road to see someone with a balaclava on for instance walking towards you. The same with the full face veils.",
