        "additional_details": "Most people I know on these medications can't get it for free and have to pay \u00a38.70 just for the medication, however people with thyroid problems and other problems can get it for free and all their other medications for free! Why when this is a condition that we must have our tablets every day otherwise become very ill and put into hospital can we not get it? This is an issue that needs to be spoken about mental health has to be spoken up about. It's difficult going through this and getting help.",
        "background": "I have been on Bipolar Medication for a while. Like others who have various mental health problems, I can't get it for free as it is not on the exemption list. However I am on this medication for the rest of my life. It should be on the list because like most medications on the list, it's for life.",
