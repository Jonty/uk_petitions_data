        "additional_details": "Why do councils not have the same respect for cats as they do for dogs? They are someone's family pet. The law must be changed so all cats are scanned and returned to their owners.\r\nA scanner is not expensive and all councils need providing with one and need to use it.\r\nMany councils who say they scan, often don't. There is NO excuse. It takes two minutes. How dare they throw our beloved pets away.\r\nEVERYONE needs to sign the petition to get this law passed for the cats.\r\nThank you\r\nGizmos Legacy",
        "background": "Thousands of cats are just disposed of every year without being scanned for a chip after being involved in RTAs. Owners search for months and years and never get closure. Scanning takes two minutes. Cats are a part of a family and deserve to be returned home, not thrown into landfill.",
