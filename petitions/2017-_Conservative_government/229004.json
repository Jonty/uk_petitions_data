        "additional_details": "Why do councils not have the same respect for cats as they do for dogs? They are someone's family pet. The law must be changed so all cats are scanned and returned to their owners.\r\nA scanner is not expensive and all councils need providing with one and need to use it.\r\nMany councils who say they scan, often don't. There is NO excuse. It takes two minutes. How dare they throw our beloved pets away.\r\nEVERYONE needs to sign the petition to get this law passed for the cats.\r\nThank you\r\nGizmos Legacy",
        "background": "Thousands of cats are just disposed of every year without being scanned for a chip after being involved in RTAs. Owners search for months and years and never get closure. Scanning takes two minutes. Cats are a part of a family and deserve to be returned home, not thrown into landfill.",

            "details": "Cats and dogs become members of the family and it is a great source of worry and uncertainty when they are injured or lost. Therefore it is the Government\u2019s position that it is best practice for veterinary practices and rehoming centres to scan cats and dogs brought to their premises. In the case of road traffic accidents, some local authorities do endeavour to identify the owners if the pet has a collar or microchip and we encourage others to adopt the same practice. \r\n\r\nHighways England similarly has a policy of scanning pets that have been killed or injured in road accidents. Rule 286 of The Highway Code also advises drivers to report any accident involving an animal to the police, which we hope would lead to domestic animal owners whose animals are killed or injured in road accidents being made aware of the incident. \r\n\r\nIt is compulsory for all dogs to be microchipped in England, Scotland and Wales. The Government would advise any owner to get their cat microchipped and keep the relevant records up to date. We would regard this to be an informed and sensible choice for individual owners to make, rather than a compulsory one. \r\n\r\nWe strongly support the work of cat charities to have microchipping and neutering campaigns. The Government has ensured that the statutory Code of Practice for the Welfare of Cats, made under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, contains advice about identifying cats, including by use of a microchip. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs\r\n",
