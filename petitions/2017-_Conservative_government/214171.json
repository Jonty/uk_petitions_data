To make sure we don\u2019t lose those precious family photos, we back-up the laptop from time to time. \r\n\r\nSo if rights-of-return and back-up plans make sense for an individual, shouldn't a nation of 65 million people have a contingency plan just in case Brexit is not the resounding success we all hope for?\r\n\r\nNo-one on either side of the argument has a crystal ball, so can we afford not to have an insurance policy in our back pocket?",
