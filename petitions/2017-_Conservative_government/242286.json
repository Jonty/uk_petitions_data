It is not democratic to become an independent MP without public scrutiny. \r\n\r\nTo that end, I have put forward this petition, in the hope of not allowing this mistake to happen again.",
        "background": "MPs are allowed to resign from a party whip without the enforcement of a by election, which means the person in question can become an independent MP, without a public vote, despite acting on another manifesto. \r\n\r\nI feel this is a breach of democracy, I therefore commend my petition to the public.",
