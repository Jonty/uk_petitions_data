        "additional_details": "The referendum did not ask the electorate whether they prefer a \u201chard or soft\u201d Brexit, or whether they wanted \u201cBrexit, as long as a decent deal is negotiated.\u201d \r\nIt simply asked if we wanted to leave the EU or remain in it. To recast one choice of a binary question as being inherently \u201chard-line\u201d in a way that can be \u201csoftened,\u201d as opposed to a legitimate option that simply means what it says, is nothing short of casuistry. It appears the only way to get clear path is to call  a General Election.",
        "background": "If you change the meaning of voters\u2019 words once they have spoken, if the electorate feel sufficiently cheated of their ballot paper, they may not use such polite words the next time they\u2019re asked. In order to change the numbers in the House, a General Election is required.",
