        "additional_details": "I am currently on a waiting list for the NHS Mental Health team and have been since June 2018. This team would give me an evaluation, handing me on to the correct team, as appropriate. Previously, I have been referred to other services - I cannot go back to them, as they have said I need an evaluation from the Mental Health team first. However, this also means that I have not updated by anyone. I feel I should know that my case is being progressed, and how soon it will be.",
        "background": "The NHS should ensure a mandatory \"keep customer informed\" system is implemented for mental health care in the UK. This would provide patients on Mental Health team waiting lists with updates on how it is until their case is to be progressed.\r\n \r\nI believe this is crucial for patient self-esteem.",
