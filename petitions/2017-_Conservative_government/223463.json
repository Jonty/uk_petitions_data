With their pension and national insurance contributions rising their wages have in effect dropped! \r\nThese heroes risk their lives every day not only putting out fires but doing so much more than you could imagine and they deserve / need to have the cap lifted and their pay increased. Lets give something back to them and help get this changed!",
        "background": "My dad is a firefighter and has been amongst the many heroes tackling the fires on the moors/winter hill.\r\nThere is such a positive response from the public recognising the gruelling work they do its just a shame their wages don't reflect this with their pay frozen & capped at 1% It needs to change!",
