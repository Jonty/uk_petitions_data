        "background": "Under s172 Companies Act 2006, directors must \"promote the success of the company\" taking into account the long term consequences and the need to act fairly with stakeholders, such as employees.  However, Part 23 of the Act fails to prevent the asset-stripping of companies by the unscrupulous.",
