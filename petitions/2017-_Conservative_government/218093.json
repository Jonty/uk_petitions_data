        "action": "Support the curry industry by reviewing immigration policy",
        "additional_details": "Previous attempts by this and former governments to train chefs within specialized Training Centres of Excellence in the UK have consistently failed to produce the skilled chefs required to address the shortage. Closures of restaurants around the country are at an alarming rate of 3-4 per week. Heavy handed raids by UKBA and heavily imposed penalties add to the burden levied upon the restaurateurs eager to maintain and survive the current economic climate.\r\nFor further info visit www.bca1960.com\u201d\r\n",
        "background": "The British curry industry is suffering since the government's cap on skilled workers was introduced over 10 years ago. We urge the government to review and reverse this policy as this cap is creating a vacuum in the area of skilled chefs, damaging growth and sustainability of the industry.",
