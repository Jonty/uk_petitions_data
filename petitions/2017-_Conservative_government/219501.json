        "additional_details": "Statistics show an 18% decline in the number of applicants to nursing programmes since removing the bursary. The Government believed to recruit 10,000 new nurses during 2017/2018 and although there has been an increase in the number of applicants accepted, targets continue to not be met. \r\n\r\nThe End Cycle Report (2017) indicates a 13% decline in the number of nursing students accepted aged between 21 and 25 (UCAS, 2017). Therefore this will impact the number of nurses recruited in the future and the National Health Service will continue to struggle with staffing.",
        "background": "To gain their professional registration, students' must complete 23000 hours of working with their mentors during the 3 years of training. As well as having a part-time job to fund their studies. Students' are exhausted and this impacts their ability to learn.",
