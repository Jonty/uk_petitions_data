        "additional_details": "It is not his place to say President Trump is not welcome. It is not his place to be involved in Brexit negotiations travelling to the EU, or around Europe in general. \r\nHis place is to serve London and it's people. To solve the problems with crime in the capital, to make sure London is running smoothly and efficiently, rather than spending tax payers money instigating various Assessments of Brexit, at the tax payers expense.\r\nSadiq Khan is the Mayor of London and that is all.",
        "background": "The Government should censor Sadiq Khan. He is a Civil Servant, not a Member of Parliament and as such, he must be told to cease from acting as such.\r\nHe is entitled to his opinion, but must not be allowed to go public, in the press or Television and insinuate he speaks for the people of Britain.",
