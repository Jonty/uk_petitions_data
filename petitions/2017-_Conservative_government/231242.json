        "additional_details": "A customer is an individual or business that purchases the goods or services produced by a business. Attracting customers is the primary goal of most public-facing businesses, because it is the customer who creates demand for goods and services.\" The UK taxpayer does not create a demand for HMRC, nor do we have a choice or any consumer rights when it comes to dealing with HMRC. Therefore, HMRC must revert to using the term \"taxpayer\" in all their publications and communications.",

This is not only misleading, but an outright mockery given the absence of choice over who and what you as a \"customer\" deal with.",
