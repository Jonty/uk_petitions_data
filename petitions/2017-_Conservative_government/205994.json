        "background": "In my area there are a great many Foreign Psychiatrists who are practising on the strength of having gained English through a \"Catch-Up\" Qualification. However, the diagnostic techniques of Psychiatry rely on an intimate knowledge of the Cultural uses of language, which these courses do not provide.",
