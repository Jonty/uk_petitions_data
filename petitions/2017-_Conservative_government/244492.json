        "action": "Withdraw the termination of vital Mybus school services.",
        "additional_details": "My daughters use one of these buses daily to get to and from school so I can fulfill my working contract. Without this bus I will be forced to give up working, as will many other parents in my position. Parents pay to use these services it is not a free service. If Metro promoted the buses better I'm sure they would be used more. The government are urging parents to leave their cars at home but this is not a very good incentive. Please please support our children and oppose this ridiculous proposal by signing this online petition.\r\nThankyou very much for reading.",
        "background": "Metro are proposing to withdraw vital school bus services across the district stating that they are not good value for money. These services provide vital transport for primary and secondary school children rely on them to get to school.",
