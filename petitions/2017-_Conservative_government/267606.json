Significantly, there are no sector specific regulatory standards. The NGBs are primarily concerned with performance standards; the wider sector going under the radar. Therefore it is unsurprising that the RSPCA, believe there is a 'Horse Crisis' in the UK;  the Haworth Case being the catalyst for urgent action. .",

To obtain a licence to trade, business\u2019 must meet minimum standards. Higher standards will attain a qualitymark from DEFRA.",
