        "additional_details": "I am advocating that music should be a basic learning subject, such as English or Mathematics, and that children and young people have the opportunity to learn how to play instruments and read music. Austerity and cuts to funding has led to schools and clubs having to make cuts in this area. We know the benefits of music to all sections of society. Let us protect future generations from all walks of life and give them this opportunity.",
