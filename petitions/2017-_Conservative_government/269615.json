        "additional_details": "As a gay man myself, it is incredibly frustrating knowing that I have to wait 3 months to donate blood after any sexual activity while a straight/heterosexual man can donate blood freely. The blood donation process should be about the he individual not their sexual orientation. Please give equal rights to gay and bi men wanting to donate blood and save lives of people who desperately need it.",
        "background": "Gay and bi men are still being treated unfairly under our government, it\u2019s about time that we give everyone the right to donate blood whatever their sexual behaviours.",
