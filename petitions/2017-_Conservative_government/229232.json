        "additional_details": "Families of nationals and non-UK nationals that provide an excellent service to the country are often left in a position where they cannot apply for state funeral funding because of the UK benefits system and its applications toward specific situations. Time of death cannot be predicted but private pension pay-ins are lifelong and should fund a funeral, which is the most costly part of some people's lives. The saddest day of one's life should never also be the most internally destructive.",
        "background": "When my partner's father passed on, his family struggled to pay the cost of his funeral, in spite of not applying for the funeral funding payout from the job centre, which they were eligible for. We see non-UK nationals work lifelong, only to see their families impoverished by the cost of funerals.",
