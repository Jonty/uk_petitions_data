        "action": "Introduce mandatory 3-yearly practical tests for drivers over retirement age",
        "additional_details": "The ability of elderly drivers to judge speed, make fast decisions or react to their environment is impeded as they age. Many are unaware of the danger they pose, while others deny it.\r\nPensioners with a driving licence may presently renew their licence with no eyesight test, no health check, and no driving test. They simply fill a form and continue driving.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for mandatory practical driving tests of drivers who wish to continue driving once they reach retirement age.",
        "background": "There are an unknown, unquantified number of elderly drivers over retirement age on UK roads.\r\nFor most, they passed a test 50, 60 or more years ago and hold a licence, yet their present driving abilities are totally unmonitored and not tested.\r\nMany are unaware of the potential danger they pose.",
