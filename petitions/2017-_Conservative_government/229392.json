        "additional_details": "Across the world, annually, we are losing 18.7 million acres of forests. Due to this we are left with only 3000 wild tigers across the world. It has been shown that the amazon rain-forest has lost 17% of its trees in the past 50 years, due to forest conversion. It is also shown that trees are our carbon sinks, therefore proving that they inhale the carbon we can't. If they can't inhale this carbon it will be let off into the atmosphere. 15% of all greenhouse gases are due to deforestation.",
        "background": "As a result of looking in class at deforestation, we have discovered that trees are declining at a rapid rate.We have decided that the number of trees being cut down for wooden objects such as building materials, need to be decreased.",
