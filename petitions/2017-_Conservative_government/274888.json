        "action": "Protect refugee family reunion in the case of no-deal Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The Refugees (Family Reunion) Bill aimed to relax restrictive rules on refugee family reunion in the UK. Despite overwhelming support from MPs and human rights charities, the Bill failed to complete its passage through Parliament before the end of session, due to government delays in passing a money resolution, which was required for progression to the next stage. The plans to end refugee family reunion if the UK leaves the EU without a deal go against the evident wishes of MPs and the public.",
        "background": "A recent article by The Guardian outlines Home Office plans to end family reunion for asylum-seeking children following Brexit. These plans directly oppose the Refugees (Family Reunion) Bill, that passed its second reading with overwhelming support, yet failed to progress due to government failures.",
