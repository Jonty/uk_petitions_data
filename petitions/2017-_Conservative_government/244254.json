        "additional_details": "During the banking crisis, the United Kingdom, on behalf of the men and women of this country rescued private banking corporations, with huge amounts of capital, capital amassed through taxation. \r\nThe Banking corporations have never expressed their appreciation to the men and women of the United Kingdom and now conspire to criminalise them in their times of hardship. \r\nThe United Kingdom therefore needs a publicly owned bank and I commend this motion to all of you, for all of you.",
        "background": "We have all seen recent developing stories about the corruption that exists within the private, corporate banking industry. This must stop, men and women are losing their homes illegally, being in some cases forced onto the streets with nowhere to go. Banks are profiteering from creating misery.",
