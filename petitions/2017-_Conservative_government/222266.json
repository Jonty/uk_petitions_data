Not only must Brexit be stopped it\u2019s perpetrators must be brought to justice for the damage they stand to inflict on our country either through premeditated malice or sheer incompetence",
        "background": "Senior Brexiters like Michael Gove, Nigel Farage, John Redwood, Jacob Reese Mogg and Bill Cash have been pushing for Brexit for years. In all that time they never bothered to think through or plan how to actually do it without harming our country. Some even stand to gain if it goes badly.",
