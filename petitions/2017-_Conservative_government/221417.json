        "additional_details": "I lived in a property for three years where the noises from above became a constant nuisance. All they were doing was walking but it was an awful noise, especially at night when they would be awake at 1am. My anger was not directed at my neighbours but at the law not looking after people living beneath other people.",
        "background": "Property in the UK, especially in London can be very close to one another. If you live beneath someone in a flat and they haven\u2019t got efficient soundproofing it can be a nuisance even though the people above aren\u2019t doing anything wrong.",
