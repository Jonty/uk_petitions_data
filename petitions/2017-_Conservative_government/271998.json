        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson is the only politician to stand up for what he believes and put his reputation and career on the line.\r\nHe's done this in order to carry through the will of the people, as voted for in the 2016 referendum.\r\nRemainers may be the loudest voice at the moment, but they are certainly not the majority. If we ran the referendum again those in favour of leaving the EU would be even greater.\r\nFurthermore despite what remainers say, we leavers knew exactly what we were voting for in 2016.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson is the best thing that has happened to this country in the last thirty years. He has injected new life into politics and is the sort of prime minister we need, but haven\u2019t had for a long time. He needs to be supported so that the referendum result of 2016 can finally be implemented.",
