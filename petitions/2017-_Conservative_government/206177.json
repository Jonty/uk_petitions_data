        "action": "Make all Historic Vehicles exempt from any scrappage scheme.",
        "additional_details": "This petition was being launched by Practical Classics Magazine, Britain's biggest selling classic car magazine, after it recently highlighted and helped reverse the decision of Ford UK to scrap a very rare Standard 10. The mint condition classic had been sent for scrap by Ford after it was traded in for a Transit van. There are many other examples of classic cars being sent for a similar fate. The worry is that rare examples of Britain's motor heritage will be lost for good.",
        "background": "British motoring heritage is under threat from both government and manufacturer backed scrappage schemes. We believe a simple way to avoid losing rare classic cars, particularly examples of family cars from the 1950s, 60s and 70s is to make all Historic Vehicles exempt from any scrappage process.",

The Government's 2009 vehicle scrappage scheme ended in 2010, and there is currently no Government-backed scrappage scheme. The Government does not have the power to compel private companies to exempt certain cars from scrappage."
