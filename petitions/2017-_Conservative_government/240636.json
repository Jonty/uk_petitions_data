        "additional_details": "Many non-binary people are prevented from self-identifying in institutions such as the NHS, HMRC, and when applying for a new passport. It not only is upsetting to not be allowed to be recognised by your own government as the gender that you self-identify with, but it leaves non-binary people feeling like we are not protected or seen as a people that deserve recognition in society.",
        "background": "Non-binary people in the UK are currently unable to identify on legal documentation that their gender is neither male or female. We want to apply pressure on the UK Government to allow non-binary, gender non-conforming, gender-fluid and intersex people the right to self-identify.",
