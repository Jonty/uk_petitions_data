        "additional_details": "Under this ancient procedure, all persons, whether peers or commoners, may be prosecuted and tried by the two Houses for any crimes whatever. The House of Commons determines when an impeachment should be instituted, and to therefore trigger this process, a petition with 100,000 signatures will lead to this option being debated.",
        "background": "Although political commentators say that the process of impeachment is now obsolete, it now begs the question, in light of the unlawful advice (and severity thereof) given by the Prime Minister to the Queen, whether impeachment of the PM should be at least debated in the House of Commons.",
