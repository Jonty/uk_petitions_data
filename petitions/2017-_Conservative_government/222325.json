        "additional_details": "On Friday 15 June 2018 a private members bill aiming to make upskirting a criminal offense was presented to Parliament by Liberal Democrat MP for Bath Wera Hobhouse and had support from all Parties and the Government but was de railed at second reading by Sir Christopher Chope who is the Conservative MP for Christchurch is Dorset this has delayed the process, 1 MP should not have the power to stop our parliamentarians from making laws to protect us.",
        "background": "Current parliamentary procedure allows 1 MP to shout \u201cobject\u201d in the chamber duing a private members bill in order to block the process of the bill. In the UK Parliament we have 650 MPs how is it fair that if 649 MPs back the bill to become law how can 1 MP block the process this is wrong and unfair",
