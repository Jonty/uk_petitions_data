        "action": "Make flashing front and/or rear lights on pedal bicycles illegal.",
        "additional_details": "If every road user were to have a constantly flashing light then there would be many accidents as a result. Also with the advances in LED technology even those front lights which do not flash are blinding if the beam is set at an incorrect angle. People should have compulsory education regarding safe use of pushbikes.",
        "background": "I am a professional driver. In the last couple of years there has been a rise to epidemic proportion of pushbikes on the roads which are displaying flashing lights. Some of which are so intense that they actually cause serious discomfort and distraction to other road users. These lights are a danger",
