        "background": "Currently in Borough Green, Kent, there are approximately 4,500 residents. A new proposal to build 3,000 extra homes in Borough Green could go ahead, possibly quadrupling the population. This would put great stress on the community, local infrastructure and the surrounding countryside.",
