        "additional_details": "At the moment the rules states 2 KC registered litters per bitch, this can be overcome by registering extra females in a litter and using the extra papers on the original bitch.\r\n\r\nThere is no law regulating unscrupulous breeding.\r\n\r\n1. Licence breeders, limiting the amount of breeding bitches per breeder, inspect regularly to maintain welfare and standards.\r\n2. Spaying and neutering should be compulsory. Stop puppy farms and back yard breeders.\r\n3. Tougher penalties for people in breach of the law.",
        "background": "The country is awash with animals being dumped and abandoned, shelters are bursting at the seams. Healthy animals are being euthanised as there simply aren't enough homes available. Bitches are being bred repeatedly for financial gain. So called designer breeds were previously mongrels.",
