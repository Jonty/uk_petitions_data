        "additional_details": "A briefing paper from the House of Commons Library titled \u2018Brexit & EU Citizenship\u2019 questions whether EU citizenship can be lost. \r\n\r\nClauses within EU law define an individuals citizenship status but Clemens M. Rieder (University of Lancaster School of Law) states \u201ccitizenship cannot simply be taken away through a majority decision, especially against the will of the individual\u201d. The link between the citizen and the Union, he argues, would only cease to exist if the EU itself ceased to exist.",
        "background": "For the 48% that voted to remain, and the many more that have since deflected from Leave, the thought of being stripped, forcibly, of their EU citizenship is not one taken lightly, especially for those born after the UK joined the EU whose EU citizenship is considered a birth right.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to negotiate to allow UK citizens to retain EU citizenship after Brexit, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
