        "action": "Ban the covering of faces at political events to stop extremist violence.",
        "additional_details": "In 2014 a parliamentary bill \"Face Coverings (Prohibition) Bill\" failed due to the actions of the following MP's falsely claiming Muslim sensitivities about the Burka. (Keith Vaz, Gerald Kaufman, Rushanara Ali, Lyn Brown)\r\n\r\nThe failure of this bill in 2014 fuelled the rise of political violence in the UK by the likes of Antifa, who the US government has declared \"domestic terrorists\". These and other groups can still legally cover their faces at political events whilst publicly proclaiming the use of violence to achieve political goals.",
        "background": "Other countries have banned the covering of faces at political gatherings due to the rise of extremist political violence which act as a huge drain on police resources. A new law is needed in the UK, banning the covering of faces at political events to prevent extremist political violence.",
