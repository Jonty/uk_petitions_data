        "additional_details": "Tax on income is fair, being as there is needs within the country which need paying for, such as many free services. Although anything over contracted hours should be tax free, working extra hours is a bonus as you have the option to earn more money, but tax has already been paid on my basic hours, same as everyone else who is employed. Which is fair, but if it\u2019s chosen to work extra hours to earn more, the tax should be reduced or cut completely meaning overtime is worth while.",
        "background": "After working many hours overtime to gain a better income to be able to improve myself, I end up finding a large amount taken in tax, I\u2019m happy enough paying tax on my basic hours as I understand the need for money within the country, but I find being taxed on overtime is unfair as it\u2019s optuonal.",
