        "action": "Banning Plastic bags given by shops and replacing with a paper option.",
        "additional_details": "Swaths of African countries such as Kenya and Cameroon have pioneered this banning of plastic bags, and it prompts the question of why we as a \u2018developed country\u2019 have not yet. Conversely to the University of Arizona\u2019s study showing the dangers of reusable bags to store food, the study was funded by those with vested interest in the lightweight plastic bag industry, I propose the use of paper or a another biodegradable option to stop this worry of contamination. In fact the banning of plastic bags is seen to have a positive effect, with the levels of Malaria dropping in Rwanda owing to the ban.",
        "background": "I believe that the time for plastic to be treated as a basic need and something to be used and abused is over, as in our modern world we see the detrimental effects of plastic more than anything - plastic and it\u2019s convenience is not equal to our environment.",
