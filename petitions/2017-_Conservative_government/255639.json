        "additional_details": "Salons, gyms etc are advertising stronger tubes offers for more and more time on the sunbeds. Skin Cancer rates are rising, there were 15,906 cases of Malignant Melanoma in 2015 and 86% of those were preventable. Despite repeated warnings from cancer charities, the NHS, government etc the rates are rising and will continue to do so unless something is done. We believe the only way to do this is to ban sunbeds completely.",
        "background": "We would like our government to follow Australia and ban all sunbeds in the UK. As a skin cancer survivor this is something I feel strongly about. Sunbeds are unregulated and unsafe. There is an age limit of 18 for usage but this is regularly flouted and there is no way to affectively police it.",
