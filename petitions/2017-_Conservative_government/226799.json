        "additional_details": "Some common symptoms of a pineal cyst can be\r\n* Constant headaches\r\n* vomiting and nausea\r\n* weakness and loss of feeling in one side\r\n* abnormal eye movement and blurriness in vision\r\n* changes in memory and personality\r\n* changes in speech\r\n* drowsiness and seizures\r\n* increased anxiety\r\n* constant fatigue\r\nOther countries offer surgery to remove the cyst but we want more help and support in this country so people don't have to go abroad for help at the cost of tens of thousands of pounds.",
        "background": "Sadly Great Britain does not acknowledge symptomatic Pineal Cysts as other countries do. This leaves sufferers with awful symptoms and no offer of the much needed surgery to help them. This needs to change to allow sufferers to live their lives free from pain.",
