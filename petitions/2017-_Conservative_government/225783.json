        "additional_details": "Research has shown that working mums set better examples to their children, and hands-on mums shape more emotionally rounded children. But mums are currently forced to choose between giving up work, not seeing their children, or struggling financially. Becoming a mum is being treated as a punishable offence. To the benefit of creating well-rounded children with strong role models and views of working and earning an income, mums must be supported in being the examples our children need us to be.",

Give mums returning to work an allowance towards childcare OR:\r\n3. Provide 15h/week subsidised nursery from 1-3 years to cover gap between maternity pay ending and full nursery hours starting",
