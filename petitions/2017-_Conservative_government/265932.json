        "additional_details": "From climate change protests to speaking out about pressing issues on social media, this generation of teenagers have demonstrated that they're willing to use their voice and the technology on offer to push for change. Unfortunately, whilst we seem to trust them with their own bodies at sixteen, we don't trust them with the ability to vote for their own futures. This needs to change. A balance must be struck that ensures the young can build a world they wish to participate in.",
        "background": "Put bluntly, sixteen and seventeen year olds must stand by and watch as others decide their future for them. They've proven recently, however, that they're willing to take positive and decisive action to protest issues such as climate change. We should give them the power to write their own future.",
