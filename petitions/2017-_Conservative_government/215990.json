You are only able to adopt these children if you live in the US. We believe this is unfair, every child should have the right to a loving stable family no matter what. We are petitioning parliment to change the legislation to allow UK citizens to give these children a fighting chance. There are some amazing families here who could give these children amazing lives. PLEASE GIVE US THAT CHANCE.",

These children are placed into orphanages and institutions where they are subjected to multiple forms of abuse, starvation and neglect in many forms.",
