        "additional_details": "After reading news story after news story about serious accidents on bouncy slides, also hearing from friends about children hurting themselves, it seems everyone has a story of some degree about the dangers of these slides and we believe it's cause for a total ban on this equipment.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, please sign this petition and hopefully we can have this matter brought up in Parliament.",
        "background": "Our daughter, one week after her 4th birthday, broke her arm sliding down and rolling off the end of a bouncy slide. Hearing the agony she was in and the trauma she went through to get better was heartbreaking and would not want any other child to go through this preventable accident.",
