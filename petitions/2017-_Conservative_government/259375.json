        "additional_details": "The UK Government should create a grant available specifically to institutions and companies developing green technology with a detailed plan to bring it to market, with the purpose of speeding that process along.\r\nTo qualify, applicants will need to demonstrate that the net impact of their project, over its supply chain and useful life, will be carbon-zero, carbon-negative, or otherwise beneficial to waterways, seas, local and global ecosystems. A caveat protecting British jobs is also possible.",
        "background": "There is no shortage of news about developments in technology with better efficiency, zero carbon emissions and other reductions in environmental impact. But the slow pace at which these technologies come to market and the difficulty they face competing with dominant dirty technology is frustrating.",
