        "action": "Introduce law making it much easier to recognise which packaging can be recycled",
        "additional_details": "The proposal has two intended benefits:\r\n1) Making it easier for consumers (particularly those with imperfect vision) to recognise products with less recycling potential and hence to make better informed decisions on which products to buy\r\n2) The larger recycling labels will reduce the space available to manufacturers for 'promotional' labelling hence creating commercial pressure to improve their products' recycling potential",
        "background": "Currently all recycling labels on food packaging tend to be around the same small size (approximately 1cm wide).\r\nThis petition proposes the introduction of legal minimum size requirements so that 'Check Locally' labels must be at least 2cm square and 'Not Yet Recycled' must be at least 4cm square.",
