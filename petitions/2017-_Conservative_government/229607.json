        "additional_details": "The UK is meant to be a representative democracy.  However, parties will often choose a favoured member to run for a seat to maximise their chances of winning, even though they have no genuine connection to the local community.  As a result, Parliament is not a collection of community representatives, but a collection of preferred party members.",
        "background": "In order for Parliament to become truly representative, this petition proposes introducing legislation to require persons standing for Parliament to be resident in their constituency for at least 12 months prior to election day.",
