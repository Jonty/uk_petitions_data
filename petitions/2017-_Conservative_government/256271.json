Within the Westminster bubble MPs from all parties debate, argue and frustrate the political process with more focus on their political careers. If these Members of Parliament had been in business, they would have been sacked by now.\r\n\r\nThis petition is to provide an opportunity to change the electoral rules to ensure we improve the standard of MPs in the future.",
