        "additional_details": "The recent Committee on Climate Change (CCC) report concludes the UK can reach net zero by 2050 with an investment of ~1-2% of GDP. If other countries follow suit we have a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees by 2100.\r\n\r\nIn the Cold War the UK spent just over 5% of GDP on defence and in WW2 it peaked at 53%. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.\r\n\r\nThe UK is both a major historical carbon emitter and in a strong economic and technological situation to be able to effect change now.",
        "background": "The UK parliament has declared we are in a climate emergency so let's act like it! \r\n\r\nWe would like the government to commission the CCC to determine the percentage of GDP required for the UK to reach net zero by 2030 and 2040 in order for the UK to be a world leader in climate change mitigation.",
