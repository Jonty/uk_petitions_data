        "additional_details": "Not only is the Hemp plant one of the most versatile crops once heavily relied on by the British Government for its naval and textile applications and grown in every single county in the UK, the higher potency Cannabis Sativa crop is now known to treat a wide range of medical conditions. Moreover with legalisation of this plant in Canada citizens should begin to ask: \u201cif this is legal in one of the Queen\u2019s sovereign territories; why not in her homeland?\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is wrongful prohibition.",
        "background": "This is not just a petition for the legalisation of a substance with, now proven, wide ranging applications to human wellbeing. But a demand for recognition by the Government that the plant was originally made illegal on a comparatively ill-informed basis when considering what is understood today.",
