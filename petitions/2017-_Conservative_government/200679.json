        "action": "Change business rates for child care providers and make them zero VAT rated.",
        "additional_details": "With the onset of the Government scheme to offer 30 hours \"free\" childcare to parents, the minimum funding leaves the childcare provider liable to make up the shortfall. Increases in business rates & VAT charges are making this unsustainable for childcare providers. Maintained providers are already able to claim taxes paid under Section 33 of the VAT Act 1994. \r\nThe removal of business rates & VAT rating would enable providers to continue to provide the services required without financial burden.",
        "background": "Childcare has recently faced huge increases in business rates for their properties. Coupled with this, they pay VAT on purchases but are unable to reclaim this to offset against the business. Along with increased minimum wage, pensions, and 30 hours funding this is leaving them financially unstable.",
