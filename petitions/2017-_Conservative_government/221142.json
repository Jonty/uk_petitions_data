        "additional_details": "A person caring for a disabled person 35+hrs a week can apply for carers allowance (CA) provided you meet certain criteria. You can\u2019t be under 16.  A 2010 BBC survey estimated 700k young carers who though they may care for 35hrs+ a week aren\u2019t entitled to CA.  You can\u2019t be in full time education or study for 21hrs a week - if you attend school, college or Uni you aren\u2019t entitled to CA.  You can\u2019t earn more than \u00a3120 a week. & receive CA. The system ignores care outside normal working hours.",
        "background": "I believe that someone who cares for someone else shouldn\u2019t be denied by criteria from seeking other employment, studying or trying their best to continue living their lives.",
