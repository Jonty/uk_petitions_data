        "additional_details": "There is no law to protect you against a bad landlord. They can get away with what ever they want it seems, councils are helpless to step in and help unless you are food related. So unless you are prepared to pay for a solicitor to step in you are on your own. Even if you do have the money, you may find that your contract is one sided - the landlords side. Help me change this, to help all those that are vulnerable that have no where to turn, to maybe save their business and their investment.",
        "background": "After going through 14 year ongoing battle of neglect from my landlord  myself, i was shock to discovered that the law does not protect the commercial property sector. Millions are being left to fend for themselves, often resulting in having to close their business, most having lost a lot of money.",

For example, you could ask the Government to provide funding for a dispute resolution scheme, if that's what you would like to happen."
