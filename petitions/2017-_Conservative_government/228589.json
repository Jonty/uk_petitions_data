In primary schools the data from the National Child Measurement Programme could be used to measure progress.\r\nEducational attainment would be expected to increase as a result.\r\n\r\nSome factors:\r\n- Screen time: video games, mobiles etc\r\n- Taxi of Mum/Dad\r\n- Over-protective parents limiting kids' freedom to roam\r\n- Erosion of PE time in primary schools by pressure of needing academic success for league tables\r\n- Erosion of play/break times and dinner time by same pressure",
        "background": "Planned exercise should be fun, incorporating lifestyle / healthy eating guidance:\r\n- Prevention is better than cure / better than keep bemoaning pressure on NHS etc\r\n- Learning at school should be about whole person and their future life chances, not just the constraints of the curriculum",
