        "additional_details": "Victims may be threatened or manipulated by the perpetrator and the law needs to take this into account. I want to change the law so that if a witness is concerned or has seen something, the police will take it seriously and take steps to investigate whether or not the victim agrees that there is a problem. The victim may be very scarred and or not have the courage to talk to the police, so it goes on and before you know it it\u2019s bad or the victim is dead. It shouldn\u2019t come to that.",
        "background": "If a person is a victim of sexual, emotional or mental abuse and afraid to speak up, admit they are being abused, it is too difficult for the police to act before it it too late. Review the law and make it easier for crimes to be investigated and prosecuted when the victim refuses to co-operate.",
