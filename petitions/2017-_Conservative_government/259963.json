        "additional_details": "We propose the creation of a National Disabilities Employment Service to help people with physical and mental disabilities look for jobs and give them specialist training in basic workplace skills and knowledge. The service would also support disabled people while they're in work, offer free counselling services and provide disabilities training which would be compulsory for every employer and employee in the UK to have, whether they're private or public sector.",
        "background": "85% of the 700,000 Autistic people in the UK are unemployed and disabled people in general are more than twice as likely to be unemployed. This is partly because many employers are reluctant to employ those with mental conditions they don't have any knowledge of and can't make reasonable adjustments",
