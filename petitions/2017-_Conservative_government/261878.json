        "additional_details": "Data produced by WWF states the food industry is responsible for almost 60% of biodiversity loss globally.\r\n\r\nConsumers need to make simple lifestyle changes, whilst producers need to find cleaner ways of working.\r\n\r\nDisplaying a product's impact on the packaging would have two main benefits:\r\n- Easier for the consumer to make an informed decision about which product they choose.\r\n- Manufacturers and supermarkets would need to work harder to reduce their CO2 emissions to reduce their climate impact.",
        "background": "The UK food industry should make it clear on their packaging how much CO2 the production of their product makes - from farm to factory to store.\r\nThe food industry contributes 25% of all global CO2 emissions, compared to transport which contributes 14%. We need to take steps to reduce this urgently.",
