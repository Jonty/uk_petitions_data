        "action": "Encourage greater awareness of the impact of facial palsy in the UK",
        "additional_details": "There are over 50 different causes of facial palsy. It can happen to anyone, at any time. It\u2019s more than losing the ability to smile.\r\nMisdiagnosis, ineffective treatments and lack of understandings are prevalent throughout NHS. Many people wait a year or more for specialist appointments \u2013 reducing the success of the few treatments available and increases the burden on the NHS.\r\nWe ask the Government to help us raise awareness and improve the outcomes for people diagnosed with facial palsy.",
        "background": "Over 100,000 people are thought to be affected by facial palsy in the UK. There are few nationally funded investigations for treatment or cures and with the pressure on the NHS, support is limited. The long-term impact of facial palsy is immense. Help us raise awareness for more research and support",
