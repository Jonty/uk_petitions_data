        "additional_details": "UK currently has a small number of green bridges - also called wild animal bridges or ecoducts. Instead in Europe, more are being built. They could become an important part of the sustainability of future transport projects by creating safe crossing points for wildlife movements, for people and benefit pollinators as well. These bridges also can led to a big reduction in accidents caused by wild animals. Cost reducing solution: convert old, unused bridges into Green Bridges.",
        "background": "Lots of wild animals die on the roads every day. These animals are part of the nature, part of our life. They could be potential danger in case of an accident due to their size, weight. Build more ECODUCTS to let them cross the railway lines and roads safety and reduce the risk of any accident.",
