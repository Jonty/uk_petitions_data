        "action": "Allow growing of industrial hemp without licence & fund research into uses",
        "additional_details": "Hemp plastics are fully biodegradable and recyclable. This alone should be reason enough to consider fully legalizing hemp farming, getting rid of the need for a license to grow and making it easier for farmers to make growing it profitable. Add to that the fact hemp can be used to make paper, textiles, medication and more it really is a no brainer. Hemp has a much shorter life cycle than timber with many harvests being ready in just 60 days. Let\u2019s set an example of a forward thinking nation.",
        "background": "At this critical time for the environment an easy solution to many of the problems our nation creates is the humble hemp plant. It can create many products that oil based products make and does not do the same damage. We also request funding towards its use to get the best out of this plant.",
