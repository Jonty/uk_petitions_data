        "additional_details": "There is Foundation Degree Courses but different years of studying can prevent students from getting grants and bursaries. Grants and bursaries should be available for all Foundation Degree students on different years spent studying made available from Colleges, Universities and Student Finance. Funding can help students with buying books, travel cost, driving lessons and medical cost for sick children and young adults, and saving money for a rainy day.",
        "background": "Students and single parents especially need more funding for studying Higher Education Courses. This can prevent financial hardship. Funding can enable a student to accomplish more goals, better prospects which helps completing their course. More funding should come from Student Finance.",
