It has nothing to do with employment status.\r\n\r\nESA is an income replacement for people unable to work due to illness. \r\n\r\nBeing different benefits with different purposes, they have very different eligibility criteria. Merging assessments would cause huge harm, especially for PIP claimants in work or planning to move into work.\r\n\r\nUC should be a lesson about merging unrelated benefits.\r\n\r\nRudd's speech https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/closing-the-gap-between-intention-and-experience?utm_source=dwppressoffice&utm_medium=twitter&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=",
        "background": "In a speech on 5/3/19, Work & Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd announced plans to merge assessments for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment & Support Allowance (ESA) from 2021. Seeing as PIP & ESA are different benefits with different purposes, we feel this would be extremely dangerous.",
