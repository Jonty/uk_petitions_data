The United Kingdom is one of the best unions ever created, and we should protect it. It's clear that Scotland don't want another referendum.\r\n\r\nLet's protect our union - the best union ever created.",

Let's protect our precious union and create a cross-party agreement to disallow a 2nd independence referendum.",
