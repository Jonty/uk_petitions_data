        "additional_details": "Tamil asylum seekers who have been granted refugee status have proven to be hardworking, entrepreneurial and significant contributors to the economy and British society. Granting asylum will prevent the opportunity cost of idling Tamil asylum seekers and help grow the UK economy at this crucial time of need. Nonetheless, it will also serve as a testament to the goodwill of the British people and the government's commitment to protecting the vulnerable Tamils whose lives are at serious risk.",
        "background": "Tamil asylum seekers in the UK are victims of violence and persecution in Sri Lanka who have entered into a process of refugee determination. Considering they are mostly supported by public funds granting asylum will instantly enable them to contribute to the pot of Income Tax and NI.",
