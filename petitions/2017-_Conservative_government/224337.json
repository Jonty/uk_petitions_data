        "additional_details": "We are well aware of what goes on with sick individuals who think it is ok to abuse animals but we don't need to see it on a daily basis.\r\n For example, the dog meat trade in Thailand/China etc . We do not need to watch a video of a dog being tortured and screaming for help. This does not raise awareness it just makes me mad/angry/upset and left feeling so low. It really needs to stop!! Please sign and join me to get Facebook to take action, it's about time!!",
