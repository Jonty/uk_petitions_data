        "additional_details": "This makes it particularly challenging when it come to regular prescriptions that are needed as you can not receive these from a surgery you are not signed up with. To allow students that are living away from home to be signed up two surgeries means they are able to get the care they are entitled to without great hassle.",
        "background": "Students are only able to be signed up with one doctors surgery at a time, which most universities advise to be the one nearest to where they\u2019re studying. Students also have incredibly long breaks from uni over summer where they are unable to visit a doctor in their home town if needs be.",
