        "additional_details": "- Section 117 are entitles people to free treatment. There is no provision for exemption from prescription charges which is a contravention.\r\n- Not all benefits received by people with a mental illness entitle them to an exemption from the prescription charge. \r\n- People with a mental illness have a lower rate of adherence to medicines. The illness is only controlled by medication, not cured.\r\n- Exemption from the prescription charge would solve all these issues.",
        "background": "Having a mental illness is a long term condition that requires medication to keep the illness under control.  Therefore it is not a choice but a necessity.  This should not be taxed.",
