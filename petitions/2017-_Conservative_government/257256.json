        "action": "Unsign the Lisbon treaty to avoid being locked in to the EU in 2020.",
        "additional_details": "From 2020 the Lisbon treaty ensures the EU member states are committed to ever closer bonds to the EU through the systematic and steady removal of such autonomies as running our own governments, laws, currencies, armed forces, boarders, land registry, planning and stock markets or to have have EU parliamentary powers of veto as allowed to member states today and especially and most importantly our own country and union.",
        "background": "Our failure to leave the EU so far in  2019 and with little chance of it happening in 2019, I want us to withdraw our signature to the Lisbon treaty and to all that being a signatory entails, to be legally sure we cannot be bound by it should our EU exit still be on going into 2020 or beyond it.",
