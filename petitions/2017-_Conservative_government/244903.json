        "additional_details": "Many people have lost kids due to post traumatic stress or depression. Their kids are their life. They have never harmed them, just themselves or feel low. Taking a child and stopping them from having regular contact and not being able to get legal aid to fight unless you have been convicted of child abuse is so wrong - it should be the other way around. Some mums get more depressed and end up worse, sometimes they even suceed in suicide because their children gave their life meaning. Give these mums and dads legal aid back. They haven\u2019t abused a child.",
        "background": "A mother shouldn\u2019t lose her child because she\u2019s experienced a death or something to become ill, especially if they have never harmed their child. They need help and support not for their life to be taken to make them worse or more suicidal.",
