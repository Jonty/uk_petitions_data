        "additional_details": "Britain signed up to the VCLT in 1970 and was ratified by Parliament in 1971 BEFORE Heath signed us up to the EEC.  The VCLT stipulates that all sides should show 'good faith' and that any law required to be repealed to enable a treaty must be SPECIFICALLY repealed and not ASSUMED to be repealed in order to facilitate the Treaty.  Neither of these stipulations were implemented.\r\n\r\nTherefore, membership of the EEC and subsequent treaties from the Single European Act were illegal for Britain to sign",
        "background": "There has long been controversy as to the legality of Britain being a member of the EEC/EU which appears to be contrary to the VCLT:1969 and the British Bill of Rights:1689 and various Treason Laws.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the Government acknowledged this and sought clarification.",
