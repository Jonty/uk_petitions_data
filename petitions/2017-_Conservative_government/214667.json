They say it will be more expensive to have different sets of rules, but I don\u2019t agree with them.  If they want a UK-wide framework, then maybe they could look towards having a federalised framework rather than a \u2018power grab\u2019.",

But now, the UK government is planning a \u2018power grab\u2019 on these areas such as agriculture, farming and fishing.",
