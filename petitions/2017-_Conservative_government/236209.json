We are losing green space, have huge traffic issues, and struggle with infrastructure.",
        "background": "This petition calls on the government to take the cumulative impact of previous high levels of housing growth into account when assessing where new housing should be built. The OAN methodology needs to be re-designed to ensure places like Wokingham Borough retain their identity",
