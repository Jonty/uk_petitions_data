        "action": "Abolish the House of Lords, replace it with elected 101 People\u2019s Representatives",
        "additional_details": "Independent parliamentary oversight is needed in the U.K. to end this constant awarding of peerages for life to those who have supported a specific party or political leader. Recent examples include Shami Chakrabati as a personal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and his policies, and Kate Fall as a staff member of David Cameron. This is not what Oliver Cromwell stood for and cannot possibly lead to independent thinking and scrutiny for the good of the country.",
        "background": "The Lords is full of ex politicians and party supporters who are not representative of the people and who vote and support party lines. This is not acceptable in an oversight role and we now need a smaller number of elected ordinary people, maybe one per U.K. county, not constituencies.",
