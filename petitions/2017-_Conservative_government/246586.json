This has in some areas caused so many family homes to be converted into properties for usually single males, totally destabilising the community, families to leave as they don't know/trust their neighbours, residents not feeling safe, tenants only being transient and not laying down roots in the areas so don't care about the area.",
        "background": "Local Planning Departments should enforce Landlords who own a great number of properties in an area to keep the community make up balance to avoid unrest and destabilise a community by chasing the easy/quick/lucrative section of society to house in their properties.",
