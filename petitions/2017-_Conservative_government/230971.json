        "additional_details": "I completely understand the ethos behind encouraging those receiving benefits to take increasing levels of financial responsibility and to work towards independent living. However, the increased uncertainty for landlords caused by the freeze on LHA rates, and the strong preference towards the allowance being paid to the claimant, disadvantages vulnerable adults and leaves many trapped in addiction and homelessness. https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN07008",
        "background": "Removing a tenant's choice to have housing benefit paid directly to a landlord has meant that few landlords are prepared to house claimants. I fear this will continue (within UC) to contribute to homelessness for many and cause a number of deaths via exposure this winter.",
