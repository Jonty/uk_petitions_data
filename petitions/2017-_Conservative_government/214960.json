        "action": "Make it illegal to charge a single room supplement",
        "additional_details": "I have spoken with several people who often have to travel on their own, many of them believing the supplement to be unfair and unnecessary, especially as there is usually nothing special about the single rooms they are allocated. In my experience, there isn't usually anything exceptional offered in the single room which one could say would attract a surcharge. The rooms are usually tiny, with neither room to \"swing a cat\", nor a particularly special view outside the window. If you agree that single travellers face unfair discrimination, please sign the petition.",
        "background": "This is a petition to ask parliament to make it illegal for hoteliers and tour operators to apply a surcharge to the hotel or holiday booking of anyone travelling on their own. It is routine in the travel industry for a holidaymaker to pay a supplement for occupying a single-bedded hotel room.",
