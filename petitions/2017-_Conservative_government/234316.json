        "additional_details": "There are many people in the uk who have had incompetent plastic surgery in the uk and need continuous revision work. The big hospital groups in the UK don\u2019t appear to take this seriously and seem to keep offering corrective surgery without resolving the issue - the surgeons ability. surgeons should be offered more training when having complaints and stop doing patients while they are in training. If it\u2019s a continuous cycle of them needing to revise their patients they should be struck off.",
        "background": "stricter laws should be in place for plastic surgeons when they perform a surgery incompetently. There should be a guideline for extra training if their patients are needing corrective surgery.",

For example, you could ask the Government pass a law to regulate who can practice plastic surgery in the UK and set the penalties they face if they fail to meet professional standards if that's something you would like to see happen.\r\n"
