        "additional_details": "The community of rough sleepers in the tunnel, which has now been closed off with a metal gate, was longstanding. One of them was Gyula Remes, whose tragic death in December sparked national attention and expressions of sympathy. \r\n\r\nSince then, they've faced continual harassment from authorities. The 1824 Vagrancy Act, and Community Protection Notices, were used to threaten \u00a320,000 fines for crimes like \"loitering.\" Now homelessness is being forced out of sight and out of mind.",
        "background": "Rough sleepers on the steps of the Palace of Westminster are being evicted from the tunnel where they've sheltered for at least a year. No support or warning was given, and most are left sleeping in the elements. This is on the Parliamentary Estate - show some compassion and reverse the eviction!",
