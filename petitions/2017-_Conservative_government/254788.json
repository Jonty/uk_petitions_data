        "action": "Hold a people's vote on Brexit, using single transferable vote",
        "additional_details": "There is a lot of support for a people's vote, both in parliament and among the public. \r\n\r\nUsing a single transferable vote with a number of plausible options, the will of the people can be clearer. These options could/should be the options presented to parliament on 27th March, and should include withdrawal from Brexit, and a \"No Deal\" Brexit.\r\n\r\nIn STV voters prioritise the options. Options are eliminated one by one with votes for those options transferring to the next prioritised option.",
        "background": "Government and Parliament are having a difficult time agreeing the format of Brexit. The original Brexit referendum was a simple yes/no and the majority margin was very small. This means that those in power are working with a limited knowledge of what the British people actually want from Brexit.",
