        "additional_details": "Seems such a small thing but trying to explain to a little boy he can't have an ice cream on the seafront but the other children can is heart breaking. I believe it's about time businesses were forced to supply an alternative to dairy to meet the growing needs of intolerant children and adults.",
        "background": "A growing number of children are being daignosed with dairy intolerance. Wouldn't it be nice to stop at your local ice cream parlour and be able to buy a dairy alternative ice cream or take your diary intolerant child out for a milkshake at any cafe without having to check with them first?",
