        "action": "Mandatory labeling for all manufactured plastics to improve UK plastic recycling",
        "additional_details": "In order to improve the recycling rates of UK plastic, we propose an amendment to existing legislation that introduces mandatory labelling for all manufactured plastics to clearly indicate the plastic type using the internationally accepted Mobius recycling logo and relevant number, except where impractical to do so (for example for small plastic components) in which case the recyclability and plastic type should be identified on the sales packaging or manufacturers website as applicable.",
        "background": "The current UK recycling rate of 45.2% is not adequate to protect our rivers and seas from plastic pollution. As more plastic, and more waste is being created, we need to make it easier to recycle. Currently consumers are confused by which type of plastic it is and how and where it can be recycled.",
