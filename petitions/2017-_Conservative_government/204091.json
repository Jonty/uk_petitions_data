        "action": "The government must release the studies into the economic impact of Brexit.",
        "additional_details": "The government has given as its reason for not releasing the studies as the national interest. It is not difficult to see, of course, that their main concern is the survival of the government itself, and not the people it is elected to represent. This is a matter of huge importance for the future of the country, and in a democracy it is surely the public's right to know the results of studies that have been paid for out of public tax revenue. It is, after all, our jobs and economic well-being that are at stake.",
        "background": "The government commissioned a number of studies into the expected economic impact of Brexit, and is now refusing to release these studies.  In a democracy it is the public's right to know the results of studies that have been paid for out of public tax revenue.",
