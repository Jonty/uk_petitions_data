        "additional_details": "It's no good giving all dogs microchips if all vets, agencies and other establishments do not scan for microchips as standard procedure every and any time an animal is dealt with whether dead or alive.\r\n\r\nCompulsory microchipping does not work without compulsory scanning and responsible owners are being let down as we have to rely on a 'Duty of Care' which doesn't work now",
        "background": "The new compulsory microchipping regulations don't go far enough and have only been put into place to save money on the management of stray dogs. Nothing is mentioned about the need to scan microchips and check registration to help find missing and stolen pets.",
