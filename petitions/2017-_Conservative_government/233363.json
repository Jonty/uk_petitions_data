        "additional_details": "Your average loaf of bread costs around 95p, a loaf of gluten free bread is anywhere between \u00a31.99-\u00a33.80, the bread is also considerably smaller. This is the same with most free from products. Some people may choose to be gluten free however others like myself have no choice and are forced to pay extortionate prices for every day items, leaving many on lower incomes or SSP having to make further crucial decisions on products others would deem essential and ordinary.",
        "background": "Due to health reasons I have had to remove all gluten and dairy from my diet. Having done so I am shocked at the price a weekly shop is costing me. I assume there are many others in positions like myself, unable to work and spending a lot more on basic items, struggling to pay for food.",
