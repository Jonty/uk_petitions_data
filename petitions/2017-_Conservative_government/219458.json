        "additional_details": "All attempts by the present government to secure favourable exit conditions have failed to produce agreements which would at least prevent the well-being of the British people from worsening, or even any coherent resolution. To leave without any deal would be disastrous to the economy. A multitude of experts testify to this. Many people have changed their minds since the referendum (which is not legally binding), and to remain in the EU would then be the most reasonable option.",
        "background": "`Meaningful votes' as planned only offer the choice of leaving under an agreement negotiated by the government or leaving without any agreement. If both are unacceptable, to remain a member of the EU should be considered and voted on by Parliament as the solution.",
