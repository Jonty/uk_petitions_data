        "action": "Remove the disgusting policy of a tiered probate tax from our statute books.",
        "additional_details": "The government forced this change in legislation through avoiding full scrutiny using a statutory instrument rather than a new piece of legislation. This policy was lead by Lucy Frazier MP and supported by Kevin Foster, Robert Goodwill, Trudy Harrison, Peter Heaton-Jones, Nigel Huddleston, Amanda Milling, Maggie Throup and Michael Tomlinson. The government already extort millions through inheritance tax and now want to add a triple taxation to our dead. This policy is just outrageous.",
        "background": "As of the first of April 2019 an exploitative, underhand and frankly disgusting policy of taxing families to undertake the administration of probate assessments based on the size of their estates will come into force. This tiered tax was silently passed through government and is an outrage.",
