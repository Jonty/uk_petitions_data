        "additional_details": "The stress of a new expecting mum having to find a new job after getting let go is difficult. It shouldn\u2019t matter how long they have been in the job for , a week a month or 5 years. As time goes on it gets more difficult for pregnant ladies to find a job because realistically no employers want to employ someone who\u2019s going off on mat leave. It has happened to myself and it is the worst feeling in the world of not knowing what you are going to do to support yourself or your baby when they arrive.",
        "background": "I was 11 weeks pregnant when I told my employer I was expecting,I then got let go, even though I was on probation period I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to sack pregnant women who needs to be financially stable for their new born baby arriving.",
