        "additional_details": "I have personally witnessed how the lack of funding has affected the quality of teaching especially to those with learning difficulties (these individuals do not have the relevant support in place because the school cannot afford to pay support staff). Furthermore, schools simply cannot afford essential equipment that they need, this puts unnecessary pressure on school leaders. Instead of the primary concern being funding, staff within schools should be able to focus on the well-being of pupils.",
        "background": "Recently, schools in Devon have been forced to make staff redundant due to the lack of funding. How can the government expect schools to perform well if they cannot afford essential equipment and staff that they need?",
