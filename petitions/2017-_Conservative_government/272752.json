        "additional_details": "When voting in the General Election, many people will undoubtedly feel torn between what they feel is required GENERALLY in the coming years, and/or what they feel is right approach to the issue of Brexit, and/or party affiliation. We should not be put in the position where our voting decision-making for a GENERAL Election is confused by our beliefs about the approach to be taken to Brexit, and the resultant lack of clarity about our motives for voting one way or another will serve no-one well.",
        "background": "As much clarity as possible about the nation's view in connection with Brexit is undoubtedly what the government and the country needs to move forwards, one way or another, and to start to heal the divisions this issue has caused. The result of a General Election ALONE will NOT provide this clarity.",
