Many of the known Benin Bronzes remain at the British Museum, where they are still on display. Nigeria has repeatedly requested for the return of its cultural heritage, but the British Museum won\u2019t budge.\r\nThis is just one of the cases of artefacts stolen from Africa. Among others are the Nefertiti Bust and Rosetta Stone, Egypt, Ethiopian treasures falsely taken, etc.",
