The government needs to:\r\n \r\n\u2022 Make menus in public institutions entirely vegan \r\n\u2022 Tax any product that contains animal products \r\n\u2022 Stop giving incentives to people who farm animals \r\n\u2022 Incentivise those who grow or produce vegan foods \r\n\u2022 Educate the public about plant-based living\r\n \r\nFor the future of our planet this subject urgently needs debate in parliament.",

And that the single biggest thing we can do to reduce our impact on the Earth is to eliminate animal products from our diet. Yet any talk of the government encouraging us to adopt a vegan diet is swept aside as \u2018nanny-stateism.\u2019",
