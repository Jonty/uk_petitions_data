        "additional_details": "The Referendum question in 2016 was unequivocal - Should the United Kingdom leave the European or remain in the European Union?\r\nIt does not matter a jot which way one voted - what is at stake is the future of genuine democracy within the United Kingdom. Accordingly, if Parliament is unable or unwilling to comply the courts must be allowed to intervene to force MPs to comply with their lawful duty. In a nutshell, the failure of Parliament to deliver on the Referendum result is also \"justiciable\"",
        "background": "The Supreme Court has indicated on 24 September 2019 that the court was entitled to intervene where the rights of elected parliamentarians had been wrongly thwarted. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the same rules should apply where parliamentarians  with relentless self interest seek to STOP the Referendum result.",
