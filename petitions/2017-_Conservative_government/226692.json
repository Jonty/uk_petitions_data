        "additional_details": "Overall, 5.6 million children under age five died in 2016, nearly 15,000 daily.

        "background": "Introduce a new tax and use the money to buy food for starving African children. I propose a small tax on all goods sold in England. The tax money will buy food for starving African children. Food security is very important, because when people have no money or food, eventually wars happen. ",
