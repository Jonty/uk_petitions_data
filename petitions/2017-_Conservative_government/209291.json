        "action": "Programme to fund aspiring commercial pilots training similar to university fees",
        "additional_details": "The current lack of a pilot loan scheme means that pilots from the UK are at a competitive disadvantage compared to those from other countries, e.g some Scandinavian countries, where a scheme is provided.\r\nBALPA, representing over 75% of UK pilots, recently voiced concerns on this matter, stating that pilot training should be more accessible (http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/airline-pilots-rich-cost-training-poor-students-industry-warn-british-airline-pilots-association-a7899886.html#r3z-addoor)\r\nAn important point is that some schemes incrementally repay a large percentage (up to 60%) of the fee back on completion of training.",
        "background": "Training fees for aspiring commercial pilots can be huge, with some of the most costly courses ranging up to \u00a3125,000. Currently there is no widely available method for people in the UK to help fund their training. We propose that the Government provide a funding scheme for future pilots.",
