        "action": "Pass the Deal which has been negotiated with the European Union by Theresa May.",
        "additional_details": "Instead of the Prime Minister's own party members jostling for position to take her place, the Opposition Parties trying to provoke a General Election or staunch Remainers trying to find ways of preventing Brexit from happening at all with another referendum, all Parliamentarians should pass this Deal in a show of solidarity.  There will never be real consensus, but there needs to be a coming together for the greater good of this country.  MPs were voted in to REPRESENT.  Start now.",
        "background": "In the 2016 Referendum, the UK voted to leave the European Union.  This question CANNOT be asked again as democracy would no longer be trusted. However, to leave without a deal would be disastrous for our economy and security.  Close ties with Europe are vital for future peace and prosperity.",
