        "action": "Insist all supermarkets sell plastic free alternatives for all products sold",
        "additional_details": "We are all responsible, yet I feel our supermarkets have a the biggest responsibility to save our world. I feel it should be a legal obligation that all supermarkets offer plastic free, eco friendly alternatives to ALL their products so shoppers are given choice. At present the only option in most supermarkets is plastic, plastic and more plastic. This HAS to stop. Please sign this petition to ask the government to make it a legal requirement that all supermarkets have plastic free alternatives.",
        "background": "Our world is being destroyed by plastic, with up 90% of sea birds alone having been found to have plastic in their guts. We can only begin to imagine the devastation plastic is having on the rest of the marine life, including fish that end up on peoples plates.",
