        "additional_details": "A 2015 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report found that a 'safe' caffeine intake level for children has not been established. They propose guidelines of 3mg/kg per day could be used as a safe amount for habitual caffeine consumption by children and adolescents. This means that while a single can of popular brands on the market can contain around 160mg of caffeine, the EFSA recommends an intake of no more than 105mg caffeine per day for children. These drinks are simply #NotforChildren.",
        "background": "The label may state \u2018not for children\u2019 but 69% of teenagers / 24% of children under 10 are consuming high-caffeine energy drinks that lead to adverse health effects post consumption. With sales ever rising, we propose a ban on high-caffeine energy drinks containing over 150mg of caffeine per litre.",
