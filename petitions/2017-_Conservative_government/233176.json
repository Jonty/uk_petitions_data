        "additional_details": "Coeliac disease is a serious auto immune disease affecting 1 in 100 people in the UK. Upon minimal contact with gluten the immune system is triggered to attack the bowel lining, which can happen without any noticeable symptoms. By law foods labelled \u2018gluten free\u2019 must contain no more than 20 parts per million gluten, but if restaurants do not take care to prevent kitchen contamination gluten free meals are likely exceeding this safe level and triggering an immune reaction in coeliac sufferers.",
        "background": "Food safety law in the UK is not strict enough around how gluten free food is made in restaurants. Restaurants offering gluten free options should have to ensure those meals are made in controlled environments, so the food cannot be contaminated by gluten which would make it unsafe for coeliacs.",
