        "additional_details": "As an EDS sufferer for several years, it has become apparent that the lack of research and funding and treatments not being on the NHS is the reason that Ehlers danlos patients are treated unfairly. If we attend Accident and Emergency we should not have to explain to medical professionals what our condition is and the symptoms they should look out for and we should not have to find our own ways of treatment because the NHS lacks sufficient help.",
        "background": "Ehlers Danlos syndrome is a condition that affects the connective tissue. Several of the symptoms involve stretchy skin, severe dislocations and unusual bleeding as well as joint pain. Seven years ago I was diagnosed with Eds which is when I realised that research was limited.",
