        "background": "Universal Credit may be stopped for weekly paid workers in a 5 week month, and they will have to reapply. This discriminates against weekly paid workers. Those paid the same annual wage over 12 months will not have months without Universal Credit payment or the stress of reapplying 4 times a year.",
