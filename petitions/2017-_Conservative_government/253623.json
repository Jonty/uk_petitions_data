        "additional_details": "It has been demonstrated clearly that Parliament is deadlocked.  No party or faction has a majority.  Ideas of Common Market 2.0, Norway plus etc.  are not viable as the EU has made it clear that negotiations have ended.  MPs have had their time on this.  If Parliament cannot decide then let the people decide in the same way we decided to go forward with this.  Those who want to leave will vote knowing what the deal is.  Those who don't want to leave on that deal can vote to remain.  Simples!",
        "background": "All political parties have shown that they have no way forward with Brexit.  The EU has stated that there will be no further negotiation therefore Norway or ESTA etc. are not a valid choice.  \r\nPut a vote to the people with 2 choices. \r\n \r\nLeave now with the existing agreed deal   OR\r\nRemain.",
