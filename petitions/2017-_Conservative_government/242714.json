Given the fact they were elected on the basis of their respective parties' manifestos, and in the case of the Labour MPs in particular the hard work of and consequent popularity of their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, this move is deeply undemocratic. I strongly believe they should resign immediately and test the credibility of their new independent group.",
