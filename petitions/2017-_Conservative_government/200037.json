        "action": "Bring the limit to claim for unfair dismissal down from 2 years to 12 months",
        "additional_details": "You must have worked for your employer for a minimum period before you qualify for the right to claim unfair dismissal at a tribunal. If you're classed as an employee and started your job on or after 6 April 2012 - the qualifying period is normally 2 years. It should be dropped to 12 months to give people a bit more security in work and to stop employers getting rid of employees under ridiculous excuses and giving the employees a leg to stand on!",
        "background": "This petition is to bring the limit in taking their employer to a tribunal for unfair or constructive dismissal which you don't have much chance if you have to be there for more than 2 years, if we can get it dropped to 12 months it may give people in the work place a better chance financially!",
