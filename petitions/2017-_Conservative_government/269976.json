Furthermore many \u00a32 and 50p coin designs never go into general circulation yet all can be bought (over face value) from subsidiaries of the Royal Mint like The Westminster Collection.

I've since found many of the designs never ever enter general circulation so the only way to get them is buy them at many times there face value. This is wrong - all coins should be released!",
