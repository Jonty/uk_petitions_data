        "additional_details": "There is no evidence to prove discrimination of a person's ability or capacity to work based on age. A tiered structure encourages many employers to discriminate as a cost saving exercise, they will deliberately employ young people. A tiered structure also makes the assumption that required income level is based on age. This is a generalisation and doesn't apply to all backgrounds.",
        "background": "We should end age-related discrimination in terms of the minimum wage. If two people are doing exactly the same job to the same standard they should be paid the same amount, regardless of age. Hourly rate should reflect a skill set, not an age otherwise, discrimination is taking place.",
