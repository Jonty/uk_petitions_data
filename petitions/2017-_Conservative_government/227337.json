        "action": "NHS Northumberland to have occupational therapy for sensory profiling",
        "additional_details": "Sensory processing issues are particularly common in people on the autism spectrum. For example somebody who is over sensitive to touch could find a slight tickle very painful, and like wise somebody who is undersensitive to touch could have a high pain threshold and potentially self harm. It currently costs around \u00a3300 for a private occupational therapist in Northumberland to address sensory processing, we need 100,000 signatures to try and make this a free service in Northumberland. Thankyou",
        "background": "Currently in Northumberland there is no funding for occupational therapists to create a sensory profile, and assist with sensory issues. Sensory processing difficulties mean the brain has trouble receiving and responding to information that comes through the senses.",
