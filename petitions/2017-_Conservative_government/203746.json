        "action": "Make independent inventory reporting of privately rented properties compulsory",
        "additional_details": "As the Private Rented Sector now covers a fifth of all households (EHS 2015-16), it\u2019s crucial that tenants and landlords abide by a fair move-in/move-out process.\r\n\r\nKey figures:\r\n\r\n- A third of 2,500 tenants admitted having their deposit withheld and 68% believed their landlord didn\u2019t provide good enough reason to do so (Hillarys, 2017).\r\n\r\n- 40% of students lose well over a third of their deposit when they rent privately, while 79% do not sign a photo inventory when they move in (Money.co.uk, 2016).",
        "background": "Independent inventory reporting of privately rented properties on an AST should be a mandatory requirement.\r\n\r\nIndependent inventories offer protection and help to reduce the number of deposit disputes.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition and help us make the letting process more transparent for all.",
