        "additional_details": "For example, a former Police Inspector was given a 16 month suspended sentence for possessing and making over 400 indecent images of children, effectively avoiding jail. I believe that going forward all offenders of crimes relating to indecent images of children should face harsher sentence in light of the danger these people may pose to children.",
        "background": "I believe changes should be to the law to require longer minimum sentences as as of now, a lot of people found guilty of possessing, making or distributing indecent images of children only receive suspended sentences and serve no jail time.",
