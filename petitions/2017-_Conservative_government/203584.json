I knew it would be busy so followed the on screen instruction to \"sit tight\" & not refresh my screen otherwise I would lose my place in line. At 17.00 I FB'd TM & asked if I would get tickets. They replied at 18.00 & told me to refresh my screen & try my search again. I refreshed and lost my place in line & on searching there were no tickets available. I have proof of their reply on my phone. I am completely distraught!",
