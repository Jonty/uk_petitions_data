        "additional_details": "Science is now clearly showing that this changing of the clock is no longer economically beneficial in the 21st century and merely disrupts the operation of many out of hours businesses, alters the circadian rhythms of employees, generates more sick days for firms, creates higher NHS costs for councils, and ultimately, is a failed 100 year experiment that has resulted in an unfortunate waste of tax payer's money.",
        "background": "Changing the clocks forwards, or backwards, has not been proven to alter the amount of light available to the common person but it has indeed been proven to significantly affect the health of the common person by encouraging sleeping disorders and other mental health issues.",
