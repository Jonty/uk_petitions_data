        "action": "Make it illegal for energy companies to levy a standing charge for smart meters.",
        "additional_details": "Upon further investigation I found out that the \"Big Six\" energy companies charge over \u00a3100 per year before your top ups actually allow you to have hot water and heat your house using gas. This means that vulnerable people will experience fuel poverty even if they conserve gas by not using it. After just \u00a35 Pounds of arrears, the meter turns off. In 2015, 9000 British people died from cold homes according to University College London. Making this \"no use tax\" illegal will therefore save lives.",
        "background": "Upon leaving my gas meter inactive for three months as I waited for my landlord to sort out the safety inspection (and not needing heating in the meantime) I was surprised to find that I was in arrears by approximately \u00a326 Pounds due to British Gas charging a daily fee of \u00a30.278 regardless of usage.",
