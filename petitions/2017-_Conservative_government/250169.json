        "additional_details": "We need this petition to allow a way forward in blocking an MP's salary if it is deemed that that MP has NOT managed their position in the eyes of the general public. In light of Brext it has a proven point that the UK is now in limbo and is in it's darkest days since Oliver Cromwell.\r\nWe the public wish to vote on the suspension of MP's payments and salary. We vote that a law be passed allowing suspension of payment.",
        "background": "Brexit has taken a turn for the worst and the MP's have not worked hard enough for the people of the UK. For 2 years they have not been working on the running of our country but battled among themselves. They give themselves a pay rise  and this now must be stopped dead.",
