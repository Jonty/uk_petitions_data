        "additional_details": "Every year \u00a3100 million worth of VED goes unpaid through evasion.\r\nCar insurance and MOT details are now held on a central register so the outdated requirement to provide these documents when taxing a car is un-necesaary. \r\nVED could be collected by adding a fraction of a pence to every litre of fuel sold, this would create a simple and unavoidable way of collecting the revenue. It would also encourage people to buy fuel efficient cars therefore helping the environment.",
