However, some of my co-workers whom are 18 or above would pay the same price but be earning a higher hourly rate of pay. This exploits young people and severely disadvantages them.",
        "background": "People above the age of 15 must buy adult train tickets and are classified as adults, but when working they do not receive the adult hourly rate. Furthermore, you cannot classify a teenager an adult in one section of society and not in another especially when they directly correlate with eachother.",

Alternatively, you could start a new petition asking for the Government to provide a subsidy for train fares for young people. "
