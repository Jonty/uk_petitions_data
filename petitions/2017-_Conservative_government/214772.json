        "additional_details": "The USA, France and many countries sing their Anthem weekly in schools. Why do we not? We have so much to be proud of. From Yorkshire Puddings to Julie Dench, Mo Farah to Harry Potter. Whether it's Music, Arts, Sports, Commerce or any other possible area England are up there and dominating. Patriotism is falling rapidly, we need to help regrow the passion and allow our children to be taught the Anthem in Schools and to be proud like they should be of the great Country which they are living in.",
        "background": "Only 35% of the UK are proud to be British says a recent poll, this is a giant drop from 10 years ago! Why? The UK with England at it's heart invented the most popular sports. Have legends in Music, Arts, Science, Finance.. Team GB came 2nd at the Olympics!! So let's help regrow the National pride!!",
