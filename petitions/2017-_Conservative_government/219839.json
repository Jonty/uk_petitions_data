        "additional_details": "30 year medal should be called the Long Service and Good conduct Medal and 50 years service should be called the Meritorious Service Medal.  Unbroken service should include Maternity leave, sick leave and bank staff and part time staff.  The medal should say \" From a grateful nation\" on it.  Ribbon colours and design should be put to NHS staff for their ideas.",
        "background": "We do not recognise the contribution NHS staff make to our local communities and to the nation as a whole.  I feel medals should be awarded at 30 years and 50 years continuous unbroken service to all NHS staff who complete that amount of service.",
