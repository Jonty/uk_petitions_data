Does the government want to force expat pensioners to return to further overload the health service & housing market.\r\nIt is a national disgrace and risks another growing scandal going forward.",
        "background": "Expats in the EU risk a life of poverty and poor healthcare through government refusal to protect expats' rights post Brexit. Deal or no deal. \r\nUK citizens in EEA countries have this right already. Prior to the Common Market UK expats in France were protected with permanently index linked pensions.",
