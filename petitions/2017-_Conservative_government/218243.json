        "additional_details": "There are around 9 million deaf and hard of hearing people in the uk? 9 out of ten were born to hearing parents. Surprisingly only around 1 in 10 parents will learn BSL or another form of sign language to communicate with their child. This means there are many deaf children unable to communicate with their families. Something many people take for granted. Children and adults in the uk should know basic BSL because even being able to say hello to someone with hearing issues can make a difference.",
        "background": "The government should give everyone the right to learn BSL. This means teaching it in schools. The government\u2019s excuse for this not being taught already is that it is a \u201cforeign language that cannot be examined\u201d Education is for teaching children crucial skills not testing children every minute.",
