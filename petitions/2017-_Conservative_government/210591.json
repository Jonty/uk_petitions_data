        "action": "Remove the ban of the musician: Tyler, the Creator, from entering the UK",
        "additional_details": "Tyler was banned for homophobic, sexist and bigoted lyrics in his first two albums, particularly 'Bastard', where he 'adopts a mentally unstable alter ego' among other things. The government claimed this album 'may foster hatred' and contains 'behaviours unacceptable to the UK'. This ban was six years after Tyler made these comments, he has also shown his growing maturity and even came out of the closet himself in his most recent album. This ban was outdated, unnecessary and would be illogical to continue, considering the artist's recent behaviour.",
        "background": "In 2015 The government banned Tyler, the Creator from entering the UK for what was decided as 3 to 5 years for abhorrent language he used in a song he made in 2009. This Petition intends to urge the government to remove this ban.",
