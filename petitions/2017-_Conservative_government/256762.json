        "additional_details": "For a full explanation of how STV works, go to electoral-reform.org.uk\r\n\r\nCurrently power ends up all with one party (or occasionally a coalition) no matter how small its majority. With STV you get a Parliament where the strength of the parties matches the strength of their support in the country, and MPs have a strong local link. As STV seldom results in one party holding an absolute majority it requires governments to compromise and build consensus. For us, this would be a new way of working.",
        "background": "The Single Transferable Vote system is fairer. Currently MPs may be elected despite 75 per cent of their constituency voting against them. STV gives minority parties and independents a better chance of obtaining parliamentary seats, thus introducing different voices to our national political life.",
