        "additional_details": "In the Portugal the road traffic fatalities are decreasing with each year as young people can learn to drive with their parents car. In the 2010, there was 937 road traffic fatalities and through 5 years it has decreased to 593.\r\nMaking this change in the country will allow people to save more money on the insurances and will allow young people to drive and learn on their parents car without buying separate insurance, which can cost a lot.",
        "background": "The insurance in many countries like Portugal, Poland or America is made on car itself instead of individuals who drive it. This would make it easier for everyone as people will be able to drive the car even if they are not its owner and will not pay huge amounts for borrowing it.",
