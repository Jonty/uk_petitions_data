        "additional_details": "Only 6% of UK health research spending goes on mental health. The quality of life and treatment is not improving for those suffering from them; there should at least be education available to young people so they may understand one another.",
        "background": "Not enough young people are informed about mental health, despite the fact that 16 million of people in the UK suffer from one. Over half of young people feel they would be excluded and isolated for their mental illness and so, we need more inclusive education to help all children be aware.",
