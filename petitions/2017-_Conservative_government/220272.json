        "additional_details": "There must be equal take-home pay for equal work for agency workers. Umbrella companies say that workers agree to work like this, but we know in the industry that this is not so and that workers are not given a choice and must go umbrella if they want to get employment. This is a widespread practice that is hurting the pockets of vulnerable workers.",

ENI is deducted from workers\u2019 wages.This petition seeks a law to prevent workers getting less take-home pay than directly employed people doing exact same job.",
