        "additional_details": "We are planning on developing a project to campaign for girls under 16 to be offered free sanitary protection and for feminine products manufacturers to donate products to the domestic violence refuges, charities supporting homeless women and girls and the donations to be made overseas to the most vulnerable and in need groups. The campaign will include making \"jewellery\" and an art installation using feminine products and packaging. We are planning to film a video and Vlog progress. The \"jewellery\" would not only be used to raise the profile of the campaign but profits would be divided between charities supporting women and girls.",

And I wrapped a whole tissue roll around my underwear, just to keep my underwear dry until I got home. I didn't know what else to do. This quote is from a school girl in Leeds.",
