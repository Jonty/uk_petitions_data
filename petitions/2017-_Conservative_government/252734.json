        "additional_details": "So I'm sure many people have been in a position where you have received an image, sent directly to you of somebodies genitals; exposing themselves. If this happened in the public, you could be prosecuted. So why is the law different online? To be prosecuted for exposure it must fit one of two guidelines - \r\n1) intentionally exposing genitals with the intention that someone will see them\r\n2) intending to causing alarm or distress \r\nNow receiving a unsolicited nude on line is having the intentions to expose your genitals AND can cause alarm and distress.",
        "background": "Exposing yourself in public is illegal, why isn't it the same online? Of course there is massive amounts of porn online difficult to control - but what we can control is receiving them on our personal social media, fitting the same guidelines as the current law and MAKE IT ILLEGAL.",
