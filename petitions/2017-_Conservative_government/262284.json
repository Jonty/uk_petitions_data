        "additional_details": "For example:\r\n \r\nPost-consumer recycled and recyclable at kerbside cardboard would get green lights. \r\n\r\nA plastic bottle that is only recyclable by speciality services would get a yellow. \r\n\r\nA paper coffee cup that is plastic treated and therefore not recyclable would get red lights. \r\n\r\nDifferent lights can cover different areas: carbon impact, recyclability, energy efficiency in production, impact to aquatic life, biodegradability, etc",
        "background": "The UK\u2019s food labels are some of the clearest in the world. In this climate emergency, citizens are struggling to make informed decisions about landfill waste, recycling, & carbon impact. Make this easy by enforcing a traffic-light style environmental impact label on any consumer goods packaging",
