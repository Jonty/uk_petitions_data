        "additional_details": "We request Hate Speech laws be overturned as it is a violation of Freedom of speech, Expression and therefore the functionality of a true democracy. The term 'hate' is commonly being used to describe criticism - especially that of Islam and Immigration. To ensure the protection of the people, we request that freedom of speech must always be allowed, unless:\r\n1. The speech is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action, AND\r\n2. The speech is likely to incite or produce such action.",
        "background": "In one year alone, British police arrested 3,395 people for \"offensive\" comments online. The reason, of course, hate speech laws. If your opinion isn't state approved off to prison with you! This Orwellian type censoring is ridiculous and unacceptable in a democratic society.",

There are other laws relating to hate crime, but we're not sure which ones you're concerned about. You can find out more about the law on hate crime here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/hate-crime/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
