        "additional_details": "Many army veterans and young people end up being homeless, and the government does very little to support these people. We are failing as a country if people are suffering from something that can be fixed. \r\n\r\nIf we have billions to spend on buying MPs and nuclear weapons then we have money to support those in need and help homeless people find a job and stable accommodation.\r\n\r\nWe cannot and must not sit by whilst people are on our streets; let's work together to end homeless.",
        "background": "It has been reported that one homeless person in the UK on average dies every 19 hours. At least 234 people have died in the last six months aged between 16 - 104. \r\n\r\nLet's get this discussed in parliament and increase funding to help end homelessness or change policy to support the homeless.",
