        "action": "Make it legal for motorcyclists to ride without a helmet on",
        "additional_details": "When Motor Cycles (Wearing of Helmets) Regulations 1973 (S.I., 1973, No. 180) was passed, it became illegal in the UK for anyone to ride without a helmet on. This was amended by the Crash-Helmets (Religious Exemption) Act, 1976, to give some groups the ability to opt out of using them. I don't debate that they have saved lives, but a study done in the US stated that it was only a 37% decrease. Furthermore it is primarily the biker that will face the consequences, so why force them into using one.",
        "background": "In the UK it has been illegal for most to ride with a helmet on. This does not apply to certain religious groups. I think that bikers from all walks of life should get the choice if they use a helmet or not.",
