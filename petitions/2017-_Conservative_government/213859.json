This includes evidence from British lawyer David Haigh, who was imprisoned without charge in Dubai for over 15 months, with no police investigation or formal interviews about the allegations against him. He was tortured and sexually abused. With others unjustly accused by the UAE, he continues to fight against extradition. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-42027115",
