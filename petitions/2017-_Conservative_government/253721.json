        "action": "Form a national government to revoke Brexit or call a People's Vote.",
        "additional_details": "A million people recently marched to Parliament calling for a People's Vote. Six million signed a Parliamentary petition calling for the revocation of Brexit. Parliament has voted repeatedly against a \"No Deal\" Brexit.  Yet divisions within the governing Conservative Party fail to reflect changing public attitudes. A national cross-party government will ensure that public and Parliamentary concerns are respected. Only such a government can be sure of avoiding the catastrophe of \"No Deal\"Brexit.",
        "background": "Parliament is paralysed, putting the country in peril of leaving the EU with 'No Deal\". Only a national, cross-party government can obtain the necessary extension of the Article 50 negotiations and then revoke Brexit or call a People's Vote. Both these options are increasingly popular among voters.",
