        "action": "Make bullying awareness part of the national curriculum in all schools.",
        "additional_details": "I have never struggled with bullying personally, but after reading a heart breaking story of a young boy, who sadly took his own life due to bullying, I feel it is time to integrate bullying awareness into children's lives, and the ideal place for this to take place is in the classroom, across all ages and all schools. I strongly believe a bullying awareness curriculum in schools could lower this stigma and ideally save lives.",
        "background": "I feel too many children are suffering from bullying on a daily basis, and not enough action is being done. Yes schools have posters about zero tolerance on bullying, but how many kids actually pay attention. I feel a minimum of 30 minutes a week classroom time will make children more aware.",
