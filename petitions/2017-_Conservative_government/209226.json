        "additional_details": "Homelessness is a major problem in Liverpool and putting an end to this is far more important than the home of a billionaire\u2019s football club being subsidised. Liverpool has much of the city extremely poorly connected by public transport and better connection between suburbs and the city centre would make it easier to find work and commute daily. Allegiances to football clubs aside, our tax money simply cannot be spent in this way. Everton FC will continue to exist without it, the people cannot.",
        "background": "On the 9th of January 2018, at Everton FC\u2019s AGM, Liverpool\u2019s Mayor Joe Anderson declared that Liverpool City Council would fund two-thirds of a \u00a3500m cost to build a new stadium for Everton FC. This is money that could be better spent on the city\u2019s infrastructure and is completely unacceptable.",
