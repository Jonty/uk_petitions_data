        "additional_details": "Every year 73 million sharks are slaughtered. Many simply for their fins.\r\nThe fins are then used as the title ingredient in shark fin soup. In some parts of the world, populations of great white, hammerhead, thresher and oceanic whitetip have fallen by 90% in the last 60 years. Worse still they could be wiped out by 2048. Help make Britain shark-fin soup free.",
        "background": "Right now,anyone travelling to the UK from outside Europe can legally bring 20kg of dried shark fins with them for personal consumption.That's enough to make 705 bowls of soup! It's illegal to bring meat or cheese on long haul flights yet legal to bring 20kg of shark fins.",
