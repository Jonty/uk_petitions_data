        "action": "Make boiling live crabs and lobsters illegal.",
        "additional_details": "Research has shown that crustaceans do experience pain, an example being a study conducted by Professor Robert Elwood at Queen's University Belfast. Elwood found that crustaceans will avoid certain spots where they have previously been given mild electric shocks, showing they felt pain. Due to research such as this, it has been made illegal in New Zealand and Switzerland to boil crabs and lobsters alive. It needs to be illegal in the UK by extending the Animal Welfare Act to include crustaceans.",
        "background": "The current way in which lobsters and crabs are prepared for consumption is by cooking them in boiling water whilst they are alive. This cruel and inhumane practice, which causes immense pain and trauma, is legal in the UK as crustaceans are not protected under the Animal Welfare Act of 2006.",
