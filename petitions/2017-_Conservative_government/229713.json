        "additional_details": "The funeral director showed us no respect. His dog was yapping around our ankles, he kept answering his phone whilst we were trying to talk to him about our daughter\u2019s funeral, at one point his wife even shouted into the room to give him an update on another funeral. My husband and son walked out, and when I told him we were grieving parents, his argument was that he was really busy at the moment. These are things that no person who has lost a loved one should have to go through.",
        "background": "When our daughter died, we visited the funeral director and were treated with a total lack of respect, and left in tears and angry at the lowest point of our lives. There are two trade associations for funeral directors, however it is not mandatory that they are members. ",
