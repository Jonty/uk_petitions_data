        "additional_details": "It's barbaric the way horses have to end their lives trying to jump over 6ft fences that they are not able to, then they break something and have to be put to sleep. This year 2019 a total of 57 horses have lost their lives on British race tracks, all for gambling. It's not right. Either lower the fences or don\u2019t have them at all. It's a barbaric sport and we need to be listened to.",
