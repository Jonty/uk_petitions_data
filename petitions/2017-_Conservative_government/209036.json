        "action": "Stop all shipments of nuclear waste to Australia immediately.",
        "additional_details": "Sending nuclear waste faraway is not a solution; burying it out of sight is not sensible either.  The Government seem to be arguing that they are entitled to send UK waste to Australia and after that they cannot be blamed if it ends up in Aboriginal Lands. Apart from the fact that sending such waste to the other side of the world is primitively irresponsible, it is cynical and further abuse of Aboriginal people. British people should forbid  our Government to do any such thing.",
        "background": "The UK contaminated and destroyed Aboriginal lands with nuclear bomb tests in 1950s and1960s. We must apologise for that and never repeat such crimes against nature and humanity. This Government now proposes to ship UK nuclear waste to Australia and dump it there: this must be stopped.",
