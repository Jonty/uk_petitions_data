        "additional_details": "The Council proposes to construct a new bridge over the M1 opposite Willen and turn that section Tongwell Street (V11) into a dual carriageway. Their plan is to divert towards Willen most of the congested traffic flows currently using J14 to cross the M1.\r\n \r\nI understand that the final bid will not be scrutinised by Councillors before submission, and instead the Leader of the Council will make an 'executive decision' without having to demonstrate that the bid is workable and has local support.",
        "background": "Milton Keynes Council are seeking Government funding to build the infrastructure for 5,000 homes through an ill-conceived and rushed plan.\r\n \r\nThe Council must demonstrate local support for the bid and they have failed to do this - in fact, there is widespread local opposition to the proposed bid.",
