        "additional_details": "With Crossrail opening soon, from London to Maidenhead, there will be a large number of new commuters travelling to the area. To travel onto Wycombe they would have to take an inefficient bus service or drive, increasing the already poor local traffic.\r\n\r\nA study by High Wycombe council is currently underway to investigate the suitability of reopening the line, which based on the outcome would require funding from the Department for Transport. This would have a major benefit to local business.",
        "background": "The current Marlow Branch Line, operated by GWR, runs from Maidenhead to Marlow via Furze Platt, Cookham and Bourne End. The line used to continue from Bourne End to High Wycombe via Wooburn Green and Loudwater, however was closed due to Department of Transport cuts.",
