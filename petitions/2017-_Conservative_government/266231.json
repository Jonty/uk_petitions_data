        "action": "Hold a General Election if the governing party changes it's leader in office.",
        "additional_details": "Gordon Brown replaced Tony Blair and among the detractors who felt this process was undemocratic and called for a General Election were Theresa May and Boris Johnson. However as soon as they find themselves in a similar situation they find spurious reasons to alter their views. To stop this situation happening in future if the Prime Minister leaves office for whatever reason during the term of a parliament a General Election must be called.",
        "background": "Although we do not elect a Prime Minister who becomes PM is a consideration when voting. There have been a number of recent examples of unelected succession in recent years. If the governing party changes it's leader while in office in the interests of democracy there should be a General Election.",
