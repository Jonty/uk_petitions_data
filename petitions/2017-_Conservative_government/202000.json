        "action": "Make it unlawful for buses to carry standing children on the motorway.",
        "additional_details": "My child uses a double decker school bus which has to travel on the motorway to avoid a low bridge. There are insufficient seats for the children so there are always children standing. I have raised this with various Govt agencies and Bus Users UK advised that buses can be licensed to carry up to 30 children standing because of economics. Even if they change the route to rectify our situation it seems insane that any child in the UK could be placed at risk in this manner on our busy motorways.",
        "background": "There is an anomoly in the law in that children are required to use car seats until the age of 12 and everyone must wear seatbelts in vehicles save for a few exceptions, yet apparently double decker buses can be licensed to carry up to 30 standing passengers on the motorway even if they are children",
