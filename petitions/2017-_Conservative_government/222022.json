        "action": "Ban the sale, manufacture or distribution of plastic confetti in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Today I saw Branscombe Beach on Devon covered in silver and gold confetti.  There was so much it was impossible to collect it all and it was very hard to pick up as it was so thin and small.  This kind of littering has to stop and individuals celebrating need to be prevented from making environmentally damaging choices such as this. When so many other options are available,  plastic confetti needs up be banned.",
        "background": "Plastic confetti is still used at weddings and parties despite it being a dramatic example of littering non-biodegradable materials.  Confetti is designed to be small and light to 'float' when thrown and therefore it is very hard to pick up and will spread widely in the wind. It has to go!",
