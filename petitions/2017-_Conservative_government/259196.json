        "additional_details": "Baby's develop loads in the first 12 months and achieve most of their milestones. It is crucial that they have the love and support from their mom to be there for these milestones. It killed me having to go back to work at 9 months due to not being able to afford being off. It is unfair for moms who work and don't recieve benefits to have to leave their baby's whilst people who have never worked a day in their lives get money and time with their children. It's now a punishment to have a baby.",
        "background": "It is heartbreaking for a mom to have to go back to work due to no longer getting any maternity pay, missing out on so many milestones and developments. This should not be the case and moms should be able to spend the full 12 months with their baby without worrying about having no money.",
