        "additional_details": "After being told her condition was terminal my wife went down hill quickly, nine weeks from admission to death. Doctors tried their best but in the end she was on massive amounts of morphine and other substances. She wasn\u2019t frightened, she knew she dying but just wanted the pain to end and doctors struggled. If there is no chance of survival people should be given that right to choose their own death. Putting people in coma\u2019s is inhumane. You would not treat an animal like that",
        "background": "Having watched my wife die in pain from cancer  in a drug induced coma over 9 weeks, she begged a doctor to help her die. No one should be allowed to suffer like that, doctors struggled to control pain, I had to watch as they stopped food and water, she died two days later.",
