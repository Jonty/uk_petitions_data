        "additional_details": "My mother has been battling with cancer for the last few years with the aid of vital treatments however a cure still doesn't exist and sadly  she has now been given months if not weeks to live as she is no longer responding to treatment.\r\n\r\nA close family friend who stands to lose everything he's worked for much like countless others due to the HS2 project made a point that perhaps the funds could be better spent on something that could truly benefit each and everyone for generation to come.",
        "background": "The debate on the long term benefits of HS2 and the use of an estimated \u00a356bn of public funds on such a project have been going on for sometime. If the British public actually had a vote, would it be in favour of spending \u00a356bn on HS2 or helping find a cure for cancer !",
