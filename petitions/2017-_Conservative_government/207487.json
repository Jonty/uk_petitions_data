        "additional_details": "8 million tonnes of plastic is found in our oceans every year and marine life is paying the price.  \r\n\r\nPlastic bags have been retrieved from the stomachs of multiple mammals including whales and albatross. Plastic forks have been found lodged in the noses of sea turtles and fish have been found growing around plastic pullrings and wrappers. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time the UK cleaned up its act and minimised our use of plastic before the damage is irreversible.",
        "background": "BP2 has highlighted how plastic is affecting our ecosystems with terrible consequences. \r\n\r\nSupermarkets are guilty of wrapping everything from avocado to apples in plastic which is rarely recyclable. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s demand that by law, less plastic packaging is used and what is HAS to be recyclable.",
