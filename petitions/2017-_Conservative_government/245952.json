        "additional_details": "People who suffer with depression and have higher suicidal tendences than other people will normally feel alone and isolated during their episodes even if they are surrounded by people or friends and family, an ESD would be put in place to help comfort and spend time with their owners, this can be extremly useful for people who also live alone, however I don't believe ESD's should be handed out to anyone who show's minor signs of being mentally ill, although I do believe people who suffer with severe mental health issues such as schizophrenia, Pyshcosis or Bipolar disorders these dogs should be put in place.",
        "background": "Emotional Support Dogs are given specifically to people with less visable illnesses such as pyschosis, schizophrenia or bipolar they help sooth some of the symptons of these illnesses and can have a greater impact on the wellbeing of their owners, but sadly they are not recognised as assitance dogs.",
