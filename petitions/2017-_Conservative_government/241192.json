        "action": "Vote Leave subverted democracy - Reverse Brexit!",
        "additional_details": "It is becoming increasingly clear that Brexit was disproportionately influenced by the overspending by the respective Leave campaigns. With such a narrow margin of victory (52% - 48%) this casts serious doubt over the legitimacy of Brexit, the result of which is clearly tainted. Indeed, for a vote to be considered democratic, it is vital that laws are followed. This clearly did not occur during the 2016 EU Referendum which is why, if we are to salvage democracy, Brexit must be reversed.",
        "background": "Those who voted Remain in the referendum have been told that they should respect democracy by accepting the result. But it is clear that Vote Leave and Leave.EU fragrantly subverted electoral law, the adherence to which is essential if a vote is seen to be legitimate, and indeed fair.",
