        "additional_details": "Gall stones are a contributing factor to gallbladder cancer, obesity is also a factor. At present gallbladder cancer is stumbled upon through nausea, rapid weight loss and loss of appetite. Yes it\u2019s a rare cancer but if the NHS funded better diagnosis, such as CT scan on the diagnosis of gallstones, they can we rule out cancer before it becomes aggressive.",
        "background": "I lost my mum this year to a rare form of cancer, gallbladder cancer, this type of cancer is so rare that it gets picked up at stage 3 or 4. If it is picked up earlier, such as when gallstones are diagnosed we can treat people quicker and save lives.",
