        "additional_details": "The NHS uses evidence based research to commission treatment and for now they will not change their decision until more evidence is produced. So for now I propose that the government look at other treatments. 1. health visitors and doctors to include screening for all children as part of the 0-19 health programme so they can offer targeted support and advice. 2. early intervention and treatments like physical therapy put in to place to alleviate and prevent further flatness.",
        "background": "Flat head syndrome is very common amongst babies. Currently treatment is not available on the NHS, research has shown that helmet therapy produces the same results as treating with repositioning and physical therapy. Flat head syndrome is caused either in utero or by constant pressure side of head",
