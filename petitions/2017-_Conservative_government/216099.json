        "additional_details": "50% of homeless people die of disease and infection, and a further 36% die from drugs and alcohol. These deaths could be prevented through improved access to healthcare. At present, the average age of death for homeless people is 45 years in men and 43 in women. This is unacceptable and must be improved.",
        "background": "Homeless people are dying far too early, and of preventable illnesses, in part due to problems accessing health care which could save their lives. The government should improve provisions for such people, who are impeded from getting care due to their circumstances.",
