        "additional_details": "Often parents cannot afford the inflated prices that travel companies charge during school holidays. Parents are being penalised for wanting to take their children on holiday. The parents that should be penalised are the parents that are regularly failing to get their children to school and not those parents who are seeking to provide memories for their children.",
        "background": "Parents are fined for taking their children on holiday during term time. Holidays with family are just as important for the emotional well being of a child as school is for brain development. If a child was home educated or at a private school they can go away with out being fined!",
