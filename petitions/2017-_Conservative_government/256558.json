The parents that should be penalised are the parents that are regularly failing to get their children to school and not those parents who are seeking to provide memories for their children.",

Holidays with family are just as important for the emotional well being of a child as school is for brain development. If a child was home educated or at a private school they can go away with out being fined!",
