        "additional_details": "The UK government should act now to secure the lives of thousands both in Spain and in the UK. This will lead the way for other European countries to secure rights for those who currently exercise their right to live abroad in the European Union. With Brexit fast approaching, offering stability and reassurance to people\u00b4s lives is vital.",
        "background": "Spain have moved to create a royal decree which protects thousands of Briton\u00b4s lives in Spain in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It covers rights to social security, healthcare and education amongst others. Once passed into Spanish Law this will depend on reciprocation to be implemented.",
