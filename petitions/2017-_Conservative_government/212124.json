        "additional_details": "There has been a steady increase in the traffic through the village, in particular large Heavy goods vehicles. The opening of the new A5/M1 link road this has again increased the traffic through the village. A journey from Milton Keynes to Hockliffe used to take 15-20 mins, now take 45-50 mins. Traffic queues in both directions, all of the congestion being at the Hockliffe Cross roads. If the M1 closes, this can increase to hours to get through the village in both directions",
        "background": "Recent local council Housing plan has proposed additional housing in the village of Hockliffe and surrounding areas, to empty out onto the already heavily congested A5. Stating the A5 as a sufficient infrastructure, the thousands of houses will cause Greater congestion and pollution in the Village.",
