        "additional_details": "The NHS is well aware of the cases of girls under 25 battling to save their own lives because they dont see cervical cancer as an issue. They allow HPV to ruin their bodies and ultimately kill them from cancer. I am one of the lucky ones but girls are dying because nobody will change the law. \r\n\r\nITS TIME FOR CHANGE.",
        "background": "At the age of 18 I started with symptoms of cervical cancer and it took doctors 3 years to finally find HPV and pre cancerous cells. If they had left that until I was 25 i would most certainly be dead.",
