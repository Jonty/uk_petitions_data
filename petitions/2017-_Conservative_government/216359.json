Cameras being deliberately trained on areas outside an individual\u2019s property can amount to harassment and potentially give rise to prosecution under the Public Order Act or Protection from Harassment Act. The use of CCTV in certain circumstances can also be seen as an infringement on privacy under the Human Rights Act 1988. Stalking is already a criminal offence.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do - for example, you could call for there to be tougher enforcement or harsher penalties for this offence.\r\n"
