The NHS are frequently at a loss to know how to support this condition, with many children & parents left to fend for themselves.  Holistic specialised team for FASD families are needed, with specialised interest in working together to provide therapies and behavioural plans, including psychology, OT, sleep, medical, SALT, trauma, attachment & neurobehavioral (on the lines of Nate Sheets in Oregan).",
        "background": "There are thousands of children in the UK who have been diagnosed with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. Most are being failed by the NHS system, as there are no specialist FASD teams providing proper care.  Many don't fulfil criteria for CAMHS/Paediatric services so have no ongoing care in place.",
