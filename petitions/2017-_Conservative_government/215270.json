        "additional_details": "Unlike passenger railway systems, persons in wheelchairs do not have priority access to wheelchair spaces provided on buses, despite this being the only safe space for a person in a wheelchair to travel.\r\n\r\nDespite the recent Supreme Court case brought by Doug Paulley, bus drivers have no legal power to force other passengers to move, and can still only request that they do so.\r\n\r\nThis is detrimental to any person in a wheelchair and has a significant impact on travel.",
        "background": "Wheelchair users do not have lawful priority over other passengers for access to designated wheelchair spaces/bays on public buses.\r\n\r\nThere have been frequent and media reported cases of such persons being able to travel as other passengers refused to move. Legislation is required to address this.",
