        "additional_details": "If the UK joins Schengen, there will be no more passport checks at Dover or Calais. People will be able to enter and leave the UK without any checks. This could hugely benefit the UK economy in terms of trade, open migration and tourism. It will also help the UK to develop a more humane policy towards asylum-seekers and refugees. If the UK joins Schengen, no-one will need to risk their life trying to cross the Channel by dinghy anymore.",
        "background": "The Schengen Agreement guarantees border check-free travel for people within its member states. The UK should apply to join Schengen immediately to avoid travel disruption after Brexit. It's not necessary to be in the EU or EEA to join. Switzerland isn't a member of either, but is in Schengen.",
