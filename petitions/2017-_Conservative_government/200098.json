        "additional_details": "90% of the time driving on the m25 there is a 60mph 50 and 40 limit imposed where drives slow down under the gantry to around 30mph which causes drivers to brake and further down turns into stand still, once national speed limit is in place the traffic is clear. this is guaranteed in the same places, almost every day in peak hours.",
        "background": "I feel the variable speed limits cause unnecessary traffic on the motorway, cause accidents and add extra stress to daily driving on the motorway, I understand when there is an accident or incident on the motorway it is necessary  but used as a 'traffic calming' measure' doesn't work.",
