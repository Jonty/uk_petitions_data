So was unable to ring the police to report youths on a roof of a derelict building. We get told to report incidents/issues to the police and to ring 101 for non emergency, so surely to get people to report these non emergency issues/incidents the call needs to be FREE &/or including in phone contract minutes!! Please sort this out",
        "background": "101 non emergency calls are charged at 15p per minute. These calls should be FREE due to the reason for calls. Or if not FREE then phone companies should allow them to be included in line rentals inclusive minutes.",
