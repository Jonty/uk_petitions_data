This can be intimidating and humiliating them at times.\r\n\r\nNorthern Rail\u2019s policy is outdated and their treatment of disabled people is unacceptable. The Equality Act 2010 was introduced to help ensure businesses treat everyone fairly. It protects anyone who is disabled, is thought to be disabled, or is with someone who is disabled. It gives these people rights to access goods or services in a way that means they are not treated less favourably than people without a disability",
