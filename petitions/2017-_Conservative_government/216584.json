        "additional_details": "During the proposed transition, the UK will be a rule-taker, not a rule-maker. It will be able to sign \u2013 but not implement- trade agreements with partners outside the EU. There is no clear evidence of the availability, terms or value of such deals, and potential partners will wish to know the UK's future relationship with the EU before committing themselves. The Transition is too uncertain. We should not leave our existing terms with the EU before we are sure we are headed for a better future.",
        "background": "Our future as a global trading nation hangs on our future relationship with the EU. That is far from certain and we need time to develop it. Once we leave the EU, our position will be weaker across the board. We should not  burn that bridge and move into the transition without more clarity.",
