        "additional_details": "If you were to put death penalty in place it could more than likely reduce rape and attacks because it would scare them into seeing sense and show adults and young people that there is consequences to their actions, clearly a few months or years in prison isnt enough. The youth of today see criminals commiting rape and attacks against people and see that all they get is a few years in prison and have the chance to commit the crime again when they have been released.",
