        "additional_details": "You get paid leave from work if you give birth to a child or adopt a child.  If you gain parental responsibly any other way eg SGO which comes under the adoption act there is no paid time to bond, get them settled in thier forever home and for the new parents.  These children and parents have the same rights responsibilities and needs of any parent/child often more so depending on the child's background.  I believe there should be leave similar to adoption leave allowed in these circumstances.",
