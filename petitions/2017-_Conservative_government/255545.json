        "additional_details": "The expectations are we wake up at 6, go to college until 4:30, get home at 6 to then fit in an hours revision for each subject (until 9) as well as juggling dinner, chores, family time, extra activities and still be in bed for a reasonable time to sleep enough to function properly the next day. There is no break as \u201ctime off\u201d is used for extra study. I don\u2019t know a single person that isn\u2019t struggling. In addition, we finish the content a few weeks before exams, leaving no time to revise.",
        "background": "Something is seriously wrong with the education system surrounding college. Everywhere I look, everyone I speak to... they\u2019re depressed. I don\u2019t know who thought that cramming 3 A levels (each with about 10 times the content as the GCSE version) into 2 years was a good idea, it\u2019s ridiculous.",
