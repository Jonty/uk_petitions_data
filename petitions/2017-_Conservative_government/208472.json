        "action": "Increase maternity SMP (33 weeks) to match national minimum wage",
        "additional_details": "Due to the financial strain more women are not returning back to work or they are returning back to work earlier than they need to and miss out on bonding with their new born. This causes us to lose skilled women at the workplace and not giving importance to an upbringing of a child.\r\n\r\nIs it fair that SMP is below minimum wage? Why is it not being matched? \r\n\r\nThere are so many benefits that a change to this can bring, families will be in a better financial situation and more likely to return work.",
        "background": "UK is ranked one of the lowest when it comes to decent maternity pay. SMP is below minimum wage, why? With all the things we are doing for equality and empowerment of women, maternity pay is being ignored.",
