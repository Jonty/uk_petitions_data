        "action": "Allow EU nationals with permanent residence to participate in a People's Vote",
        "additional_details": "In light of this, EU residents in the UK have studied, worked, paid taxes and contributed to the British society for many years. Many have permanent residence but not yet British citizenship. They have made the UK their home and they deserve to have a say in the (possible) upcoming referendum. \r\nKindly consider this petition.",
        "background": "The prospect of parliamentary deadlock has revived talk of a second referendum. \r\nThe Brexiteers lied during the campaign and broke election law for deliberately exceeding spending limits and making false promises.\r\nThe public deserves a chance to vote on the final deal.",
