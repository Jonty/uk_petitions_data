If you have made a choice whilst you are alive to donate your organs in the event of your death then how can it be that someone else, namely your next of kin,  can go against your wishes after your death.  This makes your choices whilst alive pretty pointless and meaningless and takes away your last wish",

If i had declined consent they wouldn't be allowed to take his organs even though he himself had consented whilst alive. I find this very wrong",
