        "additional_details": "The law currently requires that all  people on the organ donor register must have the permission of the next of kin after their death before the procedure can take place.I find this ridiculous. If you have made a choice whilst you are alive to donate your organs in the event of your death then how can it be that someone else, namely your next of kin,  can go against your wishes after your death.  This makes your choices whilst alive pretty pointless and meaningless and takes away your last wish",
        "background": "Last year my husband died. He was on the organ donor list yet they still required my consent as his next of kin to allow the donation procedure to be done. If i had declined consent they wouldn't be allowed to take his organs even though he himself had consented whilst alive. I find this very wrong",
