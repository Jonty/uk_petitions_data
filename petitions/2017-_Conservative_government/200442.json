        "action": "Introduce compulsory political education in secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "I propose political education would be two, one hour lessons given to Year Eleven. The first lesson would explain the British constitution (The role of the House of Commons, the House of Lords) and First-Past-The-Post. The second lesson would explain the political spectrum, what \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018left\u2019 mean, and where parties fit within this. It would also explain each newspaper's biases. This would ensure people understand political debate at election time and do not have to be bullied into voting.",
        "background": "31.3% of the population did not vote in the last election. By withholding political education, it is easy to be disengaged and to see politics as irrelevant. Many seek information from newspapers, not knowing they have political biases. Why? Because schools fail to inform people.",
