        "action": "Full scale inquiry into police failings  regarding underage grooming gangs",
        "additional_details": "When the scale of Jimmy Savilles abuse of children came to light it made headlines for months to follow. \r\n\r\nThe most recent child exploitation ring case in Telford is feared to be the largest on its kind in British legal history. This follows similar crimes being uncovered in Rotherham, Oxford and other towns and cities across the UK. \r\n\r\nThe victims of these rings have had their lives ruined, and they deserve a full inquiry into why they were failed by those whose job it was to protect them.",
        "background": "Sign this petition to show your support for a public inquiry into failings by authorities regarding: \r\n\r\n- local councils ignoring reports of abuse\r\n- police forces not taking reports seriously\r\n- people afraid to speak out for fear of being labelled as racist against a particular group/ community",
