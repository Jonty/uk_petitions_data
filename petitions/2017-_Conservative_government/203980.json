        "additional_details": "Public use of fireworks should be restricted to 4 days either side of Bonfire Night and New Years Eve and 2 days either side of Diwali and Chinese New Year, 6pm to midnight only. Any use of fireworks, outside of the specified timings for Bonfire Night, New Years Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year should require neighbours to be informed of the date and duration in advance.",
        "background": "Current law does not properly control when fireworks can be used therefore precautions cannot be taken to reduce stress caused to older people, children, those with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and those with pets and livestock.",
