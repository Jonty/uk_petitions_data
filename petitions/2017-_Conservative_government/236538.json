Catering services are also available to everyone else who works in the House of Commons, visitors and members of the public. MPs make up only a very small proportion of the people who can buy food and drink in Parliament. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the cost of catering in the House of Commons here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
