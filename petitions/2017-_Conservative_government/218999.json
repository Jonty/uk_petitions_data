        "additional_details": "As illustrated by Carillion and numerous other major corporate failures before it, the \u2018Big Four\u2019 independent audit opinion has been confirmed as inherently flawed.  There is an inherent risk in the \u2018Big Four\u2019 conducting annual audits of companies where senior management are ex-\u2018Big Four\u2019 themselves.  A mutual understanding serves each party in this situation as well as the knowledge that any moral hazard contracts or companies are ultimately backed by the government and UK taxpayers.",
        "background": "The Government should change the law so that the NAO is given responsibly for auditing any company that wins Government contract worth more than \u00a320 million and that any appropriate contract must include an agreement to be audited by the NAO and the results made public.",
