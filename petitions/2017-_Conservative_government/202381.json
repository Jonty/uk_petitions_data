        "action": "Provide tuition fee loans for all graduate medical students",
        "additional_details": "Graduates bring valuable life experience to the medical profession but are currently being hindered from completing a medical degree due to the significant burden of paying \u00a39250 per year in fees upfront without the option of a tuition fee loan.\r\n\r\nThe Government already offer tuition fee loans to those studying medicine as a first degree. However, in light of the chronic doctor shortages in the NHS, the Government should extend this support for studying undergraduate medicine as second degree.",
        "background": "The Government does not offer tuition fee loans for graduates studying a 5-year medical degree. This leaves graduate medical students having to decide between crippling debt or dropping out of their studies. Tuition fee loans would enable selection of students based on merit and not ability to pay.",
