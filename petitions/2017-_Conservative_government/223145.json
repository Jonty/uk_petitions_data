It fell for both males and females in the UK, although men still account for 3/4 of all suicides.\"",
        "background": "According to the ONS, \"of the 5,965 suicides registered in 2016, a total of 4,508 were male and 1,457 were female.\" We call on HM Government to take urgent and meaningful action to identify main factors that contribute to men in the UK being three times more likely to commit suicide than women.",
