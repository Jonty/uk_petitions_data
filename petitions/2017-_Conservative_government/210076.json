        "additional_details": "My name is Samantha Billingham and I am a survivor of domestic abuse.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to stop something happening in the first place than to repair the damage after it has happened and with mandatory awareness, we can do that.  The outcome of talking about domestic abuse will have a positive behaviour enabling our young people to deal effectively with the challenges that domestic abuse brings to life.\r\n\r\nAwareness is powerful, it gives people choices, options, knowledge, which could just save a life.",
        "background": "On 21.01.2018 an innocent child lost her life to domestic abuse.  The term \"domestic incident\" was used, minimising the severity of domestic abuse, indicating that there is a lack of understanding of the complex cycle.  Without awareness of this crime, how are we able to protect our young people?",
