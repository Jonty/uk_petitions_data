        "additional_details": "No country in Europe wastes as much food as the UK, despite millions of children, homeless and vulnerable people sleeping hungry at night. The U.K\u2019s food industry wastes 1.4 million tonnes of good produce each year. We should not rely on charity food banks to solve this We should not rely on charity run food banks to solve this problem. In 2016 France banned food waste and made it compulsory for supermarkets to donate unsold food to charities. We urge the UK government to enact a similar law.",
        "background": "The U.K faces a food epidemic of which seems to be growing each year. An increase in food prices has left many to seek the aid of charity run food banks. However, corporate food wastage has slowly been increasing over the years with little being done to protect good produce from being thrown away.",
