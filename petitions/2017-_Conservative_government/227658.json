        "action": "Raise the max speed limit on motorways to 110 mph.",
        "additional_details": "70 mph speed limits were introduced in 1965 when car wheels looked more like today's bicycle wheels. Technology has moved on unbelievable amounts in the subsequent over half a century, and is tried tested and proven to be safe at speeds exceeding 70 mph.\r\nThe mixture of the 70 mph speed limit and today's tech and ease of speed in cars erodes away at our famous British ability to maintain safe lane discipline on our motorways.",
        "background": "Due to the increasing tech of today's cars it becoming more and more unsafe to have an enforced 70 mph speed limit on UK motorways.",
