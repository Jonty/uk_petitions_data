It doesn't prevent children from being enrolled in a school if they haven't been vaccinated.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.health.nsw.gov.au/immunisation/Pages/immunisation-in-schools.aspx#1\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly what action you would like the UK Government or Parliament to take."
