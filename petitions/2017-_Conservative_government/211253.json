        "additional_details": "I had other pelvic issues which I eventually was given a smear test at 18, I was diagnosed with CIN which has resulted with me having my cervix cauterised twice. If had been left longer it would have been a lot worse. I was given the 3 hpv jabs when I was roughly 14 which failed. So many young people die from undiagnosed cancer (not just Cervical)  because of lack of testing. Proffessionals shouldn't stereotype cancer to an estimated age. People should be tested at any age!",
