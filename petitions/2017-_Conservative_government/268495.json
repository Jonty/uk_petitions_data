        "additional_details": "Given that:\r\n- It is unlikely there will be a Brexit option which commands a majority in parliament\r\n- All the Leave options shared the 52%, so none can legitimately claim the mandate of the people\r\n- Circumventing parliament for a \u201cno deal\u201d would not be accepted by many\r\n- Another referendum with just two options would not be accepted by many\r\n- Multiple referendums with eliminating votes would be impractical\r\nEliminating votes by members would provide a fair and transparent solution to the impasse",
        "background": "- Motions on Brexit options nominated by at least 30 members (one nomination per member)\r\n- Members vote for one motion in a public vote\r\n- If no motion wins more than 50% of the votes cast, the motion with the fewest votes is eliminated\r\n- Votes repeated until one motion receives requisite majority",
