        "additional_details": "There have been other examples of Donald Trump's actions since the invitation was issued that show he does not deserve this honour:\r\n\r\n- He said that there were \"many fine people\" participating in a neo-nazi / white supremacist rally.\r\n- He equated the actions of those at the rally with the people protesting it.\r\n- He declared transgender people unfit to serve in armed forces in any capacity.\r\n\r\nThe UK government should demonstrate a break from these values by rescinding the state visit invitation.",
        "background": "After Donald Trump was invited to make a state visit to the UK he used a terrorist attack in London to make political capital and to undermine the Mayor of London's response to that attack. The UK government should make its displeasure clear by rescinding his state visit invitation.",
