It is extremely unfair for people to be paid differently if they\u2019re 16/18/21 etc compared with a 24/30 year old as everyone in the store/job are expected of the same work and expectations/quality of service so why is there a different wage per age? The 16 year old does the same hours and work as the 30 year old. It shouldn\u2019t be allowed.",
