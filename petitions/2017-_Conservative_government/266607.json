        "additional_details": "The public shouldn't be penalised for the banks failings.\r\nThe level of advertising by FCA isn't as suggested nor does it explain Plevin ruling from 2017. About 67% of PPI was commission &some over 90% this is inherently unfair &shows the true nature of PPI scandal.\r\nBanks haven't informed previous complainants &if people haven't complained before banks don't have to contact them which is wrong.\r\nClaims Companies are regulated by FCA so should work together to help consumers not against each other.",
        "background": "I believe the PPI deadline ought to be extended due to the sheer number of policies which have not yet been complained about. Nor have the cases where the the court ruling for 'Plevin' for unfair commission charges is relevant as this is not as widely known about and came out less than 2 years ago.",
