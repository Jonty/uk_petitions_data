        "action": "Commit to increasing the size of the Royal Navy by at least 20% over 50 years",
        "additional_details": "The Royal Navy currently has under eighty commissioned ships. Only 3/4 of those are operational at any one time. These numbers are too small, especially compared to the 430 ships of the US Navy or the nearly 500 ships of China. In 1945 at the end of the Second World War, the Royal Navy had 900 ships, today's navy is less than 1% the size of then. We don't need to increase back to wartime levels, but we do need to increase the Navy's size considerably.",
        "background": "Historically, the Royal Navy was the best in the world. Now, it's barely in the top ten. We need to be secure, it's not a luxury but a requirement. While the existing fleet is well equipped, there aren't enough ships to be everywhere needed. 20% in 50 years isn't a huge increase, but it's a start.",
