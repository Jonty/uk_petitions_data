        "additional_details": "The government set our national minimum wage, \r\nThey also state the hours required to receive carers allowance must be 35 or more, leaving less sufficient time to maintain a second job,\r\n\u00a364.20 after working 35 hours is equivalent to \u00a31.80 per hour, \r\nHow can a carer live, pay the bills, and survive ??? \r\nSome of the carers have absolutely no choice to care, for a sick member of their family, some of them being young or ill them selfs- but have to settle for \u00a364.20 p/w!!",
        "background": "This petition is asked, for the carers allowance to be raised to the national minimum wage, \r\nCarers have to devote a minimum of 35 hours per week to provide care for a disabled person - the allowance is of only \u00a364.20 per week.",
