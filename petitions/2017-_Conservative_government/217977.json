        "additional_details": "The 1948 Palestinian exodus, also known as the Nakba, literally \"disaster\", \"catastrophe\", or \"cataclysm\"), occurred when more than 700,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from their homes, during the 1948 Palestine war. Between 400 and 600 Palestinian villages were sacked during the war, while urban Palestine was almost entirely extinguished. The term \"nakba\" also refers to the period of war itself and events affecting Palestinians from December 1947 to January 1949",
        "background": "On Friday 30th March this year Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip gathered at various points along the border with Israel to peacefully protest the blockade and demand their right of return to homes that they had been driven out of in 1948 during the Nakba. Now 30 are dead and 1000+ injured.",
