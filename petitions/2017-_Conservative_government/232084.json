        "additional_details": "Example; I have 2 deaf parents whom are both deaf and dumb, they have 5 kids to rely on to speak on behalf of them at shops or speak to at doctors or whenever they need to communicate to a hearing person who cannot sign. its hard to communicate with strangers. They feel like they can\u2019t go out together as a couple without taking a hearing person to communicate on their behalf. I think it\u2019s unfair.  I think foreign language should be an option in secondary school and BSL to be taught in schools.",
        "background": "I think it\u2019s important that children/people should be taught sign language at a young age so they know how to communicate with the hard of hearing.",
