Have these men not paid enough already? I feel it appropriate that an official request is sent to the French government in the attempt of stopping such despicable exploitation of the final mass gathering of Normandy veterans. As an example, some hotels based in Caen have a usual rate of between 120 and 160 euros per night. One of the more prominent veteran's associations have just been quoted a rate of 300 euros per night for the week of 6th June, 2019. This is more than double the usual average.",
