        "additional_details": "Brexit passed with a very small majority in the referendum of 2016. That is not enough of a mandate for the government to keep going with the brexit process when large numbers of people protest in the street and even larger numbers sign petitions to be heard. \r\nThe Government is failing its people, by refusing to listen to what we want. This petition will ask for the government to give us a voice and to listen to what we say. \r\n\r\nA survey carried out should be either via post or online.",
        "background": "Public opinion has changed over the past couple of years regarding Brexit.\r\nThe process of securing a deal is becoming more and more undemocratic, with our voices being lost, the public is being ignored. \r\nIf Brexit is still the 'will of the people', then a simple poll can uphold this mandate",
