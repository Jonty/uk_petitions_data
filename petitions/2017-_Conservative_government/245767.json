        "additional_details": "It takes years for victims to come forwards & tell someone about their abuse as a child. \r\nTo use \u201cspaffed\u201d the urban slang for ejaculate to describe money spent investigating these crimes is vile & he needs to apologise in the commons or resign. \r\nIt is not a waste of money, because offenders don\u2019t stop until they are made too. This means not just getting justice for historic victims but protecting children today & in the future. 1 in 6 sexually abused in the UK & they deserve justice.",
        "background": "MP Boris Johnson went on the Radio & when asked where police money could be saved, he said historic child sexual abuse investigations had \u201cspaffed\u201d \u00a366m up the wall. His comments are vile, unfounded & he is not fit for public office. His terminology deeply offensive to survivors of CSA.",
