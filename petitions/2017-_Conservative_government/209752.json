        "action": "Change the UK law on rape to include female on male rape.",
        "additional_details": "I propose that the law should be adapted to:\r\n\r\n (1) A person (A) commits an offence if-\r\n\r\n  (a) A intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis; \r\n                     or \r\n  (b) A intentionally penetrates their own vagina, anus or mouth with another person\u2019s (B) penis: \r\n                    and:\r\n (c) B does not consent to the penetration, and \r\n  (d) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.\r\n\r\nThe Government said that it was committed to tackling sexual offending. Yet, today, according to the law, a woman, except in a few rare instances, cannot commit rape.",
        "background": "THE LAW ON RAPE IS SEXIST\r\n\r\nThis is unjust and discriminates against men, as women who penetrate their own vagina with a man's penis against his will, can only be convicted of the lesser crime, which carries a\r\nlower minimum sentence.",
