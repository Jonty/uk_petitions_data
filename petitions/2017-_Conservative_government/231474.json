        "additional_details": "The EU has backed the abolition of DST. We are scheduled to leave the EU at the end of March, when the clocks move an hour ahead. If Europe abolishes DST and we continue to observe DST, Northern Ireland would have an hour difference with the rest of Ireland for half of the year which would mean, people heading to the ROI would need to change their time 1 hour behind. The EU and EFTA have planned to abolish DST in 2019. The UK should abolish DST at the same time as the rest of Europe.",
        "background": "Daylight Saving Time does not do Britain any good, it just causes us to move our clocks 1 hour ahead and the difference can be seen at morning and night. When DST begins, we lose an hour into Sunday morning, but we regain that hour when DST ends in October. People should be given a vote to decide.",
