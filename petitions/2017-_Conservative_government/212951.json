        "action": "Introduce mandatory labelling for meat from animals reared with antibiotics.",
        "additional_details": "Awareness of the threat of antibiotic resistance is increasing. Public health measures to deal with it have focussed on correct use and prescription of therapeutic antibiotics. However, there is less knowledge of the threat posed by veterinary antibiotics.\r\n\r\nA food labelling regime would raise awareness of this issue, and support the ongoing aim of reducing use. It also informs consumers about agricultural practice on imported food, which will be more important after Brexit.",
        "background": "Increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance is \"one of the biggest threats to global health\" (WHO). Agricultural use of antibiotics in the UK is decreasing (UK-VARSS), but knowledge of the threat to public health is limited. Labelling would increase knowledge and encourage consumer choice.",
