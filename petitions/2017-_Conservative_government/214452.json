        "action": "Amend the knife law: Ban drop point blades and thumb studs.",
        "additional_details": "Current knife law is designed around preventing stabbings and keeping our streets safe. (https://www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives) Drop and clip point knives are not restricted under this law. These knife types are designed to cause worse stab wounds. (https://www.knife-depot.com/knife-information-105.html, https://www.knife-depot.com/knife-information-104.html)\r\nThumb studs (also legal) convert knives into switchblades in all but name. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zCMe1q8MY8)",
        "background": "Knife crime is a serious problem in our nation. Drop and clip point blades (blades with a point designed to achieve greater penetration when used to stab) and thumb studs (nubs of metal that allow a knife to be rapidly opened with one hand) should be banned to reduce the severity of knife attacks.",
