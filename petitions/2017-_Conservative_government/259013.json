        "additional_details": "After doing questioning and research it is inevitably apparent that Circus animals are not kept in the conditions they should be and that they are mistreated. \r\n\r\nFrom the words of RSPCA UK \"We don't believe animals should be subjected to the conditions of circus life. Regular transport, cramped and bare temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and crowds of people are often unavoidable realities for the animals.\" \r\n\r\nIs this right? Should we allow animals to live this way? NO",
        "background": "Today we all know a lot about our planet and how it is going slowly downhill but we do not always focus on the creatures that make our planet run. It is not a question that Circuses are fun to see but do we really know what goes on behind closed doors?.",
