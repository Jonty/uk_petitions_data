        "additional_details": "Recently 2 low-cost airlines started flying from Ukraine directly to the UK, and 1,5 years need for Schengen visa was canceled for Ukrainians. These have made possible to travel from the UK to Ukraine and vice versa even more appealing.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that is still missing from the equation of perfectness is a possibility to easy and fast pass border when one is arriving in the UK. Queues in the airports at immigration control for non-EU citizens can take up to a few hours. Possibility to have a way to use e-Gates to enter the country will save Ukrainian people numerous hours, especially for those who are traveling to the UK a lot, or who are living in the UK (like me) and like to travel or to the home country or to other destination.",
        "background": "With new low-cost flying directly from Ukraine traveling to the UK number of people who are visiting the UK with Ukrainian passports rise. However, queues at immigration control in airports can be long and take a few hours.",
