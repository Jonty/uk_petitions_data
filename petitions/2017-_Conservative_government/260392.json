        "additional_details": "Ivy, my double merle border collie was born with dwarfism, epilepsy, incontinence, liver and kidney defects, a poor immune system, deaf, going blind and at 15 months old collapsed and lost her battle. Her brother Morty also passed away just a few weeks later. These puppies deserved a healthy long life. If the breeder had tested the parents genetically he would have known they were not at a good standard to breed. We need to care more about the animals and less about the money.",
        "background": "My border collie along with hundreds of thousands of other dogs have been bred poorly to the extent where they have physical and psychological defects. Ivy's Cause was set up to show people just how bad it can get for these dogs.",
