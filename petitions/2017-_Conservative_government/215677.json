        "additional_details": "I would like each MP to individually provide written answers to the following three pairs of questions:\r\n\r\n1. What economic benefits will leaving the EU bring? When?\r\n2. What social benefits will leaving the EU bring? When?\r\n3. What trade deals will we get, that exceed those we have by virtue of EU membership? When?",
        "background": "The EU referendum was advisory & produced a very slim majority to leave. MPs have been hiding behind this result. Some are still using the kind of rhetoric that has been proven to be undeliverable. We need MPs to individually explain why they think leaving the EU is in the interests of the country.",
