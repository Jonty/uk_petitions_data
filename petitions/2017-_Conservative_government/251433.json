        "additional_details": "The cause for this petition is Parliament does not represent the people, a lot of MP's have voted against their constiuents and against the people. We the people feel betrayed and recent events in Parliament such as taking away power from the PM, potentially set precedent and could mean in future MP's can take power if they feel they like they disagree with the elected PM. They are changing British politics and they need to go as soon as possible.",
        "background": "I want to Hold a general election to oust all of the non trustworthy MP's that are betraying the people and betraying the wishes of the majority of voters. The houses of Parliament is a Broken establishment and we the people need to fix it. Also the speaker should be replaced for someone less bias.",
