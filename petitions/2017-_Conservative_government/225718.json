        "additional_details": "There were 3,126 cases of cervical cancer in 2015. How many of these women were over 25? We don\u2019t know. \r\nThere were 854 deaths caused by cervical cancer in 2016 alone.\r\n99.8% of cases could of be prevented in 2016, is this because some of the women were under 25 and weren\u2019t provided a smear test?\r\nBeing 19 and having issues and worries about my health is scary, to not be provided a smear test for me is upsetting and worrying. Please help me lower the age to 16 at the very least. Help save lives.",
        "background": "The legal age to be provided a smear test is 25, why is this? Because it seems to be that it is \u2018rare\u2019 for women to be diagnosed with cervical cancer under the age of 25, but it happens. \r\nThis is why I want to lower the age to at least 16, seeing as this is the LEGAL age to have sex.",
