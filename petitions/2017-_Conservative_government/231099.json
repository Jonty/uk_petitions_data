        "additional_details": "I ask for your support to get the Government to review the current fines imposed to be more reflective of the crime. \u00a3120 is less than the cost of most insurance cover and therefore not a deterrent. I propose a minimum fine of \u00a31000+ to stop people driving without insurance.",
        "background": "In March 2018 we were hit by an uninsured driver. I was left with 7 broken bones, an operation, 7 days in hospital and the ongoing prospect of an 18 month recovery period.\r\n\r\nThe magistrates have banned the driver for 6 months and fined them just \u00a3120 for this offence.",
