        "additional_details": "I was diagnosed with a form of learning \u201cdisability\u201d in high school. From my perspective this ability has never been a detriment to me in fact in many ways it has been a strength as I learn very visually and so I am able to create simple views of complex information. \r\n \r\nHowever the cultural reference of a disability drives a lack of acceptance within the work place and society. \r\n \r\nDo you have a different ability and would like it recognised as such?\r\n \r\nSmall words have big affects.",
        "background": "I do not believe that all \u201cdisabilities\u201d put people at a disadvantage as implied by the term dis-ability. I believe this reference drives a thinking and culture that is not inclusive and supportive of many peoples varying abilities. I believe all references should refer to different abilities.",
