        "additional_details": "\"The UK supply chain supports 1,700 companies across a diverse lighting sector and is worth \u00a32.3bn to the economy. The UK is home to more than 140 lighting design practices that specify lighting for mainly overseas projects and which present a unique opportunity for lighting manufacturers to access global markets.\u201d Michael Fallon MP.\r\n\r\nJobs are being lost across the sector, training has almost ceased because retailers cannot make a living; this must be urgently reviewed to save the industry.",
        "background": "The CMA investigation considers only price maintenance. It has taken a simplistic view of how this will affect consumers and business in the short term. There is no consideration of the longer term & how this ruling is forcing retailers to close, removing our conduit to consumer education and jobs!",
