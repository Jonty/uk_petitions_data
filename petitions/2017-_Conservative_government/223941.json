        "additional_details": "UK electoral turnout is at historic lows, part of this is because the electorate do not want to vote for any of the given parties. High votes to abstain in constituencies would give people the option and drive to create new political representation for the people based on demand.",
        "background": "I have now reached a point of such dissolutionment with our political class that I no longer feel that I can vote for any of them. Rather than simply not vote, I believe that a democratic country like ours, should give the option to abstain and in effect vote 'none of the above'.",
