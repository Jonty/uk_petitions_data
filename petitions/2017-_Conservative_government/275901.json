        "additional_details": "Went to a restaurant recently and asked for the allergy book, allergy book arrives and the waitress says we do not make the burger buns and there may be some cross contamination from the manufacturer. Allergy book says food choice is ok and with no issues of cross contamination. We order food, drinks arrive, have 2 or 3 sips and the manager comes over and says you cannot eat here as there is cross contamination everywhere. He then gave us the bill for the drinks and a service charge of 12.5%.",
        "background": "My partner has a nut allergy and I am worried that one day a restaurant will put her in hospital due to lack of staff training or poor practices. We need a universal system of compulsory allergy labelling on table and window menu displays.",
