The panel needs the power to sanction or remove MPs from office for financial irregularity, lying, or racist, sexist, homophobic, abusive, violent, discriminatory, anti-social or anti-semitic behaviour. Incidents and sanctions should be public with MP's voting records, so voters can see if their MP displays the moral fibre and integrity worthy of their vote.",

Behaviour that would result in members of the general public losing their jobs is ignored in MPs. These double standards must cease.",
