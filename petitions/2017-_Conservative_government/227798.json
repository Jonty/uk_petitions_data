        "action": "Ban night shift working, for the sake of the health of workers",
        "additional_details": "Long-term night shift work is associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, as well as metabolic problems, heart disease, ulcers and gastrointestinal problems. People who work night shifts or rotating shifts often don't sleep enough. Long-term sleep deprivation is known to be bad for health. Statistics show that a large amount of UK workers are shift workers and, in particular, night shift workers.",
        "background": "Studies have established that the health of workers in the UK is directly negatively affected by night shift working. I ask Parliament to hold a debate over this practice. Why are hard-working people being made to suffer unnecessarily, and why does the Health and Safety at Work Act not protect them?",
