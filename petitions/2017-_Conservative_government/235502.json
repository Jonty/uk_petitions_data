        "action": "Revive the Black Arrow rocket program to put the UK back into space.",
        "additional_details": "The Black Arrow saw four launches, with one placing the sattelite Prospero into an orbit around the earth. While the rocket saw two launch failures, it eventually ended up succeeding. Unfortunately, the program was cancelled in favour of using the cheaper US rockets to launch sattelites. With the growth of the space industry, and the advent of Brexit, a UK space program is needed. An updated version of Black Arrow will provide a cheaper alternative to the Ariane or Proton rockets used by Europe.",
        "background": "From 1969-71, the UK launched a rocket named Black Arrow. The program was a success, but was unfortunately cancelled due to cost issues. Now with new technology and cheaper launch costs, it would be great to see this program revived to provide an alternative launch platform for sattelite companies.",
