        "action": "Scrap the \u00a3500 deposit to run for parliament",
        "additional_details": "The deposit of \u00a3500 is returned if the candidate gets 5% of the vote - with low turnouts at elections due to voter apathy , this is a tall order for the minor parties and independents. This in turn puts those candidates in a position where they are forced to consider finances before partaking in the democratic right to stand for election . \r\nLost deposits go to the Treasury's Consolidated Fund, which is effectively the government's current account-that\u2019s why I call it a \u2018Tax on Democracy'.",
        "background": "The deposit is unreasonable as it depends on financial means. The ability to pay a specified fee is not a relevant or appropriate criterion for determining access to the ballot paper. There should never be an \u2018entrance fee\u2019 to democracy, the democratic process should be open to all.",
