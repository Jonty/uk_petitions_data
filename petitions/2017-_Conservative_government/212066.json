        "action": "Ban the use of video interviews using computer analysis to select candidates",
        "additional_details": "Video interview algorithms are set up to analyses both verbal and non-verbal communication. The main problem with this system is that the characteristics which are deemed to be \u2018good\u2019 are generally characteristics which people with learning difficulties, such as ADHD or Aspergers will never display under the circumstances of a video interview. In an actual face to face interview, the interviewer can understand and account for the difference in communication while an algorithm cannot.",
        "background": "Many companies have began using video interviews in their application process. These interviews are reviewed by a computer and never seen by a person. The algorithms used cannot account for behavioural differences exhibited by people with disabilities and so, it removes them as viable candidates.",
