        "action": "Make all CCG's provide GF Bread and GF Mix to coeliac patients on prescription.",
        "additional_details": "This was to stop the postcode lottery of who got and who did'nt. The CCG's say that whilst NHS England did issue the guidance they also advised CCG's nationally that they could completely stop funding all gluten free food on prescription if they saw fit. So what was the point in this change of law! Stopping all GF items is not providing a high quality or optimum service to its patients. Coeliacs have been penalised as its not a tablet they need to be prescribed to control their lifelong disease.",
        "background": "The amendment of the NHS (General Medical Services Contracts) (Prescription of Drugs etc.) Regulations 2004 law to provide GF bread and mixes on prescription is all well and good but what's the point in having this change in law when all CCG's can still choose if they want to prescribe them or not.",
