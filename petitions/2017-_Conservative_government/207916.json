It cuts the inefficiency of time and money spent on applications with no hope of employment and helps to ensure employers can't widen already established pay gaps, offer job seekers a deserved level of clarify and transparency.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours",

Companies offering 'competitive' salaries complicate the process of finding employment and hinder job seekers from comparing potential income and making an informed choice.",
