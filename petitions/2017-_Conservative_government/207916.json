        "additional_details": "If companies are forced to advertise a minimum salary it becomes easier for a job seeker to determine the suitability of a certain position. It cuts the inefficiency of time and money spent on applications with no hope of employment and helps to ensure employers can't widen already established pay gaps, offer job seekers a deserved level of clarify and transparency.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours",
        "background": "UK average salary increases insufficient as living costs continue to rise sharply. Job seekers deserve transparency. Companies offering 'competitive' salaries complicate the process of finding employment and hinder job seekers from comparing potential income and making an informed choice.",
