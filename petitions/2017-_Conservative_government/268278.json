        "additional_details": "A part-time degree usually takes anywhere from 5 years onwards, typically 6 years however, could take longer. A student starting in 2014 would still be studying in 2019 and therefore should be eligible to a maintenance loan. A part-time student who attends a 'brick' university has the same costs and expenditure as a new part-time student attending the same university. The loan is still to be paid back the same and the repayment plan has remained since 2012.",
        "background": "Part-time students were previously non-eligible for a maintenance loan through SFE, only tuition loans. However, in 2018 the eligibility had been changed which allowed new students to apply for the loan. This excluded students who were and are still studying part-time degrees prior to 2018.",
