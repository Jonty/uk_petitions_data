        "action": "Require dining establishments (restaurants, bars, pubs) to offer metal straws.",
        "additional_details": "Metal straws are a better alternative to paper straws as they are reusable. Similar to dishware including mugs and glasses, metal straws can be washed and reused. Therefore, the use of metal straws will produce no waste. The reusable nature of metal straws also provide financial benefits for the establishments as it is a one-time purchase. Furthermore, it addresses the 'soggy' issue of paper straws providing a practical alternative that all people can use.",
        "background": "In response to the problem of an ever-increasing amount of plastic waste polluting our environment, we need to make restaurants, bars, pubs and any similar establishments offer metal straws as a substitution for plastic straws. This will benefit our planet, dining establishments and customers alike.",
