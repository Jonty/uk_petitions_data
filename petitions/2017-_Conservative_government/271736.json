        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson argues that starting a new parliamentary session and Queens speech gives his new government a chance to bring forward its own \"legislative agenda\".\r\nThe only reason some MP's (the remainers) don't want it, is because they want time to scrutinise or amend the new governments brexit policy.  Mainly because they know there is also an increased likelihood of a NO DEAL BREXIT!!!  All they want to do is amend the governments brexit plans as they don't want A COME WHAT MAY leave.",
        "background": "The Prorogue on Parliament must go ahead. Permission has been given to Boris Johnson by the Queen and if it is going to give us the opportunity of a NO DEAL BREXIT then the Prorogue must go ahead as Planned.  I'm sure the 17.4 million people that voted leave will agree!!!",
