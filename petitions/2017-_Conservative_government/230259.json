        "additional_details": "I have emailed the supplier of this product and all they have done is acknowledge they had soy oil in the product and offered a \u00a34 refund. This is not enough. I was ill for a month. This is serious. Prepackaged food is over processed and has added soy in for no beneficial reason other than the fact it is a cheap alternative for the manufacturers. There is a sugar tax in action and I think there should also be a soy tax.",
        "background": "There are many people suffering from multiple food allergies, soy being one of the main culprits. It is hidden under more than 70 different names. I myself have purchased a product labelled 100% turkey and ended up in hospital because soy oil was not labelled. Allergies need to be taken seriously.",
