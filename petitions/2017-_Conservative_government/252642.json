If this petition gets at least the normal percentage of the electorate that would vote in a GE, then goverment shouldn't just say - \"Nah, because we said so\" - like every other petition, hardly a democracy is it. \r\nId also like to vote with STV rather than FPTP to stop this horrendous two party system, but cant win them all.",
        "background": "Of the recent indicative votes and meaningful votes on both theresa mays deal and the other options presented, none have secured a majority. It is time to go back to the people and hold a general election, such that we can get moving again.",
