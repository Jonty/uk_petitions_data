        "additional_details": "Please sign the petition and let\u2019s change the way this country is run. Not for a paycheck but for real, honest reasons. \r\n\r\nThis country should not be governed by the privileged, privately educated few, who have never worked a real job in their lives but by those who want real change. Those who have worked for minimum wage. Those who have survived using food banks. Those who give their all saving lives. Those who understand what it means to live in the real world, with real problems. \r\nThank you.",
        "background": "Too many politicians have personal agendas and this is a conflict of interest when it comes to making decisions for their constituents and Great Britain as a whole. \r\nI feel the reason for becoming a politician, to create change, has become lost in the huge paycheck they receive. This is wrong.",
