        "additional_details": "The first brexit referendum was approached in the much same way as an electoral campaign with little to no concern for long term ramifications, poorly constructed lies and obsfucation, and a complete lack of assessment reports to prepare both the public and our government for a decision that will impact generation after generation British people.",
        "background": "With clearer information, and the dispersion of false statements, the people are better informed and able to make this monumental decision. Decline for brexit support has been clearly evidenced and substantial enough to warrant a second vote.",
