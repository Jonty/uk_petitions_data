        "action": "Make it law for universities to issue refunds to students due to strikes.",
        "additional_details": "Students all over the UK are angry and feel robbed by the money-making institutions that UK universities have been turned into. It is not acceptable that on top of rising student debt and UK Vice-chancellors' spending scandal, students get ripped off by universities like this. Universities are not paying lecturers who go on strike, but are still allowed to keep pocketing out tuition fees for an education we are not receiving?",
        "background": "Currently, thousands of students in 61 UK universities are not getting the education that they pay 9250 pounds a year for due to UCU's strike over pensions. Universities such as Warwick or Manchester have stated they will not refund students. At Lancaster, this petition is already being considered.",
