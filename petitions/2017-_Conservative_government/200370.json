        "additional_details": "Vigilante \"paedophile hunter\" gangs conduct stings and film themselves committing a number of criminal offences including: entrapment; threats of violence; wasting police time; assault/intimidation; theft; breach of the peace; breaking and entering; false imprisonment; assaulting a police officer; and much more.\r\n\r\nThey operate well outside of the law and several of these \"hunters\" have been arrested by police for various offences.  Many police forces and senior officers condemn this activity.",
        "background": "Vigilante \"paedophile hunter\" gangs conduct illegal and often violent public stings against people they accuse of grooming children.  This involves \"evidence\" gathering through inadmissible and unofficial means, very close to entrapment.\r\n\r\nWe believe the government should outlaw this behaviour.",
