        "additional_details": "I have previously been stuck behind a plough in heavy snow sitting in traffic because because would not move out the way. The driver got out and told around 10 cars to move over, he then gave up as others were just sitting there, in the end we was all stuck for over 4 hours including the gritting lorry.\r\nThe new LEDS could have Amber on normal conditions with the ability to switch to blue when required as vehicles would have to allow them to pass to clear the road ahead",
        "background": "New technology is now available for dual colour LEDs that can have 2 colours, I propose that gritting lorries/ snow ploughs be fitted with Amber / blue lights so during periods on snowfall, gritting lorries can switch to blue lights to make it mandatory to move out the way and allow them to pass.",
