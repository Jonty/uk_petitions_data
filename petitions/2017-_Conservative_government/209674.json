        "action": "Turn green rhetoric into an energy reality",
        "additional_details": "If we\u2019re serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we need an energy mix that recognises the importance of gas in home heating, and sees nuclear and renewables together providing most of our electricity, with natural gas used to provide flexible back-up and supply peaks in demand. No single energy source can meet all our needs affordably, reliably, 24/7 and deliver the emissions reductions we seek, so let\u2019s use the best of them together and rid ourselves of dirty coal once-and-for-all.",
        "background": "We need to turn green rhetoric into reality without damaging the economy and pushing up household bills. We can do it by adopting an all-of-the-above energy mix, excluding coal, and by supporting nuclear, renewables and natural gas together whilst investing in energy conservation measures.",
