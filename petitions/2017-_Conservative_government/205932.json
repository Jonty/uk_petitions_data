        "action": "Re-introduce the recognition of all animals as sentient into the Brexit Bill.",
        "additional_details": "MPs in Parliament recently voted to reject animal sentience from the EU Withdrawal Bill.\r\n\r\nThis leaves wild animals and animals in labs incredibly vulnerable. The decision to block the law shows stark hypocrisy on Michael Gove, Environment Secretary\u2019s part. \r\n\r\nCaroline Lucas had her pleas ignored. MPs now urgently need to counteract this backwards step.",
        "background": "The vote removing \u201canimals can feel pain and emotion\u201d from the Brexit Bill ignores basic animal science and impairs earlier Govt. pledges that the UK will be known for strong animal welfare post-Brexit. Laws impacting animals need to note their sentience. MPs must reconsider this law in Parliament.",
