        "action": "Increase the national living wage for all UK workers over 18 to \u00a310.50 per hour.",
        "additional_details": "It must be recognised by all that the social, educational and economic opportunities that are available to citizens who are paid the current living wage/minimum wage are considerably less than those individuals who are fortunate enough to earn more. Any civilised society should strive to protect its citizens from exploitation and hardship by ensuring that the national living wage is fair and equal for all workers over the age of 18 irrespective of contract or skill.",
        "background": "We are privileged to live in a nation of immense wealth and opportunity but it is a sad and shameful fact that this wealth is not more evenly distributed amongst the working population.",
