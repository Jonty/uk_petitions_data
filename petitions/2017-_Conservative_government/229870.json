        "additional_details": "This is NOT right, there are a range of issues including safeguarding of children. As parents and carers we have a duty to our children.\r\n\r\nThe petition is aimed to try to implement a law that states that no child under the age of 13 should be left alone at any given time, the reason for this is due to safeguarding and putting a huge responsibility on children regardless of their mental age. We are not allowed to leave children alone overnight and the same rules must apply throughout the day too. I understand a child must be given due responsibility but under the age of 13 should not be allowed due to risks and safety.",
        "background": "There is currently no age restriction for a child being given the responsibility of staying at home alone as long as it\u2019s not overnight and that isn\u2019t \u201cin a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health\u201d. ",
