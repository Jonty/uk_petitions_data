        "additional_details": "The layout of Parliament - two sets of opposing benches - fails to preach togetherness, but that can't easily be changed. What can easily be changed is where MPs sit. Instead of sitting together, congratulating each other on their shared opinions and virtues, we should instead randomise the seating arrangement, so that MPs of different parties sit next to one another. \r\n\r\nIn Iceland, this is done by design, where it's been shown to diverge the lines of party mantra and independent thought.",
        "background": "We're at a crossroads in UK politics. A side effect of the red hot Brexit debate is that it's drawn out our deep capacity for tribalism. As we lose will to find common ground, we should force the issue: randomise the seating for backbenchers in Parliament to compel conversation across party lines.",
