        "action": "The MCA must send launch request to RNLI when fishing boats are reported overdue",
        "additional_details": "Any delay in the MCA tasking the RNLI can mean the difference of life and death for a fisherman. There is not an RNLI crew in the country that would mind being called to station to launch, only later to be stood down because all is well with a vessel. A change of protocol to require the MCA to immediately task the local RNLI crews is needed urgently. Worse things happen at sea and even short delays can mean the difference between the rescue of a survivor, or the recovery of a body.",
        "background": "Fishing is the UK's most dangerous peacetime occupation. The Marine & Coastguard Agency must immediately task RNLI lifeboats when \r\n1) A fishing vessel is reported overdue by a harbour or family member. 2) A distress signal is received.",
