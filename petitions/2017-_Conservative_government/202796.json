        "action": "Guarantee the UK will not introduce Welfare Cards",
        "additional_details": "This would only induce further stigmatisation of claimants leading to a failure to the \u2018right to live\u2019 (Article 8 & Article 14 HRA) as others in the UK currently enjoy who are employed. \r\n\r\nMany claimants who have paid into the welfare state over their years of work life have found themselves out of work or sick or disabled. This would be social engineering, forcing them to buy goods from government sanctioned suppliers when in many cases goods can be bought cheaper elsewhere.",
        "background": "We the undersigned ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions to guarantee that they will prevent any introduction of Welfare Cards and the removal of choice for claimants of Social Security.",
