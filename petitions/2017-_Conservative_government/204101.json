        "action": "Replace credit card commission to businesses with flat fees per transaction",
        "additional_details": "More people will use a credit card rather than a debit card now there is no commission to pay. This is to be expected, after all, the money is better in their account for a month, but the cost to business is unjust.\r\nThe cost for debit card transactions is around 15p per transaction. \r\nFor \u00a3100,000 worth of transactions at an average of \u00a350, this would equate to \u00a3300. \r\nFor credit cards this could be between \u00a31,500 and \u00a32,000. There is no justification for such excess so please help to stop it.",
        "background": "The government announced recently that businesses are no longer able to charge commission on credit card payments. However, credit card companies can still levy commission on businesses. This is damaging to many businesses, especially as commissions vary, so we must introduce fixed fees instead.",
