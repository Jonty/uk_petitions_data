        "additional_details": "This was set to start in December 2018 but was pushed back to December 2019. There is currently no news about this and no sign that this will happen by the end of the year despite reassurances from the Transport Secretary.\r\n\r\nMaidstone-East lost is fast access to the City a while ago and the major commuter villages on this line (Borough green and West Malling) have been severely affected since.\r\n\r\nThe Transport Secretary should be held accountable for his promises. Help us make this happen.",
        "background": "In 2011, as part of the plans to improve transport between the South and East of England, a proposal was made for Thameslink service from Maidstone-East to Cambridge (via London Bridge) which would improve transport between the major commuter town of Maidstone and commuter villages on this route.",
