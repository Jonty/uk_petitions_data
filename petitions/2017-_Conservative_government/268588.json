        "additional_details": "7.7 billion plastic bottles are bought across the UK each year. Advertising has a big impact on what people want to buy. If we can ban this for bottled water we can hopefully reduce the amount of single use plastic in the world. Furthermore producing bottles requires a huge amount of fossil fuels which in turn affect global warming.",
        "background": "Single use plastic is a big problem for the environment. The government have done a lot already to combat this but there is always more that can be done. The next step is to reduce the amount of bottle water that is sold and to encourage people to use reusable water bottles.",
