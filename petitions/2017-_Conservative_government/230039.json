They deserve to be preserved and conserved against the whims and fancies of developers. Why should we have to destroy our village life to suit the tastes of developers? These beach huts are part of the \"setting\" of St Helens Fort, a scheduled monument and Listed Building Grade II. As such this should be considered as part of the Historic Environment and be properly protected by the Government.",
