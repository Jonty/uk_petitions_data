        "additional_details": "Syria has been in a state of on-going civil war since 2011.  Military intervention primarily by US, UK and France has been sparked by the alleged chemical attack in Syria. Although the OPCW has not yet investigated to verify that this chemical attack did indeed occur. Any intervention in the region will have disastrous consequences for the region and globally. Syria is currently supported by Russia and Iran, and any action will have catastrophic consequences for the world.",
        "background": "The UK must refrain from military action in Syria. Have we learnt nothing from the war in Iraq? This war led to thousands of deaths and turmoil for Iraqi citizens daily. Can we really risk this in Syria too?",
