        "action": "Introduce the Housing First policy into the UK so everyone has a home.",
        "additional_details": "In the basic human rights,  everyone has the right to life and right to a home. Thousands do not have this in the UK. It is the governments job, that they must provide this for all citizens. This is not currently happening. By the introduction of the Housing First program, it means whomever falls upon hard times, has a back up and it will stop the unnecessary suffering of those currently on the street. It is the right thing to do. We can stop this crisis.",
        "background": "The Housing First program is a system that has been proven to work. Rather than homeless people going through multiple stages of housing, they are given around 3 months of accommodation,  by which point they can get a job and begin a new life. It is proven to cut down costs and is morally right.",
