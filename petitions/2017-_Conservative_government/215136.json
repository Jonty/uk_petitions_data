        "additional_details": "In February 1974 Edward Heath asked \u201cWho Governs?\u201d, before losing an election and paving the way for a repeat that October. It\u2019s now 2018 and the question is relevant again. Who do you believe is capable of governing our Country?  Theresa May and the rest of the Conservatives have shown beyond doubt that it isn\u2019t them.\r\nTory MPs just voted to deprive a million children of a school meal, a vote removing the bread from the mouths of the needy while the rich and corporations received tax breaks.",
        "background": "The Conservatives have failed the U.K. it is now time the people spoke as we test OUR Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe recent vote to remove the food from our children's mouths while giving the rich and corporations tax breaks was the last straw.  The lies, the back handed deals, it's time for people to awaken.",
