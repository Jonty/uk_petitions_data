        "additional_details": "The unprecedented chaos of Theresa May's go-it-alone obsession with her way or a no-deal exit from the EU, has seen Scotland's choice to remain in the EU over-ruled with wholly insufficient consultation, and Scotland's MPs mostly left out of many vital discussions.\r\n\r\nThis further demonstrates the need for Scotland to consider the case for becoming an independent state, rather than being ruled by the Westminster elite. Leaving the EU against the Scottish People's will represents new circumstances.",
        "background": "Scotland voted to remain in the EU. In the shambles that has followed, Scotland's MPs have been side-lined by the Prime Minister, and insufficiently consulted. As a direct result we the undersigned demand a second referendum on independence, should the Scottish Government call for one.",
