        "additional_details": "Some disabled people are fortunate to either receive a trained Assistance Dog or have their pet trained as one through an ADUK charity. I've been on a waiting list for 1 1/2yrs through no fault of the charity but due to lack of volunteer trainers. I work towards the same standards of training and care that ADUK require. I feel it's only right that owner trained Assistance Dogs that meet ADUK criteria be recognized and registered instead of being seen as second class Assistance Dogs.",
        "background": "As a wheelchair user it's important for me to take my self trained Assistance Dog into public places having the same rights and recognition as Dogs trained by an ADUK charity. A Register of Approved Owner Trained Assistance Dogs meeting ADUK Criteria would lessen the problem of fake Assistance Dogs.",
