        "additional_details": "Bromley Cross is surrounded by dozens of small villages and communities but this is the only station for miles around.\r\nThe car park  is completely inadequate  and on steet car parking from commuters is an issue.\r\nWithout making any improvements to infrastructure or local transport, councillor Nick Peel has decided to impose a blanket ban on parking near the station which effectively prevents anyone who lives beyond walking distance away from catching the train.\r\nTraffic is already a nightmare :-(",
        "background": "We propose that the government compulsory purchase the land and buildings formally known as Holland's Garden Centre and relocate the station here with parking for 1000 cars, a waiting room with a log burning stove and a licenced buffet bar that must have at least 3 beers from local breweries.",
