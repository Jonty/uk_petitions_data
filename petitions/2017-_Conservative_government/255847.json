        "additional_details": "There is solid scientific proof. We know that carbon dioxide levels are linked to the recent rise in the earth's atmospheric temperature. We also know that the U.K is a massive exporter of boilers, cars, and oil. All of which contribute to the U.K's Carbon Emmissions. Use Dissolvable plastic bags, Stop the use of Fossil Fuels to produce electricity, pass a law on the amount of combustion of fossil fuels or amount of electricity. Switch to renewable energy sources.",
        "background": "Global warming is a serious issue. It is estimated that if we do not cut down our carbon emmissions by 45% in 12 years then, The oxygen that we breathe, The beaches we love and the animals as we know them will cease to exist. Earth will no longer be a habitable place. We need change.",
