        "additional_details": "The proposal is to conduct a potentially rolling sequence of referenda to ensure that the final outcome from the Brexit negotiations reflects the widest possible support AT THE TIME THE FINAL DEAL COMES INTO EFFECT.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 options. 1. Take the deal. 2. Re-negotiate 3. Stay in the EU 4. Leave with no agreement.\r\n\r\nThe voters rank the options in order of preference.\r\n\r\nWhen one option commands more than 50 percent of the votes, or if the top option is 2, re-negotiate, that's what HMG will action.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the option with the fewest votes is eliminated, and its supporters' votes are re-allocated to their next preferences.\r\n\r\nIf option 2, re-negotiate, wins, there would have to be a further referendum 3 months later, conducted as above.",
        "background": "Older voters, who were more likely to have died by the time 'Leave' takes effect, tended to favour 'Leave', whilst those under the age of 18, who will live much longer with the consequences, didn't get a vote at all.",
