        "additional_details": "News panels are widely in favour of remain and are selected with more remain guests than leave. The coverage of the one million strong London \u2018Leave means leave\u2019 protest was shocking in contrast with the remain demonstration one week earlier. The parliament website petition to revoke article 50 was given wide coverage on their news yet the on line petition to leave with no deal was not mentioned.",
        "background": "The BBCs coverage of BREXIT leans heavily on the side of remain when the greater part of voters (over 17 million) opted for leave.",
