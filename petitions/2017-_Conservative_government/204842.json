        "additional_details": "If we are born British then we remain British, unless we choose otherwise.  How can those who have come from other countries and attained a British passport be able to vote in the UK, and be believed to have Britain\u2019s best interests at heart and we are not!  We cannot vote in another country and we cannot vote in our own.  This is not right.",
        "background": "It is not right that overseas voters are denied the right to vote after they have left the UK for over 15 years.  There are very many British citizens living overseas.  Many return to the UK numerous times each year.  Many still own property, have investments and pay British tax for the privilege!",
