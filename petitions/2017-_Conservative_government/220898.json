We do not apply similar measures here and will never do so. The UK avoids separating children from their parents as much as possible.\r\n\r\nLater on the 20 June, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at ending the separation policy. We are pleased that the Administration has changed their position and hope that children will be reunited quickly with their families.\r\n\r\nThe UK has a strong and enduring partnership with the US. Our close relationship means that we can raise concerns directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
