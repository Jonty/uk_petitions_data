This crisis of trust has been building over decades and has only served to make current events more polarising. Now only 19% of the public trust Politicians to tell the truth (Ipsos MORI). Trust will not be found in new policies, committees or changing our constitution, but only by each politician taking personal responsibility to rebuild it, as a priority",

There is a real fear for Society if trust in politics is not rebuilt urgently. How MPs use this debate will define the future of generations",
