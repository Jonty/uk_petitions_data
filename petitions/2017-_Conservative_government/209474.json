ABH and GBH are fairly consistent and consist mainly of DV matters and isolated incidents. Fortis Green has also experienced an increase in street robbery of +19 offences and is an ongoing issue.",
        "background": "There has been a rise in street robbery in East Finchley, Fortis Green and Muswell Hill. \r\nAs there has been a significant reduction in  policing, and the local police stations have now closed we would at least like to have better street lighting and much more CCTV in the area.",
