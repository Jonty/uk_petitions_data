        "action": "Ban the sale of eggs from caged chickens",
        "additional_details": "As Cambridge University has proven, keeping hens in cages results in a \u201chigher incidence of metabolic disorders\u201d, which means that the chickens are under severe risk of SDS (Sudden Death Syndrome). This disease costs the US alone 100 million dollars annually \u2013 surely you don't want to allow this to continue in the UK too?\n\nLetting caged hens have their own space is critical, and if we don't act fast we will be condoning cruelty.",
        "background": "Keeping caged chickens is wrong as chickens are living animals and deserve to be treated fairly. As many trusted sources have confirmed, it is extremely bad for them - they can become overweight and ill and lead unhappy lives.",
