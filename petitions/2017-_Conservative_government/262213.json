        "additional_details": "British Steel is very top heavy. There are too many managers and head engineers not worth the pay they are given. We know very well that governments in other countries such as China India America etc back their businesses. \r\nThis leaves us with the question:\r\nWhy does UK Government not do the same and support British businesses. The country cannot survive forever by financial services in London alone. The country needs manufacturing and farming to be strong and sustainable for future generations.",
        "background": "British Government is constantly making excuses as to why they cannot support British Businesses.  At a time when British steel needs just \u00a330million pounds to stay afloat. \r\nWhy can this government not back British Steel, only a few years ago RBS, Lloyd's were bailed out vast amounts of money.",
