        "additional_details": "The CAMHS and local authorities don\u2019t offer support - even when they are taken to hospital after attempts on life. There are no practical solutions regarding rehabilitation for under 18s and absolutely no rehabilitation support at all for under 16s. All professional services continue to fail our vulnerable adopted children and this needs addressing immediately.",
        "background": "The complex needs of adopted children can be repeatedly ignored throughout their teenage years. To cope they can end up self-medicating with drugs and alcohol to mask severe early trauma and resulting mental health conditions.",
