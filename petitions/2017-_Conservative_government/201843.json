        "additional_details": "Recently, there have been instances where celebrities such as Kate Winlslet have made it public that images of them have been doctored. It should not be up to the models and celebrities to state this. There are countless doctored images that the public aren't aware about, that are constantly thrown in our faces. Advertisers should clearly state that their images have been doctored, as this can give some people the need to get the perfect body, which is obviously made up by some advertisers.",
