We could also go even further with this and have these colours put on the products that go into the bags (e.g. a certain colour recycling logo on tins)",
        "background": "The BBC\u2019s \u2018War on Plastic\u2019 highlighted that many of our recyclable materials do not end up getting recycled, instead they are dumped abroad. By implementing a simple and proven to be effective colour coded recycling system, this could change. The U.K. should adopt 7 different colours in the system.",
