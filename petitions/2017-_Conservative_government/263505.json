        "additional_details": "In some cases like myself, supporting a individual with disabilities can be very challenging and straining, 14 hour shifts regularly. The work load constantly increasing, an immense amount of jobs to complete. Some of the medication we deal with can be very important to the individuals health and one error could lead to death, and all the while we are earning minimum wage. It's a shame as the majority of us enjoy our job but can barley afford to run our own home.",
        "background": "As a carer we do alot more than some people think. We make sure they have someone to talk to, they look forward to our visits, we look after their health, medication, and even take them out to participate in activities in the community.",
