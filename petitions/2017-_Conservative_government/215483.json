It is not appropriate that it is headed and to a large extent populated by those with an interest in undermining the referendum result. We demand the removal of Hilary Benn and his replacement with an MP capable of representing the majority of the country who voted for Brexit.",
        "background": "The appointment of Hilary Benn (a remainer) as lead of the Brexit Select Committee is an affront to democracy and the British people.",
