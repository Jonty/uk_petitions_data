        "action": "All supermarkets in the UK to provide paper bags instead of plastic.",
        "additional_details": "At least 267 different species have been affected by plastic pollution in our Oceans, as well as a staggering 100,000 marine animals being killed by plastic bags annually.\r\nBirds often mistake broken up plastic bags for food, filling their stomachs with toxic chemicals. \r\n\r\nDespite the reduction in single-use plastic bags, large supermarkets and retail outlets still provide plastic bags. There is not a necessity for any plastic and can easily be swapped to a sustainable resource such as paper.",
        "background": "It takes 500+ years for a plastic bag to degrade in a landfill, ultimately becoming micro-plastics that absorb toxins and continue to pollute the environment. Although single-use bags have reduced, supermarkets are still using plastic bags. Paper is fully recyclable and takes 1 month to decompose.",
