Millions of brits are suffering from different forms of mental illness and the government isn't providing enough help for these people. If we can't fix the NHS we have to fix our mental health services. In 2015, 6188 suicides were reported in the UK and since then, mental health has rapidly increased since then. We can't leave people to to pay the ultimate price. All it will do is get worse until the government and the people of the United Kingdom support this petition and make a difference to millions of people.",
