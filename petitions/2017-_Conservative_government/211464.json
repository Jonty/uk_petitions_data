        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that mothers still have more rights to the children than father's do and when a mother just want pick up and move on in a different area, father's have no right to try and stop them unless they take them to court. But in fact its not the father's who get hurt when that happens its the children who are more affected by the move but don't get a say in it due to the powers giving to the mother's over the father's. If both parents had shared custody it could save many relationship",
        "background": "The law on father's rights needs to be looked at and change so that children have both parents in their lives and father's who is named on the children birth certificate should get automatic share custody of the children to stop mother running of with the children without taking it to court first",
