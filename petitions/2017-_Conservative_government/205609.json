        "action": "Establish an urgent inquiry into the sentience of the UK Government",
        "additional_details": "Post-Brexit animals will lose their status as sentient beings in UK law. Sentience (the ability to feel) has been located in animals via research methodologies, which, employed within an inquiry into the sentience of the UK Government, would equip Parliament with an understanding of the science of sentience, disclosing the ability (or lack thereof) of UK political leaders to feel and perceive emotions, informing future Parliamentary debates regarding animal sentience and its status in UK law.",
        "background": "In light of the Parliamentary vote against amendment NC30 to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which sought to transfer EU Protocol on animal sentience into UK law, we ask for an urgent inquiry into the sentience of the UK Government. Do our political leaders possess the ability to feel and perceive emotions?",
