        "additional_details": "The offender was not sentenced until 9 months after Stephen\u2019s death. During this time we didn\u2019t see the offender show any remorse. They appeared to be out partying, drinking and taking drugs. The offender was sentenced to just 8 years in prison and because they pleaded guilty, they got a third knocked off this sentence and because it was a first offence the sentence will be reduced by further third.",
        "background": "July 1st 2017 was the day my 17 year old brother, Stephen, was killed due to dangerous driving. The driver was on multiple drugs as well as being fuelled with alcohol. The car they had was not theirs, they had no insurance, no tax and no licence! They also seriously injured a young girl.",
