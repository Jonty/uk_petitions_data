        "action": "Adopt unilateral free trade with the whole world.",
        "additional_details": "Unilateral free trade is the most pragmatic and fair trade policy for Britain. End discriminatory, mercantilist policies and embrace UFT to (1) lower input costs for businesses and the poorest consumers; (2) allow negotiators to focus on services agreements; (3) stimulate domestic competition; (4) reduce red-tape; and (6) lead by example to make the moral case for free trade. \r\n\r\nIf you are unwilling to show leadership on trade issues, Britain's consumers are more than willing to do so.",
        "background": "We call upon the Government to adopt Unilateral Free Trade to reduce import costs to consumers and businesses. This means removing all tariffs on goods and services, reducing non-tariff trade barriers and recognising other countries' technical standards as equivalent unilaterally.",
