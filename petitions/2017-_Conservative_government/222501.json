        "additional_details": "The US administration is separating children from their parents - supposedly as a 'deterrence' measure. Children are taken 'for a bath', and not returned. The immediate and longer-term traumas of this separation and detention are unimaginable. The UK government should act to make clear that the world will not stand for this.",
        "background": "The UK has a unique opportunity to make a globally significant protest against the US administration's separation of families and detaining of children in appalling conditions. Going ahead with Trump's visit under these circumstances amounts to appeasement of his policy. It should be cancelled.",
