        "additional_details": "I think that 17 is a good age to be able to get a tattoo because it is when a young adult wants to express themselves and is becoming mature. I myself want a very simple tattoo on my wrist that i can hide if i need to and it is very simple with a meaning and i know it won\u2019t reduce my chances of employment. if i can drive and have a child at my age i don\u2019t see why i can\u2019t have a say on what i want on my body even if it is permanent as having a child would affect my life more than art on my body",
        "background": "I think that if a 17 year old is allowed to drive and a 16 year old female is allowed to have a baby then i think it should be legal for a 17 year old to get a tattoo with parental permission as long as it isn\u2019t going to reduce chances of employment or going to be offensive & is a reasonable tattoo",
