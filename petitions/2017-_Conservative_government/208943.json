        "action": "Force manufacturers to use recyclable packaging instead of taxing consumers",
        "additional_details": "Expecting consumers to pay for the cost of recycling packaging is unfair.  We have no say in what packaging is used by manufacturers and retailers and the amount of waste which is recycled varies from authority to authority.  In many shops in Germany, bins are provided at the checkouts for unwanted packaging.  Recycling is never going to increase if the onus is placed on consumers rather than manufacturers and retailers.",
        "background": "Yet another \"tax\" on consumers is being considered to deal with packaging waste (proposal to add 20p to cost of takeaway coffee), following the 5p levy on carrier bags.The problem lies with manufacturers and retailers who should be forced to develop and use completely recyclable packaging materials.",
