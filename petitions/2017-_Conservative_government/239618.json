        "action": "Schools should start a period late on Monday mornings to take the edge off them.",
        "additional_details": "There is a similar petition going on currently saying school should start at 10am every day - personally, I think that is a bad idea as either students would leave school much later and will get home much later which may not be a good idea because they may have a very long journey or have a large pile of homework that day. Also, the staff would have to completely change their days around in terms of their personal lives (childcare, events etc) which is why I think my idea is quite realistic.",
        "background": "I strongly believe that to ease children into the week, schools should start at around 9:30am on Monday mornings because teenagers are too tired and this will make it easier on them and lead to increased productivity.",
