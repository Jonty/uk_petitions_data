        "additional_details": "Main argument of \"enemies\" of pepper spray legalisation is that it will open the door for potential criminals; however, any potential criminals would use any sort of weapons (e.g. knives, sprays) for their malicious actions even without legalisation \u2014 because such weapons can be bought in the UK without any barriers (and even an umbrella can be used as an offensive weapon - let's just ban it).",
        "background": "People in the UK do not have a legal way to defend themselves effectively against armed criminals or simply against those who have a physical advantage.\r\n\r\nIn current situation - potential rapists, terrorists, thieves and robbers have an advantage against law abiding people.",
