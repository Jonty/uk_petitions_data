        "additional_details": "It is assumed that Chickenpox is a mild virus that does not require vaccination. However, this is not always the case and secondary infection can result which can lead to hospital admission and even fatality. The NHS website outlines this in more clinical detail. Another important factor is the sheer anguish and suffering of those who catch it. Chickepox is very itchy and painful and most children find it extremely distressing. When a vaccine is available, would we not choose to eliminate this suffering?\r\nIn other countries such as the US and Australia, a vaccine is offered as part of the childhood immunisation schedule. Let us not let cost stop us eliminating this horrible illness once and for all.",
        "background": "The last four days I have watched my two daughters scream in agony as their Chickenpox became itchy and painful. People presuppose Chickenpox is a mild infection but that is not always the case. It is about time that we eliminated this illness and added it to the childhood immunisation schedule.",
