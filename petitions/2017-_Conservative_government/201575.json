        "additional_details": "The reason I want adrenaline pens to be available in public and food places, one; i'm aiming to ask to help reduce the stigma of not carrying life saving adrenaline pens, two; we all forget the importance of things, three; if your newly diagnosed you won't always get an adrenaline pen straight away. Finally social awareness is needed along aside,training first aiders to administer adrenaline pens. This simple procedure could save many lives.",
        "background": "With knowing how important and life saving adrenaline pens are though past and present experiences myself If I hadn't had my pen with me it could of been different, so what I'm asking you to do is change the law, with potentially life threatening allergic reactions on the rise safety is paramount.",
