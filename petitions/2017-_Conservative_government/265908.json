        "additional_details": "The stress caused by the individual or family is often great. It is morally wrong. Once a the airline has sold their allocated seats for that flight they should never be allowed to oversell in the extreme slim chance they someone might not turn up for their flight. At the end of the day the airline is still receiving the financial benefit of selling out the flight. They don't refund the person who didn't arrive.They still charge them.I find this extremely wrong and it shows the greed of airlines",
        "background": "Everyday people all over the UK get told their airline has overbooked their flight, thus they won't be allowed on the flight.This is extremely wrong and creates all sorts of problems for the person who is meant to be on the flight. The airline don't offer to help find another flight for you either.",
