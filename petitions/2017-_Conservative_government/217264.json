        "additional_details": "Under the Responsibility to Protect doctrine, states have an obligation to protect populations within their borders. This is clearly not happening in Syria. Nevertheless, if action is to be taken then it is vital that parliament make sure that it will be effective and only to help the Syrian people and ensure progress towards long-lasting peace. This includes following through with peace making and peace building.",
        "background": "Whether right or wrong it is necessary for parliament to debate and vote on intervention considering its full consequences. In various situations including Iraq and Libya, British involvement has not been followed through and, if action is taken, it must be with the aim of peace and to help Syrians.",
