        "action": "Ban strobe lighting to reduce the risks of epileptic seizures.",
        "additional_details": "Being an epileptic myself, I know how it feels when we're unable to do something with friends or family, to describe it in anyway possible you feel alone. I would love to be able to do specific things such as concerts or horror mazes without having to wear sunglasses or close my eyes. If a seizure does occur in someone because of strobe lighting it can be fatal (SUDEP) to reduce this risk would be a major step forward. Many kinds of symptoms occur from epilepsy such as memory loss and depression.",
        "background": "So many people are forced to turn away, close their eyes or even have others to protect them. It also prevents us to do something that normal people can do e.g. concerts. By banning strobes we would be reducing the risks of seizures and enable us to do something that anyone else could do.",
