        "additional_details": "This petition is for enabling ILR after completion of 5 years for Established-staff category Visa holders. Visa holders stay in the country for more than 6 years, but not eligible for ILR under 5-year route. The number of Visas issued between April 2010 and 2011 is much less and few people are remaining in the country right now. So, please enable ILR for Established staff category Visa holders under 5-year rule.",
        "background": "As per the current rules, Tier 2 ICT Visa holders, which was issued before April 2010, are eligible for ILR. In April 2010, rules were changed, and Tier 2 ICT Visa was given with the name as Established-Staff until April 2011. This Visa can be extended any number of times but not eligible for ILR.",
