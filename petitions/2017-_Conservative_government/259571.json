        "additional_details": "Currently if you purchase a vehicle say on the 30th of the month then you are legally obliged to \"tax\" it from the 1st of that month however the previous owner has already taxed it until the end of that month, therefore the tax is duplicated. As we are no longer required to display the printed tax disc the sellers responsibility for taxing the vehicle should cease on the day the vehicle is sold and this should then become the buyers responsibility with and remaining days refunded to the seller.",
        "background": "UK Vehicle owners are paying duplicate road fund licence fees when buying or selling vehicles. The old system of pre printed Road Fund Licences (Tax Disc's) are no longer used therefore road fund has no need to be based on a full month.",
