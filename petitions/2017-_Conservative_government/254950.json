We aren't sure how you'd like the way council tax is calculated to change. \r\n\r\nIf you are not satisfied with the service you receive from your council you could raise it with your councillor, who represents you. You can find who that is on this page:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition to abolish council tax and have councils charge directly for services if that's something you'd like to see happen."
