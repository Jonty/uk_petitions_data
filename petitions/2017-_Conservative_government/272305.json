        "additional_details": "Dr Phillip Lee (CON => LD), an MP from a Leave-Voting Constituency, joining a Party whose declared policy is to keep the UK in the EU, despite the Leave vote in 2016, is just the most recent case to highlight why the current situation cannot be allowed to continue.  Other recent examples are 11 LAB/CON MPs who left to form CUK and then IND or TINDS, Austin (LAB => IND), Williamson (LAB => IND) and 21 CON MPs deselected on 3rd Sept.  Voters deserve a fresh say if their choice of Party is removed",
        "background": "Far too many constituents are finding themselves with a sitting MP who no longer supports the Party that they, in the majority, voted for.  It's unconstitutional to allow this to continue.  All MPs who, for whatever reason, leave their Party must seek re-election via the ballot box within one month",
