        "additional_details": "There are huge issues that will be caused by the permanent scrapping of these licences, resulting in huge amounts of damage to crops (hence destroying people's livelihoods), nesting game bird populations, believe it or not, to skylark populations, one of Chris Packaham's favourite birds. This petition is being used to open the door to wildlife activists to attack shooting & fishing in the UK, regardless of the collateral damage it will cause to not only human but avian and insect life too.",
        "background": "Natural England has revoked licences GL 04/05/06 which allow the management of pests & vermin within the UK.  Chris Packham has forced the move by Natural England with a legal challenge. At this time of year especially it will cause great damage, not only to crops, but to nesting bird populations.",
