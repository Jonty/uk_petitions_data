This is evidenced in demands that the government reveals its hand by virtue of impact assessments and other information and other activities designed to actively weaken its position.",

You can read the debate here:\r\n\r\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-11-01/debates/62139AE8-AA75-42F7-85D3-BB50087ACEFB/ExitingTheEUSectoralImpactAssessments?highlight=humble%20address%20impact%20assessments#contribution-E8853E96-A83A-4FB6-9F5D-E6703FD00A14\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask for a House of Commons debate about the work of the Committee, if that's what you would like to happen. \r\n"
