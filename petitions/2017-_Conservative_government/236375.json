        "additional_details": "It is also a fact that the time it takes to enforce can put that person into even more debt, or the chance to lose their home when maintenance isn\u2019t paid.\r\nIt is obvious the person isn\u2019t going to want to pay, which is why it ends up in Court, so why is this not taken as an attachment of earnings or via Court within the order?\r\nThe system doesn\u2019t allow for both parties to get on with their lives as it states is the purpose when the one side is always unsure of receiving what was fought for",
        "background": "When maintenance is not paid after a Court has ordered it it is wrong to have to keep going back to Court to enforce. Apart from the trauma that you go through for years in my case, and the cost which ran into thousands, why should you have to wait and fight again after an order is made",
