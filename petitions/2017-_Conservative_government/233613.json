People are disciplined and even sacked for being mentally ill and forces are getting away with it.\r\nThere are massive inconsistencies throughout the country in treatment, IF support is given this is limited due to funds being restricted.  Officers are taking their own lives because they have nowhere to go and get no support.  It is NOT acceptable and the Government need to ensure Police Forces take ownership.",

That;s 8 out of 10!!! MANY officers are treated unfairly and go completely unsupported by their force!!!!",
