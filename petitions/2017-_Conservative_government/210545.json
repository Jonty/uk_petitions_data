        "additional_details": "This study found that 1/3 of consumers would actively choose recyclable packaging over other factors:\r\nRokka, J. and Uusitalo, L. (2008)\r\n- therefore 2/3 of people will not actively select environmentally friendly alternatives, a huge portion of the British population\r\n\r\nThis study indicates that indifference is the key factor to be overcome when considering environmentally friendly choices:\r\nDelistavrou, A. Katrandjiev, H. and Tilikidou, I. (2017)\r\n - regulation would overcome this indifference",
        "background": "For medical/industry use, non-recyclable plastics may be a necessity.  However, there are many viable alternatives to non-recyclable packaging and there is no good reason for these not to be used for consumer products.  This would reduce the waste plastic in the UK substantially at minimal cost.",
