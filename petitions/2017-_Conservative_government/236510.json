In particular, we're not sure what taxes you'd like the NHS and its staff to be exempt from paying. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to exempt the NHS from paying VAT and NHS staff from paying income tax, if that's something that you'd like to happen.
