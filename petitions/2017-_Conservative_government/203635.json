        "additional_details": "There are many alternatives to animal testing that I personally feel it's ludicrous that it continues to happen.  I believe a clear, simple \"Tested on Animals\" stamp/logo should be introduced which can be added to all products that chose to continue animal testing.  This will allow the consumer to quickly identify these products and ensure they are making an informed choice in what they are supporting. Animal testing companies are comfortable with doing so, so shouldn't have an issue showing it.",
        "background": "As an animal lover I am often shocked to learn I unintentionally support Animal Testing.  I'm certain I cant be the only one. \r\nI believe its the consumers right, at a glance, to be able to tell if a product has been tested on animals or not.",
