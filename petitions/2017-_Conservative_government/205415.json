        "additional_details": "This way it have much more of an equal affect upon the culprit and even out some balance of a unfair prosecution system which effects the poorest more.\r\n\r\nFor example in October this year (2017) a professional footballer was caught speeding and was fined \u00a3440, alot of money for a person on minimum wage but does not have the same impact on someone reportedly earning \u00a337,500 per week. This may be an extreme example however I feel this change allow punishment to be felt equally across the board.",
        "background": "Instead of a fixed price fine we should have a proportional fine so it affects each person the same way, it should be 10% of the offending persons average weekly wage (10% of 1/52th, 1 weeks worth, of last year's net pay) or a minimum of \u00a380, whichever is the greater.",
