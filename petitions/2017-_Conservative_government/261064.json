        "additional_details": "Due to the advice the government gave at the time, the public were missold  and misrepresented diesel cars. All cars Diesel made and purchased before 2015 and after 1998 fall in to this bucket of missold cars. It is unfair and unlawful the public should suffer due misrepresentation, I believe the either one of these is applicable here (fraudulently, negligently, or innocently). Diesel car owners selling their cars especially in London are getting less money as the cars attract ULEZ fees.",
        "background": "Gordon Brown, who at the time was the Chancellor of the Exchquer, announced in 1998 that \u201cdiesel cars should attract less vehicle tax than their petrol equivalents because of their better CO2 performance\u201d. Myself, like many others brought Diesel Cars thinking running and owning them would be cheaper",
