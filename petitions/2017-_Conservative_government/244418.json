Bringing back apprenticeships would make a difference not just for my child but for all children.\r\n\r\nI also believe this will help with the knife crime in our country and keeping the kids off the streets once they believe that someone is willing to give them a chance and teach them a proper trade. Younger kids are being used as drug runners for the older people because they have nowhere else to go and these kids of today do not find school a happy place.",
