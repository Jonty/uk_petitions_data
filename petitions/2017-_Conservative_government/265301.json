        "additional_details": "According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA) in 2016, 98% of vets they surveyed have been asked to euthanise a healthy pet, with 53% describing this as not a rare occurrence. Some of the reasons given to surveyed vets include poor health of the owner, no the pet, and the owner moving to accommodation unsuitable for the pet. Futhermore the Dogs Trust in 2015 have said that councils have to put down healthy strays due to \"a lack of space and resources\".",
        "background": "Currently in the UK it is legal to euthanise healthy animals. It is absolutely disgraceful that we can choose to end the life of an animal who is not suffering and isn't a significant threat to humans for any reason we please, such as cost or poor behaviour.",
