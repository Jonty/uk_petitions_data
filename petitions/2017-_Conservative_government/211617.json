As the city has grown, the FM radio service has diminished, which in such a thriving, multi-cultural city, cannot be right.",
        "background": "One of the fastest growing cities in the country is neglected by FM radio-nobody broadcasts from the city-the BBC is based in Cambridge, Heart is too and Connect broadcast from Kettering. Peterborough is only given lip service by these stations and deserves it's own service for Greater Peterborough.",
