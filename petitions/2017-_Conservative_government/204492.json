        "additional_details": "We've seen a sharp rise in pet thefts and millions of Britons will agree, pets are more than just property, they are family. \r\n\r\nWe the undersigned request that this government takes further steps to protect animals and owners by clearly outlining:\r\n\r\n1) What is seen as acceptable steps to reunite owners with their pets. \r\n\r\nWe strongly urge the requirement for chips to be checked as soon as an animal is discovered. This step will allow the police to have a clear view of what is seen as acceptable so \"intent to deprive\" can be formed. \r\n\r\n2) Reconsider the use the term of \"property\" for pets. \r\n\r\nLegislation regarding animal welfare shows that we do see them as more than possessions.",
        "background": "When clear intent is shown to deprive a family or persons of their pet the police should have the framework in place to ensure the CPS can make an informed decision on prosecution, the Theft Act 1968 doesn't outline what is seen as acceptable steps to reunite an owner with their pet.",
