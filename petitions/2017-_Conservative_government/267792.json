In particular, we're not sure whether you want to abolish all Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) for people who claim free NHS prescriptions when ineligible, or change the eligibility rules or make them clearer in some way.\r\n\r\nThe eligibility rules are set out here:\r\n\r\nhttps://contactcentreservices.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/selfnhsukokb/AskUs_HWHC/en-gb/8202/qualifying-benefits/31018/which-benefits-entitle-me-to-free-nhs-prescriptions\r\n\r\nIf you were entitled to a free prescription, or had an exceptional reason not to pay, you can challenge a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN). You can find out how to challenge your PCN here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pay-or-challenge-penalty-charge-notice\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
