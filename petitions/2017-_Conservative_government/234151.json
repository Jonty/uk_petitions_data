        "additional_details": "- 16-25 railcards are void as they require a minimum \u00a312 fare between 4:30 AM and 10:00 AM \r\n- This is the time frame the majority of pupils travel to school in and often there ticket prices are less than \u00a312 so they are being charged as an adult to go to a institute designed for children \r\n- This allows more children to be able to afford to travel to sporting clubs and activity\u2019s \r\n- It will also in theory decrease the amount of 16+ year olds boarding trains without tickets due to lack of money",
        "background": "All people from 5 years old to the age of 18 years old should be charged a child\u2019s ticket price. A 16-25 railcard is void for most pupils in peak morning times as it then requires a minimum fare of \u00a312. If the government views us as children then so should travel companies",
