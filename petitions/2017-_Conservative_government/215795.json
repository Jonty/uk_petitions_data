The TERMS under which we leave are important: Deal? or No Deal?. (NOT \"Stay in EU\"). We MUST have a voice on HOW we are leaving!!! If no Referendum is granted, the next General Election will become a Vote of Confidence in the Government. Negotiators NEED a Referendum to make them concentrate on obtaining an acceptable outcome.",
