        "additional_details": "If you are so much in doubt then give the people a vote, leave on NO DEAL or leave with a DEAL thats all you have to ask.\r\nYou told us we would leave on a No Deal yet you keep trying to make deals and extensions. Parliament even tried to stop a No Deal which is not what the people asked for and not what we were promised. Deliver what we asked for, a NO DEAL and lets move on, by making meaningful deals for trade and work on getting UK back on track without the EU influence.",
        "background": "The people were asked to vote whether they wanted to leave on WTO aka No Deal or stay in EU, the people voted to leave, please uphold what the people asked not what you want, as we all know you want a deal that ruins the UK. Uphold democracy and do what people voted for, extension is not acceptable.",
