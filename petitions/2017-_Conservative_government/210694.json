        "additional_details": "Children all over the world are being diagnosed with a serious illness every day, they go through so much, treatment for an illness such as cancer makes the child's hair fall out. Sadly many children in schools including higher education schools are being called names, spat on, laughed at, wigs pulled off there head. It is getting out of control, it is time these children understood the damage they are causing to the confidence of these sick children. Schools need to help to stop this happening.",
