        "additional_details": "Many Sikhs experience discrimination and racism and in 2019 this is unacceptable. It is heart breaking that people are persecuted like this, usually due to ignorance. The only cure for ignorance is education. Sign this petition in support.",
        "background": "74.5% of Sikhs have experienced racism in the United Kingdom. In spite of this 95% of Sikhs are proud of being born and living in the UK. Sikhs are often mistaken for Muslims and subjected to abuse. If children were better educated about Sikhism hate crimes could be avoided.",

However, the decision on which religions should be taught is not set by the UK Government or Parliament. This is set by local authorities.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7167/CBP-7167.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the UK Government to change the law to require schools to teach a set list of religions, including Sikhism, if that is something you would like to see happen."
