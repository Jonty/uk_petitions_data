        "additional_details": "School Support Staff are the hidden professionals, who provide invaluable support to children and to the teachers, and are the backbone of our education system. They help the most vulnerable children attain an education, and schools cannot function without them.  As a consequence, many children would struggle and leave school without the qualifications and skills needed in adulthood.  Cutting support staff will affect the outcomes and life chances of our children for generations.",
        "background": "As a result of spending cuts many schools have reduced the number of teaching assistants so they are expected to do more and having extra duties imposed upon them. Schools should have the funding and freedom to employ the right level of Teaching Assistants appropriate to the needs of their pupils.",
