        "additional_details": "The government shouldn\u2019t kill off the things that most people enjoy and that\u2019s their vehicle. Whether it\u2019s diesel, petrol or electric it still should be those three and not only the silent one. Japan has a big car culture and I think The UK should be the same. Yes there is a CO2 crisis but take out the other causes of pollution rather than people\u2019s cars. Not everyone would like to drive a Prius, hopefully this would reduce the charges on emissions/road tax and fuel prices. So we can enjoy cars.",
        "background": "Listen and look into the future, it\u2019s going to be pretty boring if all we have is electric cars. There are more car enthusiasts than environmentalists. A ban on petrol and diesel car sales would clearly not go down well with car enthusiasts, therefore if you could embrace car culture and not ban it.",
