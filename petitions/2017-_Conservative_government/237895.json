        "additional_details": "I am a 14 year old student attending secondary school. I study citizenship, an option for GCSE, and it's the only way I learn about democracy, and not everyone picked citizenship, which is a reason why there is an virtual oblivion with youth about democratic rights. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jun/08/young-people-vote-school-teach-politics-curriculum-election This article clearly explains why schools are responsible for a diminishing voter turnout amongst youth.",
        "background": "Students not knowing about basic democratic actions or what parliament actually is, makes me question how democratic our future will be. School should teach us this so we can sustain democracy and so people know how to exercise their political rights. I believe lessons should be as frequent as PSHE.",
