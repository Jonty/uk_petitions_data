        "additional_details": "In High School, I remember feeling ever so low and isolated. I'd go days, weeks, months wishing I wasn't here or not to wake up. My school would put down my low mood to hormones, other students would put it down to attention seeking - Only to discover later on in life, I had severe anxiety and depression. I went years, feeling useless.\r\nMy blog below explains in more detail WHY we need it taught.\r\n\r\nhttp://journeytowellbeingandme.blogspot.co.uk/2018/02/why-schools-need-to-teach-mental-health.html",
        "background": "Schools in UK should start putting Mental Health on their Curriculum - Particularly in their PSHE sessions. By doing this, it will teach Young People that it is ok, not to be ok. It will give them the chance to reach out, and most of all, give them some early intervention.",
