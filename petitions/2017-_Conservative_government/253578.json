        "additional_details": "It has been voted on and rejected 3 times already by MPs and her bribes and promises make no alteration to the deal itself which is, in her own words, worse than no deal. Mrs May tried to have her resignation dangle like a carrot for MPs to vote for it, they didn't and she should resign for trying to bribe MPs with promises of extra funds and her going, that isn't how Parliament should behave.",
