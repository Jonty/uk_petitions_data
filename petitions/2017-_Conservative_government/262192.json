        "additional_details": "We know that girls are often under diagnosed and misdiagnosed and that children throughout the country are having to wait too long for an autism diagnosis. Delays are often further drawn out because staff who are expected to contribute 'evidence' to the autism diagnosis have received no autism training.  Professionals who work to support our autistic children should only be allowed to contribute information if they have received autism specific training.",
        "background": "Often when a child attends an autism assessment (seeking a diagnosis) with a paediatrician, several professionals must provide autism specific information about the child. Many school professionals have no autism training meaning autistic children (girls especially) are often denied a diagnosis.",
