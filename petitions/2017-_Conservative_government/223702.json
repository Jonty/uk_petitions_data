        "additional_details": "Commercial mass-release events are being marketed all over the country. The organisers will make a good profit  but will have no responsibility for any  loss or damage \u2013 that will be paid by the taxpayer. There is potential danger to houses, aviation, agriculture, livestock, wildlife and the environment. The wood and wire frames can and do injure and kill farm livestock, birds and animals. There is a festival taking place in Buxton in a few weeks time, right next to the tinder-dry Peak District.",
        "background": "Chinese Lanterns are small hot-air balloons made of paper, wood and wire, powered by a liquid fuel burner and released into the night sky. Those doing so have no regard for danger to others. Imagine a burning paper and wood balloon descending onto a house, a haystack, crops or dry grass or moorland.",
