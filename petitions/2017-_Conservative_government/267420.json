I call for regulation for the purpose of making franchise agreements balanced and there should be better exit options for franchisees.",
        "background": "Franchising is growing in the UK and is generally aimed at individuals new to business. As it is unregulated, some franchisors have unfair agreements and terms which need control. The growing trend of franchising means more and more people are becoming locked into potentially unfair agreements.",
