        "additional_details": "A Prime Minister is appointed by the Queen from the largest party in Parliament - this term, that party was headed by Theresa May. However, this isn't a mandate for Boris Johnson. A General Election should be called in order to put Parliament back into the hands of the public. It is vital that the Government has the backing of the public, and the appointment of a new Conservative leader is not a mandate to progress. A General Election should be called to allow a democratically elected leader.",
        "background": "The new Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, has been appointed as the successor to Theresa May by about 160,000 Conservative members on behalf of the 46.8 million eligible to vote. A General Election should be called as the Prime Minister should command the majority of the country, not just Parliament.",
