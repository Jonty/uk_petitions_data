            "details": "It is a criminal offence, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, to cause an animal unnecessary suffering, including by leaving it in hot car. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 6 months\u2019 imprisonment or an unlimited fine, or both. The Government has already announced that it will increase the custodial penalty for this offence to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment.\r\n\r\nAnimal owners and keepers must be aware that they have a legal duty to provide for the welfare needs of their animals, at all times. There is considerable publicity warning people about the dangers of heat stress and leaving animals inside hot vehicles. Owners must be aware that many animals do not react well to hot temperatures, including dogs, and ensure that even in hot weather they are not left unattended in such circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn addition the statutory Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs explains the dangers of heat stress on dogs and the need to avoid leaving them in cars on hot days. A copy of the code can be found here on the Government\u2019s official website:\r\n  \r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/697953/pb13333-cop-dogs-091204.pdf\r\n\r\nBreach of a provision of the Code is not an offence itself but if proceedings are brought against someone for an offence under Section 9 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006, the Court will look at whether or not that person has complied with the Code in deciding whether they have committed an offence.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",
