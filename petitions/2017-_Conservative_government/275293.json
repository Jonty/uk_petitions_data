        "additional_details": "In this country we do not have a written constitution like the majority of modern democracies. This situation has allowed the Prime Minister to prorogue parliament unlawfully. The ability of our elected representatives to scrutinize the actions of the executive must be protected otherwise we leave our democracy open to potential dictatorship.  \r\nOur current constitution is based on historical convention and cannot be relied upon to protect our parliamentary democracy. We believe that our Constitution and the roles of Parliament, the Monarch, the Cabinet and the Prime Minister should be defined and protected under a written constitution.",
        "background": "In recent days we have experienced a constitutional crisis. The Prime Minister has illegally prorogued parliament by misleading the monarch. This situation was only resolved by protracted legal debate and our Supreme Court. We need a written constitution to protect our parliamentary democracy",
