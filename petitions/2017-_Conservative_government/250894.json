        "additional_details": "There are several newborn businesses that offer safety training and posing advice, but none of these are approved or accredited, which makes it possible for anyone to sign up to without actually undertaking any training or being assessed. Knowing how to spot signs of risk is important to stop babies having circulation issues, being put into poses that overstretch them, to protect their neck, etc. Some poses should be undertaken by way of composite but many new photographers aren't aware of this.",
        "background": "At present, anyone with a camera is able to advertise as a newborn photographer, often without prior knowledge, experience of even more worryingly, insurance should anything go awry. Some newborn poses can be dangerous if attempted without knowing how to achieve it, and this can put babies at risk.",
