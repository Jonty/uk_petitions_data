Which has now led us to the Easter break where 14 more strike days have been announced.\r\nThese strikes are having a detrimental effect on our degrees and believe our grades should not suffer due to factors we cannot control.",
        "background": "61 Univeristies across the UK have been involved in extended strike action from the 22nd February onwards. This strike action has now been renewed to continue after the Easter break. As students we have been given no materials to study, and are still expected to take our examinations in the summer.",
