        "additional_details": "\u201cWhite Cider\u201d is cheap, but not always strong (abv) or still. Our Cider and Perry industry is rich in history and our artisan producers using 100% juice frequently make drinks up to 8% whose price reflects their quality. The Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 requires Cider and Perry to have a juice content of >35%. This means that Cider and Perry not made using 100% juice can be made very cheaply. Perhaps juice content is worth considering to target these cheap \u201cwhite ciders\u201d instead of strength.",
        "background": "In the Autumn 2017 budget, the chancellor proposed an increase in duty for still Cider and Perry from 6.9% to 7.5% (abv) to target \u201cwhite ciders\u201d in 2019. We believe that the proposed duty will have a much more widespread and disproportionate impact on the industry than the Government foresees.",
