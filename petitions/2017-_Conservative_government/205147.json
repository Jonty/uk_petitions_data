        "action": "Introduce an animal abuser registry in the UK",
        "additional_details": "There is a strong correlation between animal abuse and domestic violence between humans. Furthermore, there are countless recorded cases of serial killers having tortured animals before moving onto crimes against humans. With this in mind, the registry would not only protect animals and pets from abuse, but also, potentially, humans. The USA is already taking steps to enforce these laws in several areas, although Tennessee is the only place to implement a state-wide registry.",
        "background": "Animal abuse should be recorded in a database similar to ViSOR, in the UK. A registry should be introduced that records the name, date of birth, offence, conviction date and expiration date of all known animal abusers, preventing them from adopting a pet or working with animals in any capacity.",
