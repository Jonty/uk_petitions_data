        "background": "TalkPolitics is calling for an end to monopolies on media ownership. Over 50% of national UK papers sold, are controlled by two billionaires. \r\n\r\nWe're calling for stricter regulations, that limit the amount of national media that can be owned by one person/company to 20%.",
