        "additional_details": "Last September, West Midlands Police sent officers on bikes to educate drivers who overtook cyclists too closely. People who drove too close to the officers were pulled over, then educated on what they had done wrong.\r\n\r\nIncredibly, driving behaviour in the local area changed overnight, with a 50 per cent reduction of reported close pass offences in less than three months.\r\n\r\nSome police forces have chosen not to partake in the scheme and we feel as if it should be compulsory.",
        "background": "Ever feel overtaking cars are too close for comfort?\r\n\r\nFor 2 million people who cycle every day, close passes are a daily occurrence. Close passes are intimidating and account for around a third of all threatening incidents between drivers and cyclists.  There\u2019s a simple way to stop this happening.",
