Nowadays they are uncontrolled and its time to get this control back.This year so far in the London area there has been 50 murders. 50 times people have been stabbed or shot pointlessly. I believe the way to stop this would be for the death penalty to be reintroduced. Seeing your \u201cgang members\u201d twitching and losing bodily control as they are served with this penalty would stop others doing the same.",
