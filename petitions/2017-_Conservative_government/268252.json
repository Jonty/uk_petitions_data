        "additional_details": "Dr Siobhan Weare of Lancaster University Law School carried out the first research into forced penetration in the UK in 2016-17. Their findings showed that many of the participants experienced overwhelmingly negative experiences with the police, criminal justice system, and the law. \r\nUnless the law is changed to classify FTP as rape, these perceptions within the justice system won\u2019t change.",
        "background": "Under current UK law, a woman forcing a man to penetrate her without his consent is not defined as rape. Change the law to endure justice for these survivors, change the attitudes of society and police, and allow survivors to access medical and psychological support.",
