        "additional_details": "UK Armed Forces Veterans are without doubt a proud bunch of people. We don't really like asking for things but benefits such as railcards and other travel schemes go a long way to helping Veterans with work and social mobility needs. We understand there is a charge for such a railcard and, like our serving counterparts, have no objection to paying for one. It is of course a personal choice for the Veteran concerned.",
        "background": "For many years now, members of Her Majesty's Armed Forces have enjoyed the benefits of reduced rate rail travel with the HM Forces Railcard. Recently the scheme was extended to include Reservists. This petition is to request that due consideration be given to extending this benefit to Veterans too.",
