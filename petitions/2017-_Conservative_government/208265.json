        "additional_details": "In the same way cigarette packaging is marked with graphic images of damaged lungs, manufacturing companies should be forced to clearly display that they have benefitted from animal testing on the front of their products. This action would help many choose a more ethical product and, therefore, would force larger companies to seek other testing procedures and fund reasearch into these improvements. \r\n\r\nTesting on animals is a cruel, unnecessary and ancient procedure. It needs to stop.",
        "background": "Consumers should know that they are buying products that have benefitted from animal testing. This is not clearly displayed on everyday products. We currently display that products 'do not' benefit from animal testing with a small logo on the back of packaging. We must do more to improve awareness",
