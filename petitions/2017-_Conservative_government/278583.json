        "additional_details": "16 and 17 year olds also deserve a say in how the country is run. Especially now, with issues such as Brexit, these decisions are going to affect how they plan for their future. If you're old enough to get a paying job, even a part time job, then you should be able to vote and have a say in what happens with the country. Teaching politics in colleges and Year 11 just allows people to understand more and make the right decision for them and their future, which is what adults encourage anyway.",
        "background": "Teaching the policies of political parties will really help students to know which party represents what they stand for, so that they will be a lot more knowledgable. Then, there will be less reason to refuse to let the 16 year olds in the country have a say.",
