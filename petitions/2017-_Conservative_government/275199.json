There could be more serious problems if those opposing Brexit actually succeed in overturning a democratic vote. \r\nLabour, Lib Dem\u2019s, SNP, Green Party, the Welsh Party, you should be ashamed of yourselves for your actions. I voted Labour all my life, but will vote conservative in future. If everyone, got behind the government, there would be no problem!",

The reasons that I and everyone else voted to leave was to do our own thing, to have our own independence, to make our own rules and laws, to make our own trade deals. \r\nThat is what we voted for and want.",
