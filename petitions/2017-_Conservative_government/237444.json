It is truly heartbreaking to see those that can pay privately watching TV a few yards from those who cannot. \r\n\r\nI am certain the public will be happy to fund 1 TV per ward, including all repairs necessary.",
        "background": "Throughout the UK most televisions provided to patients in hospital are now charged at \u00a39 per day, per patient, outside of a 3 hour window in the morning. This charge is incredibly depressing when pensioners and other sick people are becoming increasingly poorer in our society.",
