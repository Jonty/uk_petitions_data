When stopping for a break the best scenario they can hope for is to be at a services. Not ideal but when considered that drivers also have to stop in lay-bys at small roads, it neither desirable or relaxing\r\nIn a 10 hour day, a Driver will typically be deducted 45mins pay because of his mandatory breaks, when they have barely left the place of work for even a few minutes",
