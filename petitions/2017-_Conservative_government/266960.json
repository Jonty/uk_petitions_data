        "additional_details": "Plastic pollution is a problem.\r\n\r\n95% of plastic packaging is lost to the economy after its first use, as only 15% of plastic is collected for recycling, and in the end, only 5% is recycled. (www.bit.ly/2Xz6O9P)",
        "background": "By introducing a policy that will require all new plastic products to be made of recycled material, not only will it increase demand for recycled plastic, preventing it from entering the overfilling landfills, it will help us clean up our oceans, by using the colossal amount of plastic found there.",
