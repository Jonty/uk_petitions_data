        "additional_details": "1. It is likely that closing off the PSW Visa to current students may prevent employers from hiring 2020 graduates, choosing instead, to wait on 2021 graduates for whom they don\u2019t have to sponsor a visa. \r\n\r\n2. The 2019 entrants are contemplating deferring for a year or 6 months if it gives them better work prospects. This would be a huge setback for enrolment.\r\n\r\nWe urge parliament as well as fellow students to help make the visa available to ALL students who hold a valid tier 4 visa.",
        "background": "As international students both current and future, we are immensely grateful for the reinstatement of the Post Study Work Visa.\r\n\r\nHowever, we are deeply disappointed to learn that as current students who campaigned for the reinstatement of the Visa, we may not benefit from it.",
