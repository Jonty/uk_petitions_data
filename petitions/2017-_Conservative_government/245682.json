        "additional_details": "Most people with disabilities want to work, but degrees that are not vocational do not give them experience employers expect them to have.  According to the Commons Library, 51% of disabled people are in work.  However, this does not mean they are in full time employment.  This covers zero hours contracts, part time work and piece work.  Disabled people are also limited in job opportunities, for example a wheelchair user cannot wait at tables, and someone who is blind cannot drive a taxi.",
        "background": "Many disabled people with degrees find it difficult gaining work, as they are told they don\u2019t have enough experience, but gaining that experience is more difficult for them than those without disabilities.  Access to apprenticeships would allow disabled people to get into full time work.",
