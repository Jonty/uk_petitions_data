        "action": "Pay student social workers on Placement a minimum wage",
        "additional_details": "University students who have homes/families and bills to pay struggle to maintain a life on a social work bursary. The placement funding does not cover the miles or the hours driving from one clients house to another over 100 days. Most students rely on family members and friends for handouts and childcare to get through the 20 weeks of unpaid work,doing the same role as social workers on \u00a328,000 a year and up in order to qualify with an MA.",
        "background": "Pay a basic living wage to social work students who have to do 37.5 hours on placement. Students should receive a fair wage to help support them during their studies as part time work is not always an option and so money is very tight.",
