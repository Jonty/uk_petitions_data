        "additional_details": "Professionals such as police, social workers, therapists and teachers are being told to show films containing child sexual abuse to children as young as 11 years old. They are told it will 'reduce' or 'prevent' child abuse - but this is untested, unethical and traumatises children. In my blog, real children told me the harm these films caused to them: https://victimfocus.wordpress.com/2017/07/08/please-stop-using-all-cse-resources-heres-why/\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition and share.",
        "background": "Most people don't know that tens of thousands of children in the UK are routinely being shown videos containing the abuse, rape, drugging, trafficking, harm and grooming of children. I am calling for this practice to be banned because it is unethical, untested and traumatises children.",
