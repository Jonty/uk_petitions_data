        "action": "Shale gas to guarantee no costs to taxpayers or impact on aquifers.",
        "additional_details": "Costs to be measured and paid for include: noise abatement; air quality compensation; replacing damaged aquifers with access to undamaged aquifers; subsidence and seismic damage restoration; and policing. Costs must be covered in full costs before permission for any exploration or extraction is given. Money would be better spent helping protect water supplies in droughts, preventing flooding in storms, and improving NHS and care services.",
        "background": "No subsidies, no research funds. More people in the UK oppose fracking than support it. Taxpayers do not want taxes spent on assisting or supporting shale gas extraction. All the costs of shale exploration and extraction must come from the companies not the taxpayer. ",
