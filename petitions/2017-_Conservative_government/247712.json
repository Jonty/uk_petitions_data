What about \u201cevery child matters\u201d and the fact every child has the right to the fundamentals in life?  \r\nIn high impact areas, of which there a many in the north east, the children WILL suffer. Many families live in such poverty they struggle to provide food for their kids. Will schools now open at 730am in order to meet the needs of everyone? Or are parents expected to make 2 school runs if they\u2019ve children in different year groups?",
        "background": "If the conservatives win the general election in June, Teresa May has stated free school meals will be scrapped and those living in poverty offered free breakfast instead. How on earth is this considering the needs of our children.",
