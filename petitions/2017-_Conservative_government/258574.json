        "action": "Amend the legal definition of rape in English law",
        "additional_details": "In the midst of the #MeToo movement and encouraging people to come forward about sexual assaults, now is the time to change the old fashioned meaning of rape. \r\nUK law tells us that women are unable to commit rape, only capable of sexual assault. This undermines the experiences of all genders who have been the victims of female rapists. \r\nI am asking that we as a society recognise that women should be convicted the same as men.\r\nThe US changed their def. to be more inclusive and we should too.",
        "background": "The all definitions of rape in the UK states that to rape someone you must have a penis, it also does not recognise oral penetration. This is absolutely a double standard which should not exist in today\u2019s society. Rape is not a gendered crime. Females who rape should be convicted the same as men.",
