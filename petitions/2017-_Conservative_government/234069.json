Two days UNPAID does not stretch that far especially when you have at least 3 scans and antenatal classes can be in groups of 5 individual classes once a week. Your partner deserves to be involved just as much as a mother and will benefit from attending all these appointments.",
        "background": "Current expecting fathers are only legally entitled to two days UNPAID leave to attend antenatal appointments / classes. As an expecting mother you should be able to have the support from your partner for any appointment you have to attend and be paid, just like the mother.",
