        "additional_details": "China and Japan are the second and third biggest economies in the world and are creating investment and jobs in British industry. They dispute who owns a group of islands in the East China Sea. Resolving the dispute is a matter for China and Japan, but the UK can play a valuable role by symbolically inviting the two governments to rename the islands to reflect their and our shared values - for example the Confucius Islands or the Friendship Islands. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senkaku_Islands",
        "background": "Britain is a force for good in the world. Remain and Brexit voters agree that we need to show the world that we are open for business. By brokering a new name for the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea, the Foreign Office can highlight our shared values - and encourage trade.",
