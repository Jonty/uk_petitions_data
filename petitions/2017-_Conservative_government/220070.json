        "additional_details": "We can stop this. The first step is to persuade the minister in charge of newspapers and TV, Karen Bradley MP, to launch an independent investigation - with the power to stop Murdoch's takeover going through. Karen Bradley will be scared of upsetting Murdoch. He already owns newspapers like The Sun, and he can use these to bully her. By building a huge, urgent petition, we'll prove that the British public wants Karen Bradley to stand up to Rupert Murdoch.",
        "background": "Media baron Rupert Murdoch is trying to take control of Sky TV. He already has too much influence over our news. This new power-grab would give him even more. The more power Murdoch has, the more he makes politicians listen to him instead of voters.",
