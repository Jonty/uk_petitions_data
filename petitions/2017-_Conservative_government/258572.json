        "additional_details": "I've been educating people about the dangers in & around open water for almost 8 years. In that time I've seen or heard about thousands of water related fatalities. Many of these deaths could have been prevented if emergency life saving equipment was in place at sites where lives have been lost. This lifesaving equipment could potentially save the lives of those in trouble in the water & prevent others from entering the water to attempt a rescue. Swift water rescue crews can be many miles away.",
        "background": "We see a huge amount of water related fatalities every year. Many of these deaths could have been prevented had lifesaving equipment such as throw lines or life buoys been in place. Better lighting, barriers  & warning signs would also help to reduce the amount of deaths we see.",
