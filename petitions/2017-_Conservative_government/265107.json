These claims could have influenced many voters, yet neither was true.\r\n \r\nAt a local level claims were recently made that the merger of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole councils was the direct result of an EU directive. Despite the claim being untrue, nothing could be done to force its deletion from campaign literature.",

Despite public complaints there is no formal action that can currently be taken to prevent such deception.",
