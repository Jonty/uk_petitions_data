However, smokers are still allowed to sit outside establishments, with their smoke often drifting inside. Just walking the streets gets you covered in their disgusting smoke, yet amazingly this is not illegal. It's about time the heath and comfort of all was considered, with a view to some day ban smoking everywhere.",
