        "action": "General Election. No confidence vote from the people in the current government.",
        "additional_details": "We lack democracy as shown by all MP's especially that of who stand for leave constituencies and have gone against the will of those leave constituencies. Such as the three Sunderland constituencies. All 3 MP's voted against leaving with no deal. Many MP's are in it for themselves and it is about time a vote of no confidence was put to the people and a general election was called so that we can put people into power who actually care for the people of this once great nation.",
        "background": "With the current Brexit embarrassment and another delay, people of the UK have been betrayed. We are a laughing stock across the globe. Atleast 17.4 million people have lost confidence of those in power here in the UK. Therefore a vote of no confidence from the people to call a general election.",
