        "additional_details": "There have been campaigns before by Diabetes Uk, the four T\u2019s: Toilet, Thirsty, Tired, Thinner, but it\u2019s not getting through. There have been huge campaigns for the awareness of meningitis (everyone knows the glass test), and more recently sepsis. More children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes than meningitis, late diagnosis can be fatal. I have four children, two of them have Type 1 diabetes, I knew the symptoms so they never got the chance to get really sick. However, not everyone is so lucky.",
        "background": "Type 1 diabetes KILLS, it really is as simple as that. Children and young people are dying because they are unaware of the symptoms until it is too late. Doctors are not testing for Type 1 diabetes, only realising when it too late, and permanent damage has been done.",
