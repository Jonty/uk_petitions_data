        "additional_details": "In 2016, there were 7,327 alcohol overdose deaths in the UK. There has never been a marijuana overdose death. How can a person walk into a shop and legally buy enough alcohol to kill themselves but not even a small quantity of a drug without a single fatality recorded?\r\n\r\nAccording to countless studies, such as one by Epilepsy Research UK, marijuana brings many health benefits, and may have saved lives. This comes with low risk, especially compared to legal medication such as prescribed opioids.",
        "background": "The UK government's stance on marijuana is ignorant. Whilst it remains illegal, the government is denying thousands of people the health benefits that legal medical marijuana brings. Whilst this billion pound industry remains illegal, un-taxed profits go to criminals, rather than to the government.",
