        "additional_details": "The roads in this country now compare to that of a third world country and are full of potholes. With local authorities unable to eradicate this problem and only repair the roads on a small scale it is time for the government to set up a national agency with the sole responsibility to repair and maintain roads in England. Motorists already pay enough money through their car road tax and fuel tax and get very little in return.",
        "background": "I have had to repair damage to three wheels on my car which were caused by potholes. While driving I spend more time looking out for the potholes and swerving to avoid them.",
