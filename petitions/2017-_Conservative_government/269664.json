        "additional_details": "Laybys are not truck stops, and the government should make it an offence to use them in this way. Until they do, these drivers' employers will continue to fail to plan suitable stops for their drivers to take their legal rest periods. The use of laybys as truck stops has brought with it other problems, such as bottles of urine and food wrappers being left, the verges being used as toilets, and fly tipping.",
        "background": "Britain's network of major roads is supported by laybys, provided so that road users can safely park for an unplanned stop. This is now becoming impossible, especially in the evening, because of lorry drivers taking their legal rest period.",
