        "additional_details": "This petition requests an inquiry into the poor performance of the UK rail network and train operators recovering from a power cut on 9/8/19. National Grid limited the impact of the power cut following the rare failure of two power stations in quick succession, but the UK rail network was not resilient enough to recover quickly from the event. In some cases, train operators said their drivers were not trained to reset the trains and needed a technician to do so.",
        "background": "The UK rail network was thrown into chaos by a power cut effecting around 1 million people in England and Wales. Power was quickly restored but trains were stranded for many hours. Thousands of travellers could not complete journeys until noon the following day.",
