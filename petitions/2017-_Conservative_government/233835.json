        "background": "When we hold a General Election, a Local Election, a Referendum or when a union holds a strike ballot, voting is done by secret ballot, to remove intimidation. We should insist on nothing less for our MPs, to allow them to vote with their consciences and best judgement, and to prevent intimidation.",
