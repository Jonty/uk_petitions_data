        "additional_details": "Last reported there were 400,000 compulsive gamblers in the UK but this could be nearer 1 million as gamblers are secretive in what they are doing and are not exposed until they have hit rock bottom (life savings spent, can\u2019t afford to pay their mortgage, lost their Job etc)\r\n\r\nThose that do not gamble they see these people as greedy & having brought these problems on themselves.  What starts as fun gets its hooks into you and then it\u2019s no longer about money. When the fun stops it\u2019s too late.",
        "background": "Currently there is no way to opt out of receiving gambling adverts on social media platforms like Facebook and Messenger.  This is outrageous as gambling is highly addictive and can absolutely destroy the lives of not just those who gamble but their loved ones as well.",
