        "additional_details": "When typing into Google \u2018School makes me...\u2019 it fills in the rest with the most commonly searched items, the words that follow include sad, stressed, exhausted and depressed. A recent study found that 1 in 4 girls show signs of depression at age 14. Although much of this can be due to cyber bullying and social media the study found it is also due to academic pressure. I understand educating children is essential but the current system is terrible and must be overhauled.",
        "background": "The education system is currently a mess. Stress, depression and anxiety are common ways for young teens to be feeling and school is the primary source of this. Rigorous testing and grading put immense pressure on teens whilst later in life much of this is simply forgotten, useless and wasted",
