        "action": "Make the provision of seat belts on ALL school transport compulsory",
        "additional_details": "The legislation in Wales has been changed to make seat belts in school transport compulsory, Scotland are currently petitioning government and are at stage 3 of the process (financial considerations).  It is totally unthinkable that children in England are being left at risk.",
        "background": "My son's school bus has been involved in 2 collisions in the space of 10 months.  On both occasions the school bus had no seat belts.  We want the law changed before there is a serious injury or death.  Allowing local councils to determine the transport specification leaves children at risk.",
