        "additional_details": "They're opposites and ironically all race-related stereotypes associated with them are too.The connotations of these words compound positive and negative notions e.g. good,evil,weddings,funerals,white/black magic.The symbolic representations and emotions we identify with these words subconsciously effect us\r\n\r\nPeoples natural quest to define themselves has lead to endless comparisons and historical/present tension.There are only two races defined by colours, this creates the high and low end of the race hierarchy paradigm\r\n\r\nEvery race is unique and has no opposite.Our racial identity should be defined by our continent of origin (European/African/Asian etc),not colours.This reduces ignorance by connecting people to countries, languages and cultures; things we love, share and have in common",
        "background": "One of the earliest uses of \"black\" and \"white\" as metaphors for race was used in the 17th century when French Doctor Fran\u00e7ois Bernier, an early proponent of scientific racism, divided up humanity based on facial appearance and body type",
