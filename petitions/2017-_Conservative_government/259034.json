        "additional_details": "It is not the intention of this petition to stop the use of digital payment systems \u2013 individuals should be free to choose for themselves what sort of transactions they engage in. But the same needs to apply to those who prefer the convenience and anonymity of notes and coins. We need a general obligation to point of sale operators to accept cash (as exists in Denmark and Norway, further down the road to cashless than the UK) to ensure that cash does not become an irrelevance in our economy.",

However, we must ensure that those who, for whatever reason, cannot or do not wish to use digital payment systems in their day-to-day life are not excluded from the economy. Cash is also vital in times of national emergency.",
