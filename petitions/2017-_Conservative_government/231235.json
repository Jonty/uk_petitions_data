        "additional_details": "Likewise, the deposit system for plastic bottles and tin/aluminium cans should be enforced to ensure the return of these items to locations where they can be recycled. Waste and waste sorting cost will therefore naturally diminish.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n- BAN single-use plastics*\r\n- Introduce a nationwide deposit system for plastic/aluminium bottles/cans\r\n\r\n* single-use pastics include straws, coffee stirrers, styrofoam take-away cups/containers, milk jugs, toiletry containers, and more.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.",
        "background": "No matter your stance on the EU, to ban single-use plastics was a smart move and should be enforced by the UK.\r\n\r\nIn 2015, plastic packaging waste accounted for 47% of plastic waste. 2017 alone produced a total of 400 million tons of plastic waste.
