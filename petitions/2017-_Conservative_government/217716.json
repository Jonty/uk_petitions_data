        "additional_details": "The attacks carried out against the Syrian Regime this morning by the U.S, UK and France were not decided by the people of our country. However we are now associated with a violent attack, which in fact did not concern us or our country. It also cost the UK millions of pounds, which could have been used on our own soil, for homeless people, children starving in poverty, or education. We should have a say in how our country is run, or this is not a democracy.",
        "background": "As a British Citizen, I feel strongly about my country, and the way we are percieved around the world. I am passionate about morals and values, and feel as though we should have a say in attacks carried out by our troops around the world.",
