        "action": "Only allow uni students to vote in their home town, not where they are studying.",
        "additional_details": "This is not driven by anti-student sentiment but more through a sense of democracy. For example, if there was a General Election in their first week at uni, the student could vote in the uni town without any knowledge of local issues or the local MP. They will probably spend 27 months over 3 years at uni and yet a parliamentary term is 60 months, so their vote affects the area long after they've left! They can also vote in local elections, on local issues from Day 1.",
        "background": "Currently, university students can either vote in their uni town or home town and many choose the former. The huge density of students in certain areas now mean that students control the vote and their issues can dominate the political agenda and effectively disenfranchise the local community.",
