        "action": "Make computer science controlled assessments (NEA'S) mandatory for the GCSE.",
        "additional_details": "This proposal is to ensure that the examinations are going to stay reasonable, as in an ever increasing technological world, Britain's next generation could have a massive skills gap that increases. We would like to cement programming as a legal requirement for GCSE's to ensure positive outcomes.",
        "background": "On Monday 27th November, news broke that Ofqual may be scrapping the coding element of some GCSE exams due to fairness of controlled assessments, and the breaking of rules. However this is ridiculous. How could you learn food technology without actually cooking, or physical education without sport.",
