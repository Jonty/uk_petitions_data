        "additional_details": "A recent inspection of the unowned Central Plaza Hotel found the building to be at risk, and as such businesses and roads within the exclusion zone have been closed/evacuated, this closure is expected to last until next year. Small businesses have been told that liability lies with the owner of the Hotel as the Hotel has no owner, they have no where to turn. These are otherwise thriving businesses built on blood, sweat and tears. Forced to close through no fault of their own, they need support.",
