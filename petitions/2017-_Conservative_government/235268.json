        "action": "Have a second referendum on the subject of leaving the EU.",
        "additional_details": "There's a simple solution to the situation: a second referendum voted for again by the general public. A small 52/48 majority was small anyway for such a big move.The 52% will have thought it was a lot more simple that it has actually been so far. The promises by the people who wanted to leave were all lies. There is no proof as to why leaving the EU would be in anyway better that staying.The whole debacle has cost the UK billions already, has torn up both major parties and needs to be stopped.",
        "background": "The decision to leave the EU was blatantly missold to the British public in 2016. Since then, we have discovered that there was no strategy or method to the madness of leaving a common market; and as such the UK could become effectively bankrupt for generations due to the sanctions imposed.",
