        "additional_details": "At the moment anyone caught driving under the influence of drink or drugs are free to get back in a vehicle and drive until they are disqualified by Magistrates. Due to the time it takes for blood or urine tests results, scheduling a court date and other factors.\r\nThis places the public at undue risk.\r\nA roadside disqualification pending results or court date would eliminate that risk.\r\nI understand \"innocent until proven guilty\" but a drug swipe is pass or fail the only mitigation is by how much.",
        "background": "Driving whilst under the influence of drugs has become more prolific than drink driving in the UK. \r\nAn instant roadside disqualification for any driver who fails the tests or fails to provide a specimen for testing would make our roads safer before they have their day in court.",
