        "additional_details": "Most people I know would be prepared to pay more income tax as long as it is used as extra money for the NHS and social care to enable discharge from hospital when nursing is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nDoctor and nurse staff morale is low because of the pressures in trying to care for sick people without the resources to do so.\r\n\r\nBed occupancy is at 94% in England which is not entirely due to influenza as elective surgery was cancelled to cover this. The NHS could not cope with a further crisis.",
        "background": "The NHS is at crisis point with A&E having patients in all corners and in a queue of ambulances outside It needs extra money to provide for good quality services and the type of social care that would help to stop bed blocking in hospitals.\r\n\r\nWaiting lists for clinics  and tests are too long.",
