        "action": "Introduce a charge for all foreign vehicles using roads in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Many foreign drivers avoid payment at tolls, such as Dartford Crossing (Kent), where lost revenue runs at \u00a342,000,000  in cancelled penalty notices alone. Prosecutions for excess speed, failure to stop/report accidents etc. would improve as drivers/owners are held to account utilising data collected. UK Insurance customers would see a dividend as foreign registered vehicles in the UK seek registration, tax & insurance in accordance with UK legislation, improvinvg safety, and the environment.",
        "background": "Currently foreign registered vehicles pay no charges driving in the UK, unlike European countries where an equivalent tax is subsidised by toll road networks. This is unfair to UK motorists & operators. Instigating a familiar system (vignette) at point of UK entry, collection would be easy & cheap.",
