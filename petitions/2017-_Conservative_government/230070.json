        "action": "Require that cities allow camping on public property and provide 24 hour toilets",
        "additional_details": "Camping is a necessary survival activity for homeless individuals, and must be allowed until all rough sleepers are immediately sheltered. The UK must pass meaningful legislation to insure the homeless have a right to secure their physical well being. We must abolish UK laws or ordinances that prohibit public camping, or criminalise life-sustaining activity. We must also require UK cities with large homeless populations to provide public, 24 hour sanitary facilities such as portable toilets.",
        "background": "In the UK homeless individuals are often harassed, disturbed and ticketed for temporary encampments on public property. The Vagrancy act 1824 is used to criminalize the very condition of being without a house. Public Space Protection Orders are used by Councils to harass rough sleepers.",
