        "action": "To widen the exemptions of the Ivory Bill: de minimis rule to be 50%",
        "additional_details": "Following the introduction of the Ivory Bill, the de minimis rule is too narrow at 10% to be a working meaningful exemption. If it is not amended by Parliament it will cause the wilful destruction of genuine antiques: a chest of drawers with ivory inlay, a chess set or even a religious icon like a Corpus Christi, making them illegal to sell and perhaps be even subsequently confiscated or destroyed.",
        "background": "I am concerned that the Government are using this topic to try and destroy the bona fide antiques trade. De minimis rule: 50% for cultural objects made of ivory.",
