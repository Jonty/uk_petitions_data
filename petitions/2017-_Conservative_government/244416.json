The groups would be socially mixed to encourage diversity and understanding. This would give youngsters from challenging backgrounds a sense of inclusion and responsibility, while those from more privileged backgrounds would be giving something back. Money would be saved from the criminal justice system and prison sentencing.",
        "background": "With the rise of knife crime all young people between 16-18 should have to do a compulsory Social Service Certificate for six months before finishing school or training, working on environmental and social care projects. This would be universal regardless of background and education.",
