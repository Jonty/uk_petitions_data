        "action": "Change the law on cannabis for medical users and recreational users.",
        "additional_details": "The law should be changed so that specialised UK firms can grow medical grade cannabis for the NHS to prescribe to it\u2019s patients. This would create jobs, reduce the numbers in prisons, save the NHS millions, and mosti mportantly save lives.\r\nRecreational users should have the option to also buy quality assured cannabis as it is a safer alternative to spirits and has less harmful effects towards the human body. This would help eliminate the U.K. \u2018skunk\u2019 market and grow safe cannabis, and also allow more research to be done on it\u2019s properties.",
        "background": "Medical Cannabis is currently illegal in the U.K. This means that people with medical conditions that can only be treated with cannabis, such as cancer patients and epilepsy sufferers are seen as criminals in the view of the law and could face up to 5 years in jail.",
