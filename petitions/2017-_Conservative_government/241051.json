        "additional_details": "Just go to the store, pick up an item and ask yourself one question - \u201cis all the packaging really necessary?\u201d. I can assure you the answer will be no. I fully understand that forcing billions of companies to reduce packagaing isn\u2019t exactly going to work. However, every little helps. We can start by introducing the idea of using less packaging on the internet. Supermarkets should have sections for food where you bring your own tub to fill. Ideally, the overuse of packaging should be banned.",
        "background": "Nowadays, you open a bag of crisps and find that half of the packaging is completely unnecessary or you open a box of chocolates which includes a plastic tray on top of another plastic tray and even more plastic used for wrapping each and every chocolate individually. It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.",
