The people don\u2019t want HS2!  \r\n\r\nThe UK has declared a climate emergency - it would be hypocritical to do this and then build a countryside destroying rail line that gets you to Birmingham a bit faster. Whilst emitting fumes, as we assume the train/s will not run purely on renewable energy? The carbon footprint of this line will be enormous, and we cannot justify this. By destroying much of the rolling countryside left in England, you are helping destroy the planet!",
