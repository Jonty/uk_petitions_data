        "action": "Label products with the environmental friendliness of the exporting country.",
        "additional_details": "Clear labelling will allow the British consumer to make an informed decision on the environmental impact of one product versus another. It will have the long term effect of increasing the focus of other governments on the need to respond to climate change by rewarding eco friendly nations with export growth, whilst simultaneously penalising nations who chose to disregard the environment. Whilst considerably more complex to implement, in time it could be expanded to include impact of freight too.",
        "background": "Britain alone can make very little difference to global climate change without modifying the behaviours of the most polluting countries. We have, in effect, exported our carbon emissions to developing nations who produce the products we buy.",
