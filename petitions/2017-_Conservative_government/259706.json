        "additional_details": "The amount of litter I have seen on the side of the roads in my area is out of control. It makes the UK look like a third world country. It's devastating for the environment as well. The fine is a joke at \u00a350. Fly-tipping in the countryside is now reaching epidemic levels. Give the public more chance to video the perpetrators and help increase arrests. The people that are arrested and are given the service should wear tops that clearly state their actions while cleaning up the mess.",
        "background": "The fines for littering are not enough and not enforced enough. The deterrent is not great enough and needs to be tougher. Fly tipping and roadside litter from cars is a joke. With 6 months of picking up litter every weekend, for 6 months would help get the message over.",
