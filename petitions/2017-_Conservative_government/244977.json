        "additional_details": "According to www.gov.uk, the statutory redundancy notice period for employees is 1 week, in this time no redundancy needs to be offered. With workplace stress affecting around half a million employees (Mental Health Foundation, 2018), there is added pressure on stuggling employees with the awareness that they have little security from unfair dismissal and will have no redundancy pay. Even with insubstantial evidence, the employee is subject to their employers whim.",
        "background": "According to The Office of National Statistics, 75.8% of the British population are in employment. Despite passing a probationary period, employees have little job security until they have been in employment for 2 years. Until then employers are able to remove employees on little more than a whim.",
