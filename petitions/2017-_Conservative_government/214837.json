        "additional_details": "Approximately 1 in every 1000 children is born with a severe or profound hearing loss. There are 11 million people with hearing loss across the UK, around one in six of the population. Deafness is the third most common disability in the world but you probably wouldn't spot a Deaf person in a crowd or know that a pedestrian has hearing loss.\r\nThe DSA handbook has warning signs for many things, deer crossing elderly people, schools and so on. A Deaf road warning sign is a glaring omission.",
        "background": "I am the mother of a 9 year-old profoundly Deaf boy. It struck me when visiting Europe and my family in the US that many countries and states have Deaf road warning signs in areas near schools with Deaf children and young adults, as well as in the vicinity of homes with Deaf families.",
