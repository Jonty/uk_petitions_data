        "additional_details": "The main purpose of Daylight Saving Time (called \"Summer Time\" in many places in the world) is to make better use of daylight. We change our clocks during the summer months to move an hour of daylight from the morning to the evening. \r\nChanging the time for winter has no beneficial effect for anyone hence asking for the summer time to remain throughout the year.",
        "background": "Changing the time has no beneficial effect on anyone\u2019s life anymore. It only confuses everyone\u2019s body clock. Leaving the time in \u201csummer time\u201d throughout the year would help everyone to live their life without getting used to a change of time twice a year.",
