        "additional_details": "Section 6 of the Licence to use Parliamentary proceedings from the House of Commons for Broadcast dictates that no extracts of Parliamentary proceedings may be used in any light entertainment\r\nprogramme or in a programme of political satire.\r\n\r\nThis restriction became apparent to me whilst attempting to watch John Oliver's Last Week Tonight. UK viewers were prevented from seeing a segment of his show due to it containing footage taken from Parliament.",
        "background": "Light entertainment and political satire programmes are not currently permitted to show footage from Parliament. This restriction in a democracy seems somewhat backward and should be lifted.",
