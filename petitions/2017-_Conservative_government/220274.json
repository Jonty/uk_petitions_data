        "additional_details": "If the government is so committed to prosecute veterans who were carrying out orders then the prosecution of IRA Terrorists should also be taken into account in the name of justice, some of these prosecutions of our Veterans date back to 1970 some 48 years ago yet Terrorist atrocities are more recent for example the Manchester bombing in 1996 if a government is going to work towards justice it has to be transparent in the way it does it the prosecution of our veterans is unjustified and illegal.",
        "background": "Whilst veterans from Op Banner are being prosecuted by the PSNI sanctioned by our government which is a betrayal of our veterans, I.R.A terrorist's murderers who were responsible for over 90% of the killing and tortures of Men, Women, and Children walk free today under the  good Friday agreement.",
