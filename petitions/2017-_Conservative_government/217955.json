        "additional_details": "I would also like compensation to be considered for people who have been wrongly made unemployed, refused NHS healthcare and wrongly held in deportation centres - awaiting deportation. Finally, I would like the Government to consider reimbursing the legal costs some people have considered necessary to engage in before Amber Rudd\u2019s announcement on April 16th 2018.",
        "background": "Some of the Windrush Generation and other Commonwealth citizens who moved to Britain between 1948-1973 may have been wrongly deported since the Immigration Act 2014. While we wait for confirmation that any deportations have been reversed I believe each individual should be entitled to compensation.",
