        "action": "Ban e-cigarettes from open display in shops and treat them like tobacco.",
        "additional_details": "\"E-cigarettes are 75% to as harmful as tobacco\" (Stanton Glantz, Professor of Medicine and Tobacco Control, UCSF, 2018). PHE is ignoring the evidence in its claims they are 95% safer! In the US, the FDA is now clamping down hard on the e-cigarette industry (which is mostly the Big Tobacco!) because of the rising epidemic of vaping in high schools. Vaping creates nicotine addiction and teenagers are 4-6 times more likely to try tobacco! Vaping is conditioning us to accept smoking as normal again.",
        "background": "E-cigarettes are very popular with teenagers who become addicted to nicotine and turn eventually to tobacco. They should be treated in the same way as tobacco and placed out of view in shops and petrol stations otherwise we will see an epidemic of e-cigarette use, like America, here in our schools.",
