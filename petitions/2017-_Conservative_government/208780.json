        "action": "Enshrine in law that foreign nationals hold medical insurance before entry to UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK needs to look after the NHS and nurture it. We have the finest health care system in the world. But it can no longer cope with the influx and lack of funding. Making sure that foreign nationals have health insurance before they enter the UK will help elevate some of the funding issues the NHS currently has. It will also eliminate health tourism and free up appointments that are much needed for UK Nationals.",
        "background": "The NHS is free at point of contact for all. Foreign Nationals often use the NHS then leave the country without paying for treatment. I therfore petition parliament to enshrine in law that ALL Foreigners should hold medical insurance and must prove that they hold this before entering the UK.",
