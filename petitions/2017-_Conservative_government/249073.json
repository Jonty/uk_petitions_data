The interpretation services provided by Sign Live are not appropriate for environment that informs patients of medical procedures and diagnoses. Imagine being told you have cancer or have had a miscarriage via a tablet. One face-to-face BSL interpreter must be available per shift in all NHS hospitals.",

Sign Live, the developers, say the internet in NHS hospitals is not strong enough for the system to function. This can lead to medical terminology and diagnoses being wrongly explained.",
