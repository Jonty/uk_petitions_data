What do we get in return?\r\n\r\nSome say: \u201cSimple \u2013 we get free trade\u201d. The UK is a nice big fat market for continental companies, and they don\u2019t want to lose their profits. They want access to the UK and will grant access to the continent in return.\u201d\r\n\r\nSo, would we really get free trade outside of the EU? Do we really have to pay that \u00a333 million to access free trade with Europe?",
