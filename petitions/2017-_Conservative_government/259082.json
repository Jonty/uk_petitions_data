One study found low-intensity MMW cause \u201cperoxidase isoenzyme spectrum changes,\u201d which damages cells.\r\n\r\nAnd if things weren\u2019t bad enough, it seems that the 5G infrastructure would also pose a threat to our planet\u2019s atmosphere.Peoples brains are fried enough at Glastonbury without the addition of 5g.",
