Reduce the misery that this causes and support this petition to have the word Red dropped from the Name 'The Red Lion' (though we would accept pubs in England changing their name to 'The Three Lions'). \r\n\r\nDon't forget LIONS AREN'T RED!!!",
        "background": "With fewer Public Houses remaining open, customers are facing a limited choice as where to enjoy a pint. It is unfair to expect supporters of football teams to drink in a pub bearing the colour of their most bitter rivals. We are therefore asking that Red be dropped from the name 'The Red Lion'!",
