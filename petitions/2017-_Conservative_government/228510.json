        "additional_details": "Sex workers and women who are forced to sell sex are two separate groups.Yet the Nordic Model assumes that the act of buying sex is inherently violent towards women,this is wrong.Currently for sex workers it's (and should always be),the individual's choice who to have sex with and/or charge for sex. A separate market exists for trafficked women & children and a blanket ban won't help. http://theconversation.com/the-nordic-model-of-prostitution-law-is-a-myth-21351",
        "background": "The proposed implementation in the UK of the 'Nordic (Swedish) Model' in regards to sex buyer laws criminalises the client and not the sex worker. However, this criminalisation punishes the sex worker by abolishing their market and source of income, whilst making trafficked women harder to find.",
