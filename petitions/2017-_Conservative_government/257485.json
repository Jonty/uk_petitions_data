The UK Parliament and Government aren't responsible for making medical decisions.   \r\n\r\nIn any case, NICE guidelines for assessing whether someone is suitable for sterilisation are broadly the same for a vasectomy as for a tubal occlusion. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/contraception-assessment#!scenarioRecommendation:24\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition that clearly asks for something the UK Parliament and Government are responsible for. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to review whether their are inequalities in people's access to contraception, if that's something you'd like to happen.
