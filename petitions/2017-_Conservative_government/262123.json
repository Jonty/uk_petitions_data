They then have to go through a tribunal process which can be stressful.  The government need to think about a specific assessment for individuals with Autism or Mental Health difficulties.  A 60 minute assessment does now give an accurate insight into the difficulties experiences by individuals and their families.  Children have to stay in school until their 18.",

The assessment take takes place for PIP is geared towards physical disabilities and often claims from individuals who have Autism are rejected!",
