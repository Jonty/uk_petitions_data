        "additional_details": "It is time that democracy is saved because the EU vote was a close one so if a second referendum happened then the other side will be more likely to win. So if that did happen then that would be violating democracy and will be so disrespectful to all those who are against being in the EU. We decided to leave the EU and that is what we are doing!",
        "background": "There is a lot of people wanting a second referendum on staying in the EU. The truth to those people is that the people have made their choice and we are leaving the EU with or with no deal! It is a threat to democracy and a threat to national security. We are leaving the EU on the 29th March 2019!",
