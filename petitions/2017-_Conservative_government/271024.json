        "additional_details": "The process was flawed from the start: A matter of trans-generational importance could never be determined in a one-off simple majority (50% threshold) referendum, especially one so full of false claims. No one then or now knows what an exit would look like. The process should have been two phases (1) an initial vote gauging interest then (2) a second vote once the implications were known. At 60 to 65% that proves serious interest. Now is the time for a general election THEN a 2nd referendum.",
        "background": "a) The Brexit vote was unfit for purpose (b) The vote was marginal (c) Half who voted to stay have not been represented (d) Unsurprisingly unable to reach an agreement after 2+ years, the Conservatives are trying to resort to a forced exit by Prorogation, in a way that undermines UK democracy.",
