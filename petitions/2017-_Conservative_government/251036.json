When we prevent certain groups (homeless or not) from using public spaces, we change the definition of what public is.\u00a0this hostile architecture makes our communities more hostile overall. Cities should invest in helping individuals, not in architecture trying to hide them away.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis architecture is not how we end homelessness.",
        "background": "Anti-homeless architecture is hidden in plain sight. Its aim is to prevent those living rough from sleeping in certain places away from the elements at night. It includes anything from studs in the ground to separations in benches which aim to keep our national shame out of sight and out of mind.",
