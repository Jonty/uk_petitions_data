In particular, we're not sure if you want the rates to rise in September 2019.\r\n\r\nNational Minimum Wage rates are reviewed each year by the Government, advised by the Low Pay Commission. Rates were last increased in April 2019. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about the minimum wage. You might like to sign these if they call for something you'd like to happen. You're more likely to get action on an issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241386\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/240970"
