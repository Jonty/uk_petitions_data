        "action": "Abolish school uniform in all schools.",
        "additional_details": "When a student has done something particularly bad like get into a fight or bully another student we suspend them or put them in isolation to punish the student. Why is a student with blue hair or with a t-shirt being punished at the same level? We encourage students to 'be themselves' yet we confine this with rules. Teenagers already struggle in schools with exams, hormones, sexuality etc. We shouldn't be giving them more reasons to stress out. Casual dress-code doesn't stop them learning.",
        "background": "School uniform rules have recently become too strict, to the point where people are being suspended from school for their appearance. We preach about not missing education yet we stop it over cloth and dye? Teenagers should express themselves and not be punished for being unique.",
