        "additional_details": "See Lewes School who wish to create a non-gender uniform.\r\n\r\nThe damage done by supporting these policies to normal girls and boys is not considered. Britain should provide assistance to the children/adults who are non/transgender, away from the mainstream and allow the rest of society to carry on with normal life. If you are born a boy then this is how you are raised, if the boy decides in later life to change at least it will be of his own accord and support will be there for him.",
        "background": "Schools creating non-gender uniforms to aid 1/2 children in schools of >100 is more harming to other children than the trans/LGBTI child. The minority should not dictate what the normal majority does.\r\n\r\nBeing LGBTI- non/transgender is an individuals choice. Traditional values should be promoted.",
