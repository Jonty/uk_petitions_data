        "additional_details": "The highest grade you can get for Foundation maths is C and it's known that its much easier to get a C in higher. Most people in foundation maths could easily get a 8 or a 9 (A's). The paper should be equal.",
        "background": "As everyone knows, there is higher and foundation maths. Foundation is for those who aren't as able at Maths but sometimes people are wrongly placed there. Make one whole paper for everyone, you never know what people could achieve. It would be fair to everyone if we all do the higher paper.",
