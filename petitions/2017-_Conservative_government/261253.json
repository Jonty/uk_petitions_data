Action fraud, being a centralised and privatised fraud department, receive over 25000 fraud cases a month. This in itself is ridiculous as they are completely overwhelmed. Before 2013, there was a national effort built up of every local police force, able to act independently against fraud. This national effort was more effective than the current centralised system of action fraud, which is completely overloaded & ineffective.",
        "background": "Recently I was a victim of financial fraud, which I tried to take action against, but have been completely rejected by my bank, the criminals bank, the local police forces, Action Fraud. No one could do anything about this fraud, despite having all the evidence to support it. I'm not alone here.",
