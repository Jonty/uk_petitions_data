        "additional_details": "Where some company\u2019s will use pas43 and stick to the guidelines, give staff the required training. There are still company\u2019s out there that will send untrained staff in any vehicle to broken down vehicles which are ill equipped and have no extra reflectors or beacon. \r\nI have also have an email from a parliament case worker stating pas43 is not a legal requirement and is down to the company health and safety to make sure that staff know what they are doing at the roadside. This needs to change!",
        "background": "After working with various company\u2019s doing roadside breakdowns and recovery, some of which apply pas43. The dangers of this are horrifying. I think it\u2019s about time these guidelines were made legal as a minimum requirement to get rid of the cowboys and to reduce further risk to everyone",
