        "additional_details": "Therefore the most vulnerable who rely on the TV, would not have to pay the TV license fee. This may mean the government raising awareness of the pension credit through adverts or taking direct action e.g. by having carers inform/educate the elderly to claim it.\r\n \r\n",
        "background": "Since recent news about the elderly being charged the TV license fee, many of these 75+, don\u2019t claim the pension credit which if they were on the scheme would mean they wouldn\u2019t have to pay. I believe that many who don\u2019t, need help on understanding how the pension credit works and how to claim it.",
