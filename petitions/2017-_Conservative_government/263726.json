        "action": "Create a means-tested solar subsidy",
        "additional_details": "The government must cooperate with landlords, local authorities and housing associations to deliver the greatest help to the poorest households and smallest businesses with the cost of installing solar generation and energy storage systems. This means subsidising the whole cost for those least able to pay, with diminishing levels of financial assistance for larger businesses and wealthier residents. The benefits of renewable energy must be extended to as many as possible, as quickly as possible!",
        "background": "Rooftop solar power generation is the most promising method for reducing demand on the electricity grid, & lowering the carbon footprint of homes and businesses. The government must introduce a subsidy to rapidly grow the solar industry, while ensuring disadvantaged communities are first to benefit.",
