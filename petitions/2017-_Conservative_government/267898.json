        "background": "OFGEM is the UK's energy regulator. Its statutory policy guidelines were last revised in 2011 and are incompatible with the UK Government's goal of reducing our carbon emissions to net zero by AD 2050. OFGEM bureaucracy is frustrating efforts to prioritize clean growth and progress towards net zero.",
