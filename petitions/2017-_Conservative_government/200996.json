If you want to cycle on public roads you should behave by and be governed by the rules and regulations of the road and you should pay for that priviledge, just as other road users have to.",
        "background": "The government must legislate to bring cyclists in line with other public road users. Therefore, cyclists should pay for and take a competency test, be issued with a license, be issued with two registration numbered Hi-Viz jackets, be insured and pay road tax.",
