        "action": "Reconsider the Sugar Tax",
        "additional_details": "For some, the full sugar version of a drink not only tastes superior, it has beneficial effects, especially for people with a sensitivity to said artificial sweeteners.\r\n\r\nA key example is the halving of Sugar in Lucozade (a recommended drink for people with diabetes to combat hypoglycaemic events). This wasn't announced in enough time for diabetic nurses to alter their recommendations.\r\n\r\nAll the tax is doing is punishing adult consumers. Why should we suffer this draconian approach to obesity?",
        "background": "With the introduction of the Sugar Tax looming large, consumers are being constantly let down by the attempts of companies to avoid the higher rate of sugar tax and as a result the formulas they are releasing contain much higher levels of artificial sweeteners.",
