        "additional_details": "The company\u2019s failure to maintain order and provide a safe, habitable environment that will ensure the rehabilitation of inmates, and their return to society has been reported by HM Inspectorate of Prisons www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk and the prison has now been placed under the control of the Ministry of Justice. \r\n \r\nAs G4S has been found to have failed in its duty of care to the inmates and staff alike, the Government should take all possible steps to ensure the taxpayer is not penalised for the company\u2019s failure to meet its contractual obligations.",
        "background": "In 2011, the running of HM Prison Birmingham was entrusted to outsourcing company G4S. As G4S has failed in its responsibilities, the government should ensure that any costs associated with restoring appropriate conditions at the prison are met by the company and not by the taxpayer.",
