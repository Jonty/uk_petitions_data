The other option is to \u201cspoil\u201d their ballot, but this does not get any real recognition. Should the result be a vote of NONE, then replacement candidates would be required to re-run for that constituency.  In this way MP\u2019s will get the message that the public want them to act on our behalf, not theirs",

The public feel they have no faith in their MPs, but do not have a satisfactory way to have their protest recognised. We ask that every ballot paper has \u201cNONE\u201d as a voting option to allow people to tell these MP's they are unhappy.",
