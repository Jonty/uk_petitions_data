        "additional_details": "UK university Vice Chancellors get mega-salaries.  Many unis now employ more administrators and managers than lecturers and researchers.  There is a massive secret network of lobby groups/ consultancies.  This superstructure is all funded by the debt enforced on our children as student loans, and taxpayer\u2019s money. Yet the expert panel's findings suggest it is not up to the job.\r\n\r\nA Public Inquiry is need to restore good teaching and research for the public good in Britain's Universities.",
        "background": "2017/18 saw the longest university strike ever, over slashed pensions. Students lost classes,  staff  pay.
