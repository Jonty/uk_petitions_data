We voted understanding our government will get the best deal for US. Stop the propaganda and make it perfectly clear that our Prime Minister is accepting and following the democratic vote of the people to leave the EU. No strings attached, no people's vote! No more campaigning to remain! The UK is taking back control!",
        "background": "In 2016 the UK voted to LEAVE the European union. In 2018, we still have not left. The remain campaign are still campaigning 2 years later! Why? There was no question 2 on the ballot paper about what kind of deal. It was one question leave or remain, David Cameron made it clear. We voted to leave!!",
