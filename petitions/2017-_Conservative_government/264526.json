        "additional_details": "The issue of student loan write-offs has plagued the government and a recent Office for National Statistics' decision to include them in the government deficit shows how problematic they have become. Whilst it is not a final way of dealing with the issue removing the interest whilst studying can help to decrease these write-offs. In Norway, for example, student loans do not incur interest whilst studying which helps students ensure they do not have to worry about extreme repayments.",
        "background": "Student loan fees are problematic themselves, the interest incurred from them is an even stronger issue totalling up to \"the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 3%.\" This is a large percentage when you consider students have no possible way of paying back loans whilst they study.",
