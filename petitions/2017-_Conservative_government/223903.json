The Sunbeds (Regulation) Act 2010 came into force in April 2011 in England and Wales to prohibit under-18s from using sunbeds. Guidance to support local authority authorised officers in successfully implementing the Act has been published and can be found at:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/216373/dh_125982.pdf\r\n \r\nPublic Health England\u2019s advice about sunbeds is available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sunbeds-safety-advice/sunbeds-safety-advice. It advises that:\r\nSunbeds emit ultraviolet radiation, which can cause tanning and sunburn. There is no evidence to suggest any type of sunbed is less harmful than natural sun exposure and Public Health England discourages the use of sunbeds for cosmetic tanning.\r\nSunbeds should never be used by anyone under 18 years of age. If you are over 18 years of age and wish to use a sunbed then use a staffed facility that provides guidance to users and limit your use of the sunbed \u2013 do not have repeated sessions to build up a quick tan before a summer holiday. If you have very fair skin, burn easily in the sun or have had skin cancer, do not use a sunbed.\r\n \r\nIt is important for everyone to be aware of their skin and to seek advice from their GP if they notice changes, particularly with moles that itch or bleed, or change shape.\r\n \r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care has no current plans to review policy on sunbeds but will keep the evidence under review.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n",
