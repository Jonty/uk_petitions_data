        "additional_details": "By seeking joint economic sanctions with the EU and the US, the UK can pressure Chinese and Hong Kong governments into revoking this bill which, as can be seen by 15% of the region's population protesting against the bill, the people of Hong Kong do not want and are fearful of as China strengthens its ever tightening grip on Hong Kong and completely obliterates its obligations to maintain a high degree of autonomy in the region which was laid out in the Sino-British declaration in 1997.",
        "background": "Upon signing the Sino-British treaty the united kingdom gave itself a legal and moral obligation to act when china breaks agreements signed in the treaty. Currently China is clearly interfering in HK government's decisions to dilute Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy with this new extradition law.",
