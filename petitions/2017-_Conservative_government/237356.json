The IN/OUT vote did not allow OUT voters to explain their limits. It is a disgrace to hijack the outcome suggesting to understand every OUT voter\r\n\u201cWe must respect the will of the people and the democratic process which delivered this result\u201d. (1) the will of the people is not static (2) the political class has failed to in any way create consensus",
