        "action": "Ban the sale, manufacture and use of glitter made from microplastic in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Eco friendly alternatives already exist and some companies such as Lush have voluntarily switched to plant based glitter. Eco-glitters I have researched use plant cellulose which is a sustainable material and are certified biodegradable.\r\nA safe alternative is available already therefore, an all out ban on glitter containing micro-plastic is not unsustainable within a managed time frame.",
        "background": "The use of glitter is prolific cosmetics, clothing, greeting cards etc. Most glitter is made from plastics such as PET & PC and are harmful to the environment. The government has already banned the use of micro beads  & we call for this ban on manufactured micro-plastics to be extended to glitter.",
