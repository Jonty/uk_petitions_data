        "additional_details": "We, the public, do not know if the appellant committed any wrongs. Liability (or guilt) must be decided by the courts, not by parliament. The Telegraph behaved properly in attempting to uncover and report the matter. It also behaved properly in abiding by the ruling of the court. If it appeal to the Supreme Court, it will again be behaving properly and carrying out its role in publicizing legitimate public interest stories.",
        "background": "Lord Hain blatantly disregarded a ruling of the Court of Appeal in naming the appellant in the case. He could, if he thought it proper, cause a change in the law. Ignoring a ruling of the court is a dangerous precedent in a democracy and a threat to the separation of power.",
