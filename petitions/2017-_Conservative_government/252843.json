        "additional_details": "It would cripple the car industry, forcing the Government to super tax anyone driving \"none restricted cars\". Consequently, forcing the consumer to buy new \"restricted\" cars. We as a country need to protect our investments and freedom of choice.\r\n\r\nThis is also morally wrong, the UK is currently battling Brussels to leave the EU. We wanted to leave the EU to make our own choices and decisions regarding our countries policies. Therefore, why would we want to adopt such a damaging and \"costly\" law?",
        "background": "My name is Oliver Jones. I come from an automotive background and my profession is \"cost engineering\". \r\n27 Mar 2019, speed limiters were approved by the EU regulations. \r\nFollowing this, a statement was made that the UK would align its manufacturing specifications with the EU.",
