        "additional_details": "https://www.gov.uk/speed-limits\r\n\r\nAbove are the speed limits of vehicles over 7.5 tonnes to 60 mph which is 10 mph slower than the motorway speed.",
        "background": "The main problem on motorways is congestions and crashes. The problem is lorries are trying to overtake each other which takes too long which means the flow of traffic slows and causes congestion and crashes. It would stop the middle lane slowing which makes more cars stay in the middle lane.",
