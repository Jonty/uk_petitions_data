        "additional_details": "Young people/students have enough school related stress to deal with such as exams and coursework. Being bullied can affect their grades, their self esteem and in a lot of cases, their lives. Schools should be encouraged to expel individuals who bully others, out of respect for the victims. Many young people do not feel safe in school due to bullying, and this must stop altogether.",
        "background": "All across the world, students are bullied in school. However, this is increasing dramatically. Head teachers should be encouraged to expel students who are bullying other students, as the victims often do not feel safe while the bullies are around.",
