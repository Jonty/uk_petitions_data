The people were lied to about what would happen with the first referendum, the House\u2019s of Parliament can vote multiple times even for the same deal, so why can\u2019t the people? Allow the people to vote to revoke Article 50 and remain, or to leave with no deal.\r\nLet our voices be heard.\r\nLet us decide once and for all.\r\n\r\nThere are other problems in the UK that need the time and money.",
        "background": "Hold another referendum on wether to revoke Article 50, or to leave the EU on a no-deal basis.\r\nThe government cannot decide, so allow the people too. This has gone on too long. Give the people another voice.",
