        "additional_details": "Funding for children with additional needs, and for nurseries and pre-schools is also severely stretched.  Their outcomes need to improve. Additional funding is required.\r\n\r\nSmall, mainly rural schools have been seriously disadvantaged by setting the lump sum in the National Funding Formula at \u00a3110,000. This needs to be increased to secure the financial viability of small schools which are at the heart of the local community.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental objective is fair funding for all the county's schools.",
        "background": "Cambridgeshire schools are under severe financial owing to salary and pension increases, inflation, the Apprenticeship Levy, and growing recruitment and retention costs.   \r\n\r\nImpacts include increasing class sizes, narrowing of the curriculum,  a smaller workforce and increased pressures on staff.",
