        "additional_details": "Qualified reassurances have been made by the UK government that EU nationals living in the UK - and UK nationals domiciled in EU countries, will retain their rights and freedoms as EU citizens. UK nationals choosing to remain in their own country have received no such assurances. Most UK nationals have paid taxes in order to access the advantages of EU membership including freedom of movement. They should have the right, should they wish, to retain their EU citizenship in principle.",
