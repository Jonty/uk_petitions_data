        "action": "Abolish the TV Licence",
        "additional_details": "It is time to abolish the TV licence and save the British people from being forced to pay for low quality TV and extremely biased news and political reporting. The BBC should survive the same way hundreds of other broadcasting companies survive: Via democratic means, as opposed to extortion of money from the British public.",
        "background": "TV licence money goes primarily to an organisation which is greedy, unaccountable, extremely biased in their reporting of news, politically biased toward the Left in terms of their journalism and political commentary, and has been embroiled in scandal many times over the past two decades: The BBC.",
