        "additional_details": "I recently gave birth to a little boy at 19 weeks, almost half way full term pregnancy. Baby was fully formed but not fully grown, but the hardest thing that I have had to deal with is that I have been described as having had a miscarriage. \r\nMy body did NOT reject and dispel a foetus for natural reasons , ie miscarry, which is why I believe all ladies who have to give birth should be recognised as having had a stillbirth and not a miscarriage. All we want is acknowledgement.",
        "background": "I believe that all babies that are physically born should not be called miscarriages. It is detrimental to the health of the mother who has to go into labour physically push their child out of their body.",
