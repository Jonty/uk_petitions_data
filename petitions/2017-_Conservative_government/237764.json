        "additional_details": "The two suspended projects would have produced 9.2GW of low carbon electricity to the national grid, avoiding millions of tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. At their peaks these projects would have also provided tens of thousands of jobs, a huge boost to the local economy. \r\n\r\nThis World Nuclear Association presents the main benefits of nuclear power: http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/world-energy-needs-and-nuclear-power.aspx",
        "background": "In the last few months, two major developers have pulled out of plans to develop large scale new nuclear in the UK. \r\n\r\nIn order to meet future electricity demand and reach climate change targets, no other low carbon technologies are available to replace reliable baseload electricity supply.",
