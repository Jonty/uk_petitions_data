It will make them feel more confident and will allow them to embrace their inner artist. Letting Students wear Non-School Uniform will give them a self esteem boost and a good mindset in lesson knowing they look good, they feel good. It is also proven that school uniform can be from \u00a320-\u00a3250 so why buy a school uniform you can only wear in school, you can wear them wherever.",
