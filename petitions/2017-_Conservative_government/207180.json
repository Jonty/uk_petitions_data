        "action": "Incentivise NHS staff retention by writing off student debt for employees.",
        "additional_details": "The proposal is for a point based system based on time served. This would mean people would give greater consideration to stay with the NHS for a longer period of time. In return, they would be given a larger reduction in debt in accordance with their time spent in the public services.\r\nIn the event of leaving the service, the remaining balance would then be calculated by deducting the  value of time served.  A proposal of 10 -15 years service would see all debt removed.",
        "background": "NHS staff retention is at an all time low in the current economic climate. A large portion of freshly graduated students are looking for jobs oversees due to a lack of incentive to remain in the NHS and the country. To combat this, we propose eliminating student debt for long term NHS employees.",
