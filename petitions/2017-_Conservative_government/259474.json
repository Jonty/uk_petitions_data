        "additional_details": "We must reduce the use of fossil fuels urgently, this can be done by replacing them with cleaner/renewable sources. This could include solar, wind power, etc. \r\n\u201cWe need to cut CO2 emissions almost in half (45%) by the end of the next decade,\u201d says Kimberly Nicholas, associate professor of sustainability science at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS), in Sweden.",
        "background": "Students are constantly put under pressure over exams and qualifications. However these will be worth nothing if we don\u2019t have a world where we can put these to use. Reducing the use of fossil fuels would be catalytic in saving not only the future of the planet but our futures too.",
