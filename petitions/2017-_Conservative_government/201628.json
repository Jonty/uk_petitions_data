        "action": "Re-open the Dubs scheme to allow unaccompanied child refugees entry into the UK",
        "additional_details": "FOI requests have shown that local councils have voluntarily offered to accept 1572 more children than are currently being supported, yet the Government is refusing to accept any more child refugees from the continent. The longer this goes on the more likely it is that children will go missing & fall into the hands of traffickers. Our values of openness & tolerance mean that we have a duty to be a land of sanctuary to these vulnerable children. The Government must act now and re-open the scheme.",
        "background": "The Government announced in February that it would close the Dubs scheme \u2013 intended to grant 3000 vulnerable unaccompanied minors a safe passage to Britain \u2013 after accepting just 350. We are capable of taking thousands more. Sign to call for the scheme to be reopened & help these desperate children.",
