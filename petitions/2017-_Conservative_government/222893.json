        "additional_details": "More than 80% of single use women\u2019s hygiene products contain single use or synthetic products which are harmful to the environment. Surprisingly many people flush these plastic applicators instead of putting them in the bin, and in many cases they end up on beaches, in the sea and in the stomachs of sea life. According to the Women\u2019s Environmental Network, there are around nine plastic tampon applicators for every 1km of UK beach.",
        "background": "Plastic applicators for tampons are a huge waste of single use plastic and are almost never recycled. Using cardboard applicators or non-applicator options instead could vastly decrease the volume of single use plastic usage. Petition the government to stop the sale of plastic applicators tampons.",
