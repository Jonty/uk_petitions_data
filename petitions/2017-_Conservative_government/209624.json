        "additional_details": "I believe that making this a mandatory requirement for companies will push them to become more accountable for their choice of packaging and encourage them to invest in recyclable alternatives and move away from single-use plastics.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that there are 5 trillion pieces of plastic in the world\u2019s oceans, with 8 million tonnes of plastic ending up in the ocean every year. The average UK household uses one rubbish truck\u2019s worth of single-use plastics each year.",
        "background": "I feel that manufacturers and companies should be more accountable for the packaging they use for products. \r\nThey should have to state in clear and standout text if packaging or elements of the packaging they are using are non-recyclable or, much like the health warning on packets of cigarettes.",
