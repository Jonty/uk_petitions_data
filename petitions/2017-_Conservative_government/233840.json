        "additional_details": "It is time for British Imperialism to finally come to an end. The 'british museum' is hoarding stolen goods for no rhyme or reason. It's evil tyrannical typical nonsense from rich blue people who think they rule the world. Parliament must act. This is cultural fascism. Justice must prevail. The government must legislate to return Hoa Hakananai'a to its home in Rapa Nui.",
        "background": "It is disturbing that we are hoarding stolen cultural artefacts. This month a delegation from the Island visited and pleaded for this object's return. Britain does not own or need this artefact, as it serves us only in that it appropriates their culture and establishes ours as supreme.",
