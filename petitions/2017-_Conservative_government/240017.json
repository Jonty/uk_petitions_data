        "additional_details": "According to DfE statistics published in 2017, only 39% of pupils eligible for FSM gained pass grades in GCSE compared to 67% who were not eligible. The changes will widen that gap even further as FSM eligible pupils will not have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.\r\n\r\nHeadteachers and Teachers Union were united in their opposition to the changes. Pupils should not be judged on their performance in a few hours after two years of study.\r\n\r\n'1/3 of employers felt a change to the grading system would add more confusion/complexity.'  (HoC BRIEFING PAPER, Number 06962, 31 March 2017)\r\n\r\nOnly 20% of people who get a grade 7 or above will get a grade 9.",
        "background": "I am campaigning to reverse the 2017 changes to the GCSE examinations. I am petitioning for these changes, such as the 9-1 numbering system and removal of coursework, to be reversed because they actively disadvantage pupils with SEND or who are FSM-eligible.",
