        "action": "Force a by-election when a MP defects from a political party.",
        "additional_details": "When an MP switches or resigns their political allegiance to a party, they effectively no longer represent the values and beliefs of that party and the manifesto on which they were elected. Thus they do not accurately represent the interests of the constituents and the community that voted for them. Communities should not have to wait for up to five years to act if they feel their MP is not properly representing their interests, especially with the Fixed Term Parliament Act. The decision as to whether defecting MPs sit in Parliament should thus be given back to the people who elected them to their positions in the first place by way of an immediate by-election, triggered automatically on resignation.",
        "background": "The recent resignations of MPs who now sit as part of the Independent Group mean we have (as of writing) 11 MPs who effectively no longer represent the manifesto on which they stood or the party under whose banner they were elected. Their positions as MPs are therefore no longer tenable.",
