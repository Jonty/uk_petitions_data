        "additional_details": "Overseas satire programmes can show footage of MP's in the House of Commons, these are then posted onto YouTube etc and can be viewed within the UK, but only if you go looking for them.\r\nMeanwhile it is illegal for them to be broadcast on mainstream UK TV channels. \r\nThis is undemocratic and MP's are hiding behind this law, because they know satire programmes would be reaching a wider proportion of younger people, who may not be presently voting.",
        "background": "I believe it is wrong that footage of MP's debating in Parliament cannot be used by satire and comedy shows in the UK.  Overseas shows can use the footage and post it online, but it is illegal for UK based shows do so. Our MP's are hiding behind this dreadful law it is fundamentally undemocratic.",
