        "action": "Ban use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition unless investigating crime",
        "additional_details": "For the reasons mentioned above, I consider the use of ANPR, for anything other than the investigation of crime, to be an illegal act. It is incompatible with the principles of 'innocent until proven guilty', which has been a cornerstone of British justice for centuries. ANPR has been installed as a 'fait accompli', enabling routine and blanket mass surveillance of the British population. Simply put, unless I am a criminal suspect, it is none of the government's business where I go in my car.",
        "background": "Since ANPR is by definition, a tool of mass surveillance, requiring no 'probable cause' to investigate the whereabouts of law-abiding citizens, it has no place in a free society. ",
