        "action": "Raise the age of sale, of fireworks, to the general public from 18 to 25.",
        "additional_details": "I have already read so many public posts, by people who have already been affected by youths setting off fireworks in public places, about people whose pets suffer huge distress, let alone non domestic wildlife. If fireworks must be sold to the public it needs to be regulated better.",
        "background": "All year round this is an issue but it becomes more apparent in the winter months. Irresponsible youths are allowed to purchase fireworks and they have no regard for the safety of others. Fireworks are meant to be fun but in the wrong hands they soon become weapons.",
