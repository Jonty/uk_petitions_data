        "additional_details": "According to gov.uk, there were approximately 58 thousand charities in the UK with income between \u00a310k and \u00a3100k.  If we assume that these are evenly distributed across the range, around 16000 charities would benefit.  If their costs are similar to ours, that would be an extra \u00a345k going to good cause each year.  While transparency is important, people give to small charities assuming the money goes to the cause they promote and 10% going to an auditor does not serve their expectations well.",
        "background": "I am involved with a charity which makes approximately \u00a325-\u00a330k per year, meaning we must have an independent review.  This cost us \u00a32500 this year, which seems a disproportionately high percentage of our income.   Increasing the limit to \u00a350k could help charities give more to the causes we support.",
