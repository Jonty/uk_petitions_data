        "additional_details": "Twice our house sale has fallen through and fees have been incurred due to the buyers \u2018change of circumstance\u2019. In these instances or similar, such fees should not be the responsibility of the vendor.\r\n\r\nWhen you wish to buy a house, you should be committed to buying that house and as such (and similar to other countries) deposits should be paid. Additionally, any vendor solicitor fees (or any other costs) where buyers renage on their decision, should be solely the purchasers accountability.",
        "background": "Protect vendors from incomplete sales & costs being incurred. \r\nAlthough close to my heart, I am confident this is a UK wide issue & I propose we\r\nintroduce deposits, or purchasers accountability/liability, to protect & pay (for example) vendor solicitor fees. \r\nMake house selling/buying achievable.",
