        "additional_details": "The older generations get to drive our future,While we sit in the passenger seat strapped down untill we are old enough to drive our future ourself. When the Brexit referendum happend Scottish 16/17s could vote and speak up for themselves while we couldn't. We are supposed to be living in a democracy yet the government have made no attempt to listen as me and my peers speaking out about this Injustice. 18+ people with no GCSEs can vote; yet a 16 year old with 11 grade 9s cannot. THIS HAS TO STOP",
        "background": "As a 16 year old I know that the way the government handles people's choice votes is wrong. Almost all 16 year olds are sensible people we are after all sitting our GCSEs- which impact our future so why can't we vote on OUR future. Do our GCSEs not prove that we are sensible.",
