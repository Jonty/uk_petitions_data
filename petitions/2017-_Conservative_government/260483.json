If global temperatures rise by 1.5\u00b0C, humans will face unprecedented climate-related risks and weather events. We are currently on course for a 3\u00b0C rise, which will lead to the destruction of our environment and the death and displacement of millions of people.\r\n\r\nSir David Attenborough, Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion have highlighted these risks to the public.
