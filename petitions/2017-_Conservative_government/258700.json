In the first 4 months of 2019 there have been numerous moorland fires across Saddleworth, Marsden and Ilkley moors at a high cost - both financially and to the local environment. A ban on the use of disposable barbecues and other naked flames in open moorland would reduce the fire risk and protect these beautiful environments that are home to many different species.",
