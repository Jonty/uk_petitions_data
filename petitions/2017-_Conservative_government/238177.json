        "additional_details": "In countries all over the world Jay Walking \u2013 crossing the road in the wrong place or without due care and attention - is a criminal offence so that pedestrians pay attention to the roads and don't risk their lives.\r\n\r\nDaily I witness many people walking whilst texting, with phones, bumping into other pedestrians without a care; many nearly killed crossing the roads. \r\n\r\nOthers get injured too, cyclists/motorcycles', where the negligence results in the injury or even death and damage to their cycle. Countless videos showing these incidents e.g. where a motorcyclist was left injured and with a damaged bike, the Jay Walker just got up and walked off, leaving the injured man with a damaged motorcycle in the road.",
        "background": "Increase in cycling and the use of mobile phones and ear phones has made the need for this law critical now as thousands get injured due to this issue.",
