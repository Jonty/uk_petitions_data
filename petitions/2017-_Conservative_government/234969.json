        "action": "Introduce the German Pfand system into the UK.",
        "additional_details": "This system can ensure that the plastic bottles can be refilled up to 25 times and up to 50 times for glass.This reduces the average CO2 emissions per bottle as fewer new bottles have to be manufactured. Washing and sterilising existing bottles is more environmentally friendly as there is less CO2 emissions output from the production of new, single-use bottles. \r\nAccording to a recent Spiegel article, at the time the law was enforced, 64% of all bottles purchased were refilled.",
        "background": "The German Pfand system encourages drinks companies to supply plastic or glass bottles that can be refilled and reused with the same product. Once this product was suitable to be recycled and emptied, the buyer would then be able to return the bottle to the company and earn a small amount of money.",
