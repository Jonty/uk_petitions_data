        "additional_details": "This section of road has a daily flow of 23500 vehicles which is over capacity for a road of its type. Currently the road does a very poor job as both a major trunk road and a local access road. A new dual carriageway road will leave the old road to be used as a high quality local access road for buses, cyclists and local traffic. It will improve safety and resolve the toxic air quality issues at Tideford.\r\nPlease see following link for more detail:\r\nhttps://www.cornwall.gov.uk/A38caseforaction",
        "background": "The single carriageway sections of A38 in SE Cornwall are not fit for purpose as a trunk road and must be upgraded to dual carriageway standard. The current road restrains economic growth, severs communities, is a poor local access road and has an accident record 2-3 times the national average.",
