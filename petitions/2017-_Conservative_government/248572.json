We also understand the benefits of being an agile, independently governed, sovereign nation and cherish the responsibility of our own destiny.\r\nThe electoral majority, individually voted \"Leave\" for different reasons in the 2016 referendum, but they collectively voted FOR change. Change is impossible in a perpetual stasis.",
        "background": "It is forthwith time to collectively move forward as a nation, in a way that genuinely honours the result of largest democratic exercise the UK has ever undertaken. We reject the negotiated Withdrawal Agreement. Leaving the EU on WTO terms, or \"No Deal\", is our preferred option.",
