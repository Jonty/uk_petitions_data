        "additional_details": "When merging onto a motorway/dual carriageway, where cars are moving at 70-80MPH, it can be quite daunting as a new driver and very dangerous for other road users. Please sign the petition to make the road a safer place.",
        "background": "In Northern Ireland, new drivers must display \u2018R plates\u2019 on their cars. This tells to other road users that they\u2019re a new driver and that they are restricted by Northern Irish laws, to a maximum speed of 45MPH except on slow roads. This is dangerous on roads such as the motorway. Help change this.",
