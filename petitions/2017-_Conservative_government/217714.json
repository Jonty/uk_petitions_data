        "action": "Stop UK Forces from launching any more air strikes in Syria.",
        "additional_details": "The UK has no business intervening in Syria. There are far more effective actions in pursuing peace in Syria to be taken than air strikes. We believe such air strikes only worsen the situation, increasing international tension and causing the death of innocent civilians. We urge the UK government to pursue non-violent and non-aggressive action to end the conflict. We believe such a path is not just the only way to achieve peace but the only justifiable course of action.",
        "background": "On the 13th of April the UK military joined US and French forces in a targeted strike on Syria. This attack was deeply unpopular and unprovoked. We urge the UK government not to engage in any further military action in Syria and to ask its allies to do the same.",
