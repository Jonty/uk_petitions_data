        "additional_details": "Returning to a role after having a baby is difficult enough, it seems that if you want part-time you have to fight for it and if it is granted the job level you were at before is not always made available to you. I believe that it should be compulsory to offer a part time role at the same level. Parents should not be penalised in the workplace for having a child.",
        "background": "Lots of parents who worked full time before having children are unable to do so once the child is born. At present employers are allowed to consider part-time options but they do not have to honour them leaving new mums and dads no option but to resign. The same job level should also be available.",
