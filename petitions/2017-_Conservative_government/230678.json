        "additional_details": "The 5yr land supply makes no allowance for sites that have been given approval but have yet to be developed, ie if the annual requirement for houses in a particular borough, set by government is 1000/yr, the LA must continually find sites to maintain a min. stock of 5000, regardless of whether the developers decide to build or not due to economic or other factors. Developers use this policy to build land stocks while our villages, countryside & greenbelt are being destroyed for profit/greed",
        "background": "The current National Planning Framework Policy which dictates the requirements for housing development in the UK means developers have been given the power to force LA's to offer up a minimum of 5 yrs land supply for development putting immense pressure to offer up normally protected Greenbelt",
