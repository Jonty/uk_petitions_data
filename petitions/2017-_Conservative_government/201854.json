        "action": "Kurdish independence. Iraq's gross punishment against the people of Kurdistan.",
        "additional_details": "Kurds are secular, pro-western people denied the right to independence since the turn of the century. They are the largest ethnic group without a homeland. Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria fought bravely against ISIS, stopping a juggernaut that threatened the region and British interests.\r\n\r\nThis gross punishment against Kurdistanis contradicts British values. It signals dangerous messages to the Kurds, further marginalising them. This is especially pertinent given Kurdistan calls for dialogue and long-term talks to reach a peaceful settlement with Iraq and its neighbours.",
        "background": "On Monday, Kurdish people voted in a free, transparent and peaceful referendum on independence. A resounding 92.7% called for independence from Iraq. The people of Kurdistan have committed zero crimes. Iraq's sanction towards them questions the very right to vote and practice self-determination.",
