        "additional_details": "Every town/city could have a go fund me page and the public can donate money to pay to heat the building, pay for electric, food, water and a bed. It can pay for a security guard to keep everyone safer. Make it so that the homeless can use this as their fixed address, so they can get a bank account and start applying for a job. Depending on public funding, it could pay for a councillor and job advisor once a week to help get people off the street and give them a chance to start their life again.",

We propose that in every town/city across the UK, at least one building is opened up to the homeless to get them off the streets. We are not asking the government to pay to run these buildings, the public will pay.",
