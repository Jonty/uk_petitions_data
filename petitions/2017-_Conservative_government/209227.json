        "additional_details": "It should be noted that many of these systems directly involve players putting real money into the game for a chance of a randomised reward. A quick search on any search engine will also reveal scores of stories about people who have spent thousands of pounds or more on these systems, just as with gambling scare stories.\r\n\r\nOn top of this, many of these games are not rated \"18\" since they are not \"legally\" gambling, which can expose children to these gambling elements.",
        "background": "\"Lootbox\" systems in videogames such as Star Wars Battlefront II have been shown to be predatory systems that target many who are typically vulnerable to the same trappings as gambling - however the Gambling Commission cannot consider them gambling as no money can be paid out.",
