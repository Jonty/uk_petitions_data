        "additional_details": "In reality if they were brought into a vets somewhere they're chip would definitely most likely not be checked. \r\nI have moved around the UK over the years & I have belonged to approx 11 different practices & not one offered to scan my dogs. I had to request it and luckily I did as 1 of my dogs chip had dissaperared. He is now chipped again to be safe. Scanning new & old patients microchips would reunite so many. It doesn't take long & reception staff could also easily do this. \r\n\r\nDogsAreFamily \ud83d\udc94",
        "background": "As the public & dog owners who see our dogs & cats as part of our family we would expect all vets to scan them. \r\nIf a dog or cat goes missing and then found and kept by someone or is stolen and sold on they have little chance of ever being found & reunited with their family as most vets never scan",
