There are so many homeless people in the world - divert your attention to helping them instead - Our Guru Granth Sahib is the almighty and by holding your arm out to the homeless or to someone who is less fortunate then yourself will be seen as a bigger bless then anything else in the world",

Millions of ramaleys are donated every day but once this has been placed during the ceremony it's never used again but either left in storage for years or destroyed.",
