        "additional_details": "Most insurance companies now deliver documents via PDF electronically. This no longer costs them postage. A change of address is a legal requirement (along with Driving Licence and DVLA registration) Charging people a punitive administration fee for complying with the LAW only encourages people to break the law until a policy renews. Simple address changes should be exempt from these Fees irrespective of refunds/increases in policy calculations.",
        "background": "When people move house and need to report a legal change to their address circumstances, this should NOT be subjected to punitive fees by profiteering or hidden smallprint in contracts.",
