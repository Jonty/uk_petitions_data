        "additional_details": "On 23 June 2016, 17.41 million voted to leave the EU, the biggest-ever exercise in genuine democracy in the UK. The government said: \"It's your decision\". They said if we voted Leave, we'd be out of the EU, Single Market & Customs Union. Some speak of 'crashing out' under a No Deal Brexit, but many others give excellent arguments on how 'No Deal' would make us prosper. The EU member states & most firms who export to the EU have already  planned for 'No Deal. We must now actively prepare for it",
        "background": "Parliament decided we\u2019d leave the EU either with, or without, a deal.  The Prime Minister often said: \u201cNo Deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. Leaving with no deal has great advantages. We won\u2019t have to pay a \u00a339 billion exit fee. We won\u2019t be tied to EU rules. We\u2019ll be free to make our own trade deals.",
