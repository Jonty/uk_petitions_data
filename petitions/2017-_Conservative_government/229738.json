        "action": "The UK Government to regularly measure household food insecurity across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Emma Lewell-Buck's Food Insecurity Bill would require the government to routinely monitor and report on food insecurity. Trussell Trust food bank statistics demonstrate growing food poverty but there are many more independent food banks and other food aid providers operating today. And we know that help is accessed as a last resort -  most food insecurity is hidden from view. Food insecurity is measured in Canada which means its health implications and long-term costs are understood.",
        "background": "It's estimated that millions of people in the UK are food insecure. Food insecurity can vary from worrying about not being able to access enough food to going whole days without eating. Without regular monitoring, we cannot begin to understand the true scale of the problem nor its impact on health.",
