        "additional_details": "We further believe that the Honours System has been tainted by becoming the object of cronyism by those in positions of power or influence and therefore call upon the British Government to reform the honours system so that Members of Parliament (both in the House of Commons and House of Lords) and others in a position of influence are barred from making nominations, which should only reflect the wishes private citizens for someone to receive an honour for a truly meaningful service to the country or their local community.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, believe that the Honours System has deviated from its true purpose of rewarding individuals for their personal bravery, achievements, or service to the United Kingdom and the British Overseas Territories.",
