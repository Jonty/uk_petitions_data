        "additional_details": "A 2016 study by CV-Library found that 61.3% of UK workers had witnessed or been a victim of nepotism in their workplace, and 81.4% believed that nepotism does exist. The intention is not to stop small businesses or tradespeople working with their family members, but to set a fair playing field for people developing their careers in larger companies.",
        "background": "Many people have witnessed companies advertise positions only for that position to go to a family member of a company director. This makes a mockery of the work normal people do to develop their careers and puts up a class barrier ensuring the children of the rich get precedent over the rest of us.",
