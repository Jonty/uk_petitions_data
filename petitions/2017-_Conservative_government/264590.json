        "additional_details": "However, if i was allowed to draw funds from my personal pension pot, i can get on the property ladder quicker, stop loosing money by renting versus paying to own my property. This will also mean i can continue to contribute to my pension pot(possibly at a higher rate) and begin to pay off my mortgage and gather equity.\r\n\r\nThere is no guarantee that we will live long enough to enjoy our pension but  we can live in the now and present. I am positive that this will resonate with many others too.",
        "background": "When i calculate the amount of equity i could have gathered in a mortgage instead of renting, it is truly heart breaking. But getting a mortgage hasn't gotten much easier. Even with available schemes.\r\n\r\nQuite frankly, saving in the current economic state is mission impossible.",
