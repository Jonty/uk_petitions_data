I have a whole research file on this. \r\nThere are also many many crashes and closures due to weather. The main causes; snow, ice, rain and fog. People need to use these roads daily. It would be much safer to have a bigger more straight road. Think of the lives that can be saved.",
        "background": "As a very frequent user of the A595 to Barrow in furness like many others I believe the road is inadequate, it is very dangerous and even more so when the weather is bad. Which is extremely often.  I believe that it would be in people's best interest to create a much safer road.",
