        "additional_details": "I feel that the use of drugs to gain an unfair advantage allows abusers to land punches/ strikes that wouldn\u2019t be achievable without them. Thus inflicting unlawful injury on their opponents. \r\nOver the years sadly many boxers have lost their lives or suffered serious, life changing injuries. The hardship this has caused their families is immeasurable. \r\nI also feel that spectators and gamblers expect a genuine and fair outcome and thus any use of chemical enhancement makes this impossible.",
        "background": "I\u2019m a fan of contact sports but feel that they are badly been let down by some participants who use performance enhancing drugs to gain an unfair advantage. Given the risks of serious injury in contact sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts I find it an irresponsible and immoral thing to do.",
