In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"issue pension rights to ex-service personnel\". There are processes in place for people to claim civil service and other pensions, so we're not sure what you mean by \"without the need to apply\".\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition calling for a review of processes in place for claiming Armed Forces pensions, if that's what you'd like to happen.\r\n"
