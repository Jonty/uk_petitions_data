        "additional_details": "Ticket Master doesn't do refunds or exchanges either so loads of people are out of pocket for tickets they can't use. Ticket Master could say this is there own fault but loads of people just baught the tickets without properly checking to see the age limit. Loads of tickets went away on presale meaning people who waited on the site this morning to buy a ticket for Sunday they where all more or less gone. People are trying to resell the tickets at crazy prices double or even triple face value!!!",
        "background": "Oliver Heldens will be performing in Glasgow SECC on the 9/10th of December and there is loads of people stuck with Saturday tickets which most people can't use as the age limit is 18+ which is unfair because there is no Sunday tickets left so they can't attend the eventTM also won't offer a refund.",
