Apart from a better chance at higher grades, this is part of the high quality reputation schools like Eton gain, which makes them much more likely to get in.\r\n\r\nIt is this unfairness that means we are calling on the Government to take private schools under public control, give them the same funding as other state schools, and ensure there is greater equality of opportunity for all.",
