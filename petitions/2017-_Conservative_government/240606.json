        "additional_details": "Students from private schools were 8% more likely than the average student to attend an Oxbridge university in 2016. Apart from a better chance at higher grades, this is part of the high quality reputation schools like Eton gain, which makes them much more likely to get in.\r\n\r\nIt is this unfairness that means we are calling on the Government to take private schools under public control, give them the same funding as other state schools, and ensure there is greater equality of opportunity for all.",
        "background": "Private schools have always been a tool for the wealthy to ensure they have the best opportunities in life. \r\n\r\nFor a society in which equal opportunity is one of the core principles, it is a disgrace to allow an inherent advantage to some children based on the size of their parents\u2019 wealth.",
