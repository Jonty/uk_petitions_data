        "additional_details": "Drones are like small airplanes that are not manned. Why would anyone without a pilot's license even be allowed to have one? I believe these planes in the wrong hands could do a lot of damage. They have the potential for so much harm when used for the wrong reasons. They infringe on peoples privacy, not to mention the danger of accidents involving drones.",
        "background": "Drones are not safe for private citizens to handle. Drones are a government device and should not be in the use of civilian and private hands. This is similar to the issue of guns and semi-automatic weapons; they just don't belong in the hands of private citizens.",
