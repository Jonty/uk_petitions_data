        "additional_details": "Child benefit is a flat rate of \u00a320.70 per week for the first child, if child maintenance was to be set at a flat rate it would make for a better and more efficient system. Paying parents would be able to earn more without being pushed into poverty, and receiving parents will gain security in receiving continual payments regardless of contact.\r\n \r\nThe cost of raising a child should not be based on what the non-resident parents are earning.",
        "background": "Why should child maintenance payments increase because of higher earnings? A flat fee would encourage continuity for paying and receiving parents and make the whole system much fairer. It would create equality between parents",
