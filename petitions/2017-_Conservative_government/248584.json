We should retain the \u00a339 billion for the UK, give No more money to the EU, and take back FULL control. This government has been absolutely useless negotiating with the EU. We must now leave with No Deal on the 29th March 2019 just as the mandate and the Brexit Vote was sold to the UK people.",

Some MP's are being obstructive and attempting to avoid Leaving the EU by the 29th March 2019 these should be held accountable for their actions",
