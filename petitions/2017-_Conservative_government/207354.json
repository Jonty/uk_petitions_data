        "action": "Ban pavement parking and extend rule 244 of the Highway code across the UK",
        "additional_details": "Parking on the pavement is dangerous. Pavements are for pedestrians, and it is an obstruction. Wheelchair users, the visually impaired, and those with push chairs, babies, and young children should not have to enter the road because someone has parked on the pavement. It is only a matter of time before this causes a severe accident. We don't want a new law, we want rule 244 of the Highway code extended to cover the whole of the UK so that pavement parking is banned and this ban can be enforced.",
        "background": "I decided to create this petition after I had to enter the road during rush hour, in the dark with a push chair, because someone was parked on the pavement. I should not have to wear high-viz clothing to take my son to Tesco. It is about time rule 244 of the Highway code was extended across the UK.",
