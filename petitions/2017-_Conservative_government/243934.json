        "additional_details": "The current Act permits recall to be triggered for three reasons. None permit recall by voters. We want to change that while guarding against malicious recall. \r\n\r\nA potential triple-lock model is available (but too long for this site). In summary, recall if:\r\n\r\nMP\u2019s in a party:\r\n\u2022\tA vote of no confidence in the sitting MP by the relevant constituency party AND\r\n\u2022\tA majority vote of the registered party members in the constituency\r\n\r\nIndependent MP's:\r\nDuring a period set by Parliament, x% of the registered voters in the given constituency sign to indicate they wish their MP to be recalled \r\n\r\nMP\u2019s changing party:\r\nWithin a set period after changing x% of registered electors in the constituency concerned support a recall of the MP",
        "background": "Trust in MPs is low. Once your vote has been secured, you can't remove them.\r\nThey change party, consistently vote against their constituency's wishes or act in a way their constituents see as unacceptable. But they can't be sacked.\r\nWe must change that while protecting MPs against malicious recall.",
