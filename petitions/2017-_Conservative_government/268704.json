        "additional_details": "Gordon Brown taking over as Labour leader and subsequently PM was wildly undemocratic, as was pointed out by current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has done exactly the same thing himself, after Theresa May was also defaulted into the position of PM but did not call an election for many months after her entry into power.",
        "background": "It is unfair for the members of political parties to choose the next Prime Minister on behalf of the rest of the country. If the PM has resigned or has been deposed it is a matter of national importance, not merely party. It is undemocratic to simply enforce a new PM without public backing.",
