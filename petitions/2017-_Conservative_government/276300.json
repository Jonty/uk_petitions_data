He also gave reassurances in Parliament (https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm). Moving W&C services to Shrewsbury is a waste of \u00a328M of public money (https://newsroom.shropshire.gov.uk/2014/06/state-of-the-art-new-28-million-women-and-children\u2019s-centre-to-open-in-telford/).",
        "background": "In 2014 the then Health Secretary pledged both A&E sites in Shropshire would remain open and concerns were 'scaremongering'. A purpose-built Women and Children's ('W&C') unit opened in Telford in 2014, costing \u00a328M. Telford A&E will now be downgraded however and W&C services will move to Shrewsbury.",
