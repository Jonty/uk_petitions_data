        "action": "Ban selling of plastic bags in UK, should be replaced with paper/eco friendly.",
        "additional_details": "With the removal of plastic bags from our country will NOT become an issue, plastic bags can easily be replaced with paper bags that can be recycled, or even better options such as Eco-friendly bags.Plastic bags cause damage to the environment; animals are suffering from the constant dumping of plastic, another is that sewage-system gets clogged the plastic form clumps with other waste and blocks water running, beautiful landscapes and habitats are destroyed. It is an open and shut case.",
        "background": "The biggest causes of pollution are factories, the burning of fossil fuels and of course plastics but the list of causes continues, despite having labelled plastic bags with a price quite a time ago, not a big difference has been made. Cure is simply to stop the selling plastic bags completely.",
