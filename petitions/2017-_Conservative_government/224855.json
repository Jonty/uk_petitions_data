        "additional_details": "New Southgate Cemetery, St Mary's Roman Catholic Cemetery, The City of London Cemetery and all Lambeth and Hackney Cemeteries have re-used graves, disturbed the dead, removed memorials and clear areas to build up sections with earth to bury again, meaning access to older graves are lost forever.   Graves and memorials provide a tangible link to our past, assist genealogical research but primarily form part of our heritage and encourage acts of Respect and Remembrance.",
        "background": "Graves are being re-used without the consent of people who hold burial rights.  Cemeteries are failing to locate people who may have an inherited right to grave space and the integrity of graves are being abused. This petition calls upon Government and local authorities to establish new cemeteries.",

Cemeteries are usually the responsibility of local churches or your local council.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask the Government to give local councils more funding so that they can establish new cemeteries, if that's what you would like to happen. "
