        "additional_details": "For those who live in a local community, numerous aspects of their daily life \u2013 such as housing, education, local amenities, public transport, cultural and sports facilities \u2013 are influenced by decisions taken by the local authority. It is therefore only fair to extend the right to vote and be elected in local elections to all long-term UK residents, regardless of their citizenship. Such a move would also ensure that EU citizens retain their right to vote in local elections after Brexit.",
        "background": "There should be a change in electoral law to ensure that everyone who is permanently resident in the UK and of voting age has the right to vote in local government elections.",
