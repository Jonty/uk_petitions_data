        "additional_details": "Recent plebiscites (Scottish Independence & Brexit) resulted in extreme social division, with strenuous objections to & denial of the outcomes, resulting in futile time consuming/distracting efforts to re-run both votes due to close results.\r\n\r\nIt's not logical or sensible for MAJOR change to be settled 50/50. MAJOR change requires a minimum 60% vote & a 75% turnout.\r\n\r\nThis criteria means ONLY 45% of the electorate needs to vote in favour of the change to make it happen. If the public are NOT engaged enough to achieve this, then its more than reasonable to retain the status quo and reject the suggested change.",
        "background": "Referenda are divisive. Government abdicates its responsibilities (avoiding potential elector fallout). If government require us to vote on matters of MAJOR constitutional change, they should ensure the terms of that referendum have very clear & unambiguous outcome conditions.",
