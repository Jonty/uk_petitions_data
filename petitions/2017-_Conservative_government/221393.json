        "additional_details": "This study was conducted on Chat2HelpAllTeenagers.co.uk from 30 teenagers across the UK. \r\nWhy aren\u2019t schools making all parents and children aware of the policy - as the government website indicates all parents and children should be told about it. \r\nThis recent study highlights that this is not done, and feel we need to change this! \r\n \r\nSo please help, sign this petition \r\n \r\nwww.chat2helpallteenagers.co.uk",
        "background": "A recent study has seen that 80% of teens were not aware their school had an anti-bullying policy. \r\n100% said they felt it would benefit if the policy was displayed on notice boards around the school. So let\u2019s make it the law to have it displayed and not just on a website!!",
