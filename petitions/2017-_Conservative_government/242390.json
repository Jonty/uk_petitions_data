        "additional_details": "To become an MP representing a main political party a candidate must be authorised to do so by the party's nominating officer. They must then win the most votes in the constituency. When an MP leaves that political party mid-term, they are no longer authorised by the party's nominating officer and the terms of their election by the constituents are no longer valid. The MP must now stand in a by-election as an independent under a new manifesto because they have broken the terms of their election.",
        "background": "If an MP dies or retires, a by-election is held in that constituency to find a new MP for that area. Currently, however, there is currently no requirement for an elected MP to stand in a by-election should that MP leave a political party, despite being elected on the manifesto of the said party.",
