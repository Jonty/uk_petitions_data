        "additional_details": "For many of years people have celebrated birthdays weddings and of course bonfire might with fireworks. The majority of people who purchase fireworks are sensible and responsible and this shouldn\u2019t be ruined by others. Instead of banning them to the public let\u2019s see the brining in of a licence to purchase which can be taken away if caught using inappropriately and reducing the payload of fireworks to clamp down on how loud they are. But still allow home displays.",
        "background": "Fireworks are a traditional celebration for many across the country, let\u2019s not ban them for public purchase but instead bring in measures such as having to have a licence to buy which can be taken away, and limiting the noise produced by payload on fireworks. Let\u2019s not ruin our family times.",
