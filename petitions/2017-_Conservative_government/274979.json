        "action": "A general election is required to break the deadlock for leaving EU",
        "additional_details": "A vote was carried out on 23th June 2016 to leave or remain within the EU. The leave vote won 52% to 48% and should now be delivered. Due to our current political landscape this has not happened. Holding a general election would break the dead lock and ensure the current will of the people is delivered. A general election would also allow parties to understand that the public are aware of leaving the EU with or without a deal.",
        "background": "We the people no longer have faith with the current parliament and require a general election to break the dead lock for leaving the EU. A general election would give the new parliament a clear view of the will of the people and should be held before the 31st October 2019.",
