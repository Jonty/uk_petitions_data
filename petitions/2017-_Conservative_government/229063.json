        "additional_details": "The EWB Propose a licensing system similar to the GLAA (http://www.gla.gov.uk/) to help protect the workers from these unfair practices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law is very clear on what an employment business/agency can and can't do but as it stands it is difficult to bring them to justice.\r\n\r\nWith a licence in place it makes the jobs of unions such as the IWGB:EWB easier to fight for fairness for workers.\r\n\r\nIts time for change within the electrical industry and these unfair practices that break the law to change.",
        "background": "Employment businesses/agencies that supply labour within the electrical trade are notorious with breaking the rules.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common problems is workers not being paid or having deductions made from there wages, both of which are illegal practices!",
