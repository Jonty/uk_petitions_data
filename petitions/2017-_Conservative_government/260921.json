        "additional_details": "With the increase of cyclists using roads, and more being encouraged as a healthy/less polluting alternative, it is critical to ensure there is some form of safety training before people join other traffic on road.\r\n\r\nI believe the continuing surge in popularity of cycling on roads gives a genuine concern and reason for testing road knowledge.",
        "background": "I believe cyclists should be required to undergo similar training/testing to use roads as other vehicles do. \r\n\r\nDriving tests aren't only to operate a vehicle, but to show safety, understand road markings, signals & laws. This is key knowledge for all road users and cyclists should not be exempt.",
