        "additional_details": "We demand the legal right to Free Speech, in an Act which will bring an end to the ludicrous notion that \"hate speech\" and \"offensive speech\" deserves people be imprisoned or charged. In short, an Act to codify the citizens' right to freedom of speech without government intervention.\r\n\r\nIdeas must be fought with other ideas, not with force. \r\n\r\n\r\nNaturally this precludes that the current laws criminalizing \"hate speech\" be rescinded.",
        "background": "Who defines \"Hate\"\r\n\r\nFor several years now the government has been infringing people's' most basic rights to speak freely on matters, by deeming their speech \"offensive\" or \"hateful\" and declaring that such speech, even online, warrants being fined or jailed. This is an outrage!",
