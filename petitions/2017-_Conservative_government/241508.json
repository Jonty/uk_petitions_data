        "action": "Allow phones to be used in secondary schools as there are many dangers!!",
        "additional_details": "Also children should be allowed their phones in case they have forgot to bring something and school doesn\u2019t allow them to call home. Another reason why phones should be allowed in all schools are as some secondary schools allow phones and it\u2019s unfair if some schools do not. A punishment for using a phone in class could be detention as phones will only ever allowed at Break or lunch : or maybe not allowed to be used in school but they are allowed to have it with them , for strict schools",
        "background": "I am aware that this is a very controversial topic but I strongly agree that phones should be allowed in all secondary schools. We believe this as many kidnapping that  have occured were whilst young innocent adults have been on the way home from school without a mobile to call for help.",
