        "additional_details": "Under the Care, Mental health and Autism Act's local authorities have to ensure people receive services that prevent their care needs from becoming more serious, or delay the impact of their needs, have a range of provision of high quality, appropriate services to choose from. It also makes clear that local authorities must provide or arrange services that help prevent people developing needs for care and support or delay people deteriorating such that they would need ongoing care and support.",
        "background": "I suggest that early help assessments should be statutory in adult services to ensure a robust assessment of need, planning, reviewing and correct services are involved to meet those needs and enable a better quality of life, better choices and better support for the individual and their carers.",
