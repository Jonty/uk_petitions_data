        "additional_details": "However, the detainees in such internment camps included professors in the local universities, successful businessman, well known musicians and sportsman too. So, it is hard to define the terminology of 'extremism' in China as the contributions and loyalty of the above mentioned professionals were highly acknowledged by the local government until 2017.
