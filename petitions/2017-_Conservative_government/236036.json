        "additional_details": "Many British citizens working in the UK on slightly lower pay, especially outside London. They\u2019re employed and the income they earn are enough to provide for themselves and the spouse. The government should consider this. In Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, the income rates are lower than England.",
        "background": "Government should reduce the minimum income requirement for British spouse visa, from \u00a318,600 to \u00a314,400. In many jobs, a person can save a lot from their monthly income and can provide for two people (themselves and the spouse) without relying on public funds. The incomes are lower outside London.",
