        "additional_details": "As of 01.04.2018 MP will have a salary of between \u00a376,011 to \u00a377,379 pa. Fully qualified NHS Nurses start on salaries of \u00a322,128 rising to \u00a328,746 on Band 5 of the NHS Pay Rates. Meaning that the MP on the lower end of their pay scale will still be earning over two and a half times the Nurse's wage even on the highest point on Nurses pay scale.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/adult-nurse\r\nhttps://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/mps-to-get-pay-rise-of-more-than-1300-a3779071.html",
        "background": "MP's have on several occasions voted for themselves to get a pay rise. This is a conflict of interest. Being an MP is a public service, much like our hard-working NHS staff - why aren't they paid the same? This proposal would save taxpayers money and could provide funds for additional NHS staff.",
