Adults face a minimum of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment whilst young people aged 16 or 17 face a minimum 4 month Detention and Training Order. Since the introduction of the minimum custodial term people caught carrying a knife or offensive weapon for a second time are now more likely than ever before to go to prison\u2014in the year ending September 2018, 82% of offenders received a custodial sentence for repeat possession offences.
