It\u2019s vital where the school/governing body don\u2019t provide records/evidence that the DfE must obtain & forward them to the complainant to contribute. Student\u2019s education notably those from poor backgrounds/ethnic minorities is put at risk & their records tainted with misleading information. The DfE complaints system must be overhauled & those responsible held accountable",

Currently the DfE does not do this",

However, the Petitions Committee can\u2019t schedule votes of no confidence. This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. Petitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want.\r\n"
