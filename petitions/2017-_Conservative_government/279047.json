        "additional_details": "This means most people of 27 yrs of age and below are having to carry identification in England to be able to purchase alcohol. Which in my opinion is too authoritarian. As the law states you need to be over the age of 18 to buy alcohol. This feels like identity cards through the backdoor.",
        "background": "If people look under 18 yrs of age then they should be asked for id.  Like wise if a premises states that people should be 21 yrs of age to be served. But we now have a situation where someone who could be 30 yrs old but looks under 25 can be challenged for id.",
