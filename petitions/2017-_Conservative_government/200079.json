        "additional_details": "The Daily Mail comments section sees bigoted comments posted every single day, but these are just removed when moderated. Racist hate speech on Twitter (for instance) is most likely to get your account suspended and you being charged for inciting racial hatred. I don't see why it shouldn't be challenged in other walks of life.\r\n\r\nThis petition is an important topical issue and I want it to help bring justice to everyone who has ever suffered from it. Hate speech is NOT freedom of speech.",
        "background": "Hate speech is communicating in a way that is meant to offend and hurt somebody. This abuse includes racism, homophobia, body shaming and a whole range of other hate speech. Hate speech can affect everyone from every walk of life, both in real life and online.",
