        "additional_details": "Trade from outside the EU isn\u2019t checked until in some cases 73 miles  inside the EU\u2019s border. \r\nThe port of Hamburg, Germany is further away from its own border, the North Sea 73 miles, than Belfast is away from Dundalk 51 miles. \r\nThis includes livestock. \r\nThis is all achievable using normal everyday items, pens, phones and email. \r\nIf it\u2019s acceptable for the EU to have it\u2019s customs and regulatory checks miles away then it should be for the UK too.",
        "background": "The people of Ireland do not want a hard border. Neither does the rest of the United Kingdom. \r\nThis issue is the only issue that the EU, Ireland and the United Kingdom agree on. \r\nFor that reason, surely the British government should pass a law and put in place before any possible No Deal Brexit.",
