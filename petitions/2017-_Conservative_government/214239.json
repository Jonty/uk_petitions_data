        "additional_details": "I recently went to renew my car insurance and because i had to non fault accidents in a company vehicle ( not my own car) they refused to even insure me. they claimed i was high risk even though the other parties involved admitted responsibility and i had evidence. i did not make a claim in anyway and the insurance company still refused. My company even offered evidence to them and they still refused. It should be stopped now, all your years of NCB count for nothing if someone else drives into you.",
        "background": "car insurance companies put up car insurance premiums even after a non fault accident, this is wrong if the accident was not your fault then why should you pay more. Is this not the reason why we have insurance so that the person who caused the accident pays for it all.",
