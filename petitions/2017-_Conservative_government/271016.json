        "additional_details": "Proroguing in this case is not anti-democratic - this is wholly democratic because the people responsible for representing us are doing everything they can to thwart the referendum result voted for by the public. If you believe in democracy then sign this petition and support it. It matters not if you do not support the conservative party - this is a vote for democracy.",
        "background": "The people of the UK voted for an exit from the EU in the referendum in 2016 and the House of Commons and the House of Lords have shown themselves to be utterly incapable of fulfilling the will of the people of the United Kingdom. For this reason Boris Johnson will need to prorogue parliament.",
