        "additional_details": "Other problems with secondary sites are they don't make information clear or provide T&C of the ticket upfront which sometimes means fans are turned away when ticket ID is needed. They need to be fair and honest to fans. Claire Turnham has also helped people reclaim \u00a3200k in refunds since Feb from Viagogo due to customers being mis sold and being misled. Sites like this need to stop taking advantage of their customers. This needs to stop now.",
        "background": "How many of us have tried at 9:01am to try & buy a ticket, to be told 'no tickets available' then to find so many tickets available on re-sale sites at outrageous prices. This petition is a voice for fans to say Enough! We want something to be done about this! Fans deserve tickets at face value.",
