Therefore, providing good water quality, enough food, humane slaughter and protection from pain.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s scientific evidence suggesting that crabs, lobsters, prawns and crayfish experience pain and emotion. Yet they are still sold, torn apart and boiled alive. Authorities were powerless to prosecute because these animals aren\u2019t currently covered under animal welfare legislation.",
