        "additional_details": "You can only begin to imagine the vast amount of disposable, non-biodegradable dog poo and nappy bags we get through each year. This plastic may pollute the planet we call home for hundreds of years to come.\r\nTherefore, I call on the government to ban the sale of these bags so that the biodegradable alternatives will replace their use, resulting in a healthier environment.\r\nSources:\r\nPet dog population- PDSA\r\nDisposable nappy usage- Wrap",
        "background": "There are 8.9 million dogs in the UK. Many of the UK's dog owners use disposable, non-biodegradable dog poo bags on a regular basis. These bags are similar to those used to dispose of 2 billion+ disposable nappies in the UK every year. This use of plastic poses a grave risk to the environment.",
