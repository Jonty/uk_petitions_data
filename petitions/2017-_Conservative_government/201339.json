        "action": "Grant leave to  undocumented Zimbabweans with at least 15years residence in UK",
        "additional_details": "The Zimbabwean government has brought its own citizens to their knees. The situation there is not getting any better. One only has to look at the news reports. Rather than expect a return to a country that is clearly \"broken\", there is  more humane, compassionate and tolerant action that the UK government can take. Grant leave to remain to undocumented Zimbabweans with at least 15years residence in the UK, further taking into account the best interests of their minor children born here.",
        "background": "Since  at least 2000,  thousands of Zimbabwean citizens have fled the turbulent political, social and economic situation in Zimbabwe. A  significant number of Zimbabweans with at least 15years residence remain  here undocumented, despite perpetual gross human rights violations in Zimbabwe.",
