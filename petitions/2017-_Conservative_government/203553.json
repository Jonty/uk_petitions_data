        "action": "Remove Parental Responsibility if convicted of paedophilia & domestic violence",
        "additional_details": "Protect the survivor, protect the children.\r\n\r\nThe HEAL Foundation asks the Government to rescind parental responsibility from both domestically violent people and paedophiles. If someone is convicted for domestic violence, the judge should rescind their Parental Responsibility rights so the abusive party cannot use the courts to continue their control. Judges should end Parental Responsibility permanently for convicted paedophiles.",
        "background": "Apart from financially supporting their children, people convicted of paedophilia or domestic violence should have no further parental responsibility for them. Both domestically violent people and paedophiles should not be able to utilise courts to continue their control.",
