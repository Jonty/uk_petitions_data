        "action": "Provide adequate funding so the NHS can support veteran\u2019s mental health care",
        "additional_details": "Not only did the Prime Minister make mental health a priority when she took office but the government has recently decided to engage in military action in Syria \u2013 a decision which will undoubtedly see an increase in the need for a well-funded NHS and a well-funded treatment program for veteran\u2019s mental health. We call on the government to provide adequate funding to the NHS so that it is no longer forced to decide between treatment for veterans and maintaining frontline services.",
        "background": "A funding cut from the NHS is forcing the veteran\u2019s mental health charity, Combat Stress, to stop its intensive treatment program which helps veterans overcome PTSD sustained during military service.",
