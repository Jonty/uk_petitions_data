        "additional_details": "The National LGBT Survey found that a third of respondents who were in education in 2016-2017 said that they experienced a negative reaction during that time due to them being, or people perceiving them to be, LGBT. The most frequent perpetrators of the respondents\u2019 most serious incidents were other students (in 88% of cases) but a tenth (9%) were committed by teaching staff. The resulting action plan focuses heavily on \u2018tackling\u2019 not organisational culture change in order to prevent prejudice.",
        "background": "A lack of training on the prevention of LGBT+ bullying, means providers like Stonewall & www.inclusionforall.co.uk often work with schools where LGBT+ bullying is already happening. Stonewall research shows almost half of LGBT pupils are bullied at school. Teachers must be trained from the start.",
