        "additional_details": "We are in a critically defining period of the UKs future. One that will be led by Trade Deals being written, negotiated and agreed right now, if Brexit goes ahead.\r\n\r\nIn this process Liam Fox MP has allowed ISDS clauses to be included in future International Trade Agreements. These will allow investors to sue the UK government for any measures that harm their profits. The future ramifications of this are incalculably bad for the prosperity of the UK.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks to stop the UK Government ratifying trade deals that include ISDS clauses that would allow the UK to be sued.",
