        "additional_details": "So many stories are in the news about young children saving a parents life with basic first aid. Even being taught to ring 999 and following guidance over a phone. Would your child no what to do if anything happened to you? Would they no how to get help? Who to ring? Where to ask for the help to come? Why is this not taught in schools as mandatory? In a fun environment children will absorb any information given and I firmly believe this could aid in saving lives.",
        "background": "After a incident at home with my daughter  it struck me as to how observant my 7 year old was. The questions asked and the maturity he showed stunned me. We have now taught him basic first aid and I believe it should be mandatory in school. We don\u2019t give children enough credit for what they can do.",
