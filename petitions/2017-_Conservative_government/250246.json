        "additional_details": "Negotiations thus far have been one-sided with the EU dictating and the UK treating it all as a damage limitation exercise.  We need to restart negotiation with the imperative of having left the EU without Theresa May's capitulating Withdrawal Agreement and without her as PM.  There will be incentive on both sides.  We also need to use professionals such as Crawford Falconer in the negotiations and not Civil Servants such as Olly Robbins.",
        "background": "Preparations to leave with No-Deal are further advanced than the Government will openly admit and even the Bank of England and its Governor are considerably softening their stance. We need to face the EU across the table in an equal and tough Trade Deal negotiation.",
