Every household within the UK received the leaflet.\r\n\r\nThe British people voted against remaining within the EU.  \r\n\r\nThere should be no debate about remaining within the EU, since the British people knew what it meant and rejected it. There should be a law passed to ensure that Remaining within the EU is ruled out & any further referendum should only concern choices about which option to leave the EU should be adopted.",
