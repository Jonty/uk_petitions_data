        "additional_details": "The introduction of a penalty of 5p for each plastic bag is great. Unfortunately, this doesn't take plastic out of the shopping, it just makes us pay for it. I would gladly pay 5p for a compostable bag, instead of yet another plastic one, so why aren't supermarket using the income from all of us into actively getting rid of plastic? It's my opinion that they should ONLY provide compostable bags. otherwise the 5p charge is just not enough. They should do their part as well, not just us consumers.",
        "background": "When you go to the supermarket you can bring your own bag for life, or you can pay 5p for a plastic bag. Where do these 5p go? I think they should go toward producing compostable bags instead of just disappearing into the supermarket's pockets. In the end the goal is to get rid of plastic.",
