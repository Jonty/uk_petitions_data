When their child hasn\u2019t even taken their first steps or said their first word! Having children is a very special, precious time and I think having more time at home with your children in their younger years is detumetal to a child\u2019s future, having a routine and having consistency.",

A lot of families struggle to pay for childcare & don\u2019t want to pay other people to look after their children. Children aren\u2019t getting the 1to1 parenting they need.",
