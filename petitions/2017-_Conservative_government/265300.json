        "additional_details": "I strongly believe that both of the females should be seen as legal parent as long as the donor has signed all parental rights away and they have proof of this, \r\n \r\nFor example , there are sperm banks in the EU, USA etc that ship sperm to people\u2019s homes for home insemination. They have already signed rights away when they donate so they are not a legal parent to any child. I believe if 2 females pay all the money for the sperm to be shipped over that they BOTH should be named legal parents, as they both played part and both planned the child.",
