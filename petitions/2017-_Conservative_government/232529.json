        "additional_details": "The UK beauty & aesthetics industry has many correctly trained and knowledgeable non medics providing aesthetics safely, however in the past few months this has been brought under scrutiny by medics and whilst many of the claims aimed at non medics are very unjust, it has  highlighted to many that the aesthetics & beauty industry as a whole needs to change.\r\nThe industry needs to be correctly & fairly regulated to protect not only the public but also protect non medics, their careers and futures!",
        "background": "For a while now there has been a need for change and regulation within the beauty & aesthetics industry, but now more than ever we need to put in place a regulated UK body for Non medics alongside proper regulated qualifications that will allow non medics the correct recognised training",
