        "additional_details": "No one should be able to enter a plea bargain if they hit someone and the person dies as a result. We all know right from wrong and if you kill someone then justice should serve an instant prison sentence whatever your intentions. We lost my father in 2004 and all the accused got was community service. Where's the justice in that? What does that mean for my poor father who dies of a single punch to the head? He ended up brain dead because of his injury. Help me to stop this.",
        "background": "My father was killed by a punch to the head in 2004 and has never received justice, the man who killed him received only community service as he done a plea bargain and admitted culpable homicide. If you hit someone and kill them it should be a mandatory prison sentence.",
