        "additional_details": "Though Mr Trump is a Head of State and the Head of Government of a powerful and important ally, he has shown himself to be no friend of the United Kingdom or its people, having made plain:\r\nhis awful anti-science agenda in his comments on anthropogenic climate change and vaccinations;\r\nhis support for banned National Populists in Britain and Europe;\r\nhis worrying friendliness to dictators and Russia;\r\nhis troubling lack of commitment to NATO; and\r\nhis hostility to the international rules-based order.",
        "background": "US President Donald Trump is due to make a state visit to London in June 2019. We the undersigned believe that it is wrong for a man of his bad character and ill temper to be afforded the welcome of the British state and HM The Queen. Climate change-denying misogynist plutocrats must not be let in.",
