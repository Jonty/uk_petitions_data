        "background": "On 23rd June 2016 an in/out referendum was held for the British people to vote Stay/Leave the EU - The leave vote won the referendum.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to stop the UK government from 'stealling\" our chance of \"Brexit\" and preventing the UK from Leaving the EU which is now OVERDUE.",
