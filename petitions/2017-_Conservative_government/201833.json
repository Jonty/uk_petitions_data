        "action": "Ban mobile operators from taking payments for phone purchases you've paid off.",
        "additional_details": "This practice is the same as buying a new car on finance and being expected to continue your payments once the loan is paid off. \r\n\r\nThe majority of consumers may be aware of the practice and renegotiate their contracts, however, many others do not realise that part of their monthly cost is effectively a loan for the phone. \r\n\r\nStandard industry practice should be to automatically move consumers to SIM only when their contract expires or phone is paid off, whichever occurs first.",
        "background": "Monthly payments for a new mobile contract will often include the service charges and a cost to cover a new phone. Once your contract term expires, and if you do not contact the operator, you will automatically continue paying the same monthly cost despite having paid off the loan for the phone.",
