        "additional_details": "The noise from fireworks causes a great amount of fear, stress and anxiety in wild animals. ... Errant fireworks can also cause environmental damage though fires, and from the release of poisonous chemicals and particle-laden smoke, which is not just inhaled by wildlife, but contaminates the natural environment. \r\nIn England last year, 4,436 individuals attended A&E because of an injury caused by a firework - more than double the 2,141 in 2009/10.\r\nWith around 40% of the UKs dogs being scared.",
        "background": "Every year more and more people, animals and wildlife get hurt by fireworks. It\u2019s time something was fine to stop this. There are enough organised firework groups around for us to still enjoy fireworks safely so please help me stop the needless sale of them to the public!",
