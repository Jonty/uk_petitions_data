They British public are more informed and understand the arguments for and against staying in the EU with more depth.  We the British public are now informed of what is and is not possible from a withdrawal bill.  Whilst the 2016 referendum did \"Vote Leave\", this vote was valid on that date only.  This new information and the current will of the public MUST now be taken in to account if we are to continue to act as a democracy.",

However this vote was flawed made on the basis of misleading information, and supported by campaigns which may have behaved less than honourably.
