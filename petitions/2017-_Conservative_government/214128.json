        "additional_details": "Between September 2016 and September 2017 the recorded crime rose across the UK by nearly 15%, with a rise of 21% in knife crime, a massive 32% rise in domestic burglary and an 18% increase in vehicle-related crimes.

        "background": "There has been a noticeable increase in crime across the UK particularly in knife, domestic burglary & vehicle-related crimes. It is apparent that the police force do not have the required resource to effectively tackle and resolve these increasing issues. We as UK citizens feel unsafe & uneasy.",
