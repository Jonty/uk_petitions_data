        "action": "Remove articles 28-35 inclusive in chapter 6 of the offensive weapons bill.",
        "additional_details": "Since the handgun ban in 1997, lawful firearms shooters at Home Office Approved clubs have not been able to use such items however the career criminals easily procure these items for their illegal activities. \r\nFurther firearms restrictions proposed in this bill are not the prudent way forward in tackling the root causes of crime and will have zero effect on the reduction of violent crime in the UK. The Government need a holistic approach to education, welfare and policing, which in time will yield lower crime statistics nationally. This is where policy should be concentrated.",
        "background": "These clauses in the Bill seek to make certain firearms illegal. This is wholly unnecessary with the robust firearms licensing that is implemented in the UK to protect public safety. None of the equipment contained in these clauses have ever been used in a crime on UK soil.",
