        "additional_details": "The referendum vote to leave is compromised by the inability of the U.K. to unilaterally leave the customs union in the event of a backstop scenario. In the highly likely event MPs vote against the deal the Government must commit to return to the EU to negotiate an improved deal, for example to amend the Withdrawal Agreement to create a unilateral right to leave the customs union in the event of a backstop scenario and to reduce the Brexit bill; to be done immediatley and urgently after the vote",
