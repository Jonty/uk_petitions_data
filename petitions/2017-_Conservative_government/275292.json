        "additional_details": "The bitter Brexit debate over the past few years has revealed how many people often misunderstand the very laws and conventions by which they are governed. \r\n\r\nWhatever side of the debate you are on, I hope all will agree that this knowledge should not be reserved to a privileged few. Everyone has the right to know how they are governed and by whom.\r\n\r\nSchools should therefore teach basics of Public Law, including Parliamentary Supremacy, the role of the Monarch and convention, and judicial review.",
        "background": "Why can Parliament override the Government?\r\nIf Judges can tell the PM what to do, does that mean they are more powerful?\r\nWhere does the Queen fit in to all of this?\r\n\r\nIntroducing mandatory Public Law lessons into schools would ensure future generations can answer all of these questions, and more.",
