        "action": "Enforce plastic bottle companies to use PLASTIC KILLS templates to reduce litter",
        "additional_details": "Overall just 32% of plastic is recycled and 70% recovered (BFP, 2017); our most sustainable option is to therefore not use it considering only a small portion is recycled. \r\n\r\nBy associating images of marine life affected by plastic in a \"SINGLE-USE PLASTIC KILLS\" graphic template, this will raise awareness that plastic affects the natural world negatively. The aim is to change consumer habits into making more responsible choices e.g. using reusable water bottles & recycling single-use bottles.",
        "background": "This petition is proposing single-use plastic bottle companies to be legally required to use a graphical template to encourage recycling and use of more sustainable products. Graphics will be similar to the \"Smoking Kills\" campaign, except it will associate single-use plastic with ocean pollution.",
