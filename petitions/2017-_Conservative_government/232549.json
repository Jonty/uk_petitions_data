        "additional_details": "The current law for landlords does not require them to even consider a pet if they are renting a property out. Making it impossible for tennants with even the most docile quiet animal to move to a property. \r\nI wish for the law to be changed on the refusal of potential rental tennants that have pets before meeting and knowing about the pets they may have, many landlords outright refuse a pet based on a dogs breed or size without knowing the individual animal beforehand.",
        "background": "I have been searching for a property to rent for nearly a year with a very docile large dog and a sick puppy, I have so far been refused every property on the basis of my one dogs size and the fact they are dogs. I have even come to begging landlords to meet them so that I can potentially rent",
