Since 2916 parliament has consistently gone against the will of the electorate and is now talking about extending past 29 March and has even threatened for not to leave at all!\r\n\r\nThis needs to end on 29 March.",

Rather than EU withdrawal they've focused on political point scoring to the detriment of our nation's reputation. \r\nTheir decision to reject No Deal is not theirs to make!",
