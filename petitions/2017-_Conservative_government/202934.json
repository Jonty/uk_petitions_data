        "additional_details": "We want a new plan to replace the proposal which:\r\n- properly consults about any Greenbelt changes\r\n-considers and prioritises Brownfield sites\r\n-uses accurate population projections and methodologies\r\n-has sustainable transport at its heart\r\n-promotes and protects green spaces as important for communities\r\n-values the individual identities of each community involved\r\n\r\nThis is an especially urgent case because the council's plan is so flawed. Delay will waste considerable public funds.",
        "background": "The council is proposing a local plan which focuses development on the periphery using only Greenfield and Greenbelt sites. We challenge the assumptions and methodology of the plan. The supporting Greenbelt deletion document had only 14 consultees out of a population of 275000. We demand a new plan.",
