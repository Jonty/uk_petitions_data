        "additional_details": "For example, a \u00a3400 policy could be bonded @ \u00a31200 (\u00a3800 Bond). If the driver drives irresponsibly, with the use of the black box scenario, then the insurance company keeps the bond. If the young or new driver drives, as most will, give the full bond back to them.  \r\nThis will cover the insurance companies risk but also encourage young or new drivers to become more responsible drivers.",
        "background": "Most adult drivers could not afford \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 a month for car insurance, let alone full time students and young apprentices. \r\nI would propose that all new drivers should pay a bond.",
