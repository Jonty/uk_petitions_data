        "additional_details": "\"The charges leveled against Assange stem from the 2010 Manning leaks... That material was received from a source who acted in what she perceived to be the public interest... An ideologically-motivated whistleblower with firsthand knowledge of the material...  forms the bedrock of public interest journalism. Any attempt to ...criminalize it by tying it to hacking on a technicality, threatens quality journalism and threatens the free media\" (James Ball)",
