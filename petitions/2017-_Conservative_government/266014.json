        "additional_details": "The Welsh Assembly recently rejected our petition, therefore we now call on the UK Government to ensure that our voices are heard. \r\n\r\nReports suggested that Mark Drakeford had already made his decision before reviewing Bill Wadrup\u2019s \u00a344 million report, which recommended the project to be approved, stating that there would be decreased congestion, pollution and less of an impact from Co2 traffic fumes on Newport families. We believe that the decision to scrap the project is to our detriment.",
        "background": "We the people of South Wales and effected areas disagree with the First Minister, Mark Drakeford\u2019s decision to scrap the M4 relief road project, believing he was not acting in our best interests. We demand that the decision to scrap the M4 Relief Road project is reconsidered and overturned.",
