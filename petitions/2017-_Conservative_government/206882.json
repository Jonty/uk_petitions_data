        "additional_details": "Where there is a dispute between a creditor and debtor, the debtor can turn to the Financial Ombudsman for mediation / resolution. However, in an IVA there is no mechanism for mediation / resolution. The debtor has to rely on the insolvency firms complaints procedure and then the IP\u2019s regulatory body.  BUT \u2026 the regulatory bodies do not intervene. They will not alter or make an IP alter their course of action, even if proven incorrect. The debtor gets no restitution nor is the dispute settled",
        "background": "An IVA typically lasts 5 or 6 years and the debtor  must use the services of an Insolvency Practitioner (IP). Once signed up they are bound to that IP, regardless of quality of service. they have no access to mediation. See https://www.iva.co.uk/forum/another-petition-f145-t83980 for background.",
