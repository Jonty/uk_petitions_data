        "additional_details": "Britain First are a far right, extremist and racist group; their leaders have been arrested and convicted for inciting hatred. Thomas Mair, convicted murderer, shouted \u2018Britain First\u2019 as he shot and stabbed Jo Cox MP in 2016. It is an insult to our country that Trump would promote such an organisation and its hateful and racist agenda.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump will visit the UK in 2018. No president who promotes such views should be invited to the UK and the UK government should rescind this invitation.",
        "background": "On 29th November 2017, Donald Trump retweeted and promoted Britain First- an extremist, racist and fascist organisation. Its members have been convicted for inciting hatred. Donald Trump is due to visit the UK in 2018. On this basis, his invitation to visit the UK should be rescinded.",
