        "additional_details": "Hobby/leisure drone users are basically doing two hobbys rolled into one which are photography and model flying and we like seeing the world from a different prospective whilst respecting privacy of other people! The people who report drones hitting planes or near misses etc are the ones making up false allegations in a poor attempt to ruin and ban our hobby cos they dislike drones!  We dont need tests or registrations/height registrations! We just need to use the best thing of all common sense",
        "background": "The sky is an infinite like space and it should not be heavily regulated like roads! Drone users should be allowed to fly as high as there comfortable with so long as there away from restricted areas ie airports and prisons and schools and be mindful of people\u2019s safety/privacy! Nobody owns the sky!",
