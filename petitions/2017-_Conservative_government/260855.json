        "action": "Introduce automatic 50/50 shared custody of children upon separation.",
        "additional_details": "The use of a child as power during divorce or separation has become very common within family law. Alienated parents are made to fight months and years to regain contact with their children after being denied contact through bitterness and false allegations. Allegations are often found false meaning the child has needlessly suffered what is essentially abuse and lost valuable time with their parent. Assumed 50/50 custody law should be introduced to prevent children being used during separation.",
        "background": "It is proven beneficial to a childs development to have the involvement of both parents. Therefore, 50/50 shared custody of a child/children should be automatically granted to parents with parental responsibility upon separation.",
