        "additional_details": "May has never been suited to the job and shown it from the start. She is a ditherer, weak, robotic, arrogant, opportunistic and incompetent woman who is incapable of making any firm decisions, has no empathy and lacks the basic human skill of communicating with anyone outside her comfort zone or listening to those who disagree with her. All that drives her is xenophobic obsession with immigrants which she stubbornly flaunts to the detriment of the country. When she goes the UK can turn a corner.",
        "background": "The worst PM in history has finally been dragged, kicking and screaming to admit the inevitable - that she is no longer wanted and will have to go. But she is once again desperately trying to justify her pointless existence and secretly planning on backtracking on her word. This must not happen.",
