        "additional_details": "Under current legislation it is almost impossible to prove or disprove whether the death of a fox was intentional or accidental. The police, RSPCA & anti-hunting groups would no longer need to undertake costly monitoring programs and most allegations of illegal activity would cease. The courts would have a very simple task in deciding whether illegal hunting with dogs had been intended or not. Hunts would show that their intention is to stay within the law rather than intentionally kill a fox",
        "background": "Since the Hunting with Dogs Act, foxes have been killed during the legal activity of trail hunting leading to accusations that trail hunting is a cover for illegal fox hunting. \r\nThis simple measure would prevent claims of accidental or intentional death of a fox (& pet cats, etc) by straying hounds",
