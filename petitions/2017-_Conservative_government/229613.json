        "additional_details": "I am tired of visiting family restaurants and being the only adult able to change our baby! I am yet to see baby changing facilities in male bathrooms and it makes life for my husband difficult and especially restricting when he is alone with the children. I also wonder how it must make male, same sex couples feel as parents when neither can visit the ladies bathroom.",
        "background": "I believe that, unless there is a \u2018baby changing room\u2019 already allocated, there should be changing facilities in all female AND male bathrooms.",
