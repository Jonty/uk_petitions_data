        "additional_details": "Sufferers would only need to use the parking pass for the time when they urgently need a toilet.  They would then be able to move their vehicle to a standard parking spot.\r\n\r\nHaving a short stay pass for those times when they suddenly need access to a toilet would significantly improve the independence & quality of life for a person living with a long term bowel or bladder condition that affects their levels of continence.",
        "background": "100,000\u2019s people in the UK have bowel or bladder condition which means they urgently have to use a toilet.  Sufferers often don\u2019t make it to a toilet in time due to not being able to park in an accessible parking spot because they do not qualify for a disabled car parking badge.",
