        "additional_details": "Quoted from the NHS, Fruit and vegetables are a good source of the nutrients that children need and form part of a healthy, balanced diet.\r\nResearch shows that on average children in England only eat about 3 portions, with many eating fewer.\r\nThe scheme for schools suggests that this also helps to increase awareness of the importance of eating fruit and vegetables, encouraging healthy eating habits that can be carried into later life, so surely this should start as early as possible.",
        "background": "As a charity setting providing care for children under 5 we are passionate in providing young children with the best start in life by embedding healthy practices from the very start. At present children of infant school age are given free fruit which is great but this should start much earlier",
