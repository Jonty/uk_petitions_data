        "action": "Repeal Breed Specific Law. Allow dogs deemed type to be rehomed for any reason.",
        "additional_details": "Due to BSL, thousands of rescue and stray dogs have and continue to be killed when deemed of banned \u2018type\u2019, exempted dogs are severely restricted; until BSL is repealed it should be possible to responsibly rehome a dog deemed type for any reason. Family pets are persecuted and destroyed. BSL continues to cost millions of pounds to enforce, impacts on dog welfare, does not prevent dog bite incidents, it does not protect the public or dogs and neither does it promote responsible dog ownership.",
        "background": "Many organisations and individuals believe that BSL should be repealed; the Act continues to be widely criticised. Dogs are deemed dangerous mainly based on their physical appearance, which does not determine behaviour, it is unscientific and continues to cause the needless death of friendly dogs.",
