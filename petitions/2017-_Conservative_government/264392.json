Malaysia, Turkey, and Indonesia are among the top destinations of our plastic waste but lower environmental protection standards and corruption mean that what Britons put in their recycling bins in the UK often ends up in waterways and the air across the world.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-46566795",
        "background": "According to the BBC's War on Plastic and Greenpeace, plastics labelled as \u201crecyclable\u201d were found getting dumped or illegally burned in Malaysia, poisoning air and water for local communities. The Government should set out a clear timetable for managing our plastic waste & recycling here in the UK.",
