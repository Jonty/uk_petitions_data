        "action": "Make shared parental leave available to all working parents",
        "additional_details": "The ability to have a career and a family is crucial for working parents. However, the ability to achieve the balance between caring for the children and working can be very challenging without the right support in place. Parents have resorted to working part time, or go on precarious contracts to achieve this balance. Since they lack the employee status, they are not eligible for some of the family friendly rights such as shared parental leave. Parents should be supported to achieve this.",
        "background": "Shared parental leave is currently available only to employees leaving out self-employed partners, or casual worker, zero hours contract workers, agency worker, etc. Child care is a key factor why some working parents are on precarious contract. They are struggling to balance work and family life.",
