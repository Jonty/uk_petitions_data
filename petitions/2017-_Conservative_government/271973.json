It can act retrospectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cTogether with the EU, it could pass retrospective legislation extending the Brexit date deeming that the United Kingdom had not left the EU after all.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is legally possible. The EU would have to agree - and they probably would. They don\u2019t want a no deal.\u201d",
