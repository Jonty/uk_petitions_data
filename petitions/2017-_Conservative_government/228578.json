        "additional_details": "PASS hologram cards don\u2019t work everywhere from my experience as many places like nightclubs are not even aware of them and usually they reject people that have them. What is the point for the government to support a scheme that is not effective. We need a government issued national ID or make PASS hologram cards part of official identification here in England in order to solve this problem as carrying driving licences or passports is a big risk to take and a long process to replace",
        "background": "Many people lose their IDs such as driving license which is difficult and costly to replace.PASS hologram cards supposedly should fix this problem but until this day not every place recognises this type of identification.We need the government to introduce something that would be recognisable fully",
