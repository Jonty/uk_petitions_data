        "action": "Make specialist training a requirement for licensing of zoos with exotic animals",
        "additional_details": "Lack of specialist training leads to the maltreatment and fatality of exotic animals and risk to both public and staff. The recent death of two large cats - one which was asphyxiated during incompetent handling and the other which escaped and was euthanised when deemed to be a threat to the public - could have been avoided had appropriate training been required of the operators. Other cases of neglect of exotic animals at licensed establishments have been made public, as have deaths of handlers",
        "background": "Currently, there are no legal requirements for a person to have gained any formal training to be awarded a licence for a zoo or sanctuary that contains exotic animals. Through the lack of expertise and knowledge this leads to the maltreatment of animals in captivity.",
