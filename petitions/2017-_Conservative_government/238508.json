        "additional_details": "Our proposal: Applicable petitions would be voted on alongside general elections, if they passed the 200k threshold.\r\n\r\nThis would give people the power to bring change, It would get people involved, giving us the power to shape Government policy, with a new era of British democracy, where anyone can force change.\r\n\r\nIt would also stop the discontent for petitions we see now & allow the UK to join the list, of many countries where petitions can force a vote.\r\n\r\nJoin the campaign. Demand Democracy!",
        "background": "Petitions with 200k signatures should be put to a public vote.\r\nIt is unjust & Unfair that Parliament make all the decisions & decide what issues we can/can't vote on, people should make policy, not just parliament, we need more democracy not less! \r\n\r\nJoin the campaign @ Let Us Vote on Fb & Twitter",
