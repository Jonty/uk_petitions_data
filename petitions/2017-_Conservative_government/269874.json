We urgently need additional safety measures to try and prevent more fatalities.\r\n\r\nIn June 2019, a close friend fell from this bridge. I personally visited the bridge to pay my respects and leave some flowers. I was horrified by the lack of safety measures in place on such a tall and infamous bridge, especially when its already so well known for its fatalities. The only deterrent up there is notes and signs wrote by locals and samaritans to try and discourage people from jumping.",
