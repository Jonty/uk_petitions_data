        "additional_details": "This new system would make our society fairer overall because it would allow ordinary people to be part of bbc tv programmes if they wanted to be in them. I suggest a new bbc website where citizens can upload their photos and details about themselves, and then bbc directors and producers would check the database and would offer a part in a bbc production to people who have brought a tv license. At least 1 part would be offered per year to a tv license holder. This will make our society fairer.",
        "background": "The law says that uk citizens who own and watch a tv must buy a tv license. I would like the uk government in partnership with the bbc to introduce a new system so that after buying a tv license members of the public will be offered at least 1 part in a bbc tv production over a 12 month period.",
