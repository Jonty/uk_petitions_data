        "additional_details": "Lipedema is quite unknown, and the only known treatment to reduce the fatty build up, is lymph sparing liposuction.  The NHS states this (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lipoedema/) but class treatment as cosmetic. \r\n\r\nUntreated, lipedema can then progress and become lipo-lymphema - lymphedema is currently treated with liposuction under the NHS.  Ladies should not have to progress to this stage before they're offered treatment!\r\n\r\nPlease help us get the treatment we need.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lipoedema.co.uk/",
        "background": "Lipedema/lipoedema is a fat disorder- affecting around 11% of the female population.  While some ladies are able to get the needed treatment (postcode lottery anyone?), the majority are left out in the cold by the NHS.  The condition is painful and progressive, and these ladies need help.",
