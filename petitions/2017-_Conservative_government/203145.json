        "additional_details": "It is common sense that all 1st class carriages be replaced with standard ones so as to accommodate the huge amount of commuters our trains see on an hourly basis, this way every commuter has the highest chance of getting a seat and a comfortable commute. First class carriages are money-grabbing mainstays from the 1800s causing only trouble for regular commuters. Abolish and replace 1st with standard carriages or make it legal to sit in 1st class if the train is full without staff interference.",
        "background": "Too many times my fellow commuters and I have been on packed trains with no standard seats where aisles and doorways are blocked with people. Meanwhile there are no fewer than six pristine and mostly empty first class carriages. Why must people suffer horrid journeys when free seats ARE available?",
