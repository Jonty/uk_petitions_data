        "additional_details": "The influence of gang culture and online media is fuelling young adults to commit violent crime. We have seen on countless occasions the use of deadly weapons being used to end lives of all generations. The ONS has seen a an 80% rise in knife crime in one year. The emergency services are at stretch trying to cope with the influx. Police are seeing record numbers of violent assault and robbery.\r\n\r\nSending an offender for National Service should be the start of a positive journey and discipline.",
        "background": "We have seen an unprecedented rise in violent crime and so far there is no deterrent strong enough to punish the offenders. Prison no longer works and is seen as a \"badge of honour\" thus raising the profile an offender. The police and the public are no longer safe on the streets.",
