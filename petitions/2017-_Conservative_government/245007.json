Give boys/girls and men/women, who use weapons on our streets, real weapons to use professionally with a minimum of three years service. Get them to learn new skills, build their confidence and self asteem. Give them a reason to live! Take them off our streets, out of prison and into our armed services which WE will all hugely benefit from. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s make Britain great again!",

Our youth have lost confidence in our country and taking the law into their own hands. If they want to play with weapons then give them the real thing. Our soft prison system is not the answer.",
