        "additional_details": "Schools should be ordered to set a maximum amount of \u00a350 for the whole uniform and any costs in excess of this must be bourne by the school.  This would also prevent schools from selecting one supplier who can then dictate the price people pay.  As education is mandatory parents should not be forced into paying excessive amounts just to send a child to school",
        "background": "School uniforms are now ridiculously expensive and even primarily schools are now setting excessive rules on school uniforms.  Parents are effectively paying hundreds of pounds in \u201cfees\u201d just to send a child to school.  Parents should not have pay for these excessive uniforms",
