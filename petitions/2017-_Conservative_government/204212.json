        "additional_details": "Most reputable marine biologists, at major centers (including experts at the University of Cambridge and multiple national centres of marine life studies), now believe that fish can feel pain in as many ways that we do and that they are MUCH smarter than we previously thought. With that in mind, both non-commercial and commercial fisherman almost always use inhumane, prolonged methods of slaughter. \r\nSources:  humane slaughter by fish count.org.uk.  Do Fish Feel Pain? by Jonathan Balcombe/PBS.",
        "background": "Fish are by far the UK's greatest victims of animal abuse as 800,000 suffer the following fates every day. Common methods of fish slaughter are cutting/filleting alive (fish remain conscious for 25-65 more mins) and suffocation (takes 55-250 minutes of complete agony). There are humane alternatives.",
