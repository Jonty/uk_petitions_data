        "additional_details": "Multiple letting agents have been reported to over charge and bill for uneccesary maintenance at the end of the tenancy. On top of this, they are extremely slow and unprofessional during the tenancy. Just because we are students, doesn't mean we should be subject to this patronising behaviour. We are adults who are working towards a future. Sign to tighten laws against scamming students out of their much needed money.",
        "background": "Being a student isn't easy. Most of us are experiencing our first taste of independent life, and it's easy to fall into traps. I see countless students loose their deposits on student properties. Letting agents need to have stricter laws in order to prevent scams like this in the future.",
