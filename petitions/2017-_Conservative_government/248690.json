        "additional_details": "Theresa May has continually told the nation that Brexit day would be on the 29th March 2019, and enshrined that date in UK law. Her incompetence as a politicain, negotiator, and leader of a great nation has now compromised trust in British politics and ensured that the departure on the 29th won't happen. The trust that the electorate had in Parliament has now gone. It's not all about 'Remainers', the voice of the 'Leaving' majority needs to be heard. No deal on March 29th, leave means leave!",
        "background": "The Govt repeatedly claims that exiting the EU is 'the will of the people'. We need to endorse this assertion by proving the strength of public support now, for exiting the EU. The Govt must honour the majority 'Leave' vote. No 'deal' was mentioned, or needed. Leave on March 29th, no deal!",
