        "additional_details": "The 2008 recession probably displaced many professional people. Arguably it could be said that I was one of those people. David Cameron then Prime Minister encouraged the out-of-work workforce to embrace education to better one\u2019s skills. Embracing this challenge, I worked my way through academia studying up to BSc (Hons). Furthermore, the justification for raising the retirement age revealed that we are all living longer. Consequently, how is it that at 60+ many older students and I can no longer get student finance. Surely this is a form of age discrimination and should be addressed.",
