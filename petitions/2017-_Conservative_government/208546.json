This is too great a number for the ambulance services to cope with. There will be a high percentage of those calls would not have been life threating. The general public need to be made aware when it is acceptable to dial 999, this would ease pressure for staff when faced with real emergencies. Maybe in the form of televised adverts at peak tines when adults and children will see them",
