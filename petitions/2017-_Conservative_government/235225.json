        "additional_details": "This anti democratic sentiment was highlighted on BBC Politics Live 06/12/2018 when Ms Lisa Nandy, MP for Wigan openly admitted that she represented remainers in her area stating without a hint of irony that its undemocratic \"to impose the tyranny of the majority.\" More than two thirds of Ms Nandy's constituants voted to leave in the referendum yet, unable to accept this clear mandate of the people Ms Nandy insists on fighting to remain. MPs who ignore the will of their voters should not be MPs.",
        "background": "The Brexit debate has highlighted the gulf between MPs and Constituents. How can it be right and proper that MPs who represent constituents who voted overwhelmingly to Leave the EU fight to remain in the EU and vice versa. Is the oppinion of 1 MP worth more than the opinions of thousands of voters?",
