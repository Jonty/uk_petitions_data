This is clearly a loophole, which is having a devastating impact on parents in the UK who suffer parental child abduction. The loophole in the child abduction act needs closing.",
        "background": "A court's permission for a parent to take a child out of the UK facilitates child abduction. Case law states that failure to return a child to the UK is not a crime. This is not in the true spirit of the Child Abduction Act. Failure to return a child should be treated the same as taking them away.",
