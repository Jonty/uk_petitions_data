        "action": "Waive liability of dog owners when an intruder is attacked in the home.",
        "additional_details": "A dog is naturally territorial although a lot of breeds, usually smaller would not attack an intruder due to size difference, a lot of perfectly well rounded large breeds would indeed feel threatened by an intruder entering \u2018their\u2019 secure territory. I am an ex British Army dog handler and find it abhorrent that the government cannot back up its citizens in a way they should. A person can be educated on the laws of \u2018minimum force deemed necessary\u2019 but how do you teach a dog not to defend itself.",
        "background": "It seems there is a lot of confusion and unclear legislation regarding \u2018liability\u2019 if an intruder is bitten by a dog in the dogs home? This needs clarifying urgently along with clarity in respect to signage placed at the property, it should also be legislated in the view of protecting non criminals.",
