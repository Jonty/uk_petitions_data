        "additional_details": "As an NHS worker, I have seen private companies seize contracts that are paid on a by-results basis. Unrealistic targets and unreasonable systems of measuring \u2018recovery\u2019 and \u2018access\u2019 for profit do not place value in the people we are working hard to protect. I am also seeing experienced, excellent health workers leaving the NHS due to restructuring, resource restrictions and burnout. It\u2019s time that this is put to an end so that the NHS can provide the world-class care that it\u2019s famous for.",
        "background": "In the last week, Matt Hancock MP has allowed \u00a3127 million worth of NHS contracts to be put out to tender. This is inviting private health services to take over our NHS care for their profit rather than for the good of the people. We want to bring these services back into the hands of the public.",
