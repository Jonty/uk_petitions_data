        "additional_details": "The current political crisis has been exacerbated by the FTPA; without it an election would probably have been called in the first part of 2019, when Theresa May's government was unable to gain backing for any of its proposed plans for Brexit. \r\n\r\nParties could then have campaigned on their Brexit policies which would have had ample time to be carried out. This would have avoided the current crisis. \r\n\r\nThe badly designed Act trampled over hundreds of years of parliamentary convention and should go.",
        "background": "The FTPA was created to strengthen the coalition government elected in 2010. It abolished the previous conventions that would require a government to resign if it lost the confidence of the House of Commons. \r\n\r\nThe government should introduce legislation to repeal the Fixed-term Parliaments Act.",
