        "action": "Require a court warrant to access and store mobile phone data",
        "additional_details": "This means that police should not be able to extract any data from ones mobile phone without a valid court warrant, and if they do not conform to this statute then they should be contested with a judge. There are also lots of different types of data, from financial bank accounts, to social media. Police should not be allowed access to certain types of data without applying for permission, if they have provided the required amount of evidence to suggest that it would be highly beneficial.",
        "background": "It has been proven nationally that police forces and other relevant authorities can find more evidence on a mobile phone, than they can using a search warrant on one\u2019s home. This evidently shows a gap in the law as we humans develop technology, then the law should be developed in accordance.",
