It operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its work is funded principally by British taxpayers.\r\n\r\nAlthough independent, is is nevertheless a representation of British worldview to the world. \r\n\r\nThe current categorization lumps Canada together with the US, ignoring centuries of shared Commonwealth history. If purely geography, why not \"North America\"?",
        "background": "Britain's public service broadcaster, in online and video formats, continually presents Canada in the same category as the United States.  This tars by association the reputation of the people of Canada, a Commonwealth country with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II as head of state.",
