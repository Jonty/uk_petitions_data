My council tax is now almost 10% of my wage with tax and national insurance this take my tax liability to over 45% for a low income family, surely this cannot continue.The excuse is social care but this is also taken out from our taxes and Nat Insurance contributions. Stop this exploitation now. The government do not care.",

For example, you could start a new petition calling on the Government to stop the increase in the cap on council tax rises (without a local referendum), or to lower the cap, if that's what you want to happen. You could also start a new petition asking for the UK Government to increase funding for Local Councils, if that's what you want to happen. \r\n\r\nWe'd be happy to help you write a new petition if you'd like us to. You can contact us at petitionscommittee@parliament.uk "
