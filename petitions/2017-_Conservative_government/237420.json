You could miss one class out of your two week payment schedule, and that in turn heavily affects you, losing half of your income. Not all students live at home with parents, so for a lot of students, we relay on bursary payment to pay for food/toiletries/electricity/rent. When a situation like this occurs, it\u2019s in turn leaving it\u2019s students hungry, unable to live, and in debt.",
