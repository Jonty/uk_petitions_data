        "action": "Give university students free public transport in the city where they study",
        "additional_details": "As the rising costs of living, especially for students in studying in England, transport to and from university and the surrounding areas takes up a huge chunk of their limited student loans. Some universities in England, charged \u00a3299 for a bus pass for the year, if the government were to subsidise this cost for all students then it would be investment into students life\u2019s and wellbeing. Costs of transport shouldn\u2019t be a worry on a students mind when they have assignments and exams to complete.",
        "background": "University students have very little disposable income, and accumulate high amounts of debt throughout their studies - by giving them free transport around the areas which they reside in not only will this help students but also boost economic activity in the local areas.",
