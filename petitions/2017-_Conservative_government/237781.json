        "action": "Legislate an affordable car insurance maximum premium for younger drivers.",
        "additional_details": "Of course, it is expected that more powerful vehicles are charged at a higher premium, however, the government's ability to help young people become more mobile within the uk offers huge benefits to both the individual and the winder economy. It is argued that the leading cause of unisured drivers in the uk is cost and so this practice also could contribute to a reduction of uninsured deivers on the road thus elevating some risk to other drivers. Let us not price young people out of mobility.",
        "background": "The current ability for insurance companies to charge in excess of \u00a31500 for a 1lt small car for younger drivers is a detriment to the ability of young people to make themselves mobile and thus employable. I would ask that the house assesses the possibility of a price cap for Car insurance in the UK",
