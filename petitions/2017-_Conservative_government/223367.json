        "action": "Devolve TV Broadcasting to Scottish Government Arts, Culture & Sport Ministry",
        "additional_details": "We need to trust our politicians and institutions, devolvement  of television broadcasting would assist the need for transparency and responsibility for localised accountability within Scotland assuring a fairer and more balanced reporting in Scotland and the promotion of the Gaelic Language to Scots. \r\nAt present, Scotland has the lowest proportion of TV Licence Fee to programming collecting \u00a3350 million with \u00a389 million set aside for operating costs in Scotland leaving \u00a3281 million to go out.",
        "background": "British broadcasters have neglected their obligation to the people of Scotland, leaving it comparatively invisible in the networks,as there is a \"huge accountability-gap\" in Scotland as UK Government responsibility lies at Westminster instead of Scottish Government as it is with N. Ireland",
