        "additional_details": "Furthermore, I am unemployed - I have no income. How could I? I\u2019m still in full time education. So how do I suddenly have the excess money to pay for an adult fare? \r\nThere is a 16-25 railcard in place BUT this only reduces the fare on journeys at non-peak times - unhelpful if you\u2019re trying to get to school/college for 8:30. So I propose that if this fare increase cannot be abolished completely, the reduction in fare covered by the 16-25 railcard should cover all times of the day. That\u2019s fair.",
        "background": "Once you turn 16 you begin paying an adult fare on public trains. This is unjust. Legally we still have to attend school/college and yet we suddenly have to pay almost double the fare. At 16, you cannot drink, drive or vote but apparently you can pay an adult fare just by going to school.",
