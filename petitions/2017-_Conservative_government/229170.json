        "action": "Mental Health Awareness should be taught in secondary schools.",
        "additional_details": "When I was younger I felt too embarrassed that somebody close to me suffered from mental health. At the age of 14 I had to skip class to call for somebody that I loved to be sectioned so that they would get the help they needed.\r\n\r\nIf mental health was discussed more in secondary schools I believe I would have felt safe to approach my teachers and explain to them what was happening. \r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take away the stigma that surrounds mental health and make it a safe place for others.",
        "background": "By educating students this will help them to become more aware and possibly allow them to spot signs within their schools & home environments. They will be able to discuss the issues of mental health & seek help whether it be for themselves or others around them and may help reduce bullying.",
