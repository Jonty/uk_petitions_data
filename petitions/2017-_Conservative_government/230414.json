        "additional_details": "According to its mission statement, UN HRC is \"responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations.\" It is also empowered to investigate alleged human rights abuses of UN member states. The watchdog's makeup includes Venezuela, China, Qatar, Angola, Pakistan, DR Congo, Cuba, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, with Somalia, Bangladesh and Eritrea most recently joining the rest.",
        "background": "The Council has clearly become a platform for countries with worst rights records to whitewash themselves, as evidenced by the lack of a single resolution on the countries that run it. It is therefore a moral obligation to stop legitimising this travesty.",
