        "additional_details": "If you have been subjected to unsafe living conditions, patronising responses, lack of communication and no action taken on much needed property repairs and/or maintenance, then a regulating body is required to fully investigate in depth. Local authorities currently do not have enough capacity to assist with such needs across the UK.",
        "background": "Too many private landlords do not carry out their legal obligations at the detriment of their tenants. A governing body is required to regulate such requirements and support tenants whom need to report such landlords for not meeting safety & obligatory maintenance and to investigate harrassment",
