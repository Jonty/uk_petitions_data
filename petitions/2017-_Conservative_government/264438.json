        "additional_details": "The other problems they face which are in many cases more of an issue than their ability to walk are not taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Badge system is not working for a lot of people who are struggling with a disability and this needs to change.There are many reasons why people need to park in a disability bay and the only one should not be how far they can walk. For those struggling with mobility issues getting into and out of a vehicle in a standard parking bay is very difficult, stressful and often distressing and this needs to be taken into account when making a decision on whether or not a Blue Badge is issued.",
        "background": "I run a Parkinson's Support Group and we have many members who have been refused a Blue Badge on the grounds that they are able to walk a relatively short distance. The other problems they face which are in many cases more of an issue than their ability to walk are not taken into consideration.",
