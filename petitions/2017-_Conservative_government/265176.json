As there has been lots of accidents and DO  WE HAVE TO HAVE ANY  MORE FACILITIES BEFORE SOMETHING IS DONE ABOUT THIS?  This will help business with the flow of traffic and not all the snarl-ups every day.",
        "background": "The magic roundabout at five ways is one big joke. It was supposed to alleviate the traffic congestion but it has made it a 100 times worse and it would be better to have a fly over there as suggest at the planning meetings when the A11 was under discussion.",
