        "additional_details": "The BBC claims that there are 216,000 homes across the UK which have been empty for six months or more, and that more than 11,000 UK homes empty for 10 years. This is unacceptable, considering how many areas of natural beauty have been destroyed over the years to make way for new housing. The UK wouldn't need new houses if the government fixed the empty houses.",

The government should provide a scheme to repair these homes and put them on the housing market, rather than destroying the countryside and local greenbelts to make way for the development of new houses.",
