        "additional_details": "Case study: HSBC 2 years ago made my wife redundant after 28 years she was paid redundancy based on her part time salary which she\u2019d been on since 2013 however she had worked for them full time for 25 years which was not taken into account.  I feel this is a distinct disadvantage for women who reduce hours to start a family",
        "background": "Currently companies in the UK can make women who stop work to start a family and return to work part time, redundant and pay redundancy based on the new part time rate, even if the employee has worked there full time for many years, this is unfair and should be outlawed",
