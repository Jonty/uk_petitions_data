This may only happen if the person would not be left stateless as a result. This power has been used against those who travelled to fight overseas. Non-UK nationals can be excluded from the country.\r\n\r\nWhere it is not possible to deprive an individual of their British nationality, a range of powers are available to protect national security.\r\n\r\nThere have already been several successful prosecutions for those who have returned from Syria. This includes the minimum of 40 years for Khalid Ali who was sentenced earlier this year for planning a terrorist attack in Westminster.\r\n\r\nIn addition to seeking prosecution of terrorism suspects we use a range of tools to manage the threat posed.  We impose travel restrictions for individuals subject to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, and require those individuals who return to the UK subject to a Temporary Exclusion Order, to report to a police station regularly.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
