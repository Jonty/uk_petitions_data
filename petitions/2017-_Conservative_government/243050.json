        "additional_details": "Kosher and Halal slaughter is allowed on religious grounds, but legally, only where the sale of such is only for those who religiously require it. This law is being flouted. Only half a carcass from a Jewish slaughter is considered 'Kosher' The rest will be sold, Unlabelled into the British market. Halal and Haram are sold to unknowing British people on a daily basis. Not only is this illegal, it is Immoral. I demand that this practice is stopped. We have laws, and laws are laws.",
        "background": "Halal meat is \"stun-free\", so it violates RSPCA standards on animal welfare and is against the law in the EU, it is legal in the UK due to an exemption in the law granted to Jews and Muslims. With the law in hand, To sell Kosher or Halal/Harem to the British public is illegal, this must be upheld!",
