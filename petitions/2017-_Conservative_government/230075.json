        "additional_details": "There is no way to challenge their decision. \r\n\r\nApparently it\u2019s an MP\u2019s democratic right to not represent you or give an explanation which I find utterly ridiculous as they are there to hold the government accountable. \r\n\r\nThis ability that MPs have to cut off constituents from questioning their government is wholly unacceptable. The rules should be changed so they have to give an explanation.",
        "background": "MP can refuse to represent constituents and choose not to reply to any form of communication unless legally obligated eg subject access request. They do not need to give an explanation, it leaves constituents cut off from all lines of communication if they wish to ask questions of their government.",
