        "additional_details": "To leave the EU based on this vote alone is undemocratic in the extreme, akin to a jury deciding the outcome of a court case on false or no evidence. Now that supporting evidence and some facts are in place, we implore the government to hold a second referendum to legitimise any decision the country comes to, whether that be leave or remain. Without a second vote, neither outcome will have any legitimacy whatsoever and will continue to divide the country for many years to come.",
