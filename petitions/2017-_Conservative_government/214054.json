        "additional_details": "Fed up with the heavily biased news reporting by the BBC especially around BREXIT, the BBC has an obvious left wing bias too. It does not report news items in an impartial way, even some of its programs and dramas have a left wing bias. So if you agree, especially you 17m plus leavers, support this petition to scrap the BBC TV licence fee and make the BBC a commercial enterprise.",
