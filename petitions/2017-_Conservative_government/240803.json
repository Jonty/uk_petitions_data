        "additional_details": "The initial Brexit referendum was a simple question with a very complex outcome. No one really understood what Brexit would mean. Almost everyone had an opinion on what they hoped it would be, but no one had any real certainty about a definitive outcome.\r\nIt has become very apparent that the referendum was not honest and open about the impact Brexit would have on everyone in the UK.\r\nNow we have a definition or Brexit, we should be able to vote as a Nation to decide if this deal is right for us.",
        "background": "The UK voted for Brexit without understanding what it would mean for themselves personally, or the Country as a whole.\r\nNow the UK know what the deal entails, and the public have a better understanding of the impact, I believe the public should vote either for, or against this deal.",
