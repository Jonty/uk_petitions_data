I believe this is very unfair and think it should be more standardised across the UK. I would like to push for all sudden infant deaths that do not have enough evidence to establish a cause to be classed as 'SUDI' (Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy).",

However in other almost identical cases parent's received a very different verdict.Unlike myself, many were also not made to attend the inquest.",
