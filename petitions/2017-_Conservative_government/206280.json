        "additional_details": "According to Kelly (2014), the average house in Oxford costs 14.9 times the city's average salary. \r\nA large number of OUH staff had to move further away from the city to avoid costs, and face petrol and traveling financial demands.\r\nThe remaining staff lives closer to the Hospitals, due to lack of cars, and are struggling to afford rent in the city, where houses do not match the price tag they are given, and many of them are forced to resort to Hospital accommodations, that are far from ideal.",
        "background": "Unlike London, housing cost is not weighed in when attributing salaries, and the OUH is suffering with recruitment and retaining staff, due to the financial demand of the city.",
