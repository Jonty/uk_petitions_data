        "additional_details": "ticket prices bewilder me I see young students having to pay fees of \u00a322 just to receive free education. To make this worse, say one day they don't manage to afford this, say there weekend job (under 18 minimum wage = \u00a34.20) was cancelled and they weren't able to get the money. They bunk the train and end up with a rapidly increasing \u00a320 fine and possibly a criminal record. \r\nI am not saying travel should be free however the rates that they charge are unacceptable for both adults and children",
        "background": "South Western Railway took over South West Trains on august 20th 2017. Since they took over there have been an increase in delay, cancelation and length of delay and on top of this ticket prices have increased!",
