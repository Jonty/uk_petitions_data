        "additional_details": "Reasons why this job need a to be better paid: \r\n \r\n1) High Demand with aging population still growing (over 74 million by 2039). \r\n2) Under-staffing is a huge issue, and higher wage will attract more workers. \r\n3) Workers will stay longer, as many see that this strenuous job isn't worth the stress for the little amount of money in return. \r\n4) Healthcare/Care assistants are essential in order to encourage independence and protect dignity, which is very important to empower the elderly to those who need that extra care.\r\n \r\nThe Government should provide funding so that local authorities and other providers can increase wages.",
        "background": "Currently becoming an assistant within a care/residential health and social care setting, only earns around minimum wage. Even though you need many humane skills to do this hard job e.g. ability to be Compassionate, Communication Skills, Commitment, and most importantly empathy and lots of patience.",
