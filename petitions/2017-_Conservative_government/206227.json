        "action": "Amend the Dangerous Wild Animals Act to Exotic and Dangerous Wild Animals Act",
        "additional_details": "Buying without researching care needs of specific animals is especially damaging to reptiles which suffer from ailments, like metabolic bone disease, as a result of improper husbandry. Introducing a license for exotic pet ownership should encourage people buying to understand the commitment they are undertaking, particularly if paired with expert consultation at the time of license purchase. The \"EDWA\" should also aim to hold accountable those involved in crimes against the Animal Welfare Act.",
        "background": "Amend the DWA, making it a legal obligation to possess a license for ownership of any wild or non-native species; preventing whimsical buying of animals with specialist care needs to safeguard animal welfare.",
