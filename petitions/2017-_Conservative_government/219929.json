        "additional_details": "Unelected as they are, they're still an essential part of the 3 pillars of State, in holding the executive to account.\r\n\r\nThe Lords has many experts in many fields.... to be an MP or part of the executive, you need NO qualifications, even to hold one of the great offices of State.... maybe the old school tie perhaps.\r\n\r\nUnelected they do not fall foul of the virus that is populism which is what led to the rise of fascism in the 1930's\r\n\r\nThey are thus indispensable.",
