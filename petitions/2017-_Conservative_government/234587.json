        "additional_details": "Most research suggests this would be the least damaging form of Brexit. The government's own impact assessment found the Norway option would be the least damaging option in terms of economic harm. \r\nBritain would retain full single market access,it wouldn't be forced to sign up to some of the EU's more contentious policies.\r\nDuring the 2016 referendum Scotland, Northern Ireland and Gibraltar voted to remain. \r\nThis is the most fair outcome as the UK is still leaving the EU yet keeping access.",
        "background": "The Norway model includes two European organizations.The European Free Trade Association(EFTA) and European Economic Area (EEA)\r\nUK would leave the EU, join EFTA, and become a full member of the EEA.",
