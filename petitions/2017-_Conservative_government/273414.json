        "additional_details": "In 2017, following the largest ever democratic mandate to leave the European Union, MP\u2019s voted to trigger article 50 by 498 votes to 114, a huge majority. Article 50 put into UK law that the United Kingdom would leave the EU on 29th March 2019 ***\u201cwith or without a deal\u201d***.\r\nParliament has now taken away the option for the PM to leave \u201cwithout a deal\u201d in direct contravention of the provisions of article 50 and the EU Withdrawal Act 2018. This ties his hands and removes his negotiating leverage.",
        "background": "Since June 23rd 2016, parliament has shown itself to be utterly incapable of delivering on the will of the British people and is now in paralysis. The only fair solution now is to put it back to the people in a Gen. Election to decide who they want to send to the EU as PM on our behalf to negotiate.",
