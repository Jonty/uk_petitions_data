        "additional_details": "Plastic coating on advertising leaflets is the norm, which contributes to the depletion of global resources, the deterioration of our planet, and the destruction of animal habitat's and their lives. \r\nThese leaflets are non-recyclable, meaning they end up being thrown \"away\". Both production and disposal of these marketing instruments are contributing to global warming, and ultimately the destruction of our planet. \r\nCompanies should be prompted to switch to recycled paper, or FSC paper.",
        "background": "Over the past 4 months, I have been collecting all advertising leaflets that find their way into my mailbox. Over 55 leaflets from big  and small companies, and only 3 of them I was able to recycle. The rest were all printed on paper, coated with plastic, making them non-recyclable.",
