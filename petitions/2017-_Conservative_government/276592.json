Recent research (April 2018) conducted by BMG Research for the Food Standards Agency showed this policy would have broad support from English businesses \"77% of  businesses would support the introduction of compulsory display with 55% agreeing that compulsory display would be \u2018a very good thing\u2019 and a further 22% agreeing that it was \u2018a fairly good thing\u2019.\" Section 4.12.2 of http://bit.ly/BMGFHRS",
        "background": "Many businesses still don't take food hygiene seriously enough as they can hide a poor score and wait to be re-checked. Make businesses in England display their rating in a prominent position, both in-store, on advertising and online.",
