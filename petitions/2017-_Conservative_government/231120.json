        "additional_details": "When the UK electorate has a referendum, the decision has been passed to the electorate, the decision does not belong to the Government. It does not make sense for the Government to campaign for or against a particular outcome. They should attempt to remain neutral. Please note that I am referring to the Government and its Ministers, not MP's.",
        "background": "It is my view that campaigning by Government Ministers during the previous EU referendum was counter-productive. I would like you to create legislation preventing the government and its ministers campaigning for or against a particular outcome during a referendum.",
