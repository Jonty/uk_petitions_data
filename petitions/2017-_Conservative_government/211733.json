        "additional_details": "The smells that are emitted from the majority of urinals are awful. In addition, spare a thought for the cleaners. Also, banning the use of urinals would save an enormous quantity of water as the urinals typically flush automatically even when they are not being used. The time has come to provide equality for men and give us some privacy.",
        "background": "Women are able to urinate in private so why are men men expected to use urinals?  Yes, cubicles are also provided in most cases but they are typically being used by somebody that needs to do the alternative.  Men are under pressure to urinate next to another man despite the privacy concern.",
