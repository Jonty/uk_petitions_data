        "additional_details": "The English FA mounted an unsuccessful bid to host the recent 2018 World Cup that was awarded to Russia. Whilst there is no doubt that England has the footballing infrastructure to host the tournament the world cup has of course been held in England once before in 1966 and a joint British bid would be something new with the added dimensions of all home nations then qualifying as hosts. As well as Wembley and other English stadia games could be played at Principality and Hampden Park.",
        "background": "Britain has shown itself to be a nation that unites when it comes to sport. In these somewhat divided times a post-Brexit United Kingdom will need to find ways to unite us all and demonstrate that we are outward facing nation. What better way that a joint bid to host the football World Cup?",
