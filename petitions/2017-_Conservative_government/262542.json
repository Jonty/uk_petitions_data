This can lead to employment of people who do not understand the care needs and ethics involved in supporting vulnerable people. DBS checks are a legal requirement but this is not a measure of an employee\u2019s values or morals. Making care work a professional career where a person must hold a high level of qualification can reduce the abuse of the UK\u2019s vulnerable people.",
