Addicts are unsupported, driven to use stronger versions of their drugs and not knowing if it is cut with harmful chemicals. \r\nLegislation would allow drugs to be controlled,  user would know they are buying pure substances.  Strength can be controlled and help can be provided to curb addiction. Drug related crime and gangs will disappear overnight.  And tax revenues would easily cover the NHS fund gap",
