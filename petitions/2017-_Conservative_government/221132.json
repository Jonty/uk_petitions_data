        "additional_details": "The aims of this petition are;\r\n\r\na) Stop double charging by allowing daily tax calculation on top of yearly, 6 monthly and monthly. \r\nb) Make car buying and selling easier for members of public by allowing grace period until end of day because previous owner will have paid tax for that day.\r\nc) More accurate charging period where owners don't have to pay for full month if they sell, cancel or SORN their car tax.\r\n\r\nCloud computing brings charging per second, why can't we do it in real world case.",
        "background": "Vehicle road tax is charged monthly, 6 monthly or yearly. If you purchase a car on 31st you have to tax for last 30 days that you did not use and someone else had paid for that time so essentially double charging consumers. At time of sale/ cancellation vehicle should remain taxed until end of day.",
