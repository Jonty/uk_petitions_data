        "action": "Make it a specific criminal offence to busk with a dog in a public place",
        "additional_details": "This is a lucrative business involving long hours for the dogs lying on hot pavements in the Summer without water or shade. Dogs are allegedly deprived of water to prevent them urinating (an old circus trick for performing animals). Dogs are transported for hundreds of miles between UK Cities to maximise their earning potential. Legislation is now vital to support the Animal Welfare Act by creating a new specific offence with strong deterrent penalties and increasing the powers of the police to seize animals where there is evidence of cruelty and exploitation.",
        "background": "The use of Busker dogs is a growing problem. Those individuals involved take up prime positions in tourist locations where they charge for pictures and solicit donations.",
