        "additional_details": "With towns struggling and the death of the high street you would think that attracting business would be a top priority for councils. Motorhomers & campervanners are dependent upon a support network of local shops, towns and cities to facilitate their travels & provide the basic essentials required for their travels.\r\nWe feel it\u2019s high time that the government had a review of policy regarding the whole motorhome parking issue! Closing off areas and adding barriers is not good enough anymore.",
        "background": "As a keen campervanner and huge lover of the UK we are shocked at the current policy that appears to alienate our community from exploring not only the country we love but the country we contribute towards and consider ourselves guardians there of.",
