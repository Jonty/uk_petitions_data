        "additional_details": "All we have to do is google how much of a mess this is and what the world thinks of us. Look at the state of our streets. Our NHS, our Police Force, our homeless, our relations with the rest of the world. \r\nThese people have stopped caring about the people who they are supposed to help and only bothered about arguing to distract us from the mess they are making.\r\nI believe if The Queen fired them all and started again with an entire new Parliament one that fought for us we can help the UK again.",
        "background": "Due to the recent mess of Brexit. Many scandals with these people who are supposed to fight for what the people want. It has become clear they are only bothered about lining there own pockets. They sleep at work. Lie to the public with every election. Steel with expenses. Make a laughing stock of UK",
