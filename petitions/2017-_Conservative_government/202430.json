On his death certificate, his cause of death was written as 'road traffic accident' by medical professionals and signed. It's now also been proven I suffered placenta abruption as a result of the impact of the crash on my bump. If he was 1 day old or 1 week old the driver could be charged! My son had his whole life ahead of him and will never get justice!",

People who cause road traffic accidents that kill babies in the womb can\u2019t be charged with \u201cdeath by dangerous driving\u201d as in the eyes of the law a baby in the womb is not a person.",
