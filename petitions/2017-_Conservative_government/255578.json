        "additional_details": "Multiple reports, citing several sources, illustrate the electorate were deceived and misled and, more alarmingly, that the Leave campaign broke electoral law - https://ind.pn/2Eg1frj (Independent); https://bit.ly/2qSzBIC (Channel 4); https://bit.ly/2U6C95M (The Guardian); https://bbc.in/2mp8L8C (BBC).\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the Conservatives have lacked leadership, avoided clarity, and blundered forward on a 37.5% mandate, lowering the quality of life for many within the UK in the process.",
        "background": "The first referendum is tainted by reasonable claims of deception, questionable funding, and misinformation; voting was ill-conceived and has left regions divided; no clear plan has attracted support from Parliament or the public; we suffer while an inept leadership stagnates.",
