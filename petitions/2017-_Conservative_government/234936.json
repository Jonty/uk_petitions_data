        "action": "Change the rules of vaccines being  essential to get a dog breeding license.",
        "additional_details": "Lepto 4 vaccine in particular has caused so many adverse reactions, and so many deaths in puppies and adult dogs. Even Lepto 2 vaccine has caused problems too. \r\nLeptospirosis is so rare, its just not worth taking the risk, especially as it can be treated with antibiotics. Breeders should be allowed to decide whether or not to vaccinate. Why should we risk our dogs lives just to get a dog breeding license? These rules need to be assessed and hopefully the guidelines can be changed regarding this.",
        "background": "This petition is for those reputable/hobby breeders that need to get the new dog breeding license, but don\u2019t vaccinate their pets annually, and don\u2019t vaccinate with Leptospirosis, due to adverse reactions that this vaccine can cause. Over vaccinating (annually) can also causes health problems.",
