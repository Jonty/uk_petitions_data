        "additional_details": "Whilst not expecting to pay less for services received and taking in to account the Management Fee I pay more per year than similar properties. If my Council Tax Band was reduced by 1 from D to C this would almost cover the cost of the Management Fee.\r\nShipston-on-Stour Council Tax for Band D is \u00a31,906.82 and Band C is \u00a31,694.95 for FY 19/20. The estate management fee is \u00a3275.00.\r\nLowering the Band from D to C would still require those in the new Band C houses \u00a363.13 a year than similar Band D houses",
        "background": "When setting Council Tax Bands the VOA do not consider that some occupiers pay a management fee for services normally provided by Local Councils. These occupiers both have a lesser drain on Council resource yet pay more than older, similarly sized 'reference' properties.",
