Please sign this petition in the hope that something changes to ensure our taxi drivers/family members are safe.",

You can find them using the following website:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apccs.police.uk/find-your-pcc/\r\n\r\nYou could also start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n"
