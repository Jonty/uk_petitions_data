        "additional_details": "A (marginal) carbon tax would be an ideal solution to the giant problem that is climate change. Unlike most other solutions, the bill wouldn\u2019t end up at the lower- and middle class, but at the place where it ought to be, namely the polluting industry. The measure would be as simple as it would be effective: the polluter pays. A marginal carbon tax would mean that the most polluting companies pay relatively more, which is only fair, as they are responsible for this atrocity.",

If we don't take more action, we will soon hit the 2 degrees threshold, bringing devastation and havoc to the whole world. To effectively fight this huge problem, the government must introduce a (marginal) carbon tax.",
