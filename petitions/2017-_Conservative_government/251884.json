        "action": "The UK government must enforce a (marginal) carbon tax to fight climate change.",
        "additional_details": "A (marginal) carbon tax would be an ideal solution to the giant problem that is climate change. Unlike most other solutions, the bill wouldn\u2019t end up at the lower- and middle class, but at the place where it ought to be, namely the polluting industry. The measure would be as simple as it would be effective: the polluter pays. A marginal carbon tax would mean that the most polluting companies pay relatively more, which is only fair, as they are responsible for this atrocity.",
        "background": "Climate change is undoubtedly one of the biggest problems we face today! If we don't take more action, we will soon hit the 2 degrees threshold, bringing devastation and havoc to the whole world. To effectively fight this huge problem, the government must introduce a (marginal) carbon tax.",
