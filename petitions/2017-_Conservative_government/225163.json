        "additional_details": "Also, some young people, especially those who have come through the care system or who can't live in their parent's home, are finding it impossible to live independently on such a derisory income. The cost of living isn\u2019t reduced due to age, so why are our wages?",
        "background": "Just as inequality, if pay between men and women is now considered unacceptable for the same employment, paying people less purely on the basis of age when carrying out the same duties is exploitation-this also leads to employers preferentially recruiting under 18s to avoid supplying sufficient pay.",
