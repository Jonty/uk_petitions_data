        "additional_details": "The Conservative government's policy is supposedly to prevent electoral fraud, yet there was only one instance of this last year. Furthermore, the Bill would make it illegal to cast a proxy ballot on behalf of more than two voters, and for political parties to \"harvest\" postal ballot papers to deliver them to polling stations.11 million people do not have a passport or drivers license.This is blatant voter suppression which would unfairly increase Conservative representation.",
        "background": "The Conservative government have announced the introduction of voter ID laws (The Electoral Integrity Bill) before a ballot is cast in UK elections. This policy will suppress the vote, particularly in BAME and poorer communities where voter ID is less accessible. This policy cannot be introduced.",
