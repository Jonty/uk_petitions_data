        "additional_details": "Islamic tradition holds that when the Prophet Job's faith was tested, his wife grew frustrated at all her husband was suffering and openly lamented God's cruelty. In his anger and invoking God's name, Job vowed that were he to recover he would strike her a hundred sticks. Recover Job did, but was filled with regret. God was not unaware and instructed that Job should gather and tie together a hundred sticks, tap his wife with the bundle, and so fulfil the promise whilst also preserving his union.",
        "background": "Three years ago, we held a referendum on whether to leave the EU or remain as a member. The people received a promise that their choice would be implemented, and so it must be. But no-one promised that it would be forever, or even a year. Technically, we could leave one day and rejoin the very next.",
