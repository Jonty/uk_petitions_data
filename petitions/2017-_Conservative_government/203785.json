        "additional_details": "We should choose 22 June, the day when the MV Empire Windrush docked at Tilbury in 1948: a powerful and iconic symbol of the rise of modern-day multicultural Britain. The Windrush is not simply a symbol of the 492 Caribbean men and women who arrived on that ship \u2013 the first big group of postwar immigrants from the West Indies \u2013 but of everyone who came from the Empire; British subjects who saw Britain as their mother country. The seeds of modern \u00admigration were sown in these former colonies, from which 2.5 million men and women \u00advolunteered to fight fascism \u00adduring the second world war.",
