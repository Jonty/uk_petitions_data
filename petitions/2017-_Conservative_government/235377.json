        "additional_details": "The construction of warships & minesweepers for the Navy and support ships for the RFA should allow a thriving shipbuilding industry in the UK. But the Govt applies a narrow definition of what constitutes a warship, recently 3 RFA ships were built in S Korea, 3 more ships have been put out to international tender. V few other countries will allow their industrial base to be hollowed out like this. Would Spain, Italy, S Korea & Japan build their ships in the UK? The ships must be built in the UK",
        "background": "The Government has put construction of the new RFA support ships out to International tender. Under EU article 346, warships are exempt from international tender, but the UK doesn't apply this to RFA ships. Other countries do apply this exemption and support their industrial base. So should the UK",
