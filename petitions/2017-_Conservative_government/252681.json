This will enable few people like me who have worked hard in UK continuously for 5 or 6(if initially came on ICT short term for a year) years to switch to ILR.",
        "background": "As per the current rules, Tier 2 ICT Visa holders which was issued before April 2010 are eligible for ILR. Like me there are few people who are going to complete 5 years by Jan 2020. Since we applied after 2010 we are not able to apply for ILR.",
