Every day,  we  wonder if  today will be the day we get the dreaded  call  . Every day, we support our  loved one to  go back out there and do a difficult job with pride and confidence.    We see at first hand how that confidence has been eroded by   government policy and we ask Parliament to  begin to  right this injustice",
