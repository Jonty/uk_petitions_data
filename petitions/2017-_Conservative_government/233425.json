Especially over the last few years this number has increased significantly and it was only yesterday that someone lost their life on this Bridge. \r\n\r\nI am hoping with all your support that this issue could be addressed by the government and a metal safety barrier be constructed on the bridge to prevent anymore suicides occurring. \r\n\r\nAll support will be greatly appreciated.",
