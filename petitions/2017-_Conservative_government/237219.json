You can find out how to report them to trading standards here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/get-more-help/report-to-trading-standards/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to require all food and drink to be labelled as vegan, vegetarian or containing meat, if that's something that you'd like to happen.
