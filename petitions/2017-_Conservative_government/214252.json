        "action": "stop social services forcefully adopting children out without a real reason!!!",
        "additional_details": "- social workers,CAFCASS or professionals have told the courts lies just to obtain an order to kidnap or snatch innocent children \r\n\r\n- 20 cases out of 10000 are won by parents against social services within the family courts per year\r\n\r\n-it appears that perverting the court of justice is NOT a crime anymore as no action is taken against the daily corruption within the secret courts. This is sending out the message that justice no longer stands in the uk \r\n\r\n-authorities have targets to meet !!!",
        "background": "social services need stopping from taking innocent children just for a bonus, myself and thousands of other families are having to deal with these monsters and they take children with the excuse of \"future emotional harm\" they need stopping and they should only go to families that actually need help",
