I think we really need to consider a fairer, more compassionate way of enjoying fireworks. The main attraction is surely watching them, not listening to them? I would like to campaign for following in the footsteps of a town in Italy, Collecchio, who made a law that fireworks in their town must be silent. It's a way of reducing the stress that the loud noises cause to animals\u2013not just pets, but wildlife, as well. This would mean we would not have to rely on organised firework displays to keep noise to a minimum.",
