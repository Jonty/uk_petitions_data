        "additional_details": "During each year of study, students receive 3 main holidays, this includes 3-4 weeks at Christmas and Easter and almost 3 months summer holiday. It is not uncommon to need health treatment during these periods, however, receiving the care needed can be a nightmare!\r\n\r\nNot all GPs offer temporary registration, imagine the hassle of constantly having to re-register between two GPs. This also causes unnecessary inconvenience for GPs who constantly have to send patients files and data back and forth.",
        "background": "Currently in the UK, you can only register to one GP (General Practitioner) at a time. People tend to register to the one nearest to their home address, but what if you're constantly going back and forth between two addresses? This is a problem students studying away from home have to face.",
