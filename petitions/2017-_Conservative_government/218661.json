        "additional_details": "1 in 4 British people suffer from mental health problems, and depression is 10x more widespread than it was just a decade ago (demonstrating its alarming growth under societal changes). 85% of adults experience stress on a regular basis; a cause of anxiety, depression, panic attacks and insomnia. Suicide is the biggest cause of death in men betweeh 20 - 49. And LGBT people are more likely to experience mental health problems, and less likely to have support systems.",
        "background": "At 8 years-old I lost my mum to cancer, and I'd never dealt with it until 20 years later, because I wasn't equipped with adequate coping mechanisms. Children everywhere are unequipped to deal with trauma they experience on a daily basis, and the stress of later life, I'd like to change that.",
