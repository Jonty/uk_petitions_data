        "additional_details": "There were 39,818 knife crime offences in the UK in 2018. The sentencing guidelines begin at 6 months imprison. This is not the deterrent that is needed. If the minimum for just being caught in possession of a knife in a public place was raised to 10 years, this would begin to halt the sharp rise in people losing their life to a knife. \r\n\r\nIf it means 100's of people to be sent to prison for the message across that's fine. How many lives need to be lost before the power balance shifts back",
        "background": "Knife crime in the UK has now reach epidemic status. Every day someone is stabbed, seriously injured or killed. The current sentencing level is inefficient. \r\nA minimum sentence of 10 years should be in place for carrying a knife in a public that will be more of a deterrent than the current 4 months",
