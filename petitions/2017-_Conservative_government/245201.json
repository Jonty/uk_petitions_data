        "additional_details": "Recently I received this information from the government which leaves me with an area of uncertainty that as a parent I am uncomfortable with:\r\n\r\n'While PE is a compulsory subject at all four key stages in maintained schools, it is not compulsory within academies.' \r\n\r\nGiven the increase in childhood obesity, type two diabetes, the governments push on exercise and the increase in sports funding given to schools to increase the provision of physical education. I feel that we have to stand up for our children now before it's too late!",
        "background": "PE has been a compulsory part of the national curriculum since 1994 but times are changing, and it's now time to act! Exercise has long been associated with both physical and mental wellbeing. It is our responsibility to ensure future well-being of our children by keeping PE alive at all keystages!",
