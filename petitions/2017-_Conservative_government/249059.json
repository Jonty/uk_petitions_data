The government trusted the public once to advise them, and now refuses to seek advice on how to end this stagnation.\r\nFurther, there are young people who are now eligible to vote who were not in 2016. This result impacts their future, and they never got a say.\r\nIf the public now want the \u2018agree to agree until we can agree better\u2019 deal, or wish to leave without a deal, or if they wish to revoke article 50, they should be heard.",

No one planned for leave to win, and nothing has been achieved in 1000 days. The public should have the right, now that they are informed, to have their say.",
