        "action": "For the introduction of non-lethal means of control of the Otter (Lutra- lutra)",
        "additional_details": "Evidence shows  with some certain  fish species, their populations have been reduced dramatically to the point of collapse, the rivers Kennet, Great Ouse, Teme, Bristol Avon, Cherwell, Dorset Stour and Thames are good examples of the otters effect on the local environment of these rivers. Many commercial fisheries and fish farms are regularly invaded by the otter with the negative effect of costly indiscriminate fish kills, many fisheries are now ring fenced to keep this predator at bay.",
        "background": "Since its assisted re-introduction to the freshwater waterways of the UK, the otter has reached levels of increased population on lakes, canals and rivers where its presence has become a detriment to the riverine environment affecting most fish species and birds and mammals.",
