        "additional_details": "There are more than 4 million hectares of deforestation for cigarette fuels and paper wrapping.\r\n\r\nThis industry kills 7 million people ever year\r\n\r\nSo why can we as humans not recognise that this substance would be better off if completely irradicated. Why is it seen as though the manafacturers care more about their profits than the health of people around the globe. \r\n\r\nAnd unfortunately, \"smoking kills\" just isn't enough.",
        "background": "Ever hour around the world, 800 people die as a result of the most lethal human creation - cigarettes. These small paper rolls kill more people on average around the globe than AK47's\r\n\r\nSo why is it so ironic that countries prohibit smoking in public but still allow toxic tobacco manufacturing ?",
