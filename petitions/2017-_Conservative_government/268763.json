        "additional_details": "Green energy promotion is everywhere due to everyone\u2019s concerns about increases in global warming. The car industry even use it as a selling point. People\u2019s energy consumption at home is improving marginally with the use of led lighting and insulation levels but it would come on leaps if we used photovoltaics for water heating and electric generation. Further rainwater recycling should now be the norm for toilet flushing for example.",
        "background": "Current housing developments are using housing models that include greater levels of insulation to meet energy efficiency but little is being done to promote efficiency in terms of renewable energy and rainwater recycling. I think it should be a pre requisite on medium/large scale domestic housing.",
