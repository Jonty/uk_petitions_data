        "additional_details": "The Government needs to review the current exam system and make changes to improve the mental health of students. \r\nA study from 2017 suggests that the reason suicide rates in young people increase during exam season, and the exams play a big part. Suicide is the result for 14% of deaths for people between the age of 10-19 in the uk and they peak during exam season. Schools don\u2019t provide enough help for people who are struggling and students also get anxiety from the way the exam halls are set causing panic attacks which could affect their overall grade and their well-being. Exams should be set out in a more peaceful way and less pressure should be put on students.",
        "background": "The exam system in schools does not test the knowledge of students, but tests how much they can remember. During this time they can suffer with anxiety and depression because of how much pressure they are under, which can seriously affect their grade, and their overall well-being.",
