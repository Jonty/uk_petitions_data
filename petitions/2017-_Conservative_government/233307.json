        "additional_details": "I am a student and a carer and survive on a small income. Although I was insured, due to the health background history of the pet, they would not pay. I was fortunate enough to have family who helped me out, but I wonder how many other people find themselves struggling to pay such huge vet bills only to find tax is also added. What is the cost to our pets?",
        "background": "A recent visit to the vets saw my dog have to undergo emergency surgery at the cost, all told, of just over \u00a31200.00. When paying the bill I was appalled to see nearly \u00a3180.00 in tax!! Being taxed on your pets welfare is extremely wrong in my eyes.",
