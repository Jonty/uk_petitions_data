        "additional_details": "The reply says that there can be no attempt to reverse the result of a narrowly won, advisory referendum, as it is the will of the people.Yet the will of the people last June overturned a 2015 election and did not deliver a government majority. The petition was not calling for a second referendum on leaving the EU (which would be a third after 1975 and 2016) but a first referendum on the exit deal (it seems pointless to call for a debate on the DeXEUs reading and comprehension skills).",
        "background": "The government\u2019s reply to a petition calling for a referendum on any deal with the European Union misunderstands democracy, a process whereby nothing is set it stone. We want to hear, on behalf of the British people, what parliament thinks democracy is in Britain, and how it will uphold it.",
