        "additional_details": "I believe that this is not positive but unethical and discriminatory. A law supposed to prevent discrimination encourages it, particularly when it comes to employment. Nobody should be at an advantage and nobody should be at a disadvantage due to their ethnicity or any other factor they have no control over. I want the positive action exemption for recruitment and promotion to be removed from the Equality Act.",
