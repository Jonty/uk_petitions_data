        "additional_details": "I personally have witnessed how the difference in minimum wage can affect the way people live their lives. I have seen people have to leave their job and become homeless because they weren't earning enough to keep up with bills and outgoings. It saddens me to see that in the world we live in people are struggling to afford the basic necessities to live, while others doing the same job are more financially stable. And all that separates us is a difference in pay.",
        "background": "I have created this petition to make minimum wage for 18 year old's and over equal. I dont believe it is right that people who are younger should be paid less for doing the same job as someone that is older. At the end of the day the cost of living is still the same so why shouldn't our pay be?",
