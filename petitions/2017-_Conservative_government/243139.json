        "action": "Change current electoral voting ballot papers so to include a 'No Vote' tick box",
        "additional_details": "This ballot paper change is required to give those who are fed up with politics of most parties that seem to have forgotten they are there to represent the people, not there for their own self being, a chance to actually register their displeasure rather than opting for an unwanted 'protest vote' to a lesser party, a spoilt ballot paper or even worse a no show at the polling station. Surely such a vote would help give a clearer democratic graph of the feelings of the electorate of this country.",
        "background": "Due to elected politicians from all parties repeatedly failing to follow views of voters and instead pushing own agendas it is believed that a no vote box should be included on electoral voting ballot paper.",
