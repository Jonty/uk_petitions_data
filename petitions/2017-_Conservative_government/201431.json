        "additional_details": "Our initial campaign commissioned 2 polls:\r\n\r\n\u2022 80% of British parents believe child mental health is a top concern & 79% believe children should be taught about mental health (YouGov)\r\n\u2022 92% of 14-18 y/o think mental health should be taught at school. 65% said lack of knowledge meant they wouldn\u2019t know if they were having issues (Censuswide)\r\n\r\nOver 30 UK clinical psychologists & psychiatrists wrote to the government to make mental health education compulsory (The Times)\r\n\r\nwww.headucationuk.org",
        "background": "Despite increasingly high rates of mental illness in young people, mental health education isn\u2019t compulsory in UK schools. Education is a vital component in increasing knowledge and awareness, encouraging open discussion among young people and giving them the power to ask for help when they need it.",
