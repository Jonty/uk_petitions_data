        "additional_details": "It was when a wheelchair swing was donated to our school I realised how important it is for opportunities like this for disabled learners. A parent was moved to tears as she watched her 18 year old son squealing with delight because he had never been on a swing. This really touched me because as a parent we take for granted these things, which are a part of childhood. Please help to ensure that every child is able to access our parks no matter the disability.",
        "background": "I work with students with profound and complex needs. I despair at the lack of access and leisure activities in our country. Please help to ensure that every child is able to access our parks no matter the disability.",
