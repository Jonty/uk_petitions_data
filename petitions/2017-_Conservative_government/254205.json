        "additional_details": "Possible outcomes could be: The EU will move to remove the backstop. The EU keep asking the UK \"what do you really want?\" - We have given them the answer to that many times: \"remove the backstop\". Another is that we leave on WTO terms & the world's 5th largest economy can once again stand proud, with belief in our country's greatness, it's people, resources & innovation & finally honour the referendum result - by delivering the fantastic possibilities for global & EU trade that we all voted for.",
        "background": "By enacting a prorogation of the current parliament session, all debate will be postponed until after we have left the EU with no deal.This will deliver on the Referendum LEAVE result, and assure the EU that the UK can actually leave without an official deal being ratified.",
