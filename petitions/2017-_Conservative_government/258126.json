        "additional_details": "But where a blood biker or ambulance aren\u2019t available, a hospital trust will have no choice but to use a paid-for taxi. This costs trusts and hospitals hundreds of thousands of pounds per year.\r\nNABB has 27 member groups spread around the country, manned by over 1700 volunteers. In any year they can be called on to transport between 35,000-40,000 emergency blood deliveries.",
        "background": "Delivering emergency blood supplies is a vital part of the NHS yet remarkably it is delivered by a mostly volunteer force, a group of independent local organisations, many represented by the Nationwide Association of Blood Bikers (NABB).",
