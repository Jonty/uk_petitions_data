        "additional_details": "I walked from the UK to the grave of Stockton\u2019s George Hunter in Esquelbecq, France to ensure that his memory was preserved. His story has been a focus of our commemoration in Stockton on tees and a source of immense comfort to his grand daughter. I believe that in the spirit of reconciliation and understanding she, and the families of the other shot at dawn soldiers should receive the medals that their ancestors earned in the conflict.",
        "background": "In 2006 the UK govt granted a pardon to the 306 British soldiers shot at dawn for cowardice or desertion. Whilst that provided some closure for their families, I propose that their living relatives should now receive their service medals as they are as deserving as their fallen comrades.",
