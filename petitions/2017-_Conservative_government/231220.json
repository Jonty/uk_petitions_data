        "action": "Legalise the possession & use of Psilocybin Mushrooms for adults aged 18+.",
        "additional_details": "Psilocybin mushrooms have had documented use by mankind all over the world for hundreds if not thousands of years. They continue to be used today in religious or spiritual ceremony, as medicine or in recreational settings. Their classification as a Class A illegal substance in the UK is ludicrous, myopic and unjust. Consenting adults should be free to use these safe & naturally occurring, native or non-native fungi either as part of a spiritual practice, medicinally or in recreational settings.",
        "background": "Psilocybin mushrooms should not be classified as a Class A illegal drug alongside substances like heroin or cocaine. Studies suggest they are non-addictive, have incredible therapeutic value & have no long-term negative side effects.",
