        "additional_details": "Charities are in place such as PDSA that help owners who can't afford the extravagant fees, but why should animals be subject to the right of free health services.\r\n\r\nI'm sure many people, like myself, would not mind National Insurance being raised by a fraction to cover such a necessary project.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will make law. I propose to call this Freddie's Law.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and help me fight for the Animal Kingdom.",
        "background": "Since 1948 humans have had support of the NHS when injured/in need of medical care. What do animals have? Extortionate Vet fees. There's many cases where animals have died due to not having medical care. Its not fair. If its a matter or life/death, why should humans be any different to animals?",
