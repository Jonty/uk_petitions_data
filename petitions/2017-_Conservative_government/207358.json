        "action": "Maintain freedom of movement for British citizens after the UK leaves the EU",
        "additional_details": "We believe that in a modern democracy the majority cannot take  a fundamental and hard-earned right such as the freedom of movement away from the minority. 17.4 million voters cannot take freedom of movement away from a total of over 50 million British citizens. In this total we also include all those who were below voting age at the date of the referendum, who risk losing their freedom of movement without having had a chance to vote. The UK Government should protect the freedom of its citizens.",
        "background": "After the UK leaves the EU, British citizens should maintain their freedom to move to, work, live and study in EU countries with the current terms and conditions. If this right of the British citizens cannot be guaranteed then, in respect of democracy, the UK should not leave the EU.",
