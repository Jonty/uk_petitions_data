        "action": "Grant the DPS power to fine letting agents who overcharge at end of tenancies",
        "additional_details": "Even if the money does get awarded back to the tenants, no repercussions are taken against the agencies who were trying to overcharge. Due to both no consequences for the agencies and financial circumstances for the tenants, these excessive charges are frequently being accepted. This happens time and time again with student properties and happened to myself in all 3 of the houses I rented whilst at university. It is unacceptable to take advantage of people in vulnerable situations and receive no consequences.",
        "background": "Many letting agents find it acceptable to claim excessive amounts for repairs at the end of a tenancy which aren't carried out. Although the DPS provide protection, the months it often takes to examine cases forces those in vulnerable financial situations to accept the unjustified charges.",
