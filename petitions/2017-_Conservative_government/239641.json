        "action": "Require all secondary schools to make home learning optional",
        "additional_details": "There is a wide range of arguments as to why home learning outside of class should be banned. Students spend long hours in a school environment and need to use even more time outside of the classroom to complete home learning activities. This takes valuable time away, disallowing teenagers to invest in extracurricular hobbies and interests. In addition, long hours of home learning outside of the classroom can easily cause detrimental health impacts on teenagers.",
        "background": "Parliament should require homework and home learning to be optional for secondary school students as it creates additional stress, sleep deprivation and negative health side effects. Furthermore, it takes time away from a teenager's personal development to explore extracurricular hobbies.",
