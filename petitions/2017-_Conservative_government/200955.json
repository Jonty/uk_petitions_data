        "additional_details": "Many mums and teachers I have spoken to, have agreed the school would benefit highly with a zebra crossing put in place outside the school for the children to attend school quickly and more importantly safely. \r\nMany cars have been damaged by irresponsible impatient drivers and also a young boy being knocked down by a car.\r\nI also think many people with older children would feel more comfortable about allowing their children to walk to school if this was to happen, which then may decrease the number of vehicles needing to park around and near to the school.",
        "background": "Moorlands Primary School has always had an issue for children and parents to cross the road safely. Over the past few years of my child attending this school Church End Lane has become a very busy and dangerous road, with drivers excessively speeding and using as a through road.",
