        "additional_details": "Beaches and waterways across the world are marred by plastic waste. A 2015 study published in the Science Mag found that 275 million tons of plastic waste was generated in 2010. Blue Planet II showed the continued degradation of our oceans through plastic pollution. Micro-plastics could cause the \"chemical contamination of large predators\" said Blue Planet's executive producer. Meanwhile countries like Malaysia and Nigeria are left to deal with our rubbish. The UK must urgently limit plastic pollution.",
        "background": "Banning virgin/ non-biodegradable plastics will help curb the waste polluting our planet, endangering ecosystems and reducing human quality of life. The ban would also encourage the re-use and recycling of plastic products. The UK must act to help protect our planet.",
