        "additional_details": "On November 15 MPs voted to reject a clause that would transfer the recognition of animal sentience into UK law post Brexit. The new clause was rejected with a majority of 18 for the Government; 313 against and 295 in favour. \r\n \r\nThe only reasons for not recognising animal sentience are having no prior experience of animals or the wish to exploit them with disregard for their welfare.\r\n\r\nMPs should have the highest regard for other species and recognise their sentience by putting this into law.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, know that animals are sentient beings. Animals can feel pain, hope, fear, contentment, heat and cold. We know this because we are animals, because of the relationships we have with other species and because science tells us so. \r\n\r\nAnimal sentience should be recognised in law.",
