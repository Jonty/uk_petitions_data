        "additional_details": "In multi-billion pound organisations such as fast-food chains and retail stores, young adults work alongside their older colleagues, doing exactly the same jobs, yet they get paid significantly less, so this pay-gap is discriminatory and illogical.\r\n\r\nIf a 19 year old and a 25 year old both work a 30 hour week on minimum wage, the 19 year old will earn approximately \u00a3177, whereas their older counterpart will earn \u00a3234.90. This is a massive difference of just under \u00a358 a week.",
        "background": "A 19 year old and a 25 year old often face the same bills, the same expenses, and the same cost of living as one another. However, a 19 year old is only entitled to a minimum wage of \u00a35.90p/h, whereas a 25 year old is entitled to living wage of \u00a37.83p/h. This is a pay gap of \u00a31.93 every hour.",
