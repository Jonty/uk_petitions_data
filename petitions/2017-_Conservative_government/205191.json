        "action": "Change the law to make it compulsory for all taxis to be fitted with CCTV",
        "additional_details": "Statistics from the Metropolitan Police Service have revealed 126 taxi or private hire drivers were charged with violent or sexual offences in 2015. Furthermore 6 separate councils in the North West of England have granted or renewed permits for more than 300 convicted drivers since 2012. Within these approvals are those committed of sexual offences, indecent exposure, drug dealing, violence and harassment, possession of a fire arm, theft, burglary and criminal damage. This figures show that there needs to be further restrictions, and increased monitoring in place. \r\n \r\nThe privacy of both parties would still be maintained, as conversations would not be recorded, and devices could be deactivated when the driver is not working.",
        "background": "Shops, bars, hospitals, and the majority of public places are fitted with CCTV to maintain public safety.  Introducing cameras into taxis would promote the safety of both the general public and the driver, and decrease the risk of assault, abuse and theft.",
