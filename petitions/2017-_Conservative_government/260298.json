The Committee on Climate Change Report \u201cNet Zero: The UK\u2019s contribution to stopping global warming\u201d dated May 2019 identifies an ambitious but feasible way forward for the UK. Delay is simply not an option; the next decade will be critical if we are to meet the target. By showing leadership the outcomes will be better for the UK and hopefully for the planet.",
