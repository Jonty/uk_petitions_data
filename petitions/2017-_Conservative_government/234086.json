        "additional_details": "When my wife, who is Spanish, and I visit friends and relatives in England, usually in Brighton and London, we use a lot of buses. In Brighton, a network saver costs \u00a34.90 per person per day or \u00a322 for 7 days, which for two pensioners whose friends in the UK travel free is quite a sum.",
        "background": "Many British pensioners resident abroad visiting the UK find public transport prohibitively expensive, as they cannot get bus passes. It seems illogical as we get our pensions and can have Senior Railcards. It would not cost the authorities much as we would use the passes for short periods.",
