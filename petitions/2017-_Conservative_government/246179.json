        "additional_details": "This is a campaign run by and for Sheffielders.\r\nThere are areas of poverty and deprivation in our city that are hit enormously by the roll out of universal credit. People already living in poverty are being pushed into destitution. We are seeing crime rates rise in postcodes adjacent to those which are the largest hit by the Universal Credit rollout.\r\nThe legacy system of benefits is not perfect but it's better to revert to it while a fairer system can be developed.\r\nStop this suffering.",
        "background": "Since the rollout of universal credit we've seen increases in food bank usage, rent and council tax arrears, malnutrition in adults and children, suffering and difficulties for disabled people and older people; we want the rollout urgently stopped for universal credit to be scrapped.",
