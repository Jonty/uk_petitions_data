        "action": "Ban schools from supplying milk cartons with plastic straws.",
        "additional_details": "The children estimate that 1.7 million children have milk each day in Key Stage 1, so approximately 8.5 million straws are discarded each week.  The Government must ban schools from giving children milk with plastic straws, ban local authorities from buying milk with plastic straws, and ensure that all milk supplied to schools meets minimum Eco standards so that no unnecessary plastic, like straws, are used in manufacturing or packaging.",
        "background": "Eco teams from two primary schools in the North West are collaborating to ban plastic straws from school milk after learning about the damage they are causing to our wildlife and habitats.",
