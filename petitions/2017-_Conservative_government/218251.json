        "additional_details": "Already bail with a no study condition is being enforced without proper examination of circumstances and the impact. \r\n\r\nNot only is it wrong from a moral viewpoint but it is also a real concern to disenfranchise a group of already troubled and damaged young people from society, and leaving them open to abuse from gangs, extremism and other exploitation.\r\n\r\nImagine your 16 year old son arriving abroad after years of traumatic travel without language, a carer, money and cultural knowledge.",
        "background": "The Immigration Bail status took effect in January 2018 & replaces other kinds of status & which may prevent vulnerable migrant children & care leavers accessing education\r\n\r\nThis is an abuse of human rights & contrary to Acts relating to welfare, protection & safeguarding of children",
