At 16 you can start a family but can't support them yourselves. What if we did it the other way around? People 50+ aren't as able bodied and fast as a 18yr old, why don't we pay them \u00a35.90 p/h? Because there would be uproar. So why is it okay to pay young people less that \u00a36 p/h when they can learn faster, work longer and need to put a roof over their head like anyone else? It's discrimination.",
        "background": "There is a sever discrepency in the minimum wage for different age groups. The older you get, the higher your wage gets. And this isn't right. I understand the logic of a person 25+ might have more expreiance but a lot of the time you get 18 year olds doing the same job as a 36 year old.",
