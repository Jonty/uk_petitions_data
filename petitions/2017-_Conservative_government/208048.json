        "action": "Introduce compulsory maximum speed limiters on all vehicles driven on UK roads.",
        "additional_details": "Criminals ignore speed limits and we regularly see news reports of police pursuing stolen high performance cars in excess of 100mph with some causing deaths and injuries. It is illegal to drive above the speed limit. Why are cars that can travel over the maximum legal speed limit allowed on our roads? The new range of Ford Fiestas have maximum speeds of between 99 and 121mph (Autocar). I am calling for compulsory top speed  limiters to be fitted to all vehicles used on UK roads to save lives.",
        "background": "Most production cars & motorcycles manufactured today are capable of speeds well in excess of 70 mph with some high performance models able to reach up to 155mph.",
