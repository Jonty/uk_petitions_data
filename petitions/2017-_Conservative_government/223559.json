        "action": "Require all schools to provide a trouser alternative during summer periods.",
        "additional_details": "Many schools throughout the country simply do not provide students with uniform alternatives for hotter weather periods, as a result thousands of students find it particularly hard to concentrate are learn effectively during their academic experience. Being forced to overheat due to schools not providing cooler uniform alternatives is patently absurd - as such, all schools most make a summer suitable uniform for their students.",
        "background": "All schools should be legally obliged to provide all students with a trouser alternative; although traditionally formal customs be respected, it is ridiculous that many individuals are not provided with alternative uniforms options, such as shorts, during hotter summer periods.",
