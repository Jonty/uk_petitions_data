        "additional_details": "Currently the UK buys more fast fashion than Europe (at 26.7kg per person) with over \u00a3140 million worth going to landfill or being burned annually, which is around 300,000 tonnes. The fast fashion industry creates more emissions than international aviation and shipping combined, uses vast amounts of water and creates both chemical and microplastic pollution. The 1p charge would help fund better clothing collection and sorting. Currently, 69% of retailers and suppliers support the charge.",
        "background": "Most people are aware of the detrimental effect that fast fashion has on the environment and how it is contributing to the climate crisis. Fast fashion can also exploit workers; from forced labour for cotton pickers abroad to some garment factories paying less than the minimum wage",
