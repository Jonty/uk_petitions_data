        "additional_details": "In Winslow there is no good exersise for young adults who find the childrens playground, well childish, and s it seems they resort to causing trouble but having a skatepark would stop this issue becuase there is something for them to do. Having a skatepark in winslow will be fun for all ages from little kids on scoters to 19year olsd on bmx's. And i think winslow's happiness overall would benifit from this disicion.",
