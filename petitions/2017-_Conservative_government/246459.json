        "action": "Make declaring all ingredients used in alcoholic drinks mandatory as with food",
        "additional_details": "EU Regulation 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers includes the obligation to provide the list of ingredients and nutrition declaration (the nutrition declaration became applicable on foods in December 2016). Alcoholic beverages containing more than 1.2% by volume of alcohol are exempted from the mandatory listing of ingredients and nutrition declaration. This exemption is dangerous and irresponsible. There is direct threat to life as a result of this.",
        "background": "There is limited legislation in place to ensure alcoholic drinks declare ingredients/allergens on their labels. Ingredients should be clearly marked to avoid anaphlaxic shock & death. Having witnessed the risk I can't stress enough how dangerous this is. Lack of labelling is risking life every day.",
