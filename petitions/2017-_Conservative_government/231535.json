        "action": "Enforce companies to label products and packaging with decomposition dates.",
        "additional_details": "Labelling goods and packaging with decomposition dates would also increase awareness in society and people would make informed environmental choices when buying items. There is plastic everywhere. Take a walk around your local supermarket, or any other shop and observe the masses of plastic that is literally everywhere. Some normal plastic items can take up to 1000 years to decompose. A plastic bottle can take up to 450 years or more. If the government agreed to decomposition date labels on all goods and packaging, it would be a step in the right direction.",
        "background": "I am just an ordinary person who wants to help save our planet from drowning in plastic. If every item and its packaging were labelled with a date showing how much time they would take to decompose, then companies would be forced to re-evaluate their products and packaging.",
