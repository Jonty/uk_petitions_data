The Government needs to provide a targeted financial support programme to local councils to allow reduced hall hire costs to be implemented for indoor physical and sporting activities to alleviate the current general inactivity of our population across all ages. We don't have the best indoor sports facilities in the world but what we do have we need to access at a much more reasonable cost to local communities.",
