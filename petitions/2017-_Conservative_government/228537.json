        "additional_details": "Particular examples include the 2 train lines servicing Essex. The price of a ticket with Greater Anglia is almost double the price of a ticket with C2C and the service on C2C far better. \r\nTo travel anywhere in the country is far cheaper by car than by train and also more direct. We should be encouraging people to travel by public transport so price is the best way of doing this. \r\nNSW in Australia has a great system (every Sunday travel costs just $2.50 anywhere in NSW). This is just one idea.",
        "background": "Compared to Europe, I believe that the price of train tickets in the UK are too high and unfairly priced. It is in our best interests to make train travel cheaper to reduce carbon emissions and ensure that all companies charge the same price for the same distance travelled.",
