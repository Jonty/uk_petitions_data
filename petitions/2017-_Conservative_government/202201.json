        "additional_details": "What I suggest is that the amount of homework aloud to be set is limited per subject.\r\n\r\nIn a half term I believe per subject (Maths,Science, etc) there should be a limit on how much homework can be set that is mandatory to do. If a teacher wants to set more they can make the homework optional.\r\nThe limit I think would work is 5 or less pieces of mandatory homework per half term (Roughly 7 Weeks per half term) in every subject.\r\n\r\nIn France they have got rid of homework and it has worked well.",
        "background": "Mental health problems in younger people is at the most it has ever been, a factor that contributes to this is Homework. Homework if used correctly CAN give benefits but if overused can have negative impacts.\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest a limit on homework to help tackle this issue.",
