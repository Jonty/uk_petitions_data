        "additional_details": "Today households can expect to see council tax rise by as much as 5% in 2019 following the publication of the government's annual local government funding settlement. This move will see average bills go up by \u00a380 a year. So due to council tax rising, we should not be seeing an increase in the level of taxation placed on citizens, with areas such as garden waste fees. The amount it cost to live in society is increasing and the government have the obligation to tackle that issue, not cause it.",
        "background": "The Government have initiated a policy which has placed a fee on the collection of garden waste/ bags, which before were free to homes as they were covered by council tax. The rising level of cost in today's society is already making life hard for working-class people so this is completely unjust.",
