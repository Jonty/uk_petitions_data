We understand that you'd like to see a change in how these conditions are considered, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the NHS describes both as \"long-term conditions\", so we're not sure what else you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fibromyalgia/\r\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ankylosing-spondylitis/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to fund a campaign to raise awareness of the effects of fibromyalgia and ankylosing-spondylitis, if that's what you'd like to happen.
