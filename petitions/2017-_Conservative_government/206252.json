        "background": "It was recently announced that Stamp Duty was abolished for first time buyers on properties up to \u00a3300,000. However, Help to Buy ISA\u2019s only qualify for the bonus on properties up to \u00a3250,000. I feel this qualifying limit should be raised to \u00a3300,000 to be in line with the new Stamp Duty.",
