        "additional_details": "EU passports afford us with quicker airport queues, special EU member state consular assistance in countries where the UK is not represented, and so much more. Most are not able to keep up with brexit issues and many think we left in March, with people already being declined EU benefits by those who think we are out.\r\n\r\nBeing able to carry EU-branded passports means not just following the standards that all member states follow, we are making it better and safer fly British travellers abroad.",
        "background": "Given that we are now likely going to remain as EU members until at least 31 October, it makes sense that we ensure all passports are printed with the 'European Union' writing on it, thus following EU law recommendation.",
