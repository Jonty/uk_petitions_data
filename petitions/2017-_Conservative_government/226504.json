        "additional_details": "For soldiers who were not aware of the army mortgage scheme and missed out when they were serving. Paying out very high rental prices which hinder being able to save for a deposit, especially with the rise of inflation on properties. If veterans have paid their rent in time for 3 or more years and never claimed housing benefit in that time, surely they have proved themselves to the banks?! The bank don\u2019t loose out ever as if the mortgage isn\u2019t paid the house gets repossessed.",
        "background": "To give Iraq or Afghanistan Veterans especially the injured 100%mortgages on an individual basis not a credit score basis. For example; They may have missed a payment on the catalogue and have a bad credit rating for that but never missed a rent payment ever and this doesn\u2019t get taken in to account.",
