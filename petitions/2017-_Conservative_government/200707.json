        "additional_details": "The ordinary British public have had a enough of wishy washy handling of these attacks being told to carry on as normal. How can we? We need to see some action which provides this nation with security. If you can\u2019t intern them due to political correctness then tag them.",
        "background": "Currently it takes 20 agents to follow 1 terrorist suspect. If there are 300 or 5000 or 20000 people of interest in our communities, our agents have to prioritise who to follow, clearly leaving potential huge risks to the British population of more attacks (5 successful attacks since March).",
