        "additional_details": "In 2017, Plan International UK found that 1 in 10 girls or women aged 14 to 21 in Britain cannot afford sanitary towels or tampons.\r\nPeriod Poverty is a massive issue in the UK, and abolishing the 'Tampon Tax' would help to reduce the number of women and girls affected by it. Girls should not be missing school or using unsanitary items such as socks, tissue or newspaper, to avoid bleeding through their clothes.",
        "background": "The 'Tampon Tax' is currently at the lowest rate possible under EU's VAT rules. Once the UK has left the EU, there is an opportunity for the Government to abolish the 'Tampon Tax', therefore taking a step towards eradicating period poverty.",
