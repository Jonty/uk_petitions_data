The government has caused this problem by seriously defunding the NHS in real terms.  The government has given away policy decisions over to people not qualified to make these decisions.  Aside from calling on the health minister and Simon Stevens to resign, this \"government\" should immediately create a public inquest into this ill thought out and dangerous decision.",
        "background": "NHS England have recently banned the treatment of Pectus Excavatum deformities in England putting the physiological and mental health of thousands at risk, and creating a serious public health emergency for some, since the condition is now proven to cause serious impairment of the heart.",
