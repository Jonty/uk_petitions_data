        "additional_details": "Minting a coin to 'celebrate' Britain's exit from the EU is a provocation to remain voters and wholly inappropriate given how the referendum result has divided us. Many people fear leaving the EU and consequences it has for jobs, trade, medicine and food supply chains and Britain's global standing. The wording is also inaccurate, implying being in the EU is incompatible with 'friendship with all nations' and is insulting to remaining members of the European Union, negating its supposed intent.",
