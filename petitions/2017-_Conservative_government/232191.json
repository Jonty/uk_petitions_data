        "additional_details": "I learned about World Wars at school and read about Hitler and the Nazis subsequently. I visited the Meningate and war graves in France and Belgium and paid my respects. But I did not envisage the profound reaction that a recent visit to Auschwitz and Birkenau had on my husband, friends and me. The industrial scale of the genocide was evident before our eyes. Lectures and books cannot fully capture the scale. The past MUST not be forgotten.",
