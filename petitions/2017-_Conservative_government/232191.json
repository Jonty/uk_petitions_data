        "additional_details": "I learned about World Wars at school and read about Hitler and the Nazis subsequently. I visited the Meningate and war graves in France and Belgium and paid my respects. But I did not envisage the profound reaction that a recent visit to Auschwitz and Birkenau had on my husband, friends and me. The industrial scale of the genocide was evident before our eyes. Lectures and books cannot fully capture the scale. The past MUST not be forgotten.",
        "background": "The rise of anti Semitism & apparent devaluing of the armed forces & their role in maintaining our democracy, there are lessons to be learnt by young people ACTUALLY seeing the scale of the horror & to establish a connection between them & the sacrifice and values that helped create modern Britain.",
