        "additional_details": "Vulnerable people can find it difficult to understand their rights and make complaints. Proper regulation would mean that vulnerable people would be protected without having to fight to be treated fairly. I have been discriminated against and there was nothing I could do about it. A housing charity evicted me for not engaging enough, even though I have a severe anxiety disorder and another didn't deal with a complaint fairly and wasn't impartial.",
        "background": "We need a regulatory body to license and oversee hostels and supported housing, including checking that support workers are trained, checking that licence agreements are fair, and offering a fair and impartial complaints procedure. Currently, owners get away with treating vulnerable adults unfairly.",
