        "additional_details": "[A similar petition expires on 22/04. I would like to start a new petition upon its expiry.] The Department for Transport are reviewing urban transport including the laws surrounding e-scooters. This petition highlights the benefits (both to the environment & rider) and popularity of e-scooters. They offer a cleaner & more cost-effective way to travel but users currently risk penalties for use on public highways. I simply ask for equivalent treatment for e-scooters to e-bikes in public.",
        "background": "I would like to help tackle the issue of congestion and pollution with the legalisation of electric scooters. Many cities have legalised the use of e-scooters as they recognise the environmental and consumer benefits. I believe the UK should treat e-scooters in the same way as e-bikes. Adam Norris.",
