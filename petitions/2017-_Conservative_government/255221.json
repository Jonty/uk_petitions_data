        "additional_details": "Foreign workers in Korea usually collect their pension as a lump-sum when they leave Korea. There are currently 45 countries who have agreements with Korea which allow their citizens to do this. The UK does not have an agreement. For this to work, the UK must also allow Korean citizens to take their pension when leaving the UK. An agreement would help country relations as well as finacially benefit the UK citizens returning to the UK.\r\nhttp://english.nps.or.kr/jsppage/english/scheme/scheme_04.jsp",

Some countries such as the US, Canada have an agreement with Korea that allows their citizens to collect their pension when they leave Korea. The UK has no agreement, leaving its citizens unable to collect their pensions.",
