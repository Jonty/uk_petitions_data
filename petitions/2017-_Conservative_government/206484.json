        "additional_details": "In the face of these devastating facts, many people have argued that giving everyone a small, monthly sum of money to cover their basic needs, without any work requirement, would significantly salvage the situation. This is what's called a basic income.\r\n\r\nAll we ask is for parliament to put all the ideas that may help deal with the issues outlined above on the table. That is literally their job. It's what they get paid to do. Ask parliament to debate the basic income.",
        "background": "Britain is the 6th richest country on earth, yet 1/3rd of British children live in poverty. 3.8 million Brits in work live in poverty. A majority of people live paycheck to paycheck. The botched rollout of universal credits made matters worse. It's time for parliament to debate the basic income.",
