        "additional_details": "World Trade Organisation Rules include General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Clause XXIV, 5a, 5b, B3 provide that trade conditions cannot be harsher for UK outside EU than within it, pending a new agreement, sought in good faith, for 10 years or more. We can leave on WTO terms with existing tariff-free trade and customs free access. EU cannot enforce harsher terms without breaking International Law. No Deal is the best Deal. Most EU countries would opt for that too. Why has HMG avoided this?",
        "background": "EU only wants new deals that are worse than remaining. WTO would allow tariff free trade and customs free access for 10 years. UK voted to Leave the EU. MPs must support \u201cNo Deal\u201d. Nobody has yet explained factually why Remain is a good option. Remainers lost the vote because they lost the argument.",
