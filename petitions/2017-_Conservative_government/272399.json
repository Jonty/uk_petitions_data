The referendum question was \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the EU or leave the EU?\". Two choices, one result, no caveat. Current parliamentary action is working in direct conflict with the delivery of the EU referendum result, and therefore is anti-democratic and against all principles of our democracy.",
