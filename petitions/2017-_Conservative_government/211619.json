        "additional_details": "The Government wasted a \u00a3100k grant and even Mary Portas couldn't make a difference to the declining Town Centre. Surely the solution is obvious - get rid of car park charges! It's simply not affordable to just nip into the Town Centre anymore. Make the car parking Free and who knows, people may decide it's worth a trip - if the Town is destroyed, there won't be any income for the Council anyway and they must be losing lots of Business Rates from all of the empty shops. Self-sabotage!",
        "background": "Stockport Town Centre is in decline, largely because of the parking charges. Why pay to park in Stockport when you can go to the Trafford Centre or Handforth Dean for free? The charges are destroying the Town Centre. Even M&S are considering closing their store. We're heading for a ghost town!",
