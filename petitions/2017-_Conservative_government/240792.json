        "action": "No more payments to the EU no more fees no 39 billion no nothing",
        "additional_details": "Legally we owe them nothing and after the way they have been treating us including Tusks recent comment about Brexiteers \"special place in hell\" proves they have no respect for our country and that they deserve nothing from us.  No 39 billion no more fees no nothing.  How they make up the difference is their problem not ours.  That 39 billion plus the savings from paying their fees can be much better spent in this country instead on more important things such as the NHS and police force.",
        "background": "We feel that the EU have done nothing but try to bully us and have shown us no respect for the last 2 years refusing to budge with negotiations and offering no decent compromises.  It is obvious to us that they are making it so hard for us to leave because they want our money.",
