Most of these dogs are not reunited with their families. This should be the responsibility of the owner. Many are not aware dog theft is on the rise in UK by 25% in the last few years.\r\nAdditionally the owner may not be aware they made need to clean up after their dog if they have not seen it fouling the pavement.\r\nIt can also create issues amongst passing dogs if pavements and paths are blocked by another dog that is restrained. As well as those who are fearful of dogs but have no option to approach if the path is blocked by a dog.",
