        "additional_details": "The prospective increase is extremely unfair on prospective migrants (e.g. an applicant applying for leave to enter the UK under the UK Ancestry route with a spouse and two dependent children will need to pay \u00a38,000 up front for Immigration Health Surcharge, which does not include the visa application fee).\r\nThe proposed increase of IHS to \u00a3400 per year is extremely harsh and unfair and should therefore not increased.",
        "background": "The Ministers have made plans to increase the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) for migrants from \u00a3200 per year to \u00a3400 per year. Although, the suggestion is that the increase in the IHS is to reflect the actual cost of such patients to the NHS; the increase seems increasingly unfair on migrants",
