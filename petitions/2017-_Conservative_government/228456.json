        "additional_details": "The NHS should have to buy vegetarian friendly capsules where they are available and must work the drug companies to ensure that all capsules supplied to the NHS are vegetarian friendly. Most vegetarians know that capsules are not vegetarian friendly. So the more people (vegetarians and meat eaters) help to try to fight this change the better it is.",
        "background": "Every time I have to have medication, I have to ask for liquid or tablets. Then when I speak to either doctors or nurses, they moan that \"capsules are cheaper to make.\" If that is the case, change the capsules to vegetarian friendly capsules.",
