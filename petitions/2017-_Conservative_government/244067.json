It estimated young people not being in jobs will cost \u00a328 billion over the next decades. \r\n\r\n\r\nInternationally (such in the USA and Australia), under 16s are allowed to work in a major corporation such as McDonald's) but limited businesses allow under 16s to work for them and lie under principles of unjustified reasons and reasons which do not comply with UK laws.\r\n\r\nWe need to support under 16s into part-time jobs and this must be a foremost priority if the UK is to avoid a lost generation. Not doing anything means an inadequate talent pool for the needs of UK businesses as our economy grows and recovers.",
