        "additional_details": "This will stop slow cyclists impeding the flow of traffic, especially since the 1.5m ruling, and make it safer for cyclists across the country to cycle without worry of being hit by a car or larger vehicle.\r\n\r\nThis will also reduce the amount of cyclists getting injured and reduce the risk of drivers having to live with the guilt of injuring (or worse) erratic cyclists who sway all over the highway.\r\n\r\nAny cyclist not using a cycle path where one is provided should face a fixed penalty fine.",
        "background": "With the rising amount of road users, both cyclist and powered vehicles. We the undersigned would like to see it made mandatory for cyclists to use cycle paths and not the public highway where cycle paths have been made available for them to use.",
