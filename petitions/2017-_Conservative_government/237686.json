        "additional_details": "Firstly, the Mental Health Act 1983 is a piece of legislation from nearly 36 years ago. Awareness, understanding and support has changed vastly in those years, so it's about time legislation did too. \r\n \r\nSecondly, some of the content of the act is simply degrading for victims and sufferers of this condition and other conditions similar to it. There are mentions in the Act to detain individuals experiencing or who have experienced an episode for 6 months. As matter of fact, this makes victims worse.",
        "background": "As someone who has had a range of mental health conditions, I'm taking it upon myself to get legislation updated in line with today\u2019s requirements and to ensure other victims are supported.",
