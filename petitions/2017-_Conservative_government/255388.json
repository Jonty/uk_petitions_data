        "action": "Allow a confirmatory public vote if Parliament agrees the EU leaving conditions",
        "additional_details": "We reject the argument that the public has already spoken, because the conditions were not known at the time of the referendum.  Those who make this argument are not demonstrating a desire to follow the will of the public. We also request that, if the UK is to leave the EU, this occurs in 2020 to provide time for arrangements to be made in the knowledge of the conditions which will exist then.  It will also allow the upcoming elections for EU MPs to take place, necessary if we do remain in EU.",
        "background": "If the public still want to leave the EU the vote will not only confirm this but the Government will have acted responsibly by listening to current public opinion rather than irresponsibly by acting on views given almost three years ago by the voting public, approximately 5% of whom have since died.",
