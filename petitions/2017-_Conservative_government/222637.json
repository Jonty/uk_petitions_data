        "additional_details": "In my opinion, GP's are not educated enough about the severity of asthma and other respiratory conditions such as COPD. Hospital treatments are only temporary such as nebulisers and steroid medication and after this, GP's do not provide the sufficient checks to make sure an \"attack\" does not happen again. Asthma UK and COPD both do fundraising to raise awareness of the severity of both conditions and I feel like the government and the public could do more to help.",
        "background": "As a young person who suffers from severe Asthma, I've only recently started getting the medical treatment i needed after a lifetime of suffering from the condition (17 years). Unfortunately this is the same for many young people and this is something i would like to change.",
