Because the three excluded groups did not all receive support, the petition is relaunched as three separate ones. The issue is urgent because with an unstable Government a new election or referendum may occur at any moment.\r\n\r\nNumbers come from 2014-15 ONS and UN data.

Labour & LibDem policy gives them votes.\r\nEnfranchise them immediately so that all future voting may be more fairly representative.",
