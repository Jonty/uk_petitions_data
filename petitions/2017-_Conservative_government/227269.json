        "action": "Ban the sale of all acid that burns the skin on contact",
        "additional_details": "As a plumber I have used acid before and find it is dangerous even for me to use, even when standing back from it and reaching out to pour it down the drain it can still burn my eyes and face from the fumes. As a result I do not use it for cleaning drains, acid destroys the plug hole and all seals on the pipes. There is no need for it to be used for plumbing. Acids are used in a lot of items from lemons to drain cleaner, however some are diluted and would not cause harm, so i am asking for all acids that burn the skin instantly to be banned outright.",
        "background": "Today I walked into a discount home store and found acid on sale for \u00a31.99. Thousands of lives destroyed for only \u00a31.99.",
