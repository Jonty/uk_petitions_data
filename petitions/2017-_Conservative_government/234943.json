While Parliament remaining in session over Christmas has unwelcome ramifications for support staff, MPs must recognise that it is unacceptable to take holiday leave at such a time. In the manner of a Papal Conclave, it is their duty to commit to reaching a consensus, whatever that looks like, before the current sitting period can end.",

This is despite MPs' individual and collective actions in failing to reach agreement on a course of action over Brexit.",

Recess periods are an opportunity for Members of Parliament to focus on constituency work and to consult constituents on important matters before Parliament. The recess periods are kept under constant review in order to react to any urgent business.\r\n \r\nThe Government remains committed to delivering on the result of the referendum and has already introduced a variety of legislation to facilitate a smooth exit from the European Union. The Government has introduced ten Brexit Bills so far this Parliamentary session, with five having already received Royal Assent.\r\n \r\nThe Prime Minister has secured a deal with the European Commission for the United Kingdom's Exit from the EU. However having listened to the House during the debates on her deal, the Government deferred the vote to allow the Prime Minister time to secure additional reassurance on the backstop. These reasons were set out by the Prime Minister in her statement to the House of Commons on Monday 10 December. The Government has confirmed that House of Commons will return to the meaningful vote debate in the week commencing 7 January and hold the vote the following week.\r\n\r\nLeader of the House of Commons",
