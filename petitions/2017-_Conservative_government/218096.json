        "action": "Mandatory annual testing of Agricultural Trailers with a capacity of 10 tonnes +",
        "additional_details": "The law needs to be changed to impose the mandatory testing of agricultural trailers that can carry a load of ten tonne or over. A professional mechanic should award an approved certificate when the required standard of maintenance has been reached. It should be a criminal offence for anyone not to have a certificate. This will create a policeable system of road safety that protects the operator and other road users.",
        "background": "Since the death of Harry, 19, due to faulty trailer brakes as a harvest worker, we call for mandatory annual trailer maintenance by qualified mechanics. Currently there is no road test for agricultural trailers, leading to many deaths by poorly adjusted and poorly maintained trailers.",
