Our local council is broke after years of Central Government funding cuts.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s time central government stepped in to help \u2013 and we are calling on our representative in Central Government , Richard Drax MP, and his Parliament to find the money to keep it open.  Our children need it, we need it, and society needs it.\r\n\r\nWAVES supports children in Weymouth, Portland, Chickerell, Dorchester and all our neighbouring villages.",
        "background": "WAVES will be expecting to close its doors to the public in late April 2019. The service offers support for children aged 9yrs-19yrs old and their families. They cannot get enough Local Government funding or Grant funding to keep this service going. They need Central Government to help ASAP!",
