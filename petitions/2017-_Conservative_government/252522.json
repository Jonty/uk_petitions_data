        "additional_details": "This petition is calling for a long Brexit delay and a second referendum, clearly the democratic process is failing as parliament last night failed to reach any majority decision. This petition is calling for a referendum, to either leave the EU with no deal at all, leave with membership of EFTA and the EEA or stay in the EU, and asks politicians to lay out explicitly and clearly to the public with no power no mongering, exactly what the pluses and minuses of each of those options are. It\u2019s our country let us decide",
        "background": "Parliament has just voted on eight Brexit options and can\u2019t reach a majority. Put it back to the people, properly educate the people about what the EU does for us, what we pay in, what we don\u2019t pay in, how leaving will affect us TRUTHFULLY,let the people give a majority decision as parliament can\u2019t",
