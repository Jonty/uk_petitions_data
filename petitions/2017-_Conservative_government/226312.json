        "additional_details": "Technology already exists that can break the vicious circle of poverty, give fair access to top quality education and healthcare, and end the exploitation of vulnerable people by unscrupulous business. Instead of trying to fix our broken economy, these technologies could be harnessed to create a new, ethical model that will not favour the rich over the poor or any other group over another.\r\nThe DFFS would lead the country, and the rest of the world, to a fairer, more inclusive model for society.",
        "background": "New technologies could benefit everyone but instead, they are often exploited for maximum corporate profit \r\nThe DFFS should: \r\na) Find and support technologies that can have a revolutionary positive impact on society\r\nb) Champion them to other government departments, the press and business groups",
