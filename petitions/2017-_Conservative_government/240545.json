        "additional_details": "The Government already believe the current system is fit for purpose therefore the traffic light system, as it is called, should not be altered.  The process of fracking is strongly opposed by environmental groups who are of the opinion that the fracking companies have found it \u201cimpossible to frack safely in the UK, and so they want permission to frack unsafely\u201d.  The UK should join other countries such as France, Germany, Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands and many more who have banned fracking .",
        "background": "Caudrilla was forced to pause work at its Blackpool site on several occasions last year after fracking tests triggered earth tremors exceeding 0.5 on the Richter scale. Rural communities and local authorities are saying no to fracking but their voices have been unheeded.",
