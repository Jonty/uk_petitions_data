Britain First is a vile racist party with a long history of extremism and Islamophobia, some of it criminal. \r\n\r\nBan Trump from entering the UK and send a clear message. \r\n\r\nNO to hatred. NO to racism. You are a dangerous incompetent disgrace. You are not welcome here!\r\n\r\nIf Trump was allowed into the country, the ONLY reason should be to charge him with inciting racial hatred.",
