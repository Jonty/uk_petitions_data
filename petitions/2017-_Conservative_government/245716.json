        "additional_details": "Endemic in the UK, with an est. 3,000 new cases a year, Lyme disease can cause tremendous suffering to some patients, each requiring an individualised holistic plan of care which no other specialty can give. Sufferers with ongoing symptoms see multiple inexperienced Doctors, costing the NHS thousands in various wasted appointments/investigations. Many are unable to work fulltime. Referral to a Specialist in the Centre, experienced and trained in Lyme would have the ability to manage all aspects of the disease.",
        "background": "NICE guidelines (2018) suggest to refer complicated Lyme Disease sufferers to a Specialist. Referral is often made to other specialties who do not have the knowledge or experience to manage this debilitating disease of multi-systemic symptoms .",
