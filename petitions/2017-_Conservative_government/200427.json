        "additional_details": "The referendum result should be disregarded as so many people who voted to leave were tricked by the lies of the Brexit camp. So much for democracy if people have been hoodwinked. We need to show the Government that this Brexit disaster is not \"the will of the people\" by calling on them in sufficient numbers to stop it. I don't think enough people realised quite how complicated it would be to leave the EU, so here's a better idea: Stay in. The EU would welcome us back with open arms.",
        "background": "It would be a colossal mistake for the UK to leave the EU. The Government is floundering in the Brexit negotiations and the country would be poorer in every sense outside of the EU. And It would affect young people's lives greatly and this could become Regrexit.",
