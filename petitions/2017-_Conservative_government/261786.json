        "additional_details": "For my family we have been fighting for the correct diagnosis for ten years now and still we are left with no support. With PDA individuals can have better social understanding meaning (girls especially) they don't necessarily meet the criteria for a full autistic diagnosis. My daughter appears to socialise but it's surface socialability. I have been physically, emotionally and mentally abused by my fight for recognition. It should not be a post code lottery on whether or not you get help!",

PDA has been recognised as a form of autism for over 30 years, yet getting a diagnosis through the NHS is a postcode lottery.",
