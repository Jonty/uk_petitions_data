        "additional_details": "Unfortunately there are no charities that provide training of psychiatric assistance dogs currently. This means many people who would benefit from a support dog are unable to receive help- me included.\r\n \r\nHaving a support dog would benefit severe mental health sufferers. Although there are no charities offering these services for mental health I would like to be able to sign my privately trained dog up to be registered with ADUK\r\n \r\nhttp://www.assistancedogs.org.uk/faqs/#haveAssistanceDog (ADUK site)",
        "background": "The ADUK (Assistance Dogs UK) is a voluntary coalition of seven charities. The charities are high in demand. There are long waiting lists and people are not receiving the help fast enough so there should be a registration body where people can sign up their privately trained assistance dog to ADUK",
