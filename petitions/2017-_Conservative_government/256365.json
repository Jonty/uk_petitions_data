        "additional_details": "The amount of people being diagnosed with this disease is rapidly increasing. I feel that we should have more training in place for all areas of the surgery, especially receptionists as it\u2019s the first port of call. There is so much more that needs to be addressed to make life easier for dementia patients, but training would be a good start.",
        "background": "A massive set back in my Nan\u2019s care is the lack of understanding of an already difficult disease. If more people were trained in dealing with dementia patients, it could have a massive impact on carers lives. One wrong word or action can distress a dementia patient for hours & sometimes days/weeks.",
