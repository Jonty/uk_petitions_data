        "action": "Introduce a paid wage for student nurses during placements.",
        "additional_details": "The majority of student nurses cannot work elsewhere part time as this affects the working-time directive and may affect their future loan/grant entitlements. There is a long gap between student loan payments of April - September, but are required to work through summer on a placement and at University. A placement wage should be introduced to support all student nurses who are effectively working a full-time unpaid job on placement. We care, and so should parliament. Support our future nurses.",
        "background": "The Nursing bursary has been scrapped and we now have to rely on maintenance loans & grants through out the year. In some cases, this is not enough for students and their families to live on. We need to bridge the gap between April - September student loan payments too and provide better support.",
