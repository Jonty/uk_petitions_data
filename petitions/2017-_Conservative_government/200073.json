        "additional_details": "Because we didn't use a private clinic or the NHS and we weren't married at the time of conception my partner is unable to go on the birth certificate. She is now having to adopt our baby to get step parent rights instead of full parental rights, which is emotionally costly as well as financially. It now leaves our daughter's future uncertain should anything happen to me. In this day and age a birth certificate should state name of parents instead of gender specification.",
        "background": "My partner and I are in a same-sex relationship and we wanted to have a baby. We couldn't afford private IVF and didn't want to use the NHS money when we could do it ourselves at home using a sperm donor. Baby born, now my partner isn't allowed on birth certificate because we weren't married.",
