        "additional_details": "It should be a better way to keep the traffic slow and steady.\r\nCameras could be installed in 20mph zones to keep the cars slow and steady.\r\nIt should be speed cameras in front of every school and pedestrian crossing as well.\r\nTraffic lights should be better sequenced as well (green wave) to protect that drivers will keep arriving at green lights rather than red ones if they drive within the speed limit",
        "background": "Traffic calming measures might be reducing the chance of an accident, but they increase pollution\r\nCars repeatedly slowing down and speeding up, which almost doubles the amount of harmful gases and particles they emit. Not to mention break dust\r\nGreen wave for drivers driving within the speed limit",
