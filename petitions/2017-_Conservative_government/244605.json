        "action": "Tighten recycling law so rubbish is sorted by material more and treated properly",
        "additional_details": "We should emulate the system in Japan where each household must separate their waste into upwards of 4 different categories of waste material before collection.  This is an inconvenience that some might complain about at first, but it is worthwhile if it means waste will be reduced and repurposed more efficiently.  It also makes it easier for councils to treat materials properly.  We should also widen the deposit return scheme that has produced such amazing results in Germany.",
        "background": "I recently discovered that some councils throw together their recycling rubbish and non-recycling rubbish and treat it all as the latter.  This goes against all the efforts of constituents to recycle and reduce waste.  This should be more tightly controlled or, at least, looked into.",
