        "additional_details": "The effects of fireworks are long standing, I personally have to use sedation on my dogs from weeks up to bonfire night, to months after, as they are terrorised by the loud bangs around the area.\r\n\r\nI am seeing more and more reports of fireworks being thrown at people to cause harm too, which is in effect a terror attack.\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't have to blow things up to celebrate, so please ban these horrible fireworks asap and prevent all of the negative effects that come with them.",
        "background": "Fireworks are not only stressful for pets and wildlife, but an outdated method of celebration that are dangerous and can cause serious harm. Ban them from the UK so we can stop the terror they cause.",
