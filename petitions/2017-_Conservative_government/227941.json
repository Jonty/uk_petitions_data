        "action": "Tax on meat and dairy products to offset the damage caused in their production.",
        "additional_details": "Excessive meat and dairy production damage both health and the environment. We call upon the government to tax their consumption along the lines of tobacco, alcohol and the burning of fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nResearch from the University of Oxford suggests surcharges of 40% on meat and 20% on milk would account for the damage their production causes, and reduce the impact of both emissions and unhealthy consumption. We ask the government to discuss the adoption of a tax at these levels.",
        "background": "According to a news article published in late 2017 the global livestock industry causes 15% of all global greenhouse emissions, furthermore the over consumption of meat in the UK seriously damages health and is associated with hugely elevated heath care costs.",
