        "action": "Let on duty paramedics park anywhere to buy food or use public conveniences.",
        "additional_details": "Paramedics can't always purchase and eat meals at specific times if they are attending a patient. They can't/won't stop CPR for instant at 12.30pm if that is when their official lunch break starts but they still need to eat and drink like everybody else. In busy areas it's often not possible to park near a cafe` or public toilets. Therefore provision needs to be made for the crews to refresh themselves, they provide a vital life saving service.",
        "background": "A recent example of the need for such a law change is the case of a parking attendant who issued a parking ticket to an ambulance crew who had parked on double yellow lines so that they could purchase refreshments. Although the ticket was rescinded this demonstrates the need for such a law change.",
