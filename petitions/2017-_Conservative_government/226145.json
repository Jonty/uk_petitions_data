        "additional_details": "If you wish to see evidence of this, look at the cost of uniform providers such as Just Schoolwear or Schoolwear Solutions for logo items. Then compare to a high street retailer such as George, Tesco or Sainsbury.",
        "background": "Many schools and academies are adding expensive logo trousers, skirts and shirts to their uniforms, for example increasing the cost of school trousers from \u00a34.50 to \u00a319.95. Often the opinions of parents are ignored, and families have to pay these large bills or face having their children excluded.",
