Recently a person lost their finger due to posting a card through a letterbox. Bringing this law in would stop these needless and sometimes life changing injuries. Something needs to be addressed and sooner rather than later. \r\nPlease sign this petition. Thank you.",
        "background": "Dog attacks are on the increase. Many bites happen when items are pushed through letterboxes. I feel it should be the law to either have a box fitted externally, a box fitted internally so a dog can\u2019t get to the letterbox or the dog inaccessible to the back of the front door (behind internal door).",
