        "additional_details": "As mentioned, being in the process of purchasing a house personally for the first time I feel it is unfair that I miss out on the opportunity to avoid stamp duty as a first time buyer because my partner isn't one (she also missed out on the opportunity herself previously). As stated I am proposing that if a couple are purchasing a property and one is a first time buyer I believe Stamp Duty should be halved.",
        "background": "I'm in the process of buying a house with my partner and I'm a first time buyer, she isn't so we have had to pay full stamp duty on the property. I feel as though this is unfair as first time buyers who buy on their own don't pay stamp duty. I would like this to be amended to a reduced rate.",
