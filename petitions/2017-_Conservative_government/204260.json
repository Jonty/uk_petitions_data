        "additional_details": "Interpretation of the referendum result turns entirely on the question of whether the referendum was an advisory one, or if it should be taken as binding.\r\nThe arguments as to it being advisory are powerful: that was what parliament voted for, & the Supreme Court has clearly ruled it as so.\r\n\r\nThe only argument to the contrary is that the government said so.\r\nIn doing so, the government claims sovereignty & supremacy over parliament.\r\n\r\nThat claim cannot be upheld.\r\nParliament must consider the advice.",
        "background": "Brexit is a test of parliament's supremacy over government.\r\n\r\nThe question revolves entirely on whether the referendum was advisory or binding: parliament voted for an advisory referendum whereas the government decreed that it would be binding.\r\n\r\nGovernment is claiming sovereignty over parliament.",
