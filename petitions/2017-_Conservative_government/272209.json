        "additional_details": "There are more undiagnosed learners with developmental language disorder than Autism. High needs funding could be reserved for more severe needs. \r\n\r\nSchools would benefit from expert input on the communication environment, early identification and intervention, a smoother transition from Pre-school NHS speech and school and an improvement of outcomes and behaviour for learners with SEN.",
        "background": "Most children with special educational needs (SEN) will at some point require access to a speech and language therapist. Currently only children with an EHCP are guaranteed this service. By funding a schools universal offer in this way you can save money by reducing the number of EHCP\u2019s needed.",
