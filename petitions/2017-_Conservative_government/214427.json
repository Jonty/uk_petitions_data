        "additional_details": "In 2018 it is unbelievable that not just students, but graduates are forced to work for free for up to a year after graduating if they have selected an arts/fashion based subject. If these individuals do not live in London or have their parents to contribute to their income it can cost \u00a31,019 monthly according to The Sutton Trust. The majority of these companies are worth millions and can afford labour at NMW. These individuals are exploited, with no income and no promise of future employment.",
        "background": "Unpaid Internships are used by companies in the fashion & creative industry that are worth millions. This use of free labour is exploitative. It increases elitism and classism within the chosen roles and does not give everyone a fair chance to pursue their future career.",
