        "additional_details": "We all need to come together and break free of this forbidden love. The income requirement essentially suggests that low income individual are not allowed to fall in love outside of the country. Ain't this country named \" Great Britain\". At least those in a Commonwealth country should be allowed to stay in the UK easily. \r\n\r\nThe minimum income threshold is harder for women than men, especially for those working in places like McDonald's, KFC and as a cleaner. We need to do something to improve this law.",
        "background": "Supreme court justices have unanimously backed Theresa May\u2019s \u201cparticularly harsh\u201d \u00a318,600 minimum income rule for British citizens to bring non-European spouses into Britain that campaigners say has led to tens of thousands of families being separated. Thousands of people are impacted by the rules.",
