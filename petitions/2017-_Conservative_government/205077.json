        "action": "Introduce CPR training to the primary and secondary education curriculum",
        "additional_details": "A cardiac arrest is commonly known as a heart attack - the heart ceases to function which results in loss of blood circulation and oxygen to the brain. CPR refers to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the act of the manual application of chest compressions and ventilations to patients in cardiac arrest, done in an effort to maintain viability until advanced help arrives. \r\n\r\nAlthough this petition calls for Parliament to introduce CPR training to primary and secondary level education curriculum, it also aims to encourage adult CPR training and awareness.",
        "background": "There are approximately 30,000 cases of cardiac arrests each year in the UK. This means that if we introduce CPR training to the National Curriculum, we have the potential to save 7500 lives, as only 8% of out of hospital cardiac arrest cases survive in the UK.",
