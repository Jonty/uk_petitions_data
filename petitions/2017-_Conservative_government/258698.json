There isn't silver bullet to our climate crisis, that\u2019s why the UK must lead to support a circular economy. We can't delay. The Earth won't give us an extension to hit 2030, or 2025 targets. We are sapiens. EarthDayEveryDay for a better planet.",

The Government must lead & incentivise a circular solution now with (1) taxes: on non-recycled packs (2) subsidies: to lower the cost of recycled material.",
