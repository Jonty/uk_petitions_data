        "action": "Ban use of all non-recyclable plastics for packaging in the UK retail market.",
        "additional_details": "The banning of plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds is a great first step, but it does not go nearly far enough.\r\n\r\nIndividuals will recycle plastics, but only if it is simple to do. The current system makes it very confusing with different plastics being recyclable in different places across the UK. The only way to seriously reduce our non-recyclable plastic packaging waste is to not offer it in the first place.\r\n\r\nWe need to become a world leader in our approach to tackling this issue.",
        "background": "The buildup of single-use, non-recyclable plastics is currently one of the biggest problems facing us and our planet. \r\n\r\nThere is only so much people can individually do, governmental intervention is key to reducing the sheer mass of plastic that is building up in our oceans and on our lands.",
