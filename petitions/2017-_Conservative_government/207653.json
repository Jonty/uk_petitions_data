        "additional_details": "Example:\r\n\r\nIf you use a nursery every Monday and that nursery chooses to close on bank holidays, you will still have to pay full fee's on those closed days.  This is true even this year (2017) where Christmas Day falls on Monday. \r\n\r\nIt is completely wrong that nurseries can force parents to pay for childcare when they have CHOSEN to close and are not offering a service. Parents have no option for alternative childcare on these days and many can not afford to pay for it twice..",
        "background": "Nurseries have been forcing parents to pay for childcare on days they are closed.  Many working parents already struggle to afford childcare.  The government should pass legislation to prevent this from happening.  If the nursery is closed, no fees should be charged.",
