        "additional_details": "The government is poised to award the contract to produce the new British blue passport to a european company when the british company which has produced our passports for many years has also bid. This is unacceptable and would not happen in other countries. It also threatens the security of employment of british workers.",
        "background": "If we are to leave the EU and take back control of our destiny then one of the key symbols of britishness is the blue British passport and it should be manufactured in Britain. The passport now contains a significant amount of individual data and that should be protected and not allowed offshore.",
