        "additional_details": "In 2011 a proposed development of housing and a community centre on land now known as College Park in Bideford went to Public Consultation. In this and subsequent evaluations the centre was backed by over 90% of respondents and 1,840 signatures of support were sent to Torridge District Council. Planning permission for The Bridge Centre was gained in 2015 and funding remains in place. However, the land is now destined for the construction of a multi-use games area and a neighbourhood play scheme.",
        "background": "A community centre is urgently needed in Bideford, North Devon. The charity Wings planned to deliver what is now known as 'The Bridge Centre' on S106 land, with funds secured to build a first phase that would include a shop, a bistro and a large community hall suitable for a wide variety of uses.",
