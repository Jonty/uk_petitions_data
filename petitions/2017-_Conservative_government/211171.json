        "additional_details": "By re-introducing a dog licence, you would need to apply PRIOR to adopting or purchasing a dog, thus making it harder to purchase a dog on a whim, as a dog is for life, just like a new born baby, which the birth has to be registered, so should a dog. Dogs require care, walks,feeding, attention, a safe environment, and above all love. \r\nBy making people apply for a licence beforehand and pay would surely make them stop and think and prevention of abandonment and cruelty is far better than a cure",
        "background": "In 1987 they scrapped the dog licence, and brought out the dangerous dogs act instead. However, this doesn\u2019t prevent, owners abandoning a dog after days, weeks , or months as is so often the case, it also doesn\u2019t prevent animal cruelty.",
