        "additional_details": "In the US Military there is Childcare centres provided on many Military installations that are at a reduced cost compared to normal childcare providers. If Military families are unable to get their child a space then they can apply for the Department of Defence child care fee assistance scheme which offers to pay up to $1500 per child per month to offset the difference for civilian childcare. These changes could potentially seriously boost morale, recruitment and retention for the UK Military.",
        "background": "Military families are more often than not stationed very far away from any immediate family and trusted friends and therefore have little to no help with childcare needs. This can force one of the parents to have to give up work in order to care for the children.",
