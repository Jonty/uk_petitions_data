        "additional_details": "Pitbulls and the other dogs which are banned on the danergous dogs act 1991 are not given a fair chance of being legalised within the United Kingdom due to the face people class them as dangerous. I have been around two pitbull's while visiting family in America and they are the softest dogs ever. You are discriminating against the breed when it is in actual fact the owners of the breed who have not brought them up right or abused them which causes them to be aggressive.",
        "background": "The dangerous dog act 1991 has 4 breeds of dogs which are banned in the UK. As the UK tried to ban other breeds such as, Rottweilers, dobermans and staffies etc. It is not the dogs which are dangerous but it is how they are brought up by the owners of the breed.",
