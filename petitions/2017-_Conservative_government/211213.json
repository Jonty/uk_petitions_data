The rule was upheld above my child's safety and my husbands disability. \r\nFundamentally this rule needs to be changed, forcing a disabled parent to travel further so his child can be educated is unacceptable if he can't get there. My child will walk 4 miles a day he is 5yrs old.",
        "background": "We lost our appeal to place our son in the closest school because of class size legislation \r\nHis Dad is disabled and can't walk more than 200 metres and doesn't drive\r\nThe new school is 2 miles away so doesn't qualify for assistance there is no bus service or proper pavement",
