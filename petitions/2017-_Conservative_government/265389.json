        "additional_details": "Currently, any language at GCSE counts towards the EBacc. Sutton Trust research reveals that studying the EBacc can help improve a student\u2019s performance in English and maths. It is the government\u2019s ambition to see 75% of pupils studying the EBacc subject combination at GCSE by 2022, and 90% by 2025 (Department of Education 2019). By introducing the language of the second most common non British nationality in the UK (The Guardian 2018), the government is more likely to realise this ambition.",
        "background": "In order to consider starting any new language GCSE, exam boards require a business case demonstrating a starting entry figure of at least 5000 candidates. Romanian is the second most common non British nationality in the UK with circa 411,000 Romanian residents living in the UK, up 25% on 2016.",
