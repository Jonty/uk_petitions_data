        "background": "Since the referendum 3+ years ago 3.5 percent of the population have come of age to vote.\r\nNone of them have had a say in the future of this nation.\r\nAnd they will have to accept a future they had no say in.\r\nTheir votes count as much as ours.\r\nIf they don't get a say what is democracy?",
