        "additional_details": "Children do not earn a fraction of what adults earn, so why are subjected to the same fees? According to public transport, age 16 is an adult, but legally it is not. So why is public transport allowed to charge children, adult prices just for needing to travel to school, college or work? In many cases children have to pay multiple times what they earn in one hour just to travel to their job! How can young adults be expected to fund anything for themselves when it\u2019s already been spent on travel?",
        "background": "It is unfair for young people under the age of 18, who are legally classified as children, to pay for \u2018adult\u2019 tickets on public transport. For one, they are not adults. Secondly, children do not earn anywhere near what an adult earns.",
