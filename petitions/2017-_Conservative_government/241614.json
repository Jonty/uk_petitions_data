        "action": "Protect the right of UK/EU families to move home to the UK after Brexit",
        "additional_details": "As detailed in the Immigration White Paper, December 2018, the EU spouse of a UK citizen will only be able to move to the UK if the UK partner earns at least \u00a318,600 (more if there are children). Families on lower incomes will be unable to move to the UK. I suggest this infringes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, articles 13 (right to return home) and 16 (protection of family life). This petition calls for existing rights of UK/EU families to move or return to the UK to be protected.",
        "background": "Currently a mixed UK/EU family can move to the UK with no restrictions, because the EU spouse has the right to live in the UK. After Brexit this right will cease, unless the UK spouse earns more than the income threshold. Some UK/EU families will then be unable to move or return to the UK.",
