        "action": "Introduce mandatory drugs testing for all Politicians with results published",
        "additional_details": "These same politicians have brought our drug testing policies for those in many public sector jobs, stating that these jobs are safety critical. In most cases only a couple of lives are on the line, a politician can influence the Country going to war where millions of lives are on the line and so surely their job is more safety critical. There needs to be a random drug testing policy in both houses so that we can be sure leaders are not using drugs whilst criminalising others who do as they do.",
        "background": "Recent revelations in the press have revealed that many politicians have a history of drug use or currently using drugs.These same politicians have had influence in drugs legislation as well as rulings of other professionals and subjecting others to these tests.This is hypocrisy, test Politicians!",
