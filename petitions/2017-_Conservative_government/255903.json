        "additional_details": "PETA statistics show that 82 horses have died in The Grand National alone. Beecher\u2019s Brook is the most dangerous and harmful hurdle in which horses must endure twice during the course of a race.The fence has a drop of 6ft 9 inches, being much more than the initial jump. This means Horses are spooked and either die on the course, or are injured and shot later. Please end these cruel events, starting with The Grand National.",
        "background": "The Grand National is the most notorious event responsible for the cruel treatment of horses every year. The steeplechase events have ditches and fences which they have to navigate while at full speed. If not killed on impact, Horses are shot as they rely on their legs therefore injuries are fatal.",
