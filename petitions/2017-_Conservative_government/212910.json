EVERYONE who goes through that route will or probably will be late for work or their appointments\r\n2. Emergency services get blocked from entry by the large amounts of traffic. Dying? Tough - a boat needs to deliver a few boxes of car parts\r\n3. Pollution - pretty much every car that is on its way home from work will be sat in the same spot with the engine running (unless it's stop start) for a good 20-30 minutes",
