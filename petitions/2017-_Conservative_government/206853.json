        "action": "Invest in gridscale battery storage to stabilise wholesale prices of electricity",
        "additional_details": "On 11th June 2017 a record 70% of the electricity for the UK\u2019s homes and businesses was low-carbon. Solar cuts the power demand for National Grid, reducing prices, while wind power also lowers prices. When renewable supply drops however wholesale prices are being ramped higher. Prices can fluctuate between less than \u00a30 and as much as \u00a383 per MW as seen in May 2017. Battery storage facilities like the new plant seen in South East Australia would resolve this problem and save the consumer money.",
        "background": "Renewable energy supply has succeeded in droping wholesale MW prices into negative but without storage nothing is being done to prevent low supply periods seeing prices hikes as high as \u00a383 per MW as seen in May 2017. A stable grid, means cheaper bills for consumers and a future for energy suppliers",
