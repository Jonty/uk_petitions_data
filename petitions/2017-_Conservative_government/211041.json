        "action": "Remove Carney from the BofE due to his incompatible views on U.K. leaving the EU",
        "additional_details": "Carney is part of the bureaucratic brake trying to stop Brexit. His background is Goldman Sachs whom are making similar noises about Brexit. Carney was appointed by Osbourne, whom got it spectacularly wrong on the Brexit effect. Carney endorsed Osbourne\u2019s view and since then has consistently made negative comments about the UK economy, lack of growth because of Brexit, that the U.K. have a closer relationship with the EU that the U.K. has voted to leave. His position is no longer tenable.",
        "background": "Carney is no longer fit to be governor of the Bank of England. The U.K. is leaving the EU, but Carney continually makes unfounded pro EU statements, thus causing confusion and negativity around the U.K. and potentially undermining trade agreements. We need a governor compatible with the U.K.",
