        "action": "U.K. government to introduce National ID Cards to all legal citizens",
        "additional_details": "The principal objection to ID cards is that they are an infringement of citizen's right to remain anonymous. - this could easily be remedied by legislation under which circumstances an ID card could be requested I.e, voting, by police, claiming benefits or seeking employment. An ID scheme would also be hugely expensive. Estimated at \u00a31 billion - but long term security and savings on crime makes this worthwhile. About 100 countries already have compulsory ID cards. Others have voluntary schemes.",
        "background": "The introduction of a U.K. national ID card has many benefits and few disadvantages. For example: it would improve security, reduce fraudulent claims to U.K. rights and benefits and make it more difficult to carry out other illegal activity. There are few possible reasons for valid objections.",
