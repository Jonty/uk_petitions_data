        "additional_details": "In enacting the European Communities Bill through an ordinary vote in the House of Commons, Heath's Government breached the constitutional convention which requires a prior consultation of the people (either by a general election or a referendum) on any measure involving constitutional change. \r\nWe need a constitution that is not merely convention, but that is actually written into our law to prevent this happening again.",
        "background": "In signing the European Communities Bill in 1972 thus taking us into the EEC without our consent, Edward Heath sacrificed our independence. Thus making the articles on the supremacy of British Parliament only of historical perspective.\r\nHe should've had referendum 1st on such constitutional change",
