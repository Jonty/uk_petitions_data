        "additional_details": "The current proposal of Vattenfall is to build two offshore windfarms, Vanguard and Boreas, trenching 60km across North Norfolk from the fragile and eroding cliffs at Happisburgh to the village of Necton where vast substations are to be built in the fields. The Orsted Hornsea Three trenches from Weybourne will meet and cross over the Vattenfall trenches on their way to connect to the grid at Norwich. These windfarms are not even connecting to their closest connection point!",
        "background": "Currently offshore windfarms dig trenches miles across rural areas and build vast substations in villages to connect their electricity to the grid. An offshore ring main would have just one connection point and one landfall for multiple windfarms saving disruption, destruction and blight.",
