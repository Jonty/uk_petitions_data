        "additional_details": "This is not about withdrawing uniform or policies on acceptable appearance, this is needed. However, Lord Agnew recently presented to MPs in Parliament that the monopoly process of purchasing uniform, often from single suppliers and overtly strict policies is creating a way for schools to deter children from lower income homes and indeed affecting families. Calling the Government to put this to the debate and gather information from MPs and their respective constituencies for a plan of action.",
        "background": "Many schools are adopting overly strict uniform policy forcing parents to buy very often from only one supplier and often over branding even down to socks. This is affecting all families and children, families are getting into debt to afford, and having unnecessarily negative affects on children.",
