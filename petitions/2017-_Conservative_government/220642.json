This shows people are using phone calls less and less so making 24 hour text lines may make more people reach it for help when they need it. Texting is quicker but it can also help people feel more comfortable with opening up so they could be more honest to get the help needed.",
        "background": "Many people suffer from severe anxiety and may not feel comfortable making phone calls to crisis teams or suicide helplines so they avoid calling which could put them in danger.
