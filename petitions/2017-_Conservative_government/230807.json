        "action": "Stop the resale of concert tickets on secondary websites above face value price",
        "additional_details": "Reselling football tickets is illegal under section 166 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. This prevents touts from buying and reselling at inflated prices. \r\n\r\nWe need something similar for concert tickets. One option is to not allow secondary sites to resell concert tickets for more than the face value, excluding transaction fees and a small fee to ensure profit for the site. Selling at a highly inflated rate should not be allowed. It's unbeneficial for fans and the music business alike. \r\n\r\nThe fan fair alliance goes into more detail on this - http://fanfairalliance.org/faqs/",
        "background": "Concert tickets sell out within minutes due to use of specialist software purchasing them in mass.\r\n\r\nNew laws put in place earlier this year have seemingly made no difference.",
