        "action": "Make it compulsory for disability rate ticket offers to be available online.",
        "additional_details": "Many venues have their own schemes to access these offers but, there is no defined standard and very few make them available online which makes them difficult to access for those who cannot easily use a telephone. Considering the current digital age and the focus on making accessibility a priority it is wrong that there isn't a requirement to make all such offers available online which is proven to be the most effective method of driving complete accessibility no matter the type of disability.",
        "background": "Many public venues offer disability ticket offers, amongst many options these may be reduced pricing or free tickets for companions. However few are available online and usually they require a phone call to be accessed which discriminates against many of the people these offers are meant to assist.",
