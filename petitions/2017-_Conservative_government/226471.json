Whether a victim is wearing minimal clothing, or fully clothed, this is not a reason to be raped and is in no way the victims fault. There is never any excuse for rape, whether someone gets into your bed by accident while sleep walking for example, that is still not an excuse for rape. The attacked is the only person at fault",
