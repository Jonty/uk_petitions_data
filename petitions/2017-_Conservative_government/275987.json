        "action": "Update the Gender Recognition Act of 2006",
        "additional_details": "It still uses terms like \"transsexual\", asks unneccessarily invasive questions and is inaccessible to many. The process is difficult and expensive. Furthermore, the viewpoint of the law seems to be that living legally in your true gender is a privilege that can only be given to a select few. It isn't - it's a right for all trans people. This is not acceptable in 2019, in the UK. We are lagging behind other countries who have a more streamlined process. Please reform this outdated legislation.",
        "background": "The Gender Recognition Act was, in 2006, a groundbreaking piece of legislation for trans people which allowed them to change their gender in law. However, 13 years have passed and our understanding of trans people has changed. The law is now outdated and doesn't reflect the society we live in.",
