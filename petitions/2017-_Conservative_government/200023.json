        "action": "Proscribe Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation in its entirety in the UK",
        "additional_details": "However, even Hezbollah\u2019s own leadership does not differentiate between the two.  Speaking in October 2012, Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary General Naim Qassem stated: \"We don't have a military wing and a political one; we don't have Hezbollah on one hand and the resistance party on the other.\"\r\n\r\nThis petition calls upon Home Secretary Amber Rudd to once and for all listen to Hezbollah themselves and proscribe Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation in its entirety in the UK.",
        "background": "There is a legal loophole in the UK that allows the flag of Hezbollah, an organisation that hates the West, is anti-Semitic and perpetrates international acts of terror, to be flown in Britain because only Hezbollah\u2019s military wing is proscribed by the Government but not its supposed political wing.",
