        "additional_details": "There seems to be more and more caravans now especially foreign caravans that are more than 7m long these can currently only be towed with a vehicle more than 3.5 tonne a lot of people still tow illegally with less than 3.5 tonne as most campsites don\u2019t allow Comercial vehicles so this makes it hard to stay legal and still be able to enjoy using bigger family friendly caravans",
        "background": "The current law stops you towing a caravan more than 7m long with anything less than 3.5 tonne vehicle when a lot of vehicles less than 3.5 tonne are capable of towing these caravans",
