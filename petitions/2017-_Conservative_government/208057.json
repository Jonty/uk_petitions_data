        "action": "Provide all student nurses and midwives with additional maintenance loan",
        "additional_details": "I am currently a first year student studying in Manchester. Like many others, we are currently expected to make our third loan instalment last from April till September which includes essential fees such as uniform, travel expenses and living costs. Working a minimum of 22.5 weekly unpaid placement hours, attending university and studying leaves us little opportunity to take up a part-time job and therefore fund ourselves.",
        "background": "At the moment, healthcare students are given the same maintenance loans that all undergraduates apply for - this basic rate is made on the average course length of 30 weeks 3 days and ignores the requirements of our course length.",
