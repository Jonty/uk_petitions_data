        "action": "Ban paper receipts in the UK unless specifically requested by the customer.",
        "additional_details": "We live in a digital age where a receipt can be emailed at the click of a button. Eventually we should be phasing out paper receipts altogether, but for now the government need to take the first step of making it illegal for all shops and companies to hand out receipts without a customer specifically requesting one.",
        "background": "Over 11 billion receipts are printed each year in the UK alone. The majority of these are discarded straight to the bin. This has a devastating effect on our environment and the future of our planet. We must stop receipts being handed out as a matter of habit and dramatically reduce this number.",
