        "action": "UK to Leave the EU on WTO rules without any Deal. Our Leave Vote was for no Deal",
        "additional_details": "Following the success of Petition 229963, Leave voters were surprised at the lack of attendance at it's debate. In addition, the Petition was ignored by the biased Mainstream media, and reference to it was deleted from many online sources, so publicity was sparse and patchy. This petition is to make sure that Parliament actually does know that we voted to Leave without any Deal on 29th March, though we do accept that there may be \"some pain\" (as Mrs May calls it) involved in the initial process.",
        "background": "In June 2016, the UK voted to Leave the EU in a referendum. At the time, there was no Deal mentioned during the referendum campaigns. Indeed, Mr Cameron failed to return from the EU with any compromises some months earlier, so the majority of people voted to Leave the EU on WTO rules, nothing else.",
