The complexity of the U.K. tax code is a boon to them and their accountants and a curse on everybody else. This is not a new idea. It just deserves to be treated seriously.\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/eu-turnover-revenue-tax-corporation-tax-avoidance-a7941116.html",

These countries will then have to use the same system to recover revenues. U.K. SME's will still get the tax breaks they need.",
