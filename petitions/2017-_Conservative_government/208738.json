        "additional_details": "It is also very difficult to get a prosecution for hunting as you have to have an abundance of evidence against the hunting party. This is difficult to get as they are often very secretive about what actually happens out on the field.\r\n\r\nSee the below links for further information.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.huntsabs.org.uk/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/37/contents\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share this petition - this animal cruelty needs to stop.",
