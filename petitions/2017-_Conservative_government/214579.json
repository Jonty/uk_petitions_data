        "additional_details": "At the moment less than 7% of alpacas have been tested and the industry wants that to be at least 80%. \r\n\r\nbTB test results are not being shared by APHA or collated and thus no opportunity exists to improve the current situation. Animals are unnecessarily culled before the data is captured. The situation will never improve unless we all work together to learn more about these unique animals for the benefit of all livestock keepers in the UK.",
        "background": "Alpaca owners want the Government to work with them to eradicate bovine tuberculosis(btb). Testing rules are draconian and need to be reviewed. Please support a testing regime that does not condemn a healthy alpaca to death by always allowing a retest where no substantial evidence for disease exits.",
