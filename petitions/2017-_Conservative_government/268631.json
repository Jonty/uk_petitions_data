        "additional_details": "In some emergencies, private RNLI cars have tried passing by vehicles but tourists and local buses have refused to pull over, even though they had their hazard lights on. If RNLI crews had blue lights they would get to the station much quicker and people would realise the importance they are to our community. Many of the crew members come from a distance therefore they have to deal with traffic.",
        "background": "With the tourist season beginning our RNLI crews will be paged more often, and many tourists do not understand that our RNLI crews need to get to the station as quick as possible. Rural areas are the worst with narrow, windy roads that tourists. This would help the crews to help protect our people.",
