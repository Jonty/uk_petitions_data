        "action": "Legalise bow hunting in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The difference between guns and bows are as follows;\r\nBullets can get lost in your game, only to be found painfully when eating the game - Arrows get taken out soon after game is caught.\r\nGuns are loud, scaring the animal before it dies - Bows are not as loud, if without silencers, still allowing a more humane hunt.\r\nGun fumes and bullet/shell remains are pollutable - Arrows are collected if found.\r\nBows are lighter but more convenient to that of loading a gun, which emmits noise.",
        "background": "I am petitioning as a fellow bowman to relegalise bow hunting. It has been a skillful way of supplying meat since the ancient times.\r\n\r\nBut now, in the UK, it is all done by guns, and bows are no longer legal. There is neither any explanation as to why it is illegalised. But we can change that.",
