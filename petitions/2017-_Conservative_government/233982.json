        "additional_details": "Each year, globally, we are losing 18.7 million acres of forests. Due to this we are left with only 3000 wild tigers across the world. It has been shown that the amazon rain-forest has lost 17% of its trees in the past 50 years, due to forest conversion. In addition, it is shown that trees are our carbon sinks, therefore proving that they inhale the carbon we cant. If they cant inhale this carbon it will be let off into the atmosphere. 15% of all greenhouse gases are due to deforestation.",
        "background": "In school, we have been looking at deforestation and the causes and impacts of it. As an individual I have realized that a major issue for deforestation is the need for paper and other school supplies. Instead of cutting down more trees we should use recycled materials to help the environment!",
