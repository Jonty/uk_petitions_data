Give power back to the bobby on the street who faces the dangers to protect his community.",
        "background": "Knife crime and possession of drugs is rife in the UK. Current legislation under s1 PACE, s60 CJPO, and s23 Misuse of Drugs Act is too restrictive and current policies and rules prevent police searching individuals and the criminals know this. As a result crime,ASB, and disorder is out of control.",
