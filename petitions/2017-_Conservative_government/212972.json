        "action": "Ban the sale of Angora rabbit fur products in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Britain should make a stand against and the Angora fur trade to demonstrate cruelly harvested products are not tolerated. The unethical practice of removal of rabbit fur in China has recently been highlighted by People for the Unethical Treatment of Animals (PETA.) Their graphic evidence is featured on their website. The rabbits are kept in disgusting conditions and subjected to abuse that is beyond words.",
        "background": "Angora rabbit fur is often harvested from live rabbits. Their legs are stretched and pinned down while their fur is ripped out leaving them to scream helplessly in pain. Its an inhumane and cruel practice that we must make a stand against. ",
