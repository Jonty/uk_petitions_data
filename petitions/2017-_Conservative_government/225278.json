        "additional_details": "Anthony Douglas, the chief executive of Cafcass, vividly described it as one parent \u2018trying to turn their child into a child soldier in a battle\u2019. Previously parental alienation has been dismissed as a common product of bitterness about a failed relationship, but it is separate from these normal feelings of hurt. Parental alienation is in fact an internationally recognised form of parental psychological abuse and undermines the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Convention on the rights of the child. In Mexico and Brazil, it is even classed as a criminal offence.",
        "background": "Parental Alienation\r\nThis can occur when a child is caught in between their parents divorce or separation, the offending parent deliberately turns their child against their ex so that they eventually cut off all contact. This can be described as one parent \u2018trying to turn their child into a soldier.",
