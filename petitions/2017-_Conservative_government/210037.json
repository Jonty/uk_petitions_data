If a carrier does not have this framework in place, they should not be allowed to operate premium SMS services at all.",
        "background": "Shady companies are sending fraudulent unsolicited premium rate SMS text messages to mobile phone owners in the UK. These cost recipients up to \u00a34.50 a message often resulting in huge bills to the victim as the fraud is likely to go unnoticed for long periods of time.",
