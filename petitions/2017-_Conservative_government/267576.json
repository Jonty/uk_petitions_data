        "additional_details": "It's been well known over the news already of this occurring in London, I knew my council had a lack of empathy for the people they serve and regular known to waste tax payers money. I never thought they would take the stance of taking what little the poorest of our community has. There are plenty of abandoned buildings that could be renovated into hostels or centres to rehabilitate and educate if money was spent more wisely, fining them is not the answer.",
        "background": "I found a guy I regularly buy food for in tears. A member of my local council and a police officer in tow gave him an \u00a3100 for begging. He has nothing, no family, no home, no job, how is he expected to pay a fine when he can even get the money together every day to feed himself. This needs to stop.",
