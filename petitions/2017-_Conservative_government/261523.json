        "action": "Make it Law for Social Media Accounts to only be for people aged 16 and over",
        "additional_details": "Families in modern day society are being put under extreme amounts of pressure to keep their children safe in their own home. All children are different and learn about the world at their own pace. By setting up a Social Media account at the age of 13, this exposes them to worldwide news they may not be able to cope with, and parents can feel the added pressure of running a home, a business or going to work, whilst trying to contain safety of their child on the internet. Lets make a change.",
        "background": "Currently, children are being exposed to a world they are not mature enough to deal with or understand, creating bad behaviours, leaving them open to grooming, and taking their own lives through online bullying because they cannot cope. To make it law may help families, and schools in our country.",
