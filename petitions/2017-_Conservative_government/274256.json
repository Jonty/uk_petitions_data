        "action": "Ensure regulatory bodies reduce registration fees for those on parental leave",
        "additional_details": "There exists huge inequality in the way professional membership fees are managed during parental leave. Certain regulatory bodies offer discounts whilst others do not. Registration fees are often large amounts of money that can put significant financial pressure on families during parental leave. Discounted memberships should be made available to all men or women taking parental leave.",
        "background": "Currently not all professional bodies reduce compulsory annual fees for their members whilst they are on parental leave, despite members not working for extended periods and despite the significant drop in earnings during parental leave.",
