        "additional_details": "There are more than 60,000 NHS staff who are EU citizens. At present, there is no assurance that they can continue working post Brexit. This makes recruitment of staff challenging. \r\nThe suggested \u00a365 fee represents more than one day's earnings for the majority of them and cannot be justified for administration purposes.\r\n",
        "background": "The possibility of a \"no-deal\" Brexit has been described as uncomfortably high. \r\nThere are a significant number of EU citizens working in the NHS.  Any disruption in their working rights may have catastrophic effects. The government should give them indefinite leave to remain for free.\r\n",
