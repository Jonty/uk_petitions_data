        "additional_details": "If these people pass one part of the test but fail the other, they should be given the chance to re-take the failed part within a year. If they pass it, that should count as passing the whole test. Lots of people have passed both sections but not at the same time. Being able to drive is so important for their day to day life.",
        "background": "The driving theory test is in two parts, multiple choice questions and a hazard perception test. You have to pass both parts at the same time to pass the whole test. This is very hard for people with Dyslexia or anxiety, who might panic under the pressure.",
