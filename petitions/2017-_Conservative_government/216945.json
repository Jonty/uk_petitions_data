        "additional_details": "I\u2019ve started this petition as I highly think mental health lessons should be taught in schools and is a greater importance than sex education, so many of us including myself suffer with anxiety and depression from our time at school or childhood. I think it\u2019s very important that kids of today learn this from a young age as it may provent or help when they become a adult. It will help people they may not end up suffering with mental help understand others that do, friends, family etc.",
        "background": "As a suffer of mental health myself I really strongly believe it needs to be a subject to kids in schools to learn.",
