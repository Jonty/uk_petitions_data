        "action": "Fund more nurses and training for trauma wards in hospitals.",
        "additional_details": "Patients (including myself) were left on bed pans/commodes/equipment way longer than necessary and going into emotional breakdown, lashing out at staff. Patients were being referred to as bed numbers. Curtains (for privacy) were being drawn so carelessly that half the ward, including visitors, could see the person using bedpan/having intimate care done. Quiet patients were being ignored and forgotten over demanding ones.",
        "background": "I spent 27 days on trauma ward in hospital. I saw and experienced call bells being ignored, 'red tray' patients not fed as not enough staff and long waits for painkillers. The Government should provide more funding for trauma nurses and better training for staff who work on trauma wards.",
