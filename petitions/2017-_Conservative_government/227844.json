        "additional_details": "It is said that an estimated 1 billion pounds would be given to the economy in a year of its legalisation. This can be spent on helping fund the NHS and/or better the country in general. It would also cut crime down as selling cannabis would no longer be illegal therefore dealers will have no way of making money as government funded regulated companies would be in charge.",
        "background": "It has been shown that cannabis provides many health benifits and the legalisation of recreational cannabis would bring many benifits to the economy of the UK.",
