This bureaucracy is causing a barrier to these performances when other similar activities such as sports have and exemption.",
        "background": "This legislation is intended to safeguard children taking part in performances, sport or modelling as per the \u201cChildren (Performances and Activities) (England) Regulations 2014\u201d. It is not intended to deter children from engaging with Brass Bands, but it is having a negative impact on the movement.",
