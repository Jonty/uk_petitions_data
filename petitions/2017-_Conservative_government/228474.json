        "additional_details": "We are told by the police to take money upfront. Do shops & fuel stations ask for money upfront before you purchase? No!! So why should taxi drivers be treated differently to theft offenses? The lack of police support against taxi fare dodgers allows criminals to continue as they know nothing will be done about it. Even Transport for London have their own police force.",
        "background": "As a taxi driver providing transport service to the public, we face endless fare dodgers with no police support. The police say it's a 'civil matter'. If someone filled up their vehicle with fuel and drove off, the response from the police is immediate. Why isn't that applied to other thefts?",
