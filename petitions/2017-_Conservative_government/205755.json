        "additional_details": "Loot Crates are essentially virtual slot machines, paid for with real life currency, that usually gives the player a few random in-game items with a very small chance to win a \"Rare\" item; the vast majority of the time this will result in receiving very common items of no value. This system is implemented for the sole purpose of allowing the publishers to milk every penny possible out of vulnerable, naive young gamers through gambling-esque exploitative tactics. This simply shouldn't be allowed.",
        "background": "Gambling problems in the UK are becoming more widespread annually, with very little action taken to prevent this trend; Loot Crates are creating a gambling time-bomb for the younger generation by conditioning impressionable children/teenagers to associate gambling real money with winning rewards.",
