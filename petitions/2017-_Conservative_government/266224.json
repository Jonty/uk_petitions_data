        "additional_details": "Traces of Cocaine have known to have been found in toilets within Westminster. It is essential that MPs and Lords are tested to ensure they do not take illegal drugs. How can they be trusted to vote on drugs legislation for instance, if they themselves are drug users?\r\n\r\nMPs found with illegal drugs in their system must be suspended and face deselection.",
        "background": "All serving MPs and Lords should face compulsory drugs testing annually. Having drugs such as Cocaine, Heroin or Cannabis in their system could inhibit their ability to make sound and rational decisions. Making irrational decisions could lead to extremely damaging situations.",
