People of many religions In our diverse country are forbidden to consume Religiously slaughtered meat. We deserve the right to have our foods labelled, Not with the cop out of 'stunned' but Full bolt stun. Both Kosher and Halal demand that the animal be conscious at the point of dispatch. Illegal in our country. Religion does not come above civilized morals.",
        "background": "The British people are being sold, unlabelled Halal and Kosher meat. Also being sold other products, not all honestly labelled. I think as a people we deserve honesty where this subject is concerned. Many faiths are forbidden to consume Halal or Kosher goods. Everyone should be entitled to choice.",
