        "action": "Make DLA/ PIP assessment companies liable for wrongly rejected claims",
        "additional_details": "Daily, there are numerous reports of wrongly rejected claims. These awards are often taken away or not awarded at all because PIP assessment companies don\u2019t take their responsibilities seriously. Reports are showing consistent similarities - What a claimant has said and what a medical professional who knows them personally, is not being taken into account. In addition to this, assessors are writing claimants have shown examples of doing things that contradicts the truth entirely.",
        "background": "Countless disabled and individuals severely in need are not being awarded what they are rightly entitled to. Furthermore, those already in recipient of DLA/PIP are having their awards completely taken away. Companies must be fined when appeals succeed to make them assess claims properly.",
