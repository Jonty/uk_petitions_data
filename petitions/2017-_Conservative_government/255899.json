        "additional_details": "People need to understand that these horses have feelings too and they do not like being put through the pain of races non stop. Picture this, a company set up a race full of dogs that have to jump hurdles, however one dog falls and twists it\u2019s ankle. The dog gets put down. There would be national outrage. So why is it different for horses?",
        "background": "Every year, thousands of people pay and get dressed up to go and watch horses race which usually ends up in one of the horses dying due to an injury whilst racing. In the recent \u2018Ladie\u2019s Day\u2019 event at Aintree Race Course 2019, two innocent horses died. It is not fair.",
