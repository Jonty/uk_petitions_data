        "additional_details": "Only half of a Kosher slaughter is considered 'Kosher'. The other half will enter the food chain, unlabelled, to be purchased by an unsuspecting public which may object to the method of slaughter. Kosher and Halal slaughter have, for some reason, been exempt from British Animal welfare laws on the grounds of 'Religion'. The public demand the right to a choice. The exemption from our law is determined as to supply the demand, which it clearly exceeds. British Christians have rights also.",
        "background": "The British Public are becoming increasingly annoyed by the Governments continued dismissal of the subject of Religious Animal slaughter and the stealth by which it enters our food chain. (The General Food Law Regulation(EC) 178/2002) states clearly, that all food should be traceable to the buyer.",
