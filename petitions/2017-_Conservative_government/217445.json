        "action": "Codify the requirement for parliamentary authorisation of military action.",
        "additional_details": "Whilst military action is often justified and neccessary, it should not be in the power of PM to unilaterally decide when and where to deploy British Forces. Since 2003, convention has been followed by succesive governments that Parliament should be consulted on military action, it appears that this convention will now be ignored. It is therefore neccessary that this requirement is enforced via statute. Such a statute could include exceptional circumstances whereby action could be expedited.",
        "background": "Since 2003, and Parliament's decision to vote in favour of military intervention in Iraq, it has become an accepted convention that Parliament will authorise military action in which British Forces will participate.",
