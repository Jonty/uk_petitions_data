        "additional_details": "According to the British Horse-racing Authority, approximately 5000 horses have died as a result of racing since 1994. Even those who don't die on the racing course, do not tend to have a happy retirement. Many horses have been reported to end up in the slaughterhouse or a bullet shot through their brain. \r\nIf it was your family member or your closest friend, would you allow them to be treated in this manner?",
        "background": "We constantly criticise countries for their exploitation of animals in cruel sports, such as Spain with its tradition of bull-fighting. Yet we allow animals in the UK to be exploited & butchered, through the Grand National. Having broken horses necks for the sake of greed and money needs to stop.",
