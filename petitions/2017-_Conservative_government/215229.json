        "action": "Increase Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) from 39 weeks to 52 weeks",
        "additional_details": "The House of Commons Library contains a document entitled \"Maternity pay and leave\" dated 13 January 2010. It states that in December 2004 the Government announced a goal of extending maternity pay to twelve\r\nmonths, from what was then 26 weeks (6 months). Although progress has been made and maternity pay is now paid for 39 weeks (9 months), I believe it is an important social issue to get that extra extension to 52 weeks (12 months).",
        "background": "It is important that new parents should not be put off taking their full entitlement to Maternity Leave for 52 weeks because they will not receive payment for the last 13 weeks of their leave. Currently SMP is only payable for the first 39 weeks of Maternity Leave.",
