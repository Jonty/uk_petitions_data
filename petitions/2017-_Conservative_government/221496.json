        "additional_details": "At the moment for a child under three years old to attend a full day of nursery the average price is around \u00a350 a day. Family's who are living on lower incomes  can't afford this and many are reducing their hours or giving up work completely as the money they are spending can be as much as or nearly as much as they are earning.",
        "background": "Childcare at the moment is only free from two if you have special circumstances, all other children have to wait til 3. If childcare was free from a year old a lot more parents would have the oppurtunity work or work more hours that cant currently because of the price of childcare.",
