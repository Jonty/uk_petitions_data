        "additional_details": "Replace the present election system with one that requires 25% of MPs to stand for re-election each year.  Ensure that the list of those needing to stand is random and cannot be fixed by political parties. Ensure all MPs have to stand for re-election during a Parliament.  Publish, in mainstream media, attendance and voting records of all MPs standing for re-election.\r\n The annual election of a proportion of Local Councillors has worked for many years. It is important to show MPs are honest people",
        "background": "Parliament and MPs have lost the respect and trust of the majority of UK citizens. Parliament is perceived as representing MPs, political families and the rich. This applies to all UK political parties. The system of PD has been hijacked by interests from outside the UK with the support of UK MPs.",
