        "additional_details": "How many more veterans will die, feeling alone and full of guilt, self-loathing and unable to function?  It is a National disgrace that we lose these heroes every day because they are allowed to be ignored.  The first step is for the Armed Forces to counsel everyone and to provide a caring, professional solution.  This may involve the NHS even whilst these personnel are still serving.  If all three organisations work better together we can begin to understand more and provide a safer environment for them all",
        "background": "PTSD is rapidly becoming the biggest killer of Service personnel. We need to do more to identify the condition before it takes over. Our Service personnel deserve the best after giving us so much, we cannot just throw them into a Society that doesn\u2019t have the patience or understanding to accept them",
