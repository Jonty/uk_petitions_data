        "action": "Stop the Prime Minister from bringing her Brexit deal for a 3rd vote.",
        "additional_details": "The referendum result was very close - the voting on this deal was not! It has been defeated categorically and in no uncertain terms, TWICE. It is wrong for her to try to put pressure on Parliament to try to FORCE this deal through a 3rd time when it is clear that this deal is bad for Britain. We all know that if it goes through now, it will be a false and reluctant acceptance under duress and we, the people, should not accept that.",
        "background": "We, the people of the United Kingdom, have been refused a 2nd referendum on Brexit by the Prime Minister on the grounds that it would make a mockery of democracy. \r\nIn my opinion she is being totally hypocritical on this by attempting to bring her Brexit deal back to Parliament for a 3rd vote.",
