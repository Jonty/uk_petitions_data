        "additional_details": "Counselling in schools should be offered and easy to access, eg if students were provided with questionnaires on their mental well-being once every few months, their mental state could be easily monitored and be offered support and extra info if needed.\r\n- Around 850,000 5-16 yr olds suffer with mental illness (almost 1 in 10 / 3 per class)\r\n-70% increase in self harm rates in 10-14 yr olds over past 2 years\r\n-70% of young people with a mental illness don't get the appropriate support",
        "background": "The teaching of mental health becoming required was a huge step, but there\u2019s a long way to go until support and info on mental health within schools is enough. Having anxiety and depression myself, I know that many people can be left alone or confused; it shouldn\u2019t be seen as a minor topic to rush.",
