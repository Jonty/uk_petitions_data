        "additional_details": "I ask that the oath and contract for an elected official include three parts.\r\n\r\n1) If caught irrefutably lying to their electorate they be subject to a personal fine of no less than \u00a310,000.00\r\n\r\n2) If that lie gives them any form of benefit through personal benefit through business interests outside of politics the accused should have to face a jail term of no less than 6 months.\r\n\r\n3) If they must vote on anything that could potentially benefit them personally through business interests outside of politics that interest must be declared before such a vote takes place.",
        "background": "The word 'politician' has become synonymous with 'liar'.  This is unacceptable.  What once was a noble profession has become perverted with the ill intent of men and women who seek power and personal gain.",
