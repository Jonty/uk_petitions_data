        "additional_details": "The service has been getting worse and worse over the past 5 years since they took over from First Capital Connect. Passengers are getting more and more frustrated with excuses for not being able to run a train service. There are constant excuses such as no train drives, cancelling trains last minute due to late running of trains, delays. The passengers are paying a fortune and not getting the service they deserve.\r\n\r\nThe recent timetable change is making matters worse by cancelling up to 6 trains at a time and drivers who don't even know the route they are taking. This has been years in the making not days, we all deserve better.",
