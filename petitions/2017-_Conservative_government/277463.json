You might like to sign this petition:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/255921\r\n\r\nYou're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nOr you could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, calling for a review of the PIP assessment in relation to claimants with mental health conditions, if that's something you'd like to happen."
