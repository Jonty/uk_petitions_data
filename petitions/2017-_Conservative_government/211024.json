        "additional_details": "There is no support for working families like there is for unemployed/low income families (sure start maternity grant.) more support is desperately needed. Minimum maternity also needs to be increased, and \u00a3140 a week made the minimum amount. This is putting a huge amount of mental strain on new families and something needs to be done.",
        "background": "Maternity pay for working parents is ridiculous. \u00a3140 a week or less is not enough to support a child! This amount needs to be increased to take the pressure away from working families.",
