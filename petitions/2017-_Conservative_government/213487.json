        "additional_details": "Due to the high number of dog attacks on sheep, and people as well as other canines, the aim is to have all dog owners and dog homes must have every dog\u2019s DNA taken and registered on a database with their microchip. This would allow all dogs to be screened when attacks happen to find the owners.  Wounds can be swabbed and detection made, not only during injury investigation or th of sheep, but also for banned breeds!  \r\nThe DNA could also assist District Council to check samples of uncollected poo in order to trace owners and prosecute them.",
        "background": "This was first suggested in July 2016 following a mixed breed Staffie mixed type dog nearly killing my Border Terrier. Only 66 people at that time signed it, so this time round it should get a better result.",
