        "additional_details": "Also I think all road works need to be monitored more by local authorities as it seem the contractors will dig holes and rip up roads then leave them for days without any work being done.\r\n\r\nSo having them monitored might make the contractors complete the work in a better time frame and get the job done propley the first time",
        "background": "Everyday there\u2019s more and more roadworks  sometimes the same hole being dug or same works being done twice but it causes so much congestion and a lot of the time the work isn\u2019t being done so have all road works or anything that will cause congestion done through the night will help everyone",
