        "additional_details": "A simple law that states no ID no sale on alcohol would remove the possibility of human error in judging people's ages and would help to Reduce verbal and physical confrontations if customers knew the law was no ID no sale.\r\nAcross the country workers have been subjected to abuse because of guessing a customers age who subsequently causes a scene in an attempt to intimidate the cashier into selling the product.\r\nA No ID no sale law would be a simple fix so everyone knows where they stand.",
