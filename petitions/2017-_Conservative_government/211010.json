        "additional_details": "Extracts from the Chief Rabbi's letter to the Lord Chancellor:\r\n\r\n..... I have received copies of correspondence between Ms Hassell and a Jewish communal organisation, the Adath Yisrael Burial Society, and I have been extremely troubled by Ms Hassell\u2019s stated position.\r\n\r\n ... she has made clear that she will not expedite the burial of a Jewish or Muslim person, even in cases where it is possible to do so.",
        "background": "The religious tradition of both Jews and Muslims demands that the dead should be buried as soon as possible. All coroners do their best to respect that obligation, with one exception. Mary Hassell has steadfastly refused. \r\n\r\nThe Chief Rabbi stresses the pain for a Jewish family if burial's delayed.",
