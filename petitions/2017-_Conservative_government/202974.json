        "additional_details": "The evidence to support this is in the fact that use of food banks has risen so dramatically. That homelessness has more than doubled. \r\n\r\nThere is also the fact that I have endured sanctions myself, where I went weeks without money and had to use food banks myself. \r\n\r\nThe evidence is everywhere, and has been in the news, there have been studies after studies that have said that sanctions and universal credit are causing more poverty. \r\n\r\nIt is time to stop using abject poverty as a punishment.",
        "background": "The welfare state was invented to support those in need, to support those in need. It should never be used as a form of finacial blackmail. Sanctions make people need more, they make poor people more poor and they victimise the most vulnerable in our society. \r\n\r\nit is time we put an end to this.",
