        "additional_details": "A member of the local council informed concerned residents that questions had been asked regarding traffic speed, however, residents deny they were asked questions. It came to light after that the road narrowing was not to reduce speed, but was put in place as a cost effective method to reduce the number of heavy vehicles crossing the bridge at the same time. In effect reducing damage to the bridge and future cost of maintaining the bridge. Traffic is set to rise with new houses being built.",
        "background": "Recent road works carried out on Somerton's main road, were implemented to reduce speed of traffic. However, as a result of this work, traffic speed has not reduced, but appears worse than ever. Drivers speed up in order to make it through the road narrowing, to avoid giving way to oncoming traffic.",
