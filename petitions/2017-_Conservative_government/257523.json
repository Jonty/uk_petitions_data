        "additional_details": "I propose the BBC licence fee be collected on a subscription basis via a set top box and the law be changed to allow consumers to watch competitors television free from licensing.  The BBC can supply a set top box that will unscramble their programme signals for those who decide to pay to view BBC programmes.\r\n\r\nIt would leave consumers free to choose whether or not to pay and would better reflect the actual value of the State broadcasting service.",
        "background": "I believe the BBC licence fee in its present form is outmoded.\r\nThose companies providing commercial television are prevented from advertising to anyone who does not pay the TV licence. There is no other sector in the commercial world whereby one producer can control the market in such a way.",
