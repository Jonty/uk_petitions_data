        "action": "Allow university students to be registered at two GP surgeries.",
        "additional_details": "Repeat prescriptions such as contraception and inhalers are both major concerns and usage is required all year round so are needed at home as much as at university. Illnesses can arise at any time and when they occur close to the end of a university term treatment can be disrupted due to the change of location. Having to apply as a temporary patient can cause unnecessary stress for time sensitive matters.",
        "background": "Students should be able to be registered at two GP surgeries; one at university and one at home. This is to allow for ease of continued care and for regular repeat prescriptions, especially as only half a year is spent at university, so why must students only be seen in the city they study in?",
