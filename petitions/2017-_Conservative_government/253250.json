        "action": "Require all emergency vehicles to be fitted with sirens",
        "additional_details": "As a young, inexperienced driver, I was extremely shaken up when a police car came around a bend with no siren directly towards me at a very high speed. This prompted my instructor to seize control of the vehicle to ensure mine, his and the safety of the drivers behind me. \r\n \r\nI believe that this situation would have been avoided had the police car been using its sirens as I would have heard and reacted appropriately without the need for an emergency stop, therefore making it safer for everyone.\r\n",
        "background": "Whilst nobody disputes that emergency personnel do their utmost to protect us, it is wrong to allow them to drive at high speeds without warning other road users. It should be made mandatory that all emergency vehicles are fitted with sirens and that they are used when exceeding the speed limit.",
