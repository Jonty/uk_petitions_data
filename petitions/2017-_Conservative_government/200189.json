        "additional_details": "Those who sign this petition are calling for a reduction in single-use plastics and for the Government to set a target date for the eventual ban of all single-use plastics. \r\n\r\nThere are many ways to reduce single-use plastics; deposit return schemes and plans similar to that of the 5p plastic bag charge.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the weight of plastics in the ocean is likely to exceed that of fish by 2050.\r\n\r\nWe cannot allow future generations to be burdened with a damaged environment.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call for action on the current environmental crisis concerning single-use plastics and demand the Government committ to a significant reduction and eventual end to them. There's been recent success in limiting microbeads and plastic bags, but far more needs to be done.",
