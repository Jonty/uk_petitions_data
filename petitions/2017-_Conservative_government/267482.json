We know that this is a small step against climate change and ocean pollution but a step is step no matter how small. And this one can be done very quickly as Tesco\u2019s themselves said (on a bbc documentary) it could be done overnight if it was the right thing to do. We want you to tell that this is the right thing to do. Bananas don\u2019t need bags!",

We don\u2019t need it and it\u2019s not recyclable.\r\n\r\nMost fruit and veg such as bananas, lemons and many more come with their own natural packaging, they don\u2019t need more. For those that don\u2019t such strawberrys, mushrooms and many more a paper bag or cardboard tray would be more than enough.",
