There is evidence of Internet Users recommending multiple submissions & how to instructions. \r\nThis casts into doubt the integrity of the UK Petitons process & it clearly demonstrates this system is not fit for purpose when it can easily be circumvented.  This review is urgent.",

It may have even had interference and manipulation with the use of an automated systems such were the patterns of voting recorded during silent hours.",

We use a number of techniques, automated and manual, to identify and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses or other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. We also monitor signing patterns. For security reasons, we don\u2019t tell people when their fraudulent activity has been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t comment in detail about the security measures, but all petitions are subject to checks as part of due diligence and any concerns investigated. We're therefore not sure exactly what further action you'd like to see."
