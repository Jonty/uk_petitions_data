        "action": "Give Tyson Fury an OBE",
        "additional_details": "Shortly after this triumph Tyson suffered from depression and mental health problems and was inactive from boxing for 2 years. Having conquered these demons outside of the ring he decided to make a comeback in the ring. He had accumulated a weight of 27 stones, he drastically lost this weight which is a huge achievement in itself and went to the backyard of the most feared boxers in Deontay Wilder to battle it out for the World Heavyweight Championship. The fight was deemed a controversial draw, Tyson was without doubt robbed having clearly won the fight. He has never been given a fair chance, I believe this more than justifies why this man should be awarded an OBE.",
        "background": "Tyson Fury is one of the greatest boxers to have ever come out of Britain. He went to Germany and utterly dominated Wladimir Klitschko, who at the time had ruled the heavyweight division for over a decade and was considered the most supreme boxer of all time.",
