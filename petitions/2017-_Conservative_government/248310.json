        "action": "Ensure UK schools deliver LGBTQA diversity lessons to all",
        "additional_details": "Nobody chooses sexuality, but you can choose to remain uneducated. Diversity lessons help make people of a non LQBTQA background to understand the difficulties that those who are face on a daily basis. \r\n\r\nThe LGBTQA community suffer on a daily basis: social / workplace discrimination, bigotry, violence. Ironically the same people protesting are also are a minority and should also understand why it is important that all minority groups are fully represented and children are taught respect for all.",
        "background": "Recent protests from a religious minority in Birmingham saw the council suspend LGBTQA diversity lesson in schools. This sets a dangerous precedence. Will the government uphold and protect diversity lessons covering all minorities including LGBTQA for all school children and enforce the current law?",
