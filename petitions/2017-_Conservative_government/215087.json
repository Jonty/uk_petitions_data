        "action": "Stop cuts to free school meals for children",
        "additional_details": "I come from Cornwall, which has one of the highest poverty, and in particular, child poverty rates in the country! The Conservative Government is planning cuts to free school meals as part of the age of austerity that we live in. Tory austerity affects the poorest in society, while the rich and wealthy continue to enjoy tax breaks and tax havens. All children deserve to be well fed at school in order to learn, if children go hungry they are at a disadvantage to others during their education.",
        "background": "I was lucky enough not to have to rely on free school meals. However, for many children in the UK this isn\u2019t the case! Many children rely on free school meals as their only substantial meal for each day. Help me to stop the cuts to free school meals and give every child in society an equal start.",
