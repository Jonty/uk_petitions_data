So what if all 26 member states would have to agree.  So do we. Our Vito. \r\nNew agreement would have to be free and allow UK to establish trade agreements around the world. \r\n\r\nPretty soon, everyone will want a Backstop.",
        "background": "I simply cannot understand why we only hear about 2 or 3 simple aspects of the Backstop. 1) Stuck in it, as all other 26 member states would all have to agree. 2) When it would start 3) The EU don't want to be in it either.
