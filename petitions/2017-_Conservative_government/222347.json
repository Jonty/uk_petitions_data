        "additional_details": "This is most recently and controversially shown by the actions of Sir Christopher Chope MP; who blocked a private members bill on making the practice of supporting an offence by objecting; this is despite the bill otherwise having clear support from virtually all honourable members present. \r\n\r\nSir Christopher is also understood to have blocked several other private members bills through objections and through filibustering.",
        "background": "Currently, a private members bill can be blocked by any one MP calling to object to it, or by filibustering. These practices are not democratic and Parliament should consider updating the rules on these types of bill to ensure only a majority vote can decide the outcome.",
