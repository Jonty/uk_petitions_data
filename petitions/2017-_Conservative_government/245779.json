        "additional_details": "Once people do not have the opportunity to use plastic bags, they will gradually learn that they need their reusable bags or need to find an alternative to using plastic bags. As humans we can learn to adapt. It is important. It is only a bag. These bags are often used to carry 2/3 items because we are \u2018lazy\u2019 then thrown away when we arrive home. We need to remove these bags as a start to removing single-use plastic and helping to save our planet. We have NO planet B.",
        "background": "As a country we are aware of the issues surrounding plastic so it is important we put a stop to plastic usage as soon as we can. One way is to completely eradicate plastic bags forever. As a country we should learn to manage without plastic bags, forcing people to move to cotton reusable bags.",
