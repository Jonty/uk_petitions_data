        "action": "Correct the claim, misleading MPs, that UK cosmetic testing on animals has ended",
        "additional_details": "Most UK cosmetic ingredients are industrial chemicals, normally all tested on animals under REACH law. For any chemical to be approved for marketing there are normally 11 required toxicity tests. Of these 11, only 4 non-animal tests have been developed. To get their missing data, cosmetic companies exploit loopholes that permit dual-use industrial & cosmetic chemicals to be tested on animals. This means UK cosmetic testing on animals has not ended, also compromising our public health & safety.",
        "background": "Despite an official 'ban', most UK (& EU) cosmetic ingredients can still - by law - be tested on animals. There is now a call for a \u2018global ban\u2019 based on this. So consumers are being misled and decision makers even congratulated on \u2018full testing and marketing bans\u2019, which in reality do not exist.",
