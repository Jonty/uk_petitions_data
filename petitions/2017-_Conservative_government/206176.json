        "action": "Raise the tax threshold of Personal Allowance reduction to above \u00a3100,000",
        "additional_details": "Whereas Personal Allowance values have almost doubled since the 2010-11 tax year (\u00a36475 to \u00a311500), the \u00a3100,000 earnings limit has not increased since introduction. Therefore, whilst Personal Allowances increase in line with the cost of living, the \u00a3100,000 earnings cap does not. Consequently, families of individuals earning over \u00a3100,000 are disadvantaged, with tax/child credits already abolished for any family earning over \u00a350,000. The income limit for this PA reduction should be increased.",
        "background": "Currently, an individual\u2019s Personal Tax Allowance reduces when annual income is above \u00a3100,000, by \u00a31 for every \u00a32 earned above this limit. This \u00a3100,000 limit has not been increased since its introduction in 2010-11.",
