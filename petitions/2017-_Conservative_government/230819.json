        "action": "Change the current process when bringing complaints to the IOPC",
        "additional_details": "When a complaint is made to the IOPC the current procedure is that it is sent to the Chief Constable of the force being complained about. It is then the decision of that Chief Constable whether he/she will investigate or hand it back to the IOPC. This current system is not independent or fair and means that in many cases the complainant is prevented by the police from being heard by anyone impartial unless they apply for a Judicial Review afterwards, which is beyond the financial means of most.",
        "background": "The IOPC (formerly the IPCC) is responsible for overseeing complaints made against police forces in England and Wales. However, the current procedure allows Chief Constables to circumnavigate the IOPC and investigate complaints themselves. We want this changed to make the IOPC truly independent.",
