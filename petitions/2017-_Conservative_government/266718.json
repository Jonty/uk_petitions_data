        "additional_details": "Appointments to government jobs should be made on the basis of ability and experience, rather than on MPs\u2019 commitment to party policy or loyalty to the party leader, and incumbents should not be removed from office just to make way for someone else.\r\n\r\nTo constrain leaders\u2019 powers of patronage, the House of Commons should humbly request Her Majesty that no Member of Parliament be removed from a government job without Parliament\u2019s consent, as demonstrated (where necessary) in a secret ballot.",
        "background": "The appointment of MPs to government jobs creates a potential conflict between their responsibilities to their constituents and their duties as public officials. Parliament should ensure that such appointments are not used as a way of influencing MPs\u2019 votes in the House of Commons.",
