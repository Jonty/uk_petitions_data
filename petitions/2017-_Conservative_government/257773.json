        "additional_details": "The introduction of a 'Dog Licence' would help reduce cases such as:\r\nCornwall caravan dog attack - BBC(April, 2019)\r\nDog attack leaves baby boy fighting for life - ITV (April, 2019)\r\nAnglesey dog attack - BBC (April, 2019)\r\nDog mauled to death in park and owner let with fractured fingers - Metro (April 2019)\r\nDog Attack nurse 'saw her hand on ground' BBC (April 2019)\r\n\r\nThese cases are all linked to a level of neglect and incompetence from owners and a licence will help prevent this in future.",
        "background": "In light of recent dog attacks on young children and livestock, as well as cases of abuse to dogs in the UK, it is time the Government takes action to control owners. Those adopting a dog should be vetted for previous crimes such as neglect or abuse that may put the dog or others at risk.",
