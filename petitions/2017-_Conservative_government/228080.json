Flyparking often refers to the parking of HGVs overnight outside proper parking places. The Government has said it is considering banning this practice and you could start a petition on it. However, your petition appears to go wider than this. The enforcement of local parking restrictions would be the responsibility of local authorities and not the UK Government or Parliament.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition which sets out clearly what behaviour you would like to see made illegal.
