The government does not fund or maintain northern England properly as it should. \r\n\r\nWe in northern England pay taxes, yet the south spends it. It is time to hold a referendum in Northern England !",
        "background": "Northern England is always the most underfunded out of everywhere in the UK. We in northern England pay taxes, yet it is always the south that spends it. We have the worst public transport system in the UK, and many other services including the NHS receive the smallest amount of funding in England.",
