        "additional_details": "It is extremely plausible that vulnerable people in our society will be put at risk if businesses do not, or cannot afford to complete DBS checks.\r\n\r\nBusinesses should be able to pay a subscription to gain access to a database to authenticate the intervrity of their employees, opposed to paying between \u00a320 - \u00a360 per check.",
        "background": "Businesses are charged to check the forensic history of employees, to safeguard vulnerable people within the workplace and/or academia. For many businesses this is a very costly overhead. It is not ethical that the safety of vulnerable people is contingent on paying a DBS check fee.",
