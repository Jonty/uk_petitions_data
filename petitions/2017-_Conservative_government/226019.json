        "additional_details": "Some of our politicians have no respect for the vote that was taken, had the vote been the same majority for remain as it was for leave then I would have accepted it, we would stay in the EU and that\u2019s democracy. I don\u2019t believe there would have been a big debate in Parliament about respecting the 48% of people who voted leave, no deal would have been done to respect our concerns, MP\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be going to Brussels to do a deal on a soft remain, we would have been told you lost get over it.",
        "background": "All we have heard from remainer MP\u2019s and parts of the media is how leave voters didn\u2019t know what they were voting for. I knew exactly what I was voting for and I\u2019m not zenaphobic, racist or stupid. I respect those that voted to remain it\u2019s time for them to respect those who don\u2019t share their view.",
