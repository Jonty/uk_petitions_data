        "additional_details": "He ran MI6 from 1923 until his death in 1939, having put in place the Special Operations Executive that was behind a campaign of sabotage in German-occupied territory.\r\n\r\nA year before the war he bought Bletchley Park for \u00a36,000 as a wartime intelligence station, realising that base outside London was critical with war looming. It is estimated that the intelligence produced at Bletchley Park shortened the war by between two and four years.",
        "background": "He ran MI6 for 16 years and established with his own money the codebreaking unit at Bletchley Park that altered the course of the war. The plaque should be located at Queen Anne\u2019s Gate in central London, which was his official residence and linked to MI6\u2019s headquarters by a tunnel.",
