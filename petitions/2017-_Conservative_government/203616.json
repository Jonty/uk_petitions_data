All the exam boards... Namely OCR and AQA plan to abolish the subject! http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/law/gcse/law-4160\r\nhttp://www.ocr.org.uk/qualifications/gcse-law-j485-from-2012/",
        "background": "GCSE law is a great qualification as it allows students who do not have the knowledge to perform at a-level to show their ability in another way. Sadly, all the exam boards that provide the subject will scrap it in 2018. This petition calls on the government to provide a syllabus after that.",
