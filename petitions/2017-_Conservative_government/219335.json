        "additional_details": "My elderly mother was refused her request to have 2 ladies attend her intimate care by a local care agency.  Luckily for her I was able to assist and ensure the male carer wait in the hall.  \r\nIt is not currently a right to have someone of the same gender attend to intimate care.  I think it should be.",
        "background": "I am concerned that some vulnerable and/or elderly people needing intimate personal care, in their own homes or in care homes are having to suffer the indignity of intimate care several times a day, every day and have no right to refuse to have it carried out by someone of the opposite gender.",
