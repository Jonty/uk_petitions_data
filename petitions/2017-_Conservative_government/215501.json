        "action": "Change when employers can dismiss employees without cause back to one year.",
        "additional_details": "You have no options once this happens as the company is not obligated to reinstate you, offer another position, and neither are you entitled to compensation outside their discretion which is quite often unsatisfactory. With the current system, good employees are left with no security.",
        "background": "The qualifying period for unfair dismissal increased from one to two years in April of 2012. This made it easy for a company to dismiss someone after less than two years' employment. You could work for a company for nearly two years and be dismissed for no apparent reason.",
