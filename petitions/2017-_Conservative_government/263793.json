Installation of speed cameras on residential roads is a matter for local highways authorities, usually local councils.\r\n\r\nYou could raise the issue with a local councillor who represents you. You can find your local councillors here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition which calls for a clear action that is the responsibility of the UK Government or Parliament. For example, a petition which calls for reform of the speeding penalties system so that all drivers found guilty of speeding receive a ban from driving.
