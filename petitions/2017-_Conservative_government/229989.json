This is not so.  \r\n\r\nMedicine wastage in the UK costs the NHS around \u00a3300 million with \u00a3110 million of pharmaceuticals returned unopened & unused to pharmacies every year.  Instead of re-issuing these medicines they are incinerated.\r\n\r\nThese drugs should be given to developing countries across the world in the fight against  counterfeit medicines which are rife and are causing actual harm.",

These medicines are incinerated rather than re-issued.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile developing countries are rife with counterfeit medicines.\r\n\r\nGiving our unused unopened medicines to developing countries would relieve sufferring and harm.",
