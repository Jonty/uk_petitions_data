        "action": "The UK must accelerate decarbonisation to limit dangerous climate change",
        "additional_details": "Human activities have caused approximately 1\u00b0C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. This contributes to extreme weather, ecosystem damage, sea-level rise, species extinction, inequality and the mental health crisis. \r\n\r\nAction is urgently needed. Already 60 local authorities in the UK have declared a Climate Emergency. \r\n\r\nWe ask the UK Government to increase its ambition by implementing policies and working with the private sector to accelerate the decarbonisation of our economy.",
        "background": "This petition is calling for the UK Government to accelerate decarbonisation in order to give this and the next generations the best chance of a stable future.\r\n\r\nExisting UK carbon reduction targets do not go far enough to prevent dangerous climate change and more ambition is needed.",
