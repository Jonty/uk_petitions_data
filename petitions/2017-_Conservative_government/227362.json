It is very clear it is difficult for indiviaduals to get off the bus when the bus a isn\u2019t even close enough to the pavement and is to high up or and hasn\u2019t even been lowered down at all. If they are going to refuse it fail to do so they should be getting out to help\r\nIt is dangerous Causes serious risk of further injury & harm",

In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"strong action\". \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for the failure to lower a public bus when required to be made a criminal offence, if that's what you want to happen. If you want bus drivers to be better trained or disciplined, this would be a matter for local bus companies. \r\n\r\nPlease note that you'll need to use your full name to start a new petition. \r\n\r\nLocal bus companies are accountable to Local Authorities. You could therefore raise this issue with your local council. You can find out who your local councillor is here: https://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors"
