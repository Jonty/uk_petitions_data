Sharks have survived 5 mass extinction events, they have been around for 420 million years, do you think we should be responsible for their extinction ? \r\n\r\nSharks play a vital role as apex predators of the oceans, they regulate marine life and maintain a balance. We must act now if we are to save this beautiful, intelligent and gentle fish.",
