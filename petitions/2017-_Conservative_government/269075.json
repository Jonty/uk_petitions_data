        "additional_details": "Cycling enthusiasts can reach speeds of 20mph+, there is a reason why cycling is not allowed in the city/town centre pedestrian areas, this is the safety of pedestrians predominantly.\r\n\r\nNot everybody is able to ride a bicycle, or is physically fit enough to ride a bicycle, this should NOT prohibit people from getting around and taking in some fresh air. \r\n\r\nElectric Scooters are legal to ride on the continent, there are people already using these devices on our roads which needs to be stopped.",
        "background": "All throughout Europe, Asia and the US you can see the use of Electric scooters is thriving.\r\n\r\nThese personal transportation devices are enabling tourists to see more, residents to travel to work and quite frankly when used safely are just good fun!",
