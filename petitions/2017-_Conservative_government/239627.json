        "additional_details": "An ice rink in Leicester would give people something to do instead of potentially causing trouble and being antisocial. There are places that do rollerskating so why not ice skating. There isn\u2019t enough to do in the city, an ice rink would benefit the city in many ways. There are plenty of areas to build one, and there are too many pointless things that have a fortune spent on.. its time something worthwhile was given to us.",
        "background": "Leicester doesn\u2019t have many attractions at all compared to other cities. The Christmas ice rink does well, I think it\u2019s about time a permanent one was brought to the city. It\u2019d be a great place to keep fit and meet new people and make new friends, I would also love to learn and skate regularly.",
