        "action": "Compulsory pedestrian crossings outside schools should be UK Govt. policy.",
        "additional_details": "In 2017, there were 23,805 pedestrian casualties. Of these, 25% were children aged 0-15 and 36% were during school transit hours (7-9am & 3-5pm). 48 were fatalities. Others caused life-changing injuries. Children make up a large percentage of pedestrian casualties - only 19% of the UK population are 0-15 yrs old. Children who can cross roads safely will become adults who will cross roads safely, reducing adult casualties over time, too. This policy can save lives and reduce the economic costs.",
        "background": "Children's lives are at greater risk when crossing busy roads outside schools where there is no pedestrian crossing. UK Govt. policy should compel responsible authorities to install pedestrian crossings where one is not present. Children who use crossings become adults who use crossings.",
