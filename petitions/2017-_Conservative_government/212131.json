They propose guidelines of 3mg/kg per day could be used as a safe amount for habitual caffeine consumption by children and adolescents. This means that while a single can of popular brands on the market can contain around 160mg of caffeine, the EFSA recommends an intake of no more than 105mg caffeine per day for children.  These drinks are simply #NotforChildren",
