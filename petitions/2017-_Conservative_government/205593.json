        "action": "Urge Ofsted to rethink policy of asking Muslim children about wearing a Hijab",
        "additional_details": "The press has picked up on this today (18 November). This matter challenges ethnic minority rights to dress as our cultures allow for, our history, and window washing it as a 'muslim' matter. The majority of white school children are not asked by Ofsted about perming, curling, dying their hair, wearing wigs or make up. What is the difference? Allow us to parent our children appropriately until they are of age.",
        "background": "Amanda Spielman, the head of Ofsted, said the move was to tackle situations in which wearing a hijab \u201ccould be interpreted as sexualisation\u201d of girls as young as four or five. Wearing Hijab is a cultural matter as much as one of 'modesty'. In many societies it's also a norm dress for Christians.",
