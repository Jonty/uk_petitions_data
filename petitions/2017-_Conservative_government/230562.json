        "action": "Allow Pubs/Clubs to have their own policy on tobacco consumption",
        "additional_details": "A society that values private property, freedom of choice and enterprise cannot simply impose a blanket ban, such as the ban on smoking in Pubs. This petition is designed to allow parliament to debate the effectiveness of each landlord being able to declare their pub as smoking/non-smoking as they see fit, with the same consequences and restrictions for those who smoke in non-smoking pubs as exist today.",
        "background": "The blanket ban on smoking in pubs and clubs is illiberal in a society that time and time again calls itself as a free one. There should be a removal of smoking bans in pubs, and the proprietors/owners themselves should be allowed to set their own policies for their own property.",
