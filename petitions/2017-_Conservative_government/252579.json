        "action": "Change general election procedure to include a \"none of the above\" option.",
        "additional_details": "The numbers voting for \"none of the above\" will at least show the number of voters who feel unrepresented, seat by seat. That alone serves a worthwhile democratic purpose. If a majority of voters select \"none the above,\" that seat then does not elect a MP for that term of Parliament. The indicative costs for that MP (perhaps using actuals from the last incumbent), are allocated to be spent on civic good in the same constituency (which can be voted on if necessary, or decided on by local government).",
        "background": "The BREXIT process has tested democracy in the UK. The events of the past three years have been confusing and sometimes shambolic. In response, MPs have clearly established the precedent of rejecting all the available options. Surely that same privilege should extend to voters?",
