        "action": "To provide acceptable levels of border control staff & e-gates at UK airports",
        "additional_details": "It is understood that the government has not been prepared to invest in the e-gates or manning of Border Force desks, leaving airports, airlines and ultimately the public to either pick up the bill or leave the facilities empty resulting in queues and unhappy investors in the UK economy.  Border Force must be properly funded, properly managed and a credit to the UK.  First impressions are lasting impressions, a two hour queue is the latter.",
        "background": "Visitors & UK residents arrive at UK airports to face queues of over two hours to enter the UK.  They face unmanned desks and e-gates closed or not working.  Visitors arriving to do business, invest or spend on holiday are given an appalling experience that is unacceptable",
