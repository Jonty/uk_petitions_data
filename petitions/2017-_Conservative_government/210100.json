        "action": "Ban the terrier men's terriers from trail hunts.",
        "additional_details": "The artificial scents that hunts lay should not lead into a badger sett or into a hole in the ground.\r\nIn traditional foxhunting the terriermen were used to stop/block fox earths and badger setts in the area where the hunting was to take place to prevent foxes from going to ground. The foxes would be located using terriers, dug out and fox bolted to be hunted again by the hounds. It's hard to imagine which roles terriers could now play in trail hunting and shouldn't be found with trail hunts.",
        "background": "Since the Fox Hunting Ban in 2004, the terrier men are now simply there to lay the trail. The terriers are no longer necessary. Terriers were only used to flush out foxes before the ban.",
