        "additional_details": "This petition needs to gain enough support to be discussed in Parliament.....Power of the People may one day change such injustice by Trustees who don't live in the real world. For example ' scrapping the free licence' for over 75's. Lets make change happen and our voices be heard. Thank you.",
        "background": "The BBC is imposed on the UK population. No choice/say. Viewing content, Political bias and highly inflated salaries don't satisfy an impartial/value for money platform. SUBSCRIPTION based services allow freedom of choice. If they get things right then the public will subscribe. Vote for CHOICE!!",
