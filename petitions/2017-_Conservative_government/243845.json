In order to be able to buy the same amount of goods, your salary must increase by at least the same level as inflation.\r\n\r\nWhere the inflation rate outstrips wage increases, you lose money in real terms. You need to spend a higher proportion of your wages to buy the same goods, so your living costs increase.",
