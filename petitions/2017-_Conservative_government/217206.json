Also, they often do not have the ability to request their adult guardian not to smoke, or to take themselves away from the smokey environment.",
        "background": "It has been documented that second-hand smoke is a health hazard, being in an enclosed space increases this risk, with children being particularly vulnerable.\r\nIt is already illegal to smoke in enclosed public spaces, workplaces, in public and work vehicles and in private vehicles carrying children.",
