        "action": "Tougher sentences for criminals carrying out vehicle theft",
        "additional_details": "Over the past 3 years, vehicle theft has increased by over 30%!! 40 police forces within England and Wales reported over 85,000 cases last year alone meaning the true figure is tremendously higher.\r\nThere is a lot of money in vehicle theft and with the sentence currently standing at 12 months (if charged as High Culpability), you can understand why its on the increase as the criminals feel untouchable\r\n\r\nWe demand that Vehicle Theft Criminals MUST face far tougher sentences",
        "background": "I recently went through the emotional torture of having my home broken into, my personal belongings rummaged through all in order to steal my 4 week old car from my driveway.\r\nTo say I'm heartbroken would be an understatement and anyone that has been through similar would understand these feelings.",
