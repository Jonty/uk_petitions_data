        "additional_details": "When leaving school, you have your grades, you have big plans about going to university and starting a life as an individual. But are schools teaching children what and where to go next? NO!\r\nThey don\u2019t teach children what to do when they feel depressed, upset or handle their emotions. Self harm and suicide is on the rise! Schools can help this! \r\nThey don\u2019t teach children how to look into property and buying a house,  pay a bill and setting up direct debts. They NEED to teach life skills.",
        "background": "Schools need to teach children more about how to handle their emotions. Talking to children about what to do with their feelings and how to express them without causing themselves harm. Also life skills, like managing money, building a career and learning how to start a life as an adult.",
