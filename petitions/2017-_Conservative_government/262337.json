        "additional_details": "The reported reason for lifting this ban is local farmers are struggling to manage the increased population of the animal. However elections are due in October & the parties are using this ban withdrawal to attract votes from those who will be hunting and trading in the ivory, of which the Government might be one. \r\nEven under the best conditions, elephant populations are slow growing, because of the elephant's 22-month gestation period, the longest of any mammal.\r\nKilling will make them extinct!",
        "background": "Botswana has lifted their ban on Elephant Hunting! In 2014 a prohibition on such hunting was set this resulted in elephant numbers increasing in some areas. However over the past decade, their population across Africa has still fallen by about 100,000, largely due to poaching. We need to act now.",
