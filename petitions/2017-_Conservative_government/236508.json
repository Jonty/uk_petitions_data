        "additional_details": "There are a number of children involved in this incident, the thought of this programme being aired caused a lot of distress. I emailed the production company many times and also contacted our local MP, but he unfortunately wasn't able to stop the viewing. In the end the footage was removed, but the families endured eight months of upset until they were informed. The families involved, with the event of January 2018 had no control of what happened to their loved ones and also after the incident due to the filming of this programme. This is not only unacceptable. It is morally wrong that these production companies are permitted to cash in other people\u2019s sorrow and heartache.",
        "background": "A serious incident involving my children's family was attended by doctors and film crew for a documentary. The footage was going to be aired, without the consent from families involved. I asked for this not to be shown. Police went to great expense to stop it and were unsuccessful.",
