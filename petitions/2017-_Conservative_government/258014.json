        "additional_details": "I was denied access to a child that i was led to believe was mine for two and a half years.\r\nI was denied access before saying i wasn't the father in court. I then paid for a D.N.A test which she refused to do, before not turning up to court many times and then absconding.\r\nI then had to pay for a private investigator to try and locate them to no avail. \r\nAfter all of this and 7 years i may now to pay \u00a38000 in apparent maintenance arrears which is absolutely absurd. Women should be accountable for thier actions.",
        "background": "Women who prevent men from seeing thier children should not have the right to claim child maintenance. Men are losing their children and having thier lives turned upside down but yet they still have to pay maintenance. The system needs changing so women have a deterent against such behaviour.",
