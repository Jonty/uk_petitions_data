        "action": "Make the history of British colonialism part of high school curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "Britain is a huge multicultural society. Our society, whatever their background need to be taught where they came from and how they got to the positions they are in now. It\u2019s a too wider misconception that there has just been constant mass migrations for no apparent reason. I believe if the history of the British Empire were taught then a lot of what is happening in the present would be sympathised with and more could be done to resolve issues by all ethnicities.",
        "background": "Too many people, especially the new generation do not know anything about the British empire or the colonies which helped make Britain great. Some people are also oblivious to the pain and suffering the Empire caused as well as all the positive impacts it had to less affluent countries.",
