        "action": "Stop all anonymous telephone calls and ban virtual telephone numbers.",
        "additional_details": "It is a simple matter for telephone service providers to identify both of these types of call and to prevent them from being put through to households; indeed, some companies will do this, at a price; effectively colluding with the \"cold callers\" to increase telephone service provider profits.\r\nIt is difficult to imagine a legal need for anyone to with-hold their telephone number or to pretend that they are calling from somewhere else, both of which actions are a deception.",
        "background": "Householders across the UK are plagued by unsolicited telephone calls, which are increasingly automated. The majority of these calls arise from either with-held numbers or virtual numbers. \r\nThe Government should make it illegal for Telephone Service Providers to pass on such telephone calls.",
