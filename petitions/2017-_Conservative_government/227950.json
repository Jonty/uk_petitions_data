        "additional_details": "Distemper, Hepititis and Parvovirus are all conditions which can be tested for, a titre test would be healthier and safer than just routinely repeating the vaccine. \r\nDogs can be FULLY VACCINATED AND STILL CONTRACT THESE CONDITIONS due to vaccine failure or high immunity carried by the dam. Therefore just blindly vaccinating does not work. \r\n\r\nWe believe an independant panel will take a realistic view of the true dangers of vaccination.",

(2014) investigated an outbreak of Lepto in Bern Switzerland.  298 dogs found with Lepto. Vaccination history was available for 251 of these dogs (84.2%) Of these 95% were fully vaccinated.",
