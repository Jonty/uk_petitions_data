Police to be more visable on the streets in daylight hours. To protect, disrupt, deter and take our streets back. It would be unreasonable to expect the same level of policing at night. Admin tasks to be done at night by the nighshift or when its much quieter. Copy the railway model where at nighttime the engineering work is carried out.",
        "background": "More Police on the streets during daylight hours 7am-8pm rather than sitting at desks and in their cars. The public feeling is that we are not even safe in broad daylight. If your nipping crime in the bud at source on the front-line then surely there is less need for the backend tasks.",
