        "additional_details": "The regulation of CBD is a policy decision that needs consultation with consumers, the industry and from Ministers who are answerable to Parliament. Any new regulations must flow from that, so that a successful and growing industry is not suffocated, at the expense of \r\njobs, and the health and wellness of consumers.\r\n\r\nProposed new rules on CBD will impact millions of UK consumers looking for it's therapeutic benefits. \r\n\r\nhttp://ec.europa.eu/food/safety/novel_food/catalogue/search/public/index.cfm#",
        "background": "This potentially renders all CBD products used across EU as unlawful. Evidence shows that cannabinoid products were consumed prior to 1997.\r\n\r\nCBD is not deemed by WHO to pose a risk to human health. This could see the removal of CBD from retailers, leaving a grey market with no quality controls.",
