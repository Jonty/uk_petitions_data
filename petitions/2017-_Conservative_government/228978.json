This is a big problem for students as this tends to make some late and others simply tired.\r\nThe school likes to describe redland and cotham as being close to each other but if i can\u2019t run there in five minutes it is definitely not close so i have come up with the solution for the school to supply the students with some sort of transport so the distance between the schools aren\u2019t as big.",
