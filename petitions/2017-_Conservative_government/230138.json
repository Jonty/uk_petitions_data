        "additional_details": "Homelessness is increasing dramatically in the UK and its getting to a crisis point.Make no mistake these poor people are not there by choice.The homeless are given more assistance in underdeveloped countries through charities than in the UK . Why are they being treated like outcasts and victimised by the people who should in fact be helping them. Homeless people have been fined up to \u00a31,100 and jailed for up to 3 months . Please  sign this petition its so important with winter approaching",
        "background": "Fines and jail sentences have been handed out in the UK for people begging on the street. This grotesque practice is being sanctioned and approved by over 50 Councils in the UK .Many of these people have no where to live and are desperate for food and clothes. Its immoral and inhumane. Please sign",
