        "additional_details": "If you have a voice and disagree with what our government have voted, then please SPEAK UP FOR SYRIA. \r\n\r\nTheresa may avoided a vote in parliament and went ahead in agreeing to bombing Syria. \r\n\r\nA Voice For Syria believes parliament should be called back in to vote on all future conflict engagements. \r\n\r\nWe highly believe the British public should have entitlement to vote. Just as we do with the elections and just as we did with brexit!\r\n\r\nSign this petition, spread awareness and let's make a change!",
        "background": "Since 2011 Syrian families have been living in conflict. It's April 2018 and Syria still remains in conflict. \r\n\r\n7 years of murder, terrorism and extremism to such extent is unacceptable.\r\nTheresa may recently voted in to bomb Syria with deadly missiles along side the US and France. \r\nWE VOTE NO!!",
