        "additional_details": "Our nation\u2019s young adults are able to bring the energy, enthusiasm and hard work to revitalize our public service sectors. Driving ambulances, escorting elderly patients to and from medical procedures and helping out in the classroom (with the necessary background checks); these six weeks would provide not only an immense service to our country but also an ideological grounding for its citizens. The UK is experiencing a time of increasing social divide in which our people feel estranged from the nation as a whole. Working hands-on with members of our community would deepen our understanding of our society and revolutionize the role we feel we play in it. An elevated feeling of responsibly towards our society will prove imperative to its success.",
        "background": "There are some 750,000 18-year-olds in the UK. Their service to our nation would not only be an invaluable help to our understaffed, overstretched national health and education services but would also reestablish the commitment and responsibility we, as individuals, feel towards our community.",
