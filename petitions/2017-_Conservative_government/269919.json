        "additional_details": "Assault on police officers has risen year on year. 10,399 assaults that caused injuries last year \u2013 up 32 per cent from 7,903 recorded in 2015/16.\r\n\r\nArticle 2 Right To Life should allow frontline officers to carry a sidearm through option/choice with correct training provided. Officers will still be held to account where applicable by PSD/IPCC. Only 5% of officers are authorised to carry firearms which is not nearly enough to tackle the rise in violent crime and officers being injured.",
        "background": "Too many police officers are injured or seriously harm in the line of duty. Statistics show a year on year increase with no sign of slowing down or stopping. Sign this petition for police officers to routine carry a sidearm as many other countries do.",
