        "additional_details": "Shown in recent events of Climate Change protests by this younger generation, now more than ever is the time to lower the voting age to 16. Due to the rise of news being more readily available in relation to the rise in use of technology and social media, younger people learn about problems within the country and will be able to form an opinion on these issues, they should be able to act on them, just like those older than them are able to do.",
        "background": "Young people are the future, and often, the topics that are being decided by referendums and voted for by people over the age of 18 will affect the lives of these young people. Since Brexit has been publicized so much, many more young people are educated about the topic of politics.",
