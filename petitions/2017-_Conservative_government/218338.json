        "action": "Alter service criteria to allow Bulimia Nervosa patients better treatment access",
        "additional_details": "Most sufferers of Bulimia Nervosa have chaotic eating habits and often seek help when actively attempting to interrupt their own symptoms. This can affect their ability to meet the 'daily bingeing / purging' criterion. BMI is also often arbitrary in cases of BN as fluctuations in weight are massive and weight is extremely unstable. \r\n\r\nServices should take a more holistic approach when assessing an individual, and the inappropriate criteria should be altered or removed entirely from the process.",
        "background": "Eating Disorder services across the U.K use BMI and daily bingeing / purging criteria to assess access to treatment for Bulimia Nervosa sufferers. If the specific criteria is not met, sufferers are refused treatment. This perpetuates the disorder and leads to crisis situations.",
