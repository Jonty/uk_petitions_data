        "additional_details": "Unless you subscribe to BT broadband, or BT TV, or EE mobile network which is owned by BT, there is no way to watch BT sports without a very expensive and long subscription. Their main competitor, Sky TV, supply the Now TV service which you can buy a day pass for a small amount of money and watch on many compatible devices. BT provide no way of watching without a long and expensive subscription to a BT product. This is anti competitive and should be investigated.",
        "background": "Sports on TV in the UK is often put up for auction and several partners will be buy to make the market more competitive. However, to view BT sports, you have to take out a 12 month subscription at a high monthly price unless you also subscribe to another BT product. This is anti competitive.",
