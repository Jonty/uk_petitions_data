        "action": "Revert Ofqual's decision to remove GCSE Computer Science NEA",
        "additional_details": "Ofqual started this consultation because they found evidence of cheating, they claim that \"2,000\" students read this online solution out of the 70,000 + students studying Computer Science GCSE this year. Why should the other 89,000 students be punished for something which is entirely unfair? \r\n\r\nThe 20 hours wasted could have been spent revising for the exam, going over topics that are confusing or students are finding hard to understand. Learn new exam skills, but no, Ofqual wants students to continue the NEA even though it will not count towards the student's grade.",
        "background": "Ofqual has announced that the NEA for Computing Science will no longer count towards a students 9 to 1 grade. \r\n\r\nI urge Ofqual to revert this change. Especially as it was done halfway through the year.",
