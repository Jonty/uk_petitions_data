The group there donations were given to are pushing material into UK schools advocating against medically recognised best practice of supporting transgender children, as well as having the the support of journalists, and ear of several politicians and clinicians.\r\n\r\nBut who are these donations from?\r\nWho is influencing British policy?",
        "background": "The recent phenomenon of Crowdfunding allows pressure groups to be founded and funded with little accountability. These groups then gain influence in British politics and with the media, allowing one sided arguments to be presented without any accountability who is funding them.",
