This means that all GM foods, including flour, cooking oils and glucose syrups from a GM source, have to be labelled as GM. We're therefore not sure what further action you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to take. You can find out more information here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/genetically-modified-foods\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do - for example, you could call for a UK-wide ban on imported GM foods or ingredients."
