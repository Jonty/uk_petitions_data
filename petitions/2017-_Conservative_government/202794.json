        "action": "End the right of Anglican Bishops to have 26 seats in the House of Lords.",
        "additional_details": "The right of Church of England Bishops to sit in the House of Lords is a tradition that continues from mediaeval times. The UK is the only parliament in the world that accords a unique privileged status to religious representatives. Known as 'Lords Spiritual' these 26 Church of England Bishops occupy a position of political power that is no longer relevant in a country where so few identify with the Anglican church. If Bishops wish to represent UK people, why should they not stand for election?",
        "background": "Although only 15% British citizens are practising Anglicans, and this falls to 3% for those under 24. This is a continuing trend, yet the UK parliament allows 26 unelected Anglican Bishops to sit in the House of Lords. This privileged, undemocratic, discriminatory, anachronism cannot continue.",
