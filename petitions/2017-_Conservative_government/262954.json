They do not improve access to justice and reduce legal costs. They will also be introduced using only a statutory instrument which means MPs do not even get the chance to debate this important issue. My response to the consultation is found at https://legalcommentary.blogspot.com/2019/05/why-i-dont-agree-with-fixed-recoverable_15.html",
        "background": "The MOJ on 28/3/19 proposed changes to how much of its legal costs a winning party can recover from a losing party in a civil claim. The changes concern our rule of law & access to civil justice for cases worth up to \u00a3100k. They should be properly debated and only implemented as primary legislation.",
