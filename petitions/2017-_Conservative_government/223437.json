        "action": "Make gender-neutral passports available for British citizens",
        "additional_details": "In a recent dispute the high court was told gender-neutral passports would affect legislation, be prohibitively expensive and increase the need for consular support for British citizens.\r\n\r\nNone of which negates the fact that we still need them, whatever the cost, and that if legislation doesn't account for non-binary and intersex people, it badly needs revising.\r\n \r\nGender-neutral passports are already recognised internationally. Ten countries currently offer a third gender option, 'X', or unknown.",
        "background": "The UK government currently allows only 'M'/'F' gender markers on travel documents, which effectively erases many non-binary and intersex people. I would urge the government to recognise these already marginalised groups.",
