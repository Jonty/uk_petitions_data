To make a change for those who suffer from mental health, suicide numbers are increasing daily, and many people are fighting their inner demons alone! Theres so little knownledge for mental health and even those who suffer do not understand it fully themselfs. Its time to make a change and get the funding for mental health services now.",
        "background": "As a mental health suffer it is hard to get the support myself and so many others need as there isnt enough funding going into the services and so many of us are left waiting for 6 months+ by which time it can be too late",
