        "additional_details": "All three scenarios must be on the ballot requiring two votes.  There are two ways to do this:\r\n1)\tFirst vote all three on the ballot.  Second vote between two highest from first vote.\r\n2)\tFirst vote between two leave scenarios, no deal or May's deal. Second vote between winner of first vote and no Brexit.\r\nThis is fair and logical and gives a proper mandate for the outcome that everyone can accept.",
        "background": "Politicians have identified three positions on Brexit all with merit: no deal in order to freely negotiate future with EU and other countries; May's deal giving a close relationship with and smooth exit from EU; no Brexit which some see as better than other deals. Resolution - a three way referendum",
