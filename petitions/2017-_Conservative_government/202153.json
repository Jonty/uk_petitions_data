        "action": "Introduce specialist juries for rape trials, not random jurors",
        "additional_details": "A rape trial case went for retrial as a juror got arrested with drugs. Second jury chose to help defendant and defendants' barrister was more prepared.\r\n\r\nVictim had ribs broken. She had been controlled, bullied and traumatised. She had to go through two rape trials. Defendant had no witnesses in original trial, but had four in last trial. Victim was bullied in court by barrister. It was horrific, not justice.\r\n",
        "background": "Specialist juries who understand how complex and serious rape is could prevent mistrials and mean that more rapists are found guilty. They should be introduced in rape cases to protect victims and make sure rapists go to prison.",
