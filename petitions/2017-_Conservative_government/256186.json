A total of 46.5 million voters were registered, and 72.2% of these turned out. Thus, 17.4 million voted to Leave and 16.1 million to Remain.\r\n\r\nThe Government would be faced with reality - a wake up call \r\nLose tax revenue from 17.4M or Act responsibly, execute Brexit (potentially no deal) and restore democracy.\r\nNoting EU is unlikely to give an inch - history clearly shows this.",

Brexit voters are democrats, as we no longer have that system, why should we pay in (via Taxes).  \r\nIssue Tax exemptions for all Brexit Voters.",
