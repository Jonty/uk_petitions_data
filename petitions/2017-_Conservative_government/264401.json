        "additional_details": "Alternative plans which enhance public transport and sustainable transport options (including the Oxford-Cambridge rail link) and which encourage targeted development around existing urban centres rather than spread along a road corridor, would be cheaper, quicker to implement, cause less disruption, have fewer harmful emissions, cause less noise, safeguard valuable land, and improve public health and wellbeing.",
        "background": "This new motorway will be a major source of air and noise pollution, destroy farmland and habitats, disrupt local communities, increase CO2 emissions and increase traffic on existing roads. It will adversely affect population health and wellbeing, climate change, local ecology and the countryside.",
