        "additional_details": "I urge Govt to pause (not cancel) Brexit, committing to reduce involvement in EU by 80% by 2050 (relative to 1990 levels, measured by whatever creative accountancy the Government deems appropriate in response to the problems of EU membership); and in the meantime to fundamentally reform our political and economic systems as far as is necessary to reduce TOTAL UK emissions to net-zero by 2030 (including aviation, shipping, agriculture and imports/exports).  Once done, consider continuing Brexit.",
        "background": "The Government and Parliament are paralysed by Brexit and are unable to do anything about the Climate and Ecological Crisis until Brexit is resolved.  They believe the UK population thinks 'Brexit now' is more important than 'a hospitable planet in 30 years' time'.",
