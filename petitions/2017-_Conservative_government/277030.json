        "additional_details": "Jack was having a drink with a group of friends, in which his attacker was part of. The offender suddenly smashed a pint glass into Jack's face/eye, leaving him with on-going needed surgery/medical attention and life changing suffering. Attacks involving glasses are becoming more and more common and more people are getting hurt, physically and mentally and this could be avoided if there were no glasses available.",
        "background": "The reason I am setting up this petition is because my brother, in November 2018 was attacked with the use of a glass as the weapon. This attack has changed his life forever and has ongoing problems for him. Attacks involving glasses are becoming more common and are ruining more people's lives.",
