        "action": "Change the crime of killing by drink driving to manslaughter.",
        "additional_details": "Causing death due to drink driving in the UK is sentenced as death by dangerous driving. The average custodial sentence for causing death by careless/dangerous driving was just under four years in 2015.\r\n240 times a year someone is killed by a drink driver in the UK. This means nearly 5 times a week someone in the UK loses their mom, dad, child, partner or friend.\r\nBeing in a vehicle makes their sentence more lenient than manslaughter. That is not justice for those who lose their lives.",
        "background": "My dad at 13 years old lost his mother because someone got behind the wheel after drinking. This person served less than 3 years in prison.\r\nDrink driving fits the definition of manslaughter, they may mean no malice but knowing the risk still choose to drive, so should be punished accordingly.",
