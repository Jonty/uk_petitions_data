        "additional_details": "Israel is a legitimate state and it deserves to be able to choose its own capital and not have it dictated by other states, which would make as much sense as Paris telling us that Leeds is our capital. Israel is a close ally of ours, and they deserve our recognition of their chosen capital. More so now that the US just did so and the world came to terms with the fact, with all agitated parties having calmed down already and with reports coming in of more then 10 countries about to do the same.",
        "background": "Jerusalem has been the bibical capital of Israel for 3000 years. Following the recent declaration of our closest ally, the US, which is the leader of the free world, confirming this fact, it would be a most logical move of the UK to do the same, and thereby allow Israel to choose its own capital.",
