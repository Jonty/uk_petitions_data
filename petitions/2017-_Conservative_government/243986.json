        "additional_details": "Fracking has proven to cause water pollution and earthquakes in the USA which can have dire consequences. Even if it was safe, should we start becoming less reliant on fossil fuel? They won't be around forever and we need to be prepared for when that time comes. A government survey recently showed that only 16% of people support fracking. We are a country of democracy and should respect the will of the public.",
        "background": "Stop Fracking right away or any other drilling\u2019s in the ground for supplies. 17 earthquakes have happened in the last 5 months in Surrey, one just hitting 2 days ago with a magnitude of 3. This never used to happen in the uk! Why can\u2019t we keep UK to be that \u201cone of the safest countries\u201d?",
