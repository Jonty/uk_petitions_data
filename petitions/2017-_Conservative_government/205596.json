        "additional_details": "The Muslim Council of Britain secretary-general, Harun Khan, responded to the move saying: \u201cIt is deeply worrying that Ofsted has announced it will be specifically targeting and quizzing young Muslim girls who choose to wear the headscarf.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt sends a clear message to all British women who adopt this that they are second-class citizens, that while they are free to wear the headscarf, the establishment would prefer that they do not,\u201d he said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe many British Muslims who choose to wear the headscarf have done extremely well in education and are breaking glass ceilings. It is disappointing that this is becoming policy without even engaging with a diverse set of mainstream Muslim voices on the topic,\u201d he added.",
        "background": "Amanda Spielman has allowed inspectors to quiz girls about why they wear hijab and schools can be penalised for allowing the hijab. This goes against basic human rights.It targets only one particular set namely Muslim girls. It is a way to force Muslims to not wear hijab.",
