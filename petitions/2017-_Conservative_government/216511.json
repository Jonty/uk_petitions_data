        "additional_details": "Following Down's Syndrome day and working in the early years sector my passion for this has spiked. \r\nWe learn to communicate during our early years and language is something we hear all around us everyday to enable us to communicate effectively, yet we don't all consider teaching signing as routine to enable communication for all. Doing this would offer inclusion for those using signing daily and enable others to communicate with their peers.",
        "background": "Communication should be for all. By making British sign language part of the curriculum, we would offer inclusion and equality for those using signing to support their daily communication. Learning signing would enable all children to interact despite their disability.",
