This affects hundreds of properties around the country, despite being in busy towns and cities, they cannot get fast broadband. \r\nThe current UK broadband backend provider (Openreach) must be take over the costs and be held responsible \r\nFailing this the government must set up a fund to unlock these lines, in order to offer all super-fast broadband.",

Due to the way the lines have been configured, EO lines that go directly into the exchange (no cabinet) cannot get super- fast broadband. This is not the fault of the home owner.",
