        "action": "Drastically improve funding for mental health services",
        "additional_details": "One in four people will experience or may have already experienced mental health problems. The Government really need to start helping those in need and support those that are in need of help. Increased funding to mental health services will drastically reduce the waiting time children, adolescents and adults have to wait to begin counselling and therapy.",
        "background": "I have personally experienced the impact of the cuts to mental health services when I needed the help the most and I know I am not the only one who has experienced this: child or adult. There needs to be far more funding and support from the Government, but more importantly the Minister of Health.",
