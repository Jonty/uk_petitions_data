A similar system should exist in the UK to vet potential visitors from non-eu countries.",
        "background": "Currently, USA, Canada and Australia require foreign visitors (including British people) to complete a visa entry application prior to travel. Anybody with a historical criminal record must apply for a police certificate and await clearance from those countries, before being allowed entry.",
