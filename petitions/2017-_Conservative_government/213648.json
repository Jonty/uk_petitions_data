        "action": "Lower uni fees or scrap them entirely",
        "additional_details": "Charging sky high fees and charging a 3% inflation annually whilst studying many students are put off going to uni. If the uk wants to be a leading country we need to invest in our youth, a nationwide free uni scheme or even a nationwide reduction of student fees would open up opportunities for many unable to access uni currently and this in turn will lead to a greater work force and raise productivity having lifted the burden of debt.",
        "background": "The UK is one of the most expensive countries to study at university, fees are extorniate and students are left riddled with debt. This is a petition to see if we are able to lower university fees so students don\u2019t carry on their working life with debt and everyone gets a fairer chance.",
