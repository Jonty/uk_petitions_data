        "additional_details": "If they are not killed they are abandoned usally with their ears cut off so they can't trace them back to whoever had the dog last.They would trace them back by the tattoos the greyhound racer puts in their ears (which would be excrutating pain to the greyhound while being done)And they are not killed humanly either like how the vets do it whoever is in charge of killing uses a blot gun(which is somehow legal)I think all dogs should have a loving home and a great life.Search greyhound racing cruelty for websites that can give more info on this.",
        "background": "If animal abuse is illigal why isn't this?They are usally kept in bad living conditions such as having to sleep in a conrete floor not getting fed enough ex.Most dogs will get beat if they don't win and once they are too old they are killed and thrown in a mass grave as if they are worth nothing.",
