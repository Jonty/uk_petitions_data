        "additional_details": "Due to this lack of clarity police are called to such instances around 89% of times, wasting police time as they can not enforce anything except ensure there is no breach in peace as the matter is of a civil nature. \r\n\r\nIf warrants had stated thereon the powers of entry a bailiff or enforcement may have according to the type of warrant they are present to execute, this would be beneficial all parties including the police as they generally have no knowledge about the rights of these agents",
        "background": "Civil enforcement agencies and bailiffs are a private entity which are used to recover debt. There have been a large number of cases where these enforcement agents are providing misleading information occupiers at properties which generally leaves no choice but to make payments in full.",
