        "additional_details": "It is a major concern for many of us here, and also many in the Irish Republic and the EU, that a `hard border' between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland will cause serious unrest.\r\n\r\nThe Good Friday Agreement of 1998 ended the violence and terrorism. but this will return once customs and immigration controls are reimposed. It is reason enough to stop the process of leaving the EU. The safety of the British people is too important to be sacrificed for what is in reality vague promises",
        "background": "Peace in Northern Ireland is a valuable achievement, given decades of sectarian violence before 1998. No vague promises of benefits on Brexit can compensate for losing this. Allowing for consultation with the other states, if no settlement  by 1 October, we must withdraw Article 50.",
