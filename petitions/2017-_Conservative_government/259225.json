Surely, however, they left it too late to agree a delay that could not have received Royal Assent before 29th March 2019. Is our Constitution also subservient to the corrupt EU? Volte le la Reine?\r\nNegotiation with EU has been pointless and artificial. WTO needs no transition - GATT 24 allows continued tariff free trade and customs free access. Knows HMG not this?",
        "background": "Enacted legislation received Royal Assent that we leave EU in March. MPs, PM and EU preferred Brexit be delayed but this has not received Royal Assent. By law we have left the EU already. Any Votes or Agreements since are invalid. HMG should announce this, embrace WTO rules and celebrate our freedom",
