        "additional_details": "We believe the correct way forward is to suspend the process pending a full public enquiry and the establishment of a correct and ethical second referendum.\r\n\r\nThis is the only way to ensure that the public voice is heard and that lessons are learned from the mistakes that have clearly been made by some many involved in this fiasco.\r\n\r\nOnly through a clear process of analysis and learning can we find a solution to this issue which represents the people of the UK and most importantly not repeat them",
        "background": "The British public are appalled by the actions of politicians over the handling of Brexit from the lies and spending scandal through to the lack of planning and inability to reach a consensus.\r\n\r\nWe believe the handling of Brexit has eroded the publics faith in politics.",
