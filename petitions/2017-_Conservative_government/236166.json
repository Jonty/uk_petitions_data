        "background": "This country is being destroyed by internal civil wars in both parties.\r\nThe only sensible course is for both parties to split up, but they cannot do so because, much like when a couple splits up there's a big fight over who gets the house & the kids.\r\nThere are laws to deal with that for couples.",
