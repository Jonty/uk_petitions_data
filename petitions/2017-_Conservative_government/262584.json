        "additional_details": "Evidence\r\nThe lack of Labour representatives on all news and media shows since 2010. \r\nThe volume of appearances by non parliamentary voices like Nigel Farage.\r\nThe volume of appearances by Parliamentary party's in relation to non parliamentary parties. \r\nEg Green, Snp, party representation compared to Ukip and now the Brexit party. \r\nElected party's should not be losing airtime, and their voice for party's that are not representing the people in Parliament.",
        "background": "BBC news and media output should reflect the Parliament of the day as much as it can. \r\nSince 2010 this hasn't happened.\r\nWhether it's the ratio of guests on question time, or the constant platforming of non parliamentary voices the BBC is complicit in the airing of extreme views.",
