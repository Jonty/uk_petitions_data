        "additional_details": "I believe Conversion Therapy is a deceptive and a profoundly dangerous practice. It has been discredited by health organisations worldwide including the NHS, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, British Psychological Society and RCP.\r\nThis petition calls for the legal ban of Conversion Therapy and demands legislation be introduced by the UK Government to criminalise its practices. Only then may we claim the UK as a leading force in treating its LGBTQI people as equal citizens.",
        "background": "The UK Government is aware of the dangers of Conversion Therapy (CT), known as \u201cgay cure\u201d. Equalities Minister, Penny Mordaunt described CT as a \u201charmful process which, in its most extreme form, includes corrective rape\u201d. Victims of CT have reportedly been tortured and left sexless and suicidal.",
