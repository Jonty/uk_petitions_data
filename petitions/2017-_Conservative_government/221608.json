        "additional_details": "East Midlands Airport in Leicestershire is the absolute logical choice for expanding the UK's network. It's got a HUGE runway (already handles 747s, A380s and An-124s), it's right next to the M42 (for M6) and M1, and it's on the route of HS2. If it has to be in London, then Gatwick is by far a more sensible option when you consider disruption, pollution, and cost.",
        "background": "More expansion for London, which the residents don't want. More pollution, years of misery on the M25, and wasting taxpayer money in an outdated hub-and-spoke airport operating model. The rest of the UK would love the chance to expand their infrastructure.",
