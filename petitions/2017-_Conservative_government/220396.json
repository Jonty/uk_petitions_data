Both outcomes resulting in cost implications and a waste of money, time and resources. Small schools should be made exempt.",
        "background": "The Lord Lyon King of Arms act 1672 is an outdated law requiring registration of coats of arms. Schools which have used logos for years which unknowingly contravened these laws are being asked to pay the \u00a31800 registration fee which could be better used for resources and services to aid education.",
