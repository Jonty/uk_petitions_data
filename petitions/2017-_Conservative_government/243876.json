My father is now 74 years old lays in a bed legs locked up stiff screaming at a high pitch. We have endless days watching helplessly as such a brave man looks like a corpse and disintegrates in front of our eyes. It's time we were able to protect our loved ones' dignity and release and relieve their souls from these inhumane illnesses. It's so heart-wrenching for family to see.",
