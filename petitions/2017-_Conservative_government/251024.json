        "additional_details": "Almost all retailers ship garments on hangers into their stores. These garments range from Lingerie and swimwear to Coats. \r\nThese products would easily be hung when they arrive in store (as some retailers already do) which would reduce our plastic waste dramatically!\r\nThis would be a small step to make our retailers more environmentally friendly.",
        "background": "Millions of plastic hangers are shipped into the UK every year by our high street retailers. This plastic production has a huge impact on the environment in China and creates a huge amount of plastic waste after garments are purchased.",
