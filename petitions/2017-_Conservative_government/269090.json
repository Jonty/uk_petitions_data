        "additional_details": "That failure could mean that the decision to leave the EU has not been made with the care and attention our constitution requires, and might therefore be overturned by the courts.\r\n\r\nWe ask Parliament to debate:\r\na) how much the 2016 vote reflected people\u2019s dissatisfaction with the broader status quo, rather than genuine concerns over our membership of the EU; and\r\nb) whether fundamental reform of the UK\u2019s domestic political system might more truly honour the will of the people than leaving the EU.",
        "background": "In the referendum, a majority voted for the only change on offer. But we don\u2019t know how many were primarily giving vent to rage and hostility they feel towards the system as a whole; and the government failed to explore whether less disruptive reforms might satisfy the public\u2019s hunger for change.",
