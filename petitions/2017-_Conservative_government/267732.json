        "action": "Make tracking devices compulsory on all new and existing motor vehicles",
        "additional_details": "Fitting tracking devices will result in a huge reduction in vehicle related crime. Police will be able to locate stolen vehicles and vehicles in the area of robberies, burglaries, hit and run accidents, fly-tipping and theft of livestock for example. Gangs using stolen scooters would be stopped and speeding greatly reduced. Foreign vehicles would have to hire temporary tracking devices when they enter the UK.",
        "background": "The government gets \u00a328 billion a year from tax on fuel; as petrol and diesel vehicles are phased out the tax will be obtained from tracking devices fitted to all motor vehicles. The technology for this is already in use for monitoring young drivers  and by companies monitoring their vehicles.",
