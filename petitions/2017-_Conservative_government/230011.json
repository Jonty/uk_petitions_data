        "additional_details": "The IPCC report released this week suggests that a 1.5 degree warming will have a significant impact on our planet, the environment and our communities. Whilst the use of green energy will go a long way it is clear that the behaviour of the public needs to change. Research has shown that the public would shop more sustainably if the impact on the climate/emissions were clear and visible on packaging. Therefore it is logical to use a climate impact value to enforce sustainable behaviours.",
        "background": "Following the latest IPCC report it is clear we need to change our behaviours. To make shopping decisions easier regarding the impact of our purchases on the climate food should have a clear climate impact value based on the impact of the production and supply chain of the product on the climate",
