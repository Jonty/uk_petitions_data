MPs are already required to register and declare financial interests, and to avoid conflicts of interest.\r\n\r\nYou can find the Code of Conduct for the House of Commons here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/code-of-conduct-and-rules-of-the-house/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the Code of Conduct, if that's what you would like to happen.
