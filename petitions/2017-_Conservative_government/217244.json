        "additional_details": "Now the government threatens to build a motorway here that would engulf this sanctuary.\r\n\r\nOne of the proposed routes would cut across miles of Green Belt land, passing through ancient woodlands on its way to Otmoor.\r\n\r\nBecause the government has turned down our demands for a Public Enquiry, the decision will now be made behind closed doors. \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition to demand protection for this national treasure and save Otmoor for future generations. \r\n\r\nwww.SaveOtmoor.org\r\n#SaveOtmoor",
        "background": "Otmoor is a unique and beautiful habitat of rare wetland and grazing floodplain,1000 acres of nature reserve that is home to over sixty protected species. \r\n\r\nJust 50 miles from the urban sprawl of London, Otmoor is a conservation area the government's own laws were designed to protect.",
