        "additional_details": "This petitioners have irrefutable evidence that shows a two tier justice system, in the UK. The aim is to present to Parliament evidence that shows multiple situations, in which, the police &  judges do not prosecute wealthy people. The misuse of drugs act 1971 states that, it is illegal to knowingly allow drugs to be sold and used on a premises that you own or manage. In this case, police and judges ignored crimes committed by wealthy individuals. Whilst, they prosecute the poor.",
        "background": "This petition advocates for a equal and fair justice system. A legal system, in which, crimes committed both poor and rich people are investigated and prosecuted equally. Wealthy people shouldn\u2019t receive lesser punishment, than the poor. In some case, crimes committed by rich are not investigated.",
