        "action": "Allow Reggae to be played on mainstream radio",
        "additional_details": "We are calling for change to ensure that a country that wants to encourage all communities to accept each other, are introduced to music that appeals to everyone. Reggae artists do not receive the same wage as pop artists, and it encourages segregation amongst the British people. There are very talented musicians that are not heard because there music is not found in the UK charts. There are also pioneers of reggae that don't own the rights to their work.",
        "background": "Reggae is not played on mainstream radio, yet the UK states it is a diverse and inclusive nation. Reggae artist music unless it is commercial is only allowed to be played on pirate radio stations.\r\nThis doesn't allow reggae artists to make a good living or become as renowned as pop artists.",
