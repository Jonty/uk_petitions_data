        "additional_details": "Burnham will have an increased population size due to many planned and approved developments, most of which have less than 1 car per dwelling. 40% of residents are on or below the poverty line. The largest property owner is a housing association.  Many households lack the means or funds to transport excess household waste to the proposed distant alternative recycling sites increasing the likely incidents of fly tipping. The budget decision ignores the impact on nearby Berks and RBWM residents.",
        "background": "Bucks County Council have chosen to close Burnham household recycling centre in Sept 2019. This will significantly impact Burnham and nearby residents who use this site. Travel to the nearest alternate sites will impact the local environment, increase the carbon footprint and fly tipping.",
