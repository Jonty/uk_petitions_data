        "additional_details": "I personally believe that glasses should be free to whoever needs them if they cannot afford them, there should be some sort of scheme, not only the NHS. Appointments are free for students but after that you have to pay between \u00a369-\u00a3200 for a pair of glassss not including the extra charges to get special lenses fitted in for anyone with eye deficiencies, like myself. If abortions & sex changes through the NHS are free, why do we have to pay for a pair of glasses? - Let\u2019s make a change!",
        "background": "As if being a full time student on a budget isn\u2019t hard enough, as soon as I reached 19 years old I was no longer allowed to receive free glasses. Obviously, this was very annoying seeing as I need them, because of my astigmatism I need special lenses which cost a FORTUNE!",
