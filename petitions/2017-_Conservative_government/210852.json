        "additional_details": "I am an anorexia survivor and I strongly believe that it is wrong to be portraying the message to vulnerable young people that they can only eat a certain number of calories a day. The campaign encourages restricting your intake. \r\nIt is not fair to put this pressure onto young children when they already have so much stress in our society. It is not acceptable to say that children should restrict their diets to lose weight. Instead we should be focusing on healthy eating rather than restricting.",
        "background": "I recognise that there is an obesity problem in the uk but that is no excuse for putting harmful and unhealthy messages online. Imagine it was your child or younger sibling who started to refuse to eat certain foods, this can lead to potentially life threatening mental health issues.",
