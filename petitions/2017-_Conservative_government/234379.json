        "additional_details": "I am lucky if my daily commute from Bishop's Stortford to London is ever on time or disrupted in one way or another. I pay approximately  \u00a3500 a month, or \u00a36,000 for a service which is miles away from being worth it, but I am left with little option to get to work each day (if I'm lucky).\r\n\r\nFares have beeing increased nearly 10% in the last 4 years and there have been no improvements made. Broken down trains which don't get replaced. Trains are late EVERY DAY. Trains are overcrowded.",
        "background": "The Abellio Greater Anglia service worsens on a monthly basis, all the while annually raising rail fares inexplicably. Cancellations, regularly late running trains, reduced carriages, overcrowding, extortionate fares. No remorse for their customers & no sign of reinvestment in the service. Get rid!",
