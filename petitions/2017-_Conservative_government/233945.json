So much of this \"deal\" is being kept under wraps...i personally dont see how this is in any shape a fair deal for our great nation which is already suffering.\r\nDont think for a secind its better than a no deal.\r\nNo deal means were taking back control.\r\nIt wont be easy...but nothing is. \r\nWe need to invest back into our own country,  businessess and agriculture, fishing,  put money back into the NHS, support our veterans and our elderly. Deport any prisoners that are not British citizens,  charge for nhs treatment to non British citizens...come on people. Im no MP far from it but we need to get control back and learn to thrive again",
