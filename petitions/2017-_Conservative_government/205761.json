We @DefraGovUK will work urgently to identify further action.\"\r\n\r\nMany coffee shops like Costa and Starbucks offer customers the option to provide their own cup, usually encouraged by a small discount. This incentive, combined with the extra cost of a cup tax, should encourage many people to make a small sustainable change.",
        "background": "Based on the success of the single use plastic bag tax of October 2015, a single use cup tax would help encourage more people to switch to reusable coffee cups, further reducing the UK's plastic waste output.",
