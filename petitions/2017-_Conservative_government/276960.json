        "additional_details": "There needs to be more provision made to ensure that someone who is going through a miscarriage is able to have space away from clinics/wards where there are people who are still pregnant. Women going through stillbirth should not be on wards where they can hear labouring women and crying newborns. Some hospitals have made good headway with this, but there are unfortunately still some who don't separate treatment for patients going through a scare or a loss, and this needs to change.",
        "background": "A previous similar petition was closed due to an election; why, in 2019, are couples going through a loss often made to sit in and be treated on the same clinics as women who are still pregnant? This makes the experience all the more painful and difficult to come to terms with.",
