The accused stood trial, was found guilty in June 2017 and has been sentenced.  He is currently appealing the sentence.  Foreign Office officials have followed this case closely, and will do so during the ongoing appeal process. We have offered Mr Davies\u2019 family support since his murder in 2011 and do so until the case has concluded. \r\n\r\nThe investigation in Reunion, trial and the appeal process has been conducted in accordance with French law. As HMG does not interfere in the judicial processes of another country, it would not be appropriate to raise this case with the French government.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
