        "additional_details": "Brexit has shown a huge divide across the country, mainly caused by promises made and not kept.  Political manifestos in the following General Election make statements that have not been kept.  MPs made promises to their constituents which they have blatantly not kept, therefore deceiving the voters.  Yvette Cooper MP posted thousands of leaflets stating that she would abide by the referendum result, that there would not be a second referendum - she lied to her constituents.",
        "background": "Brexit and the subsequent General Election allowed all parties to make promises that have not been kept.  MPs campaigned in their constituencies making promises and statements that they then abandoned once elected.  We, the People have been lied to once too often and they should be held accountable.",
