        "additional_details": "In 1975 People agreed to REMAIN in the European COMMUNITY (EEC or Common Market & EURATOM= European Atomic Energy Community on nuclear security, energy, medicine).  Later, articles changed EEC treaty into Lisbon Treaty creating European UNION. In 2016 People voted LEAVE the EU only - meaning modifications to EEC are illegal. HMG must keep UK a member of Euratom. A legal referendum on EURATOM is required before UK can leave it.\r\nHMG cannot withdraw from Euratom until after People vote to do so.",
        "background": "Brexit Referendum  voted: Leave EU. NO hint of Euratom. No HMG publication, no Parliament statement, no ministerial speech said UK could leave Euratom. 1975 Referendum voted REMAIN.\r\nAction required by Government & Parliament:\r\n1. Withdraw Article 50 Letter\r\n2. Hold debate and Referendum on Euratom.",
