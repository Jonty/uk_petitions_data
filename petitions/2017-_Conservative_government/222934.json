        "additional_details": "Although not involving a chemical like an addiction to smoking, alcohol or drugs the problem or compulsive gambler is just as much an  addict. They will have financial and relationship problems. They could end up in prison or even committing suicide - suggested rates being 20%.\r\nIn 1965 the British Government banned tobacco advertising and in 2005 banned sponsorship of global events.\r\nThey need to do the same with gambling and betting firm sponsorships before more lives are ruined.",
        "background": "Gambling addictions are costing the country \u00a31.2bn.\r\nThe increasing relationship between football and gambling is normalising gambling  and influencing our vulnerable children and young people. 24/7 access to online betting via smart phones will soon cause a national epidemic. It needs to be stopped",
