        "action": "The Home Secretary must block Mr Assange\u2019s extradition to the USA",
        "additional_details": "By placing confidential information in the public domain, Wikileaks has supported whistleblowers and made citizens more critically aware of their governments.  In 2010, it published the video \u201cCollateral Murder\u201d, showing the US army kill unarmed civilians in Baghdad.  In 2016, it published emails of the DNC, which some claim damaged Hilary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid.  Mr Assange is unlikely to receive a fair trial in the US.  Extradition would therefore be a violation of his human rights.",
        "background": "The Home Secretary should block Mr Assange\u2019s extradition to the USA, because (1) the request to extradite him is politically motivated and he is unlikely to receive a fair trial, and (2) extradition would set a dangerous precedent for journalists exposing corruption and human rights violations.",
