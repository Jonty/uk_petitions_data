        "additional_details": "The current system is open to absolute abuse and gives neither the buyer or seller any security or confidence that the transaction will be completed.Should one part of the housing chain collapse, many individuals and families are caused massive distress,anxiety and financial loss.It isn't difficult to change the laws to those they follow in Scotland.This is the 21st century.The laws need to be changed now.As far as I can see the only reason changes haven't been made is because the lawyers don't want it changed.If the property sale falls through, they still get paid.",
        "background": "The government urgently need to review the laws relating to buying and selling property.Buying or selling a property is one of the most stressful experiences of any adults life.",
