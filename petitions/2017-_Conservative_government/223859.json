        "additional_details": "Taking the nation to war on a lie or rending the nation asunder with a promise that there is no intention of keeping are serious abuses of the public's trust, or at least they appear so to me. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/misconduct-public-office\r\n\r\nToo often we hear tales of public officers abusing their powers to line their pockets or conceal their wrongdoings, yet we almost never hear of these things being investigated. This need to stop.",
        "background": "Abuse of the public's trust has become normalised: it is simply accepted as the way things are and not treated as the criminal offence that it is.\r\nThe police cannot get involved in political decisions and for this reason have proven too cautious over this offence, hence the need for a special unit.",
