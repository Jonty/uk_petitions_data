        "additional_details": "In July 2019 the UK\u2019s independent Committee for Climate Change stated \u201cUK credibility on climate change rests on Government action over next 18 months\u201d. Yet the PM for that period could be tied up elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThe current main cabinet minister for climate change is also responsible for energy; and not even a permanent member. Their Department, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) doesn\u2019t have climate change in its title, it\u2019s minister\u2019s titles, or its five current priorities.",
        "background": "Climate change is \u2018our greatest threat\u2019, yet the UK has no Climate Change Minister. A permanent cabinet minister responsible for climate change (and related issues) would be the force for change the UK deserves. Energy, industry and agriculture ministers should not lose their partial responsibility.",
