This would either be to a lack of funding, as most clubs at that level live hand-to-mouth, or due to the inability to obtain planning permission.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, any changes would have to be made during the season, causing major disruption to the clubs in question.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls on the government to make the FA drop these unreasonable demands.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46047599",
