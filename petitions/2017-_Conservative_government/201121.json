        "action": "Ban animal testing (vivisection) in the UK completely",
        "additional_details": "Every year in the UK (not including Northern Ireland) Around 4 million procedures take place on animals such as Dogs, horses, mice, rats, cats, rabbits, primates and guinea pigs. \r\nLab animals are left to suffer with no pain relief during the course of the experiment which can, at times last for weeks before they are killed. \r\nWe now have technology that can replace this and end the cruelty and suffering of millions of animals per year saving both humans and animals.",
        "background": "With the new advanced technology we have today we can now replace the use of animals in testing labs. Over 160,000 people still die every year by using drugs that have tested 'safe' on animals which proves the results are inaccurate.",
