        "action": "Ban use of school behaviour policies in favour of a standardised national policy",
        "additional_details": "Often, schools do not publicise or have vague behaviour policies, many of which are jargon-filled, almost constantly contradict themselves or just relay the rights given to schools under the Education and Inspections Act 2006.\r\n\r\nMany behaviour policies are written to make schools 'above the law', prioritising the handling of criminal offences committed by pupils to senior staff who have often received no law enforcement training. This means that potentially dangerous teenagers are left unpunished as their punishments do not extend past the school gates.",
        "background": "The Department for Education and/or local education authorities should create a uniform nationally and/or locally enforced behaviour policy that fairly balances the power of school staff with the power of the police and other law enforcement.",
