        "additional_details": "Climate change & the effect it's having on our wildlife is in the news alot lately. We have to protect our countryside/wildlife. It's impossible to expect rangers/police to confiscate these bbqs from the masses using our vast areas of countryside. Ban the sale of disposable foil bbqs to stop these massive fires that destroy wildlife, put lives at risk & a strain on our emergency services when many are experiencing cutbacks. Do we have to have loss of human life before something is done?!",
        "background": "Over the last couple of years the news has reported on several huge destructive wildfires. Alot of these fires are caused by the use of disposable foil bbqs on dry parched ground. The destruction to our wildlife & countryside could be stopped with a complete ban of sales on disposable foil bbqs.",
