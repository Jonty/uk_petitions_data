        "additional_details": "In 2018, why is there the need to purchase pets from a shop? I would envisage the profit margin from such sales to be  minimal,the main income being from pet food and supplies, not to mention the dreadful hutches on sale that do not meet RSPCA minimum welfare standards?  Stressed rabbits are more likely to become ill.Bred for profit and kept in small glass cages, on sawdust, without their natural freedoms, their lethargy and distress is evident .Help me end this inhumane practise",
        "background": "Despite the requirement to be licensed by the local authority, pets for sale in large stores are kept in conditions that frequently do not meet RSPCA minimum welfare standards. Many are bought on a whim,or without prior research in to their ongoing care.Most end up in rescue or abandoned",
