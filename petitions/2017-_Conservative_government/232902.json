We the victim's family have to live with this for the rest of our lives.  But the culprits will end up in prison for such a short time, usually only completing half their sentence.   \r\n\r\nThe culprits will then be allowed to move forward with their lives once they have been released.  They will be able to rehabilitate themselves into society.  But what about the victim's family?",

We will miss dad everyday and our lives have  changed forever.  People drive dangerously without thinking how this will effect somebody's life. Photos & memories all we have.",
