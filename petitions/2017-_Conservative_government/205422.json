        "additional_details": "25% of the UK population suffer with a mental health condition and there is no minister for mental health in the leading party. People with a mental health problem face prejudice in employment, in education, in care and throughout all areas of society. This needs to be challenged. The Conservative party should employ a specialist minister dedicated to creating policy and supporting those of us with mental health conditions in society.",
        "background": "The current Mental Health minister is Luciana Berger and she works for the Labour party. The Conservative party do not have their own minister. I personally find this worrying as it is the Conservative party who is leading the country and  25% of the population suffer with a mental health condition.",
