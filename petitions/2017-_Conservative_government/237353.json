We the people were given a very clear choice to either stay in or leave the EU. The result does not matter but the effect on democracy does.\r\n\r\nBetween The PM\u2019s deal and attempts to frustrate the process it is clear the will of the people is not being factored in. The fact the vote is not seen through is a final sign of abject failure in our parliament and we the people ask that new ways of governance are debated on put to the vote and implemented.",

Poor choices have led us to an inpass that occurred with the rejection of the EU withdrawal deal.",
