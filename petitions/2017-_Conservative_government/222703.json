        "additional_details": "This pressure and strain leads to mental health issues such as anxiety, panic, emotional distress and depression to name a few. The calls mental health organizations receive have been increasing significantly over the years, leaving some dropping out of sixth form altogether in hand reducing teenagers motivation\r\n\r\nTo say these issues can be eradicated by ridding of the linear style would be inaccurate but it can surely reduce it and make the A-Level process much easier and more controllable.",
        "background": "AS exams have been dwindled away due to Michael Gove\u2019s, former education secretary, reforms to A-Level exams. Previously, students would learn a years worth of content and then take the exam, now majority of exams are taken after the 2 year course. A Level exams are also getting harder",
