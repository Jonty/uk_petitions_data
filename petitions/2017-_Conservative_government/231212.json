        "additional_details": "It is grossly unfair that placement hours are not considered when deciding who should qualify for the additional funding.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to have a review of the guidelines regarding the eligibility of the additional 15 hours funded childcare for three and four year olds, and to introduce new criteria that allows students with integrated placements within their degree to have their placement hours taken into account when applying for additional funded childcare.",
        "background": "Students studying a degree with an integrated placement are required to have more contact hours than those without therefore for parents, childcare can be difficult to fund.\r\nUniversity limitations of number of hours students can work mean additional income to fund childcare is difficult to obtain.",
