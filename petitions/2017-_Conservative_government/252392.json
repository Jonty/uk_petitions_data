        "additional_details": "The Brexit process has clearly demonstrated that FPTP provides for narrow, self-interests to disproportionately influence Parliamentary Decision-Making.\r\n\r\nPerhaps its biggest failing is that it creates seats that are so 'safe' for one of the major parties that they could field a trained chimp; as long as it was sporting the right rosette, it would win. \r\n\r\nMoving to Proportional Representation would help shift the focus from Party Majority back to representing the interests of Constituents.",
        "background": "The First-Past-The-Post voting system is archaic, outmoded and an affront to Democracy. It allows MPs and Governments to be elected on the basis of the 'largest minority.' It prioritises the Race to Parliamentary Majority, and thus the Good of the Party, over the Good of the People.",
