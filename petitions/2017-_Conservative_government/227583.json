        "action": "To allow funeral processions to use all Bus Lanes.",
        "additional_details": "I strongly believe that i speak on behalf of all funeral directors and families that have been late to lay their loved ones to rest because we have been caught in unexpected traffic. It will ease the worry on so many levels and keep the dignity to the end. Having use of bus lanes, im my opinion and experience, will substantially lower the chances of ourselves, our grieving families and any member of our community being late for the most important journey in our lifetime.....our final one!",
        "background": "I am a Funeral Director based in South London Area and in my time of conducting funerals i have found that traffic in London is terrible. Although we do our very best on planning funerals and always allowing extra time, you can never anticipate 100% on what traffic will be like during your journey.",
