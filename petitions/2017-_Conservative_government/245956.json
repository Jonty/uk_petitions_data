        "additional_details": "Martial arts has become a very popular sport, as proved by a 2018 sport England report that states that combat sport and martial arts has grown in popularity as 84,800 people have taken it up. I believe that taking it off the curriculum is limiting what students can choose to get analysed in for their cousework - meaning they have to chose a sport they may not be as good at which is affecting their grades. We need a wide range of sports on the cariculum so they appeal to all students.",
        "background": "Martial arts has been dropped from the GCSE and A Level curriculum as part of approved activities. Martial arts teaches you discipline, respect, confidence and self defence skills.",
