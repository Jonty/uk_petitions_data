        "additional_details": "Armenian Genocide avoidance remains semi-official policy to appease Turkey.\r\n \r\nThe House of Commons has recognised other events as genocide. Yet the UK refuses to join the 29 countries, which label the killing of 1.5 million Armenians as 'genocide' - bearing in mind they were an ethnic and religious minority in the Ottoman Empire. \r\n \r\nThe motives for this inconsistency can be left for you to decide.\r\n \r\nPlease sign and share this petition.",
