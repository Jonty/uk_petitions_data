        "action": "Bring home troops from Estonia until the EU discusses removing the backstop.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament is apparently unclear about the clear instructions they were given by the majority of the people.  Until the EU demonstrates their gratitude to the sacrifices we have made on their behalf, not one more serviceman should be sent to protect an EU country. Regardless of our obligations to NATO. France and Germany are much closer.  Once we have left the EU, or the backstop has been removed, we can then send our brave troops to protect EU interests.",
        "background": "The EU conveniently forgets that the men and women of the United Kingdom have always been willing to fight for the rights and freedoms of Europeans. They are no longer showing us the same kindness and consideration because the backstop is designed to damage the union. Remove our precious troops.",
