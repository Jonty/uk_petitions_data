        "additional_details": "Problems such as the \u2018North Atlantic garbage patch\u2019 are starting to become more prominent and problems like these are killing sea life as well as land animals with problems such as fly tipping, by misleading animals into thinking that the waste is food of their own. \r\nMicro-plastics are now in our food chain due to contaminated soil which has been scientifically linked with health problems such as cancer.\r\nPeople have dismissed the problems linked with plastics too much and we need to take action.",
        "background": "Plastic bags contribute greatly towards harming the environment along with other factors by releasing toxic chemicals into soil as well as harming wildlife when they consume plastic. We can reduce the harm done to the environment by minimising the amount of plastic waste we produce.",
