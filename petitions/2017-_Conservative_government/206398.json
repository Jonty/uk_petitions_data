        "additional_details": "The fact that there will be a minimum price of alcohol per unit will ultimately not dissuade people from purchasing alcohol, this law will not solve Scotland's problem with alcoholism and 'binge' drinking. Instead this law will ultimately make the people of this country less economically well off.",
        "background": "The Parliament are planning on implementing a law that makes the min pricing of a unit of alcohol a minimum of 50p. Thus making the price of alcohol more expensive. There are already a number of restrictive laws surrounding alcohol within Scotland to dissuade people from excessively drinking.",
