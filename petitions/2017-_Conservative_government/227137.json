        "additional_details": "The current law in England and Wales is that in order to file a birth and death certificate the child must be born after 24 weeks of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nThe NHS currently offer a hospital-based commemorative certification, however this is not a legal document or proof of life and death. \r\n\r\nNo matter the week of pregnancy any parents of a laboured birth should have the option to file for a birth and death certificate.\r\n",
        "background": "Having gone through an early labour at 21 weeks and giving birth to a beautiful baby girl, who sadly died seconds after birth, I was heartbroken to realise that her short life would not be recognised legally on this earth with a birth and death certificate. This option should be available to parents",
