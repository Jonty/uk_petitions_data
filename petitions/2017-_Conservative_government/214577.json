        "additional_details": "This petition does not support in any way, those that attempt to avoid their child maintenace obligations. It asks only that the government be forced to consider realistic calculations based on real earnings. Therefore we move for all CMP to be calculated POST tax and NI.\r\n\r\nThe government does not keep accurate statistics on the numbers of people involved with the CMS, why do you think this is so? Ask yourself how many separated or divorced families you know, this could affect you some day too.",
        "background": "The child maintenance service is the agency responsible for calculating, managing and where necessary obtaining child maintenance payments from non resident parents. Presently NRP payment assesments are made pre tax and national insurance on their annual income.",
