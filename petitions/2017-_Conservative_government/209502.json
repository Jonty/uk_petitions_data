        "additional_details": "The unratifed \"communication\" protocol  allows child sex abuse victims to raise complaints directly with the UN Committee in relation to public authorities failing to safeguard and protect children in relation to child sexual abuse after exhausting all internal remedies. That this protocol has not been ratified is bizarre given the UK's failings in this area.  Failings which have become somewhat of a daily news occurrence in recent years.  It would give individual abuse victims a voice at the UN.",
