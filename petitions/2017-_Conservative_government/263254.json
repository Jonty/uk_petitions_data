I've had to go a few days without a proper shower because I can't use the facilities. Some hotel chains offer an interlocking room for a carer, not everyone's carers are paid help, they are family because you couldn't pay someone to do what they do. We need this debating and now!",

It is currently set as 'one size fits all' which is preposterous and outdated. According to the hotel chains I can not be both disabled and a parent - this has to stop!",
