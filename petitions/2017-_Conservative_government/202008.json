        "additional_details": "I am very vexed about this scenario if we were talking of a few pence but this is serious money approx. \u00a330 per week or \u00a3120 per month I feel the government has created a two tier pension scheme one for rich state pensioners post April 2016 and one for poor state pensioners pre April 2016 I feel this is totally unfair as I am on the pre 2016 rate after having paid in over 38 years of national insurance contributions why should I receive less money per month than a \"new pensioner\".\r\n",
        "background": "Back in April 2016 the government introduced a new state pension of \u00a3155/week for state pensioners but if you were already a state pensioner i.e. pre April 2016 your state pension remained the same \u00a3125 per week surely this cannot be fair or just why should any state pensioner get \u00a330 a week more.",
