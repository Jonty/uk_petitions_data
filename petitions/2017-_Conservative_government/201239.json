        "action": "No transitional period or freedom of movement to UK after leaving the EU in 2019",
        "additional_details": "This is a response to British Prime Minster Theresa May's speech on 22nd September 2017, where she laid out her \"Brexit\" plan to remain in the single Market, retain freedom of movement, accept supremacy of EU courts, and pay an extortionate \"divorce bill\" of \u00a340 billion pounds. This is a complete betrayal of the principles of leaving the EU, and a betrayal of the Democratic decision of the British people. It is most probably a covert tactic to delay and posdibly derail the our leaving the EU.",
        "background": "We the British people people voted to leave the EU. All of the EU. Our current government seems to want us to remain in certain EU institutions. We didn't vote for a Transitional period, or for freedom of movement. Heed our democratic decision, and take us out of ALL of the EU's institutions now.",
