        "additional_details": "Giving the RSPCA statutory powers (like the Scottish and Irish SPCA) would: \r\na) eliminate this waiting for the Police nonsense\r\nb) allow RSPCA inspectors to enter private land where they suspect animal cruelty is taking place\r\nc) allow RSPCA inspectors to remove abused or suffering animals\r\n\r\nThere are monsters who inflict unjustified suffering on defenseless creatures and RSPCA's role is vital to save animal lives and prevent  cruelty.",
        "background": "When the RSPCA receives calls on the 24-hour cruelty line its officers are not allowed to intervene and stop any abuse they discover until the Police arrive. The Police having their hands full as it is, cannot always guarantee a quick response which only prolongs the animal's suffering.",
