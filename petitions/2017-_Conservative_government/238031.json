        "additional_details": "Concessionary Bus Travel Act 2007: entitles all people resident in England who are either disabled or over 60 to travel for free on local buses at off-peak times anywhere in England\r\n\r\nEnglish National Concessionary Travel Scheme: enables off-peak travel. Some local councils extend hours beyond 9:30.",
        "background": "The current concessionary travel scheme restricts travel to off-peak hours, limiting equal work opportunities for disabled people. \r\n\r\nConcessionary passes are valid after 9:30 on weekdays and after standard 9-5 working hours begin. This questions the UK's commitment to equality in the workplace.",
