        "additional_details": "For example, in West Midlands both women and men have to wait until state retirement age. Yet in London, women can get free travel at age 60. A similar arrangement operates in Manchester. I was not aware of these anomalies until recently and so accepted, as our fate, that the free travel was addressed to align to state retirement age. Now i am disabused of that notion, i believe we need to bring fairness and equality to all. The Government may wish to hide behind Local Authority funding i say no",
        "background": "Based on where you live, you are treated differently. This goes against equality and is overt discrimination. LA's are all setting differing ages for 'Older' people to receive free travel.  The postcode lottery is made more unpalatable as in Scotland, Wales and NI, people aged 60 get free travel.",
