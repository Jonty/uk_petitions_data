        "additional_details": "Over 40% of women delay seeking help for fear of the family pet, some for many years. There is little support for pets, and they are not explicitly referred to in recent or pending domestic abuse legislation. Further, removal of pets could be in breach of the Thefts Act 1968 and the proposed Pets (Theft) Bill if the pet is owned by the abuser jointly or solely.",
        "background": "Studies have shown that between 50% and 75% of victims of domestic abuse have experienced their abusers threatening or actually abusing their pets. This is often done to control their human victims, to silence child victims of abuse, and to prevent victims leaving the abusive partner.",
