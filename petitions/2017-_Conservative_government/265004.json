        "additional_details": "A Prime Minister is not simply a party leader, they are the Democratically elected leader of the United Kingdom and as such the entire country should have it's say in who replaces them.  Individual political opinions change all the time and to leave the decision as to who leads the UK, especially during these turbulent times, to a tiny percentage of the country is not only undemocratic, it should also be illegal.",
        "background": "When a party leader stands down it is because they are no longer capable of leading their party and therefore the party members elect a new leader, however when a Prime Minister stands down the country has no say as to who will take over leadership of the country.",
