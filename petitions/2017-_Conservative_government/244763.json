I also work for an IAPT service and see the help CBT offers, but not to everyone, and it is those who do not get on with CBT are left to suffer with no affordable alternative. Mental Health therapy cannot be considered a \u2018one case fits all\u2019.",
        "background": "Although CBT is \u2018evidence based\u2019 it does not work for everyone. There are so many other forms of help out there but many people are unaware of what is available to them. Many cannot afford private counselling, even though this could be the therapy they need to begin recovery.",
