        "additional_details": "Many of the games using these predatory gambling techniques such as micro-transactions and lootboxes (which are very similar to slot machines in that you're risking getting stuff off of luck in a gamble o get something good by using real world money.) are games which kids are allowed to play, such as Forza Horizon 3, Need For Speed, Overwatch, Fifa 18, Madden NFL... suffice to say kids are more susceptible to gambling techniques \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLDid1UNyg8&t=520s",
        "background": "The use of predatory gambling systems has increased greatly over the years, now with the \"year of the lootbox\" it has reached a damn right absurdest level, games like Forza Horizon 3, Shadow Of War, Battlefront 2, have become pay to win gambling and it's time to crack down on this absurd hideousness",
