        "additional_details": "Hard brexit would bring a ridiculous recession and soft brexit is just like no brexit or non doable due to the complexity of the matter.\r\n\r\nAnd the leave campaign people lied, they should be prosecuted and the referendum should be done again.\r\n\r\nThe people of Britain don't want to leave and they have the right to change their mind.",
        "background": "No one to blame, Theresa May and the parliament are doing the right thing, people voted and they are what taxpayers asked for, but the referendum was biased and there's no realistic way to get brexit executed and all the parliament is debating for three years on how to make rain upwards.",
