I'm on a drug called Infliximab Infusion which is for my IBD and have to have it every 6-8 weeks in hospital in the Infusion Unit. This suppresses my immune system,  which means I am prone to infections. I have been rejected twice by PIP saying my IBD and Mental Health Issues don't affect me in my day to day life; I am now waiting for a tribunal.",
