        "additional_details": "UK Citizens DEMAND a General election be called to cast their vote and feelings on the appalling lack of democracy parliament have shown toward the citizens whom elected them to perform this task.\r\nMany MPs have been self serving, seeking to influence their own personal views and preference above the electorate and all have failed spectacularly, and to have so many MPs remain in place who are so obviously not up to the challenge of making a no deal brexit we demand the right to vote those who can",
        "background": "In 2016 the UK overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU in a referendum as mandated by parliament who promised to uphold the vote of UK citizens. This was further enforced in a General election in 2017 where both main parties mandate stated they will deliver brexit and have since failed.",
