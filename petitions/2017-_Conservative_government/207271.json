The courts already have the power to give an unlimited fine for driving without car insurance. You can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/driving-without-insurance\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government and Parliament to change the law to increase the fixed penalty that Police can give people who are caught driving without insurance, based on the current national average cost of car insurance, if that's what you want to happen.
