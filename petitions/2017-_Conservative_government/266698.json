During the time, the contractors sprayed,children were sick as well as dogs that were sick and some cats that had to be put to sleep after having their nose and mouth burned off. My own dog suffered swollen eyes, burns on her skin and lost fur from contact with this poison and now is also damage to her liver. Many bees and butterflies have also been killed off",
