        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum was 3 years ago, there is now more information on impacts of leaving.  The campaigns used assumptions and misleading statements.  The Leave campaign broke electoral law such that it would have rendered the result invalid if it was mandatory rather than advisory.  Information and opinions have changed over the last 3 years.  Parliament has been unable to decide on how to leave and future arrangements.  Further delay damages the UK. The impasse can be broken by a People's Vote.",
        "background": "The two largest parties wish to leave the EU based on a discredited referendum.  MPs can't agree on how, nor on future relationships with the EU.  Further delay is unacceptable. MPs should put the most favoured option, (or least disliked) for withdrawal versus remaining in the EU back to the people.",
