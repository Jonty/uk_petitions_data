        "additional_details": "The proposal is opposed by the local MP, Helen Whateley as well as Kent Wildlife Trust, the RSPB and the Council for the Protection of Rural England. Local residents are also totally opposed.\n\nAs a major national infrastructure project because of its' size, any formal planning application will have to be decided by the Secretary of State.",
        "background": "Plans are being prepared by developers to build the largest solar farm in the UK on Graveney Marshes adjacent to a SSSI, nature reserve and the Saxon Shore Way. The proposal envisages unsightly 4 metre high solar panels on hundreds of acres of land which would ruin this idyllic area of coastal Kent.",
