        "additional_details": "We the public can be uploaded onto national databases with no knowledge of this even being apparent. This is an offence to our personal security and data. One man in London was actually fined 90 pounds! Another member of the public made him aware that the police were using this surveillance on bypassers which they have no right to do. So he hid his face as a result the police bullied him into the corner shouting him down, further taking away this man's rights and liberties.",
