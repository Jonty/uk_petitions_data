        "additional_details": "University students are all in the same boat on very tight budgets. At Keele University we are paying \u00a32.90 for a wash, and \u00a31.10 for a dry. This is for a service that doesn't work properly. Circuit Laundry has a monopoly on the laundry market as students only have access to Circuit Laundry. Laundry is an essential service and students are being extorted as we have no alternative to Circuit.",
        "background": "Circuit laundry is providing terrible customer service to university students. The prices are a rip off, and clothes often come back not washed properly from the washing machines, and soggy from the dryers. A Parliamentary investigation can hold circuit to account for their failure.",
