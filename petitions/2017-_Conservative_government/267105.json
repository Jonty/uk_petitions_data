        "additional_details": "You see a lot of articles in the news on people abusing animals, statistics show that dogs are the most abused animals in the UK and cats been the 2nd most abused animals. Dogs and cats don\u2019t have the same ability to defend their selfs and I think a fine is not enough to punish these awful people who abuse these helpless animals. Something needs to be done to stop these people from getting away with it and I strongly believe that a jail time sentence is the right punishment.",
        "background": "I think many know that people are getting away with animal abuse far too much, some with just a fine and some with absolutely no punishment. As an animal lover my self I strongly believe that these criminals should get the same treatment as they would if they were to abuse a person. Jail time.",
