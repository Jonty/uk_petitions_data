        "action": "Allow all people with vitamin D deficiency to receive free prescriptions.",
        "additional_details": "There are many conditions and symptoms of being Vitamin D deficient. Those with more melanin are at an instant disadvantage living in the UK. In order for these individuals to maintain their health, they have to bear the brunt of the cost and if they are to remain in the UK, this will be an expediture for thier lifetime. If a persons genetic make up renders them more vulnerable and this genetic make up exists within large sectors of the public, surely this should be handled as a social issue.",
        "background": "A large section of the population will be affected due to the lack of sunshine and genetic make up. Vitamin D acts like a hormone and every cell in the body has a receptor for it, without it there are many symptoms and conditions that can occur.",
