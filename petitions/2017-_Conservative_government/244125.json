        "action": "Require Greyhounds to be muzzled in public",
        "additional_details": "Ex-racing Greyhound dogs, because of their heritage, can be serious chasers of cats and tiny dogs. This is instinctive and this petition is just to ask that the law requires greyhound dog owners to be responsible and muzzle the dogs in public at all times.",
        "background": "Recently our 18 year old cat was savagely attacked by an unmuzzled Greyhound who was being walked on a public road. This unprovoked attack resulted in horrific injuries and the death of our cat. Racing greyhounds are trained to chase and catch small objects, then if domesticated are not muzzled.",
