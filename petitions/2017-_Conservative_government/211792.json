        "additional_details": "If you\u2019re told that you\u2019re not accepted, then it will help significantly more than being told nothing, as you can then build on your CV / application technique. But when you\u2019re ignored, then you don\u2019t know what is wrong and when it happens with every job you apply for it can seriously damage motivation to apply for more. Therefore I feel it is a right that an applicant reserves; to get a reply - wether it be a yes or no or simply that the role is now fulfilled.",
        "background": "Applying for a job and getting no reply is demoralising and can leave you unmotivated to apply for others. If you get no reply, you\u2019re unsure if your CV is bad or if they\u2019re ignoring your application. Therefore, employers should reply to applications within a certain amount of time.",
