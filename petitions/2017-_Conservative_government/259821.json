        "additional_details": "Providing that working hours are reduced, hourly wages are kept constant, and increased leisure time is spent pursuing happiness in more time consuming and less consumption intensive ways, three day weekends could reduce consumption and the emissions it causes. Furthermore, more leisure time and a detachment from material aspirations could lead to greater human prosperity, achieving a synergy between increased human fulfilment and environmental sustainability.",
        "background": "It is becoming increasingly evident that the climate problem needs to be addressed. Introducing a three-day weekend has the potential to significantly reduce emissions and improve the trajectory we are currently on.",
