        "additional_details": "People on the spectrum present differently to neuro typical people and so do not neatly fit into the narrow boxes proscribed by the Mental Health Act. Allowances and adjustments need to be made so that people with autism are not left unable to access vital mental health services. Please change the act to add criteria that will allow for them to be treated correctly for their condition.",
        "background": "The current Mental Health Act makes no allowances for autism and the presentation by people with ASC. This means that a large number of people do not receive vital mental health treatment as they have autism. It needs amending to ensure mental health treatment is available to all.",
