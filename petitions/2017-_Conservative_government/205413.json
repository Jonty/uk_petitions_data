There are too many parents sending their children to school with lice. They aren't treating their children for lice and the children are suffering. Last year we had to treat our kids for lice overs 15 times. It affects the children in school, and distracts them from learning. Some children also get bullied for having lice and their parents just seem to leave them.",
