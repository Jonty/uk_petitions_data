        "additional_details": "Too many feral colonies exist, these animal very often die incredibly cruel deaths, many animal lovers feed and tend to these colonies, capturing humanely, and having them neutered, then returned to their environment once they have recovered, unless a suitable safe place can be found for them, and often they are suitable for rehoming, as I have experienced. \r\nMany people are ignorant to these facts, they need to be made aware, for the love of our feline friends, they need our help",
        "background": "Kittens can give birth at 4 months old, many die giving birth, or kittens don\u2019t survive. Tomcats fight, stray and increase disease and the feral colonies. Vets say they live longer and healthier lives once this procedure has been done, with no ill effects to the cat.",
