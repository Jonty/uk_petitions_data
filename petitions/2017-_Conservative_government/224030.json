However this is vague and open to individual interpretation and could put the animals life at risk",
        "background": "Currently UK law does not permit for the rescue of animals in imminent danger for example by breaking a window of a hot car to rescue a dog, instead it asks we call the authorities, and take down details of the car which can waste precious time",
