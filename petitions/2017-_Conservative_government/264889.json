In particular, we're not sure whether you want assessments by Educational Psychologists to be compulsory or offered as part of a package of support.\r\n\r\nThe Code of Practice for schools and other organisations supporting young people with SEN says that SEN coordinators should liaise with other specialists, including Educational Psychologists, as necessary so we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. You can find out more about the Code of Practice here:\r\n\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/398815/SEND_Code_of_Practice_January_2015.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do."
