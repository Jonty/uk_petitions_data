        "action": "Introduce Indian Military History to the primary and secondary curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Our current project Journey from Home, demonstrates that education on Indian Military history is much needed in the school curriculum. Community interest companies, like myself, have been working with young people to educate and connect them to their history, heritage and culture. Young people have been leading this project and are wanting to know more as they have not been taught about this subject in schools.",
        "background": "At present, school children from the ages of 4 to 16, are not taught about the commonwealth contribution of soldiers in the British Army, in particular soldiers of Indian descent. Teaching children about their heritage, culture and religions is vitally important and much needed.",
