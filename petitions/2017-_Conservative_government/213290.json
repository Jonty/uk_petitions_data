        "action": "Request that the Premier League invest more in grassroots football",
        "additional_details": "We call on the Government to request that more financial support is received for grassroots football from the Premier League. If they refuse, the Government should make this mandatory. The younger generations of now and the future are becoming increasingly restricted to play the game that dominates our sporting world. Their desire to play and fulfill their dreams of becoming the professional players of the future are hampered by a lack of suitable pitches to play on.",
        "background": "Government cuts mean that many Local Authorities can\u2019t fund grassroots football anymore.  The Premier League continues to grow and will generate over \u00a35bn in the next 3 seasons in broadcasting rights.\r\nThe Government must encourage the FA to ensure that 7% of this goes to fund grassroots football.",
