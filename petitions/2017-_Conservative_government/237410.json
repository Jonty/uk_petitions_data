        "additional_details": "On 2 June 2001, he began camping in Parliament Square in London in a one-man political protest against war and foreign policy (initially, the Economic sanctions against Iraq). Haw justified his campaign on a need to improve his children's future. He only left his makeshift campsite to attend court hearings for more than ten years, surviving on food brought by supporters.",
        "background": "Brian William Haw (7 January 1949 \u2013 18 June 2011) was an English protester and peace campaigner who lived for almost ten years in a peace camp in London's Parliament Square from 2001, in a protest against UK and US foreign policy. We want to see a permanent statue memorial to Brian at the location.",
