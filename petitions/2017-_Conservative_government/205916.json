        "additional_details": "Not allowing this amendment could see animal welfare go backwards instead of forwards allowing unethical exploitation of animals for hunting, battery farming, inhumane slaughtering for food, research and experimentation.\r\n\r\nIt is felt that the 2006 Animal Welfare Act is an insufficient replacement and does not include animal sentience.",
        "background": "Under EU law all animals are considered sentient. This law protects the welfare of animals. MP C.Lucas submitted an amendment (NC30) to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, to transfer EU Protocol on animal sentience into UK law, so animals would be recognised as sentient beings legally. This was rejected.",
