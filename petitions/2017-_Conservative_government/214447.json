        "additional_details": "Student loans have been a huge scam, pulling in students by millions and selling them an idea of a cheap loan. All the loans should be written off, new regulations and guidelines should put into place from next academic year so students know what they are getting themselves into.There is a serious breach of duty of care which the government owes to us all as the loans are provided by the government.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jun/04/student-loans-really-were-mis-sold",
        "background": "All student loans are mis-sold. The main reasons are:\nLack of information provided at the time of agreement i.e. interest rates and the term of the loan.\nNo information or support provided during the term of the loan.\nNo communication provided after the course ended on how much is owed.",
