        "additional_details": "Mr Davis in Oct 2016: \"We currently have in place an assessment of 51 sectors of the economy\". \r\nDec 2016: \"..our 57 studies cover 85% of the economy.\" \r\nFeb 2017: \u201c..I think it was 58 at the last count...\u201d \r\nOct 2018: \"...5000 pages...excruciating detail..\". \r\nNov 2017: NO such assessments.\r\nThe country needs to know: \r\nDid Mr Davis lie then or now? \r\nHave there been any economic sectoral assessments by DexEU at all?\r\nIf not, why not?\r\nIs DexEU concealing information?\r\nThe country needs to know.",
        "background": "Mr David Davis has made many contradictory statements about the Brexit 'assessments'.  The latest: they never existed. It has become a DexEU word game. He was let off by the Speaker; he should not be let off by the nation. As a Minister who has deceived Parliament, he should resign or be removed.",
