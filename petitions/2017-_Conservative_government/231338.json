        "action": "Make it illegal to hit a Cat in a vehicle and drive off without reporting it.",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of Cats every day are hit by cars  and many drivers continue with their journey and do not report the accident. It is illegal to do so to a Dog, so why should it be different for a Cat? Any driver who leaves the scene of a Cat RTA, who does not report it, should be held accountable. It is wrong, it is cruel and it is cowardly and it needs to change NOW. Marley's Wish is a personal campaign designed to end this. We need ACTION against this cruelty and we will fight until we see change.",
        "background": "I beg the Government to implement new Animal Rights' Laws. When a Cat has been hit by a vehicle, it should be a legal requirement for the driver to stop and to report the accident. Too many Cats lives are lost through RTA's. It is unacceptable to drive off and not inform anybody of the incident.",
