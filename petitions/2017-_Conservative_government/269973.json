Some can't afford to marry, some choose not to marry why should those families not be entitled to some financial help when they suffer the tragic loss of their partner leaving them as sole parents? My partner Dave, was in the army, he had no help from our government when he left and therefore we could not afford to marry. When he tragically died age 27 our future was shattered; married or not; broken and always will be.",
