        "additional_details": "In general elections, voters elect representatives to legislate on ordinary matters and to oversee the routine business of government. Constitutional issues lie outside the sphere of ordinary politics and, because they govern the way ordinary politics operates, there is a clear conflict of interests if MPs themselves are responsible for legislating on them.\r\n \r\nWe ask that elections be held for a Constitutional Assembly, to sit for up to two years, with power to bring forward legislation on constitutional issues.",
        "background": "The issue of our membership of the EU has exposed deep flaws in our political system, raising questions about the relationship between Parliament and Government, the role of the monarch, how the will of the people can be properly expressed, and where sovereignty should lie.",
