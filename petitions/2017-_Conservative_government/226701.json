        "action": "Increased fines for littering, with optional community service to lower fine.",
        "additional_details": "I propose the fines for littering being increased to 300 pounds. But offenders will get 3 options, pay 2 thirds and remaining amount is to be paid via community service (litter picking) on a minimum hourly rate. The offender can also choose to pay 1 third and double their community service time. This would mean that the litter will eventually be removed by offenders themselves and the fines can be used to pay community officers. Offenders need to experience what they cause to change their ways.",
        "background": "Britain and councils throw more than one billion pounds per year to cope with public littering, the lack of community officers handing the fines and low fines are contributing to the issue, and littering never gets treated seriously. It makes Britain one of the dirtiest places in western world.",

At the moment, the minimum fine which can be imposed for littering is \u00a350.
