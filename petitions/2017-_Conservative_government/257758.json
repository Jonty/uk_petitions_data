        "additional_details": "The most common argument for equal gender pay was that men and women were working the same job but not paid equally. The same principles apply here. Under 21's get paid significantly less for doing the same work as older employees. I'm happy with my pay however I find it unfair that someone who is a few years older than me can make more money for the same job just because they are older.",
        "background": "Younger employees are often doing the exact same job as other older employees however, they are not paid equally for doing the same amount of work. Although older people may have more to pay for (mortgages, families etc), I still find this to be unfair as younger employees are working just as hard.",
