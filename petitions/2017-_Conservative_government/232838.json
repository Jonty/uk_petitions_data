        "additional_details": "A lot of study resources omit ( or do not detail enough) the fact that Division and Multiplication, as well as Addition and Subtraction, are equally ranked and have to be completed left-to-right. Many students, and unfortunately, some teachers, understand the order too literally, calculating Addition before Subtraction getting wrong answers for simple maths sentences. \r\nWe are worried about future of our kids, who will have to pass their exams to get into higher education.",
        "background": "Current National Curriculum does not provide information on what Order of Operations should be in maths. Most students and teachers use BODMAS to remember the sequence but, unfortunately, some of them understand the order too literally and therefore are not able to complete simple maths sentences.",
