The Council of Europe has recommended in 2010 that it be banned.\r\n\r\nMosquito emissions are irritating, painful, and have been compared to forms of torture.\r\n\r\nKent County Council have already banned these on council-owned buildings - why are the Government not at least doing the same?",
        "background": "'Mosquitos' are devices deployed outside shops in public areas, with the aim of deterring loitering. They output high-energy 17400Hz waves, only heard by children and young adults.\r\n\r\nThis 108-decibel assault is painful, causes headaches, and discriminates against all young people.",
