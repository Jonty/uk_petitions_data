        "additional_details": "CoQ10 is a crucial enzyme which safeguards good cardiac, muscle and colon health as well as cell regeneration and is used by the whole body. As with steroids, Ad-Cal is prescribed as it is well known that steroids inhibit the absorption of calcium, why then should it be different for statins and CoQ10.\r\n\r\nNICE Guidance document:\r\n1.3.44 Do not offer coenzyme Q10 or vitamin D to increase adherence to statin treatment. [new 2014]\r\nThe above was also listed by NICE under 'Saving and Efficiency'",
        "background": "Statins have been developed to reduce cholesterol, but at the same time they deplete the levels of CoQ10 within the body leaving thousands of patients suffering severe pain and life changing diagnoses from the side effects of these drugs. Stop this suffering now!",
