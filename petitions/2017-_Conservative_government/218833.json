        "additional_details": "Many countries do not allow overseas investors to buy property and land for investment or to actually own.  India is a prime example and foreign nationals who choose to live there can only rent.  This is what we need in this country so that the next generation can get onto the property ladder.",
        "background": "The young in Britain are having great difficulty in getting on the property ladder.  Overpopulation and investment buying mean that some will never have this option.  Make it that British Citizens are the only ones allowed to buy, forcing foreign investors to sell.",
