        "additional_details": "The government announced it will be revising its previous proposals for reforming probate fees and will seek to remove the existing \u00a3215 flat rate.\r\nInstead, fee bands will be introduced.\r\nHMG's impact assessment accepts that current fees cover the average cost of making a grant of probate.\r\nHMG seeks to replace the current fixed fee with a new probate tax  to subsidise other parts of the courts system. They say it costs \u00a31.6bn a year to run the courts service, but court fees generated only \u00a3740m.",
        "background": "The government is proposing to introduce huge changes to the current \u00a3215 flat fee to gain Probate when someone dies.  For many estates, executors will have to pay thousands of pounds before distributing assets.  We feel this is wrongful and constitutes nothing less than a Stealth Death Tax.",
