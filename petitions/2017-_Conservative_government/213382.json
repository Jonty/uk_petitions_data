This could affect thousands of young adults jobs  forcing them to find another job. I work night shifts how do they expect me to get to work. If you agree with me that this should not happen please sign this petition and stop them from being allowed to do this.",
        "background": "Young motorists could be banned from the road at night if plans for probationary driving licences are approved.\r\n\r\nTheresa May said yesterday that the Department for Transport would review the case for a \u201cgraduated\u201d licensing system that imposes restrictions on drivers depending on experience.",

We're therefore not sure what action you want the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government not to introduce a graduated licensing system, if that's what you want to happen. "
