        "additional_details": "Myself, and many other families are suffering due to the tax credit system calculations being incorrect. Many family\u2019s inform of changes, but still receive notification of overpayments. These amounts are varying, some as high as \u00a35000! Family\u2019s that depend on the financial support are not able to pay back that amount without experiencing financial hardship. As well as enormous amounts of stress and worry. This needs to be reviewed and stopped. Too many people are suffering.",
        "background": "Too many family\u2019s are experiencing severe financial hardship due to the Tax Credit system and the demand for overpayments of significant amounts. Many are dependent on the income, and are having payments drastically cut in efforts to reclaim \u2018overpaid\u2019 amounts. Many claims being over 6 years old",

You can find out more about the current system here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/tax-credits-overpayments/repay-your-tax-credits\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for overpayments to be repaid over a longer period of time or to be calculated as a lower proportion of household income than currently, if that's what you'd like to happen."
