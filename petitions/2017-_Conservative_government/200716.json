        "action": "Health sec, Jeremy Hunt: waive all prescription charges for asthma medication.",
        "additional_details": "At present, many people are continually on 2 different types of medication for asthma - a reliever e.g.salbutamol, and a preventer/steroid inhaler e.g.seretide. In flare-ups, and in time of infection, anti-biotics may also be necessary. This petition is asking for inhalers, and other specific medication, to be provided (on prescription) free-of-charge to all patients needing it. It is my belief that in doing so, bed spaces in hospitals would be freed up as patients would be encouraged to manage their condition more effectively.Overall savings would be made.",
        "background": "Asthma is a manageable but incurable condition, which can last a lifetime.  Caused by inflammation of the bronchial passages, it can be continuous or spasmodic. Needless to say, both are unpleasant, and can at worst be life-threatening. Triggers include stress,animals, house dust,air quality,pollen.",
