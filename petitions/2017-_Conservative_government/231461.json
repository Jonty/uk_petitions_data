        "additional_details": "Theresa May has really struggled so far in Brexit negotiations and time is running out. She's failing to secure trade deals and my personal biggest fear is the Irish Border, this could lead to a United Ireland.\r\n\r\nMay has lost support not only from the Cabinet but the whole nation. I'm calling for a second referendum, because if you voted to remain or to leave we need a final say. The Brexit decision was so tight and I just think that it help everyone if there was a second vote. Sign if you agree.",
        "background": "It's no secret that a vast amount of people who voted to leave the EU didn't realise what they were voting for. \r\n\r\nThe Leave campaign said that leaving would create new trade deals, strengthen the economy and public services and reduce the number of incoming immigrants. But this is not happening.",
