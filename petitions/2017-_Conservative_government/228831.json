        "action": "Ban the use of horses within the police force",
        "additional_details": "I recently witnessed a Police horse struggling to walk, looking in pain along with acting distressed as it walked down a busy main road in Manchester. It is unfair and there are other means the Police could have used such as bikes, as this was a quiet Wednesday evening there was no need to have the horse out. The policeofficer was not able to control the situation in a calm & effective manner to which the horse would be taken out of the dangerous situation for both the horse and the public.",
        "background": "We want to ban the use of horses within the police force. Often the horses are put into dangerous and uncontrolled situations such as football games or marches which leads to distress for the animal. The horse is being exploited and is not having the freedom which we have and take for granted.",
