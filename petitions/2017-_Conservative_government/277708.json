        "additional_details": "Remain has lost the referendum result in 2016 and now the current parliament are doing everything they can to delay and sabotage the will of the people.  The option of No Deal should remain on the table for the electorate to choose from in the event the government goes back on its word and calls a second referendum as the leader of the opposition is asking for.",
        "background": "In 2016 we gave a clear mandate to leave the EU. Any second referendum must exclude the Remain option as we the people have already given the answer once so no need to ask us again.  All leave options should be on this referendum ballet including the option to leave on WTO with NO DEAL.",
