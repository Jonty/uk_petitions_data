The reason given was that she was not picking the new job up as quickly as the employer thought she should be. \r\nNo further training was offered, or the option to go back to her previous role. This was unfair dismissal, however she had only worked for the company for 18 months. ACAS are not able to assist in this case, which the company knew when dismissing her. Action is needed!",
