There are two ways to go about this: Ramping up clean energy generation via renewable power, and simultaneously massively reducing the energy we use.\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2VWOg2Z\r\n... https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/08/we-must-reduce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-to-net-zero-or-face-more-floods\r\n... https://bit.ly/2ILiG4t",
        "background": "Under a zero-carbon scenario, the fossil-fuelled energy sector, which generates around 80% of global emissions, must be phased out fast: coal, oil, gas (including fracking). Also, all heating and transport would have to be weaned off carbon-based fuels onto clean electricity. We must act now!",
