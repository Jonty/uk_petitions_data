        "additional_details": "Many lies were told and still continue to be told when politicians, public speakers, influencers are asked about the European Union and Brexit. Some of the media let these lies go unchallenged and even support them.\r\n\r\nIt is about time that we have a fully independent public inquiry into how this country has reached this point. We want this inquiry to go as far back as the 1970s so we can reach a real understanding of how we got to this point.",
