I myself cannot work, therefore have limited funds. I think there should be an option for some free hours/place at nurseries from birth instead of just the 2 year funding, my disability effects my daughter from birth. What Should I do if no one can have her? I need an option to fall back on and no other services can help me!",

People cannot keep taking time off to look after her and I simply cannot afford that amount of money. There needs to be an option for disabled parents!!",
