        "additional_details": "As many people know Plastic gets into the oceans. Each year 8 million metric tonnes of plastic pollution ends up in the ocean, causing harm to marine wildlife and the environment. It affects nearly 700 species in the oceans alone. Out of of the 8 million tonnes of plastic, plastic bottles make up a third of that. If nothing is done to at least help stop this becoming a worse problem for the next generation the amount of plastic in the sea will outweigh fish by 2050.",
        "background": "Single-use plastics are becoming an increasing issue in the 21st century. Banning plastics will be a very long process. Therefore, while there is an ongoing process there should be a tax imposed to reduce the quantity demanded by the public.",
