        "additional_details": "Regular donors, even priority donors, often have to wait for months to obtain an appointment to give blood.\r\n\r\nThe blood donation service has many reasons for an insecure blood supply stock: seasonal demand, lack of new donors, and relatively few donors from certain groups of the population. \r\n\r\nIf the blood service continues to cut donor session availability, this could cause serious supply issues in certain vital blood stocks, such as O Negative, B Negative, and A Negative.",
        "background": "The NHS Blood donation service needs more direct funding. \r\n\r\nThe service has cut services in the last few years, and regular blood donors are unable to find local sessions to make their donations, often waiting many months. This happens despite the regular appeals to for priority donors.",
