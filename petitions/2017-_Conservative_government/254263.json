        "additional_details": "I recently saw a bird eating a polystyrene takeaway carton floating in the river. There were already holes in it and bits ripped from it. It was heartbreaking to see but as the carton was out of reach I could do nothing.\r\n\r\nThese horrible items have become prolific as takeaway food and eating on the go has become a way of life. Even if they are disposed of correctly, an open air bin or an over flowing one means they often escape and are free to blow around causing danger to all manner of wildlife.",
        "background": "Polystyrene cartons clutter our streets, clog our hedges, trees, and get into our waterways. They are very dangerous to wildlife who mistake them for food. They are totally unnecessary. Alternatives made of paper are available.",
