Many parents are fighting for years against their local councils and  schools to get their child the education they so rightly deserve. Extra Support, understanding and appropriate care are what\u2019s required for them to achieve this. Why should a child be deprived of an education because of their disability.  EDUCATION HEALTH CARE PLANS provides the finance to allow schools to fund the needs of the child. These should be mandatory to all ASD children.",
        "background": "I\u2019m a parent with a daughter with high functioning autism and this is something I feel very strongly about. Years of fighting, to get my daughter the education she deserves. This can all be prevented by EHCPs. It\u2019s an injustice not to put appropriate supports in school for a child with a disability.",
