        "additional_details": "For children to have the best possible outcome from a brain injury, they need effective treatment and early intervention.\r\n \r\nIt is widely accepted in the medical community that adults with brain injuries have a good chance of recovery with fast intervention & specialist rehabilitation. Young brains are more malleable. Yet children are failed through the lack of proper specialist intervention at an early age. Seeing an NHS physio every six weeks won't aid recovery where the damage lies - the brain.",
        "background": "When we were told our son had brain damage and would be disabled, the only advice we were given was \u201cwait and see\u201d. This isn\u2019t good enough. There needs to be funding to ensure that children get the treatments they need when they need them. Wait and see should not be an option.",
