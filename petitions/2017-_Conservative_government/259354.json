        "action": "All UK children should receive their full immunisations recommended by the NHS.",
        "additional_details": "The government should legislate that children must be vaccinated unless a suitable medical professional advises that it wouldn't be in the best interests of the child. Vaccinated children are at risk themselves, but they also pose a risk to society as a whole, which relies on herd immunity.",
        "background": "Every year, thousands of parents choose not to vaccinate their children. They do this for a variety of reasons; they are rarely medical in nature. This leaves thousands of children in the UK vulnerable to diseases that should have been eradicated. This needs to change. Let's vaccinate all children.",
