        "background": "Runaway climate change will happen unless we dramatically cut emissions within a decade. Carbon capture (CCUS) technology removes up to 90% of CO2 from air, but the UK government intends to deploy it at scale only in the 2030s. We demand that the government rolls out CCUS nationwide by 2021.",
