        "additional_details": "I write this based on a personal experience where a family dog has been in custody of an animal shelter based on false allegations. There is evidence to show the allegations are false yet the authorities are not acting upon this in a timely manner. The stress this causes to an animal is astronomical and should be deemed as cruelty which is unlawful. I call for the government to place a time frame on when cases are heard in court or for legislation to be brought forward to review evidence sooner.",
        "background": "Instead of dogs being unfairly imprisoned based on a non confirmed act of aggression, have the authorities act upon this in a timely manner to prevent stress to the animal. This stress is unjustified and an act of cruelty towards animals where the animal where there is evidence to the contrary.",
