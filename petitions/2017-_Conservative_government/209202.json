        "action": "Make mental health become a topic taught in primary & secondary schools.",
        "additional_details": "I have never once sat in a classroom where the teacher has said \"today, we shall be learning about the importance of mental health\", it is a problem that is so evident in masses of students, and a lot of people (both teachers and students) do not understand the severity and importance of mental health, it is a genuine problem in modern society that needs to be fixed, because it is rapidly affecting thousands of young people without evidence of any solution. Everybody NEEDS to be educated.",
        "background": "Struggling with mental health myself and not ever being educated about what might be causing it, leaving me to find my own solutions throughout 12 years of education, I feel it is necessary, as poor mental health is a rising problem, that mental health be a topic taught in all schools to all ages.",
