        "action": "To facilitate doctors entry into the Obs & Gyn training at ST3+ level",
        "additional_details": "Currently many specialities allow entry to the training at middle grade (ST3+level) except in speciality of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, which only allows entry at ST1 level.\r\nAlthough there is a noticeable dropout rate of 40% of the trainees from ST1 level onwards, which impacts on the middle grade rota, as there is no recruitment for the trainees at this level, this has created significant difficulties in providing safe Obs and Gyn services. We request that the RCOG and Department of Health to create ST3+ level entry for training in Obs and Gyn . This will help to cover the middle grade rota gaps thus ensuring safe obstetric service in UK and allow  Non training grade doctors to fulfil their career ambitions. Overall, this will prevent the loss of highly skilled doctors from the NHS.",
        "background": "Non trainee doctors, contribute significantly to the provision of healthcare in the NHS. They are often overlooked when it comes to training opportunities, therefore unable to progress in their careers and are left disillusioned, frustrated and disappointed.",
