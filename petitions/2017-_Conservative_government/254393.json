We live in a country that takes pride in its democracy, which thrives on the basis of representation. It is undemocractic and simply unfair to ignore the electorate. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/206040\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/237424",

The replacement of the leaders has been called for by a proportion of the electorate after the standstill of governance. With a paralysed parliament things need to change.",
