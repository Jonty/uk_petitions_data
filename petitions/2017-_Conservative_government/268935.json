        "additional_details": "Supply of nitrous oxide for recreational purposes is technically illegal under the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016. This means anyone found to be selling or giving away nitrous oxide for illicit purposes could face up to 7 years in prison and or an unlimited fine. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is widely available from catering suppliers, online retailers and other outlets without any restriction or control. It is also very cheap. \r\n\r\nIt is also a drug that has limited public exposure and educational awareness.",
        "background": "Nitrous Oxide (N2O or Laughing Gas) is a growing recreational drug. \r\n\r\nUsed in catering, it is available cheaply, easily and without any control or restriction. \r\n\r\nWe are asking the Government to investigate better control of its sale, and educate the public on the dangers of N2O abuse.",
