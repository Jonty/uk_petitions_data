This means anyone found to be selling or giving away nitrous oxide for illicit purposes could face up to 7 years in prison and or an unlimited fine. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is widely available from catering suppliers, online retailers and other outlets without any restriction or control. It is also very cheap. \r\n\r\nIt is also a drug that has limited public exposure and educational awareness.",
