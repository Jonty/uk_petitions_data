        "additional_details": "Drivers do not take responsibility for their parcels, change the delivery  address, steal packages or just do not deliver them at all. On an online chat, one of the customer service helpers said that they are based in India and do not have personal contact with the drivers its tiring to send back to the retailers. My request is that you make Myhermes responsible for their drivers actions like all other trustworthy delivery services in the UK or to ban them from delivering in the UK.",
        "background": "Myhermes has point that says \"myHermes drivers are typically self employed, this means they can pick and choose their deliveries, if they don\u2019t want to deliver to you they don\u2019t have to, keep this in mind.\" I would like you to either ban them from the UK or make them take responsibility for drivers.",
