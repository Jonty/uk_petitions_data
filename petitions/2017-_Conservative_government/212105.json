        "additional_details": "We were given the devastating news at 16 weeks that our baby girl will not survive after birth, and there is nothing we can do to save her. Nothing. I am going to lose my Little Bean.\r\n \r\nWe were offered a termination, but then told our little girl will never legally exist. I have chosen to carry my baby girl until 24 weeks so she gets the recognition she deserves. Every day I feel her kick and grow, knowing I am one day closer to saying goodbye. 8 long weeks.\r\n \r\nIt is torture, its heart breaking.",
        "background": "It should be the parents\u2019 choice whether to have a birth certificate. All stillborn babies should be able to be registered if that\u2019s what the parents want. I ask as many people as possible to sign this petition, email your MPs and raise awareness so these babies get recognition.",
