The change in status prevented our courts from declaring the result as void due to illegally conducted campaigning. The Referendum should, therefore, be declared void as it lacked legal protection required for a Referendum.\r\n\r\nForeign interference: Russian Interference in political campaigns - UK Parliament website:  https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmcumeds/363/36308.htm",
