        "additional_details": "Biggin Hill is a place close to the hearts of the British People.  It is where our Air Force, young men, many who would not live to see their lives unfold into old age, flew across the channel in Spitfires and Hurricanes, to stop the German War Machine in the 1940's and also to protect our shores from invasion.\r\n\r\nAlongside our young men, New Zealanders, Canadians, Polish, Australians, Rhodesians and US airmen flew from Biggin Hill to help us keep our island free of tyranny.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is the least the general public can do, is ask that Biggin Hill remains the sacred and hallowed place it has always been - Home to the young men, who gave their lives, so that we could enjoy our lives as we know it today.",
        "background": "It is both an insult and a case of severe insensitivity that the British Government is to allow the use of German Made bricks and other building materials to come into Britain to build the Battle of Britain Memorial Site at Biggin Hill.",
