        "additional_details": "The outcome on 1st April showed how pointless voting in a competitive way is, when every option could be voted down.What is needed is a vote for however many options are required, but also the ability to indicate what one\u2019s least bad option is as well. The consensual approach that then wins will have a combination of positive votes plus additional affirmation from others for whom it is their least bad option. This would then be a more rational indication of the true feelings of the house.",
        "background": "MPs place a number against the options from best to worst with the first getting 8, e.g. for 8 options, the second 7 and so on down to 1. All the numbers would be added up ranking them in preferred order. If less than 10% separated the highest two then a straight run-off between them would follow.",
