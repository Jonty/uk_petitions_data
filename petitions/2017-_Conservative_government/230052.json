        "additional_details": "Offcom really need to put their house in order they have consistently failed to inform the public about how much money they are paying for phone calls especially on 'pay as you go'. Some phone numbers in the UK which are regularly used by those on low incomes and those on benefits are being charged at exorbitant rates which they can ill afford. Im sue many of these people end up not making  calls because of the cost and end up being penalised for not informing a company or government department",
        "background": "The cost of phone calls from a mobile phone or landline should be regulated so that prior to connection a prerecorded message should make the charge per minute clear to the caller and all Utility companies and Charities for the low paid and vulnerable should have available freephone contact numbers",
