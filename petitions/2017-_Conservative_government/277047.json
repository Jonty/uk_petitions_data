        "additional_details": "Despite shops like Superdrug and Holland & Barrett adopting policies that prevent products aimed at adults being sold to children, this is not bound by law like alcohol sales. The government restricts products that pose a potential risk to those under the age of 18. However, eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. I believe it is irresponsible that the government does not restrict the sale of products that enable children to access dangerous means of weight loss.",
        "background": "Currently it is not illegal to sell diet pills and slimming aids to those under the age of 18.  From working in a young persons eating disorder service I have been shocked at how children as young as 10 years old have had access to diet pills and use these to lose dangerous amounts of weight.",
