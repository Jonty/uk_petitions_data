There are 12+ children I know that have died because of this \u201cChoking Game\u201d / \u201cPassing Out Challenge\u201d more children are getting hurt either though the same craze or other crazy games kids believe are safe.\r\nHundreds of children have been hurt, scarred for life or suffered life changing injuries because they see people's \u201cGames\u201d and think they can do the same thing because the uploader is ok. We need to keep our children safe",
        "background": "I lost my 14 year old son Jack Pickles to a craze called \u201cThe Choking \u201cGame\u201d / \u201cPassing Out Challenge\u201d. He died because he watched this so-called \"game\u201d on the internet and decided to try it. Children don't realise that these videos are often fake or can harm them or worse lead them to their deaths.",
