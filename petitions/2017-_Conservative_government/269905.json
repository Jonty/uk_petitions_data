        "additional_details": "It has been described as one of the defining moments of its age, ranked with the Putney Debates as the events from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument.\r\n\r\nA dedicated and beautiful monument has just been built close to the site of the massacre.\r\n\r\nThis petition urges that it should be supplemented by changing the name of Manchester's principal railway station from sharing its name with one of London's to a uniquely Mancunian one.",
        "background": "16 August 2019 is the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo Massacre. In 1819, 60,000 peaceful men, women, and children, from Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding towns rallied in support of the right to vote.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to control the crowd eighteen people were killed and hundreds injured.",
