        "additional_details": "This way Parliament can be comfortable that the people have spoken again and have had the chance to change their mind (or not) given the information and evidence they are now faced with.  A second referendum would then need to be held to establish whether or not the result would actually be any different.  But at least the people will have been consulted again and given the chance to express their wishes given the seismic change in evidence and information available to them, and given the frightening and uncertain predicament that we all now face.",
        "background": "Having voted to leave the EU, many believe a 2nd referendum to be harmful and against the wishes of the UK people.  Given the UK's current predicament (and lack of clarity in 2016), we should gauge if the voting public would still choose to vote in the same way.  Majority change = 2nd referendum.",
