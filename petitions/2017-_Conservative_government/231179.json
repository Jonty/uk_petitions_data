        "additional_details": "Many places offer gender neutral baby changing areas or family rooms. I do not want to make it compulsory for all places to have baby changing facilities because there are good reasons that many places do not and I do not want to create unnecessary cost. However, there is no excuse for a place that offers changing in female toilets to not offer the same in the male toilets.",
        "background": "As a father of two I have often found myself changing nappies on the floor of restaurants and on the table of coffee shops. Many places have baby changing in females toilets but not the male toilets, this is stereotyping parenting roles.",
