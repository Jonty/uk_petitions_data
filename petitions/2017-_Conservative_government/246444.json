        "additional_details": "UK can deal directly with Ireland on the border issue as its a bilateral issue rather than UK-EU issue. UK does not need a 'withdrawal' agreement to leave. A managed no-deal seems to be the best option at the moment for both leavers and remainers otherwise UK will be tied in a limbo where it has left EU with a deal that MPs & people prefer not to have or there will be a long extension which can only fuel the frustration further and will not achieve anything. Please take back control of Brexit.",
        "background": "May I please request the PM to organise a managed no-deal Brexit. Both remainers and leavers are frustrated with the current situation and there does not seem any hope for 2nd people's vote. UK can put in place all necessary services by 23/05/19. Bilateral agreements can also start asap after that.",
