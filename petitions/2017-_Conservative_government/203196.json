        "additional_details": "Today 17 babies will die, and these families wont have a clue where to turn as they begin their grieving process.\r\nIt is often left down to each family to source their own support at a time when they're at their most emotionally vulnerable.\r\nThere should be dedicated teams of professionals who can support families before, during and after the loss of their child for as long as necessary and it should be mandatory that these teams are in place and active in each case as soon as the need arises.",
        "background": "After losing 2 children within 2 1/2 years my family was offered no support either during or after our hospital stay. We left the hospital with a pamphlet, a box and a broken heart.\r\nFamilies are left to scour google for hours in the hope of finding support and it's just not good enough.",
