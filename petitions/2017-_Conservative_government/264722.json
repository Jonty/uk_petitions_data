        "additional_details": "This is a petition for a royal commission, or investigation by the department for education, on the college/sixth form education and the way it is assessed. A huge amount of emphasis is put on end of year exams without consideration of the quality of wider subject understanding. Exams in which grades often depend on which questions come up can be unnecessarily damaging. A review into this would hopefully be able to implement deep reforms and improve the lives of our country's students",
        "background": "As an A level student I have witnessed the stress and anxiety caused by the college/sixth form education system, putting a near ridiculous focus on end of year exams that often rely more on simple luck of the draw for questions than actual subject knowledge and large quantities of fact retention",
