Skateboarders don\u2019t go out and carry knives, don\u2019t go out to pick fights, they don\u2019t wish to harm anyone, they just want to SKATE. Why disturb the peace?",
        "background": "Skateboarding is huge part of Manchester\u2019s culture and people come from all over to skate here. No matter how many skate parks are built, the streets will always be where it belongs. It is a creative, non-violent activity which brings the community together. It harms nobody. Theres no need for a ban",
