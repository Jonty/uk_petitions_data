        "additional_details": "We propose a rank order scale vote including all, or a combination of, the Brexit drafts which have thus far only been put to the House in a Yes/No format. This would allow MPs to compare and rank them according to preference, with the aim of ultimately finding a compromise. Such a system would accurately reflect overall backing, without the hindrance of tactics which split the vote between similar proposals, at a time when no singular outcome has a clear mandate.",
        "background": "Tactical voting is feeding the current \u2018deadlock\u2019 situation. Finding a majority-backed workable compromise before the default departure date is paramount. A ranking format would allow MPs to vote for their preference, without the concern of a similar option (whether tolerable or not) overtaking it.",
