        "additional_details": "The NHS should be free at the point of access but hospitals charge up to \u00a3300 for a week of parking.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Government introduced guidance suggesting free or reduced parking should be available for staff, blue badge holders and visitors of gravely ill relatives.\r\n\r\nSince then, 47% of hospitals have increased their hourly parking charges and almost half still charge blue badge holders.\r\n\r\nThe campaign is supported by FairFuelUK, CLIC Sargent, Bliss, Headway and Kidney Care UK.",
        "background": "Hospital car parking charges affect the most vulnerable, visitors of sick relatives and hardworking NHS staff. The fees are a major cause of social injustice. Government guidance isn\u2019t working. It is time that this stealth tax was scrapped, once and for all.",
