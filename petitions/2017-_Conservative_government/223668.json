This would recognise the risks they have taken to start their companies \u2013 as well as the sleepless nights, the sports days missed and the birthdays forgotten- and the contribution they make creating employment and contributing to our economy.",

The blood, sweat and tears of these entrepreneurs goes unnoticed by HMRC, despite the huge tax contribution to the UK Govt. Just say thank you.",
