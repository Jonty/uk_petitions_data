        "additional_details": "Small business owners\u2019 tax returns should say thank you for the VAT, the PAYE, the Employers NI and the Corporation Tax. This would recognise the risks they have taken to start their companies \u2013 as well as the sleepless nights, the sports days missed and the birthdays forgotten- and the contribution they make creating employment and contributing to our economy.",
        "background": "UK Entrepreneurs have started 5.7 million small businesses & employ more than 16 million people. Since 2010 alone they have created 2 million jobs. The blood, sweat and tears of these entrepreneurs goes unnoticed by HMRC, despite the huge tax contribution to the UK Govt. Just say thank you.",
