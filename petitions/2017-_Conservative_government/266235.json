        "additional_details": "An estimated 8.3 billion tons of plastic have been produced since the 1950s \u2014 that\u2019s equivalent to the weight of more than 800,000 Eiffel Towers. And only 9% of it has been recycled. Changing to a compostable alternative would work better as it is a plant-based packaging which means you can recycle it; you could also reuse the bag to put your food waste in and then dispose of it. As well as this, it will not harm any sea wildlife when being disposed of.",
        "background": "Supermarkets should replace plastic packaged fruit and vegetables with compostable alternatives massively decreasing the amount of plastic produced. 90% of birds and fish have plastic in their stomachs caused by it breaking up in the sea, plastic production is also harming our environment.",
