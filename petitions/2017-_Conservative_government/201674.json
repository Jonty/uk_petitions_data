        "additional_details": "There are now too many instances of people that think it is in order to desecrate these memorials, poppies and other items which are there to remind us of a debt owed to the many that gave their lives so that we could be free.\r\nDesecrating of war memorials, items purchased and placed on these memorials are to be respected.\r\nWhatever political, religious or ethnic issues people may have, their argument cannot be with the fallen heroes of another generation.",
        "background": "War memorials were constructed at the center of towns and villages so that people could be reminded of the sacrifices made by brave men and women who died to preserve our freedom.\r\nPoppies and other items are placed at these memorials to ensure we do not forget those sacrifices.",
