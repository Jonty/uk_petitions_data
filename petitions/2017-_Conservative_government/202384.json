        "additional_details": "I am currently employed by a one of the largest UK High street retailers and diagnosed with Cancer on the 15th Sept 2017. On the 2nd Oct (36 hours before I had Cancer surgery), my employer sat me down & informed me that I would NOT be getting paid while I was off recovering from Cancer. I have received my examples through Social Media of similar practices by this employer and by many other UK companies",
        "background": "No person within the UK diagnosed with Cancer should be put into financial difficulties by a large reduction of their income due to Cancer. In some instances, an employer may have a 4 or 8-week full Company sick pay, but after this time, their income drops to the current Statutory Sick Pay.",
