        "additional_details": "The issue:\r\nOnce we are finished with our plastic bags, we throw them in the bin ready for them to be taken to landfill. When they reach landfill, birds often mistake shredded plastic bags for food filling their stomachs with toxic debris. When a plastic bag reaches the ocean turtles cannot tell the difference between a jellyfish or a plastic bag. 91% of plastic waste isn\u2019t recycled, meaning that the majority Virtually every piece of plastic that was ever made still exists in some shape or form.",
        "background": "The solution:\r\nA law was introduced in October 2015 to have a 5p charge on plastic bags and are now planning to raise the charge to 10p in January 2020. This law has failed to significantly reduce waste. So what is the simple solution to all of this? Ban plastic bags all together by January 2020.",
