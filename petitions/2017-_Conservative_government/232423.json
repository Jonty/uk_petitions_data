        "action": "Prevent Freeholders from passing cladding costs to leaseholders",
        "additional_details": "Leaseholders are forced to pay \u00a3millions to fix cladding and more, costs unfairly passing to us even though we were not responsible for construction or approvals. Our homes won't be made safe until funds are in place. Our flats are also unsellable and unmortgageable until works are completed, We call on parliament to make it illegal to pass on any costs related to making our homes safe, to compensate those of us who've paid for works and to require homes be made safe as soon as practicable.",
        "background": "On June 14 2017, 72 people lost their lives in the Grenfell Tower fire in London.  Thousands of people are still living in tower blocks with unsafe cladding over a year later. Over 400 high-rise flats still have the same type of cladding blamed for the rapid spread of the deadly blaze.",
