        "additional_details": "A law from preventing criminals from assaulting emergency workers whilst on duty has taken months, if not years to pass but to pass a bill in hours for the delay of Brexit, a democratic vote which the majority of the country had stated they wanted out of the EU, so they can put across their remain ideologies and overturn the will of the country. This should not be a \u201cwe know better than you\u201d scenario. The country has spoken, do not change things to suit you.",
