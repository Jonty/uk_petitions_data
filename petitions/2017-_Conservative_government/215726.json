        "additional_details": "With legalisation of Marijuana the government would...\r\nSave money on A- no longer policing this substance and B- not paying for imprisonment of \"criminals\" .\r\nMake money from taxation of imports and consumtion.\r\nCreate jobs and business.\r\nReduce the incarceration rates and stop drug lords profiting.\r\nMake it a fairtrade substance, regulated farming, fair pay for all involved at no extra cos to the government.\r\nMedical uses (which is undeniable by now) and research.\r\nIf tobacco then why not marijuana?",
        "background": "Considering the amount of money available, the (legal) jobs that would be made, the crime that would be reduced and many other reasons (stated below) that Marijuana/Canabis/Weed should be legalised for recriational and medical use it is shameful that our government is allowing this to continue.",
