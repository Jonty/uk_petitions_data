        "action": "To consider free prescription charges for those with IBD illnesses.",
        "additional_details": "Long term health and medical conditions in the UK need to be met with similar standards across the board. Many patients with Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis should be entitled to free prescription charges due to their severity of their illnesses and because IBD meets the criteria of a long term health condition. Diabetes patients are permitted to free prescriptions, whereas IBD patients are not. Both can be considered dehabilitating illnesses, so both should be treated the same.",
        "background": "This petition seeks to get the government to reconsider their current position on free prescriptions in relation to Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis (both are long term health conditions so should have the same stead as diabetes).",
