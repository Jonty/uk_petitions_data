        "additional_details": "Everyone is eligible for 4 years of funding from student finance to help cover the cost of higher education however they will count the years of study of self funded courses towards a students eligibility to use student finance this in turn means that students may not be able to get the funding they need to go to university, surely self funding a course should be encouraged not penalised as it seems extremely unfair for a course to be counted when the student didn't use student finance",
        "background": "Student finance counts self funded courses towards how they calculate your eligible for student finance, this is ridiculous as you are not using their service and because of this you are actively penalised for funding your own education, preventing students from getting the funding they need",
