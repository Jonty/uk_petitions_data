Many of which aren\u2019t the breed itself. \r\n-According to the ATTS (2010-2011), 804 American Pit Bull Terriers were tested and 695 passed. Meaning 86.4% of Pit Bulls tested had a good temperament with a pass rating above 121 other breeds.\r\n- Any dog can bite, regardless of its breed It\u2019s not the dog\u2019s breed that determines risk rather the upbringing it receives .\r\n- Instead we should ban people that make dogs agressive.\r\n-",

Or maybe you look like someone who did something bad, even though you haven\u2019t done anything. Not fair right ? So why is it fair to have this done to dogs.",
