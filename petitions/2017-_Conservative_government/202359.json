        "additional_details": "If you have a sore throat, you go to the doctor and get medicine. If you find a lump, you go and get it checked - Yes? Wrong! Most people don't get it checked as they don't know they have a lump and then it's too late. There are millions of men and women who don't check themselves as they don't know how. We need to raise awareness as if a lump is cancerous and caught early, there is a very high survival rate. Pupils therefore need to be taught in school, as part of sex education, how to check.",
        "background": "At 29 years old, Simone Ferman, mother of two from Essex was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. The lump was discovered by her partner - Simone never checked herself as she didn't know how to. If pupils were taught this as part of sex education in schools, it could save thousands of lives.",
