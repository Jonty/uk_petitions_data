        "additional_details": "I believe that the travel industry is capitalising on peoples illnesses, and receiving a huge profit on the sale of therapeutic oxygen, which is essential a bottle of air, as medical grade oxygen is available to purchase for \u00a36.64 on the BOC website. \r\nhttps://www.boconline.co.uk/shop/en/uk/healthcare/medical-gas/oxygen-cylinder-medical-grade-compressed-gas\r\n I am calling for a price limit to be placed on therapeutic inflight oxygen as it is unfair for the industry to make money off my illness.",
        "background": "I suffer from a collection of  congenital heart defects which means that I require the use of therapeutic oxygen when I fly on an aircraft. The cost of this is upwards from \u00a350 per flight. Some airlines ask you to provide your own oxygen through a private company which costs around \u00a3300 per week.",
