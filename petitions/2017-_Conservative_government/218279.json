We know that some infants have become entangled in the ties and material, or fallen whilst pulling themselves up on the bumpers\u201d. \r\nPlease see relevant links attached below\r\nhttps://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/parents-should-remove-cot-bumpers/\r\nhttp://www.kickscount.org.uk/new-law-ban-cot-bumpers-discussed/\r\nhttps://www.nct.org.uk/parenting/sleeping-safely-cot",
        "background": "I\u2019m creating a petition to stop cot bumpers being made. Cot bumpers have sadly been proven to increase the risk of SIDS. Many babies have sadly passed away due to these. I believe strongly with strong evidence from sources such as the lullaby trust that these need to be removed from being produced.",
