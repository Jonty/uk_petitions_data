        "additional_details": "Broiler chickens are supposed to reach \u201cslaughter weight\u201d at 6 wks but many die early.  The heavy body causes crippling & painful skeletal deformities; the overburdening of underdeveloped cardio systems causes heart failure. Others die of thirst, as they're physically unable to reach water nozzles.  The chickens\u2019 excretions pile up; resulting ammonia fumes are so strong they burn the birds\u2019 eyes causing blindness.  Birds with \u201cammonia burn\u201d rub eyes with their wings emitting cries of pain.",
        "background": "NCC are proposing 10 broiler chicken sheds (birds which are bred to have abnormally big bodies so they can get more 'healthy chicken breast') on the ancient higham park site Nr Rushden.  Each sheds woul house 54,000 chickens equating to 22 chickens per sq m for 39 days before theyre slaughtered.",
