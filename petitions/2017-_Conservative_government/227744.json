        "additional_details": "We are concerned that women are not being properly informed about how their data will be used. We want to know if these invasive practices comply with the Data Protection Act 2018.\r\n\r\nWe call upon the Government to urgently review the unethical practice of allowing access to new mothers and babies, who rightly expect privacy, dignity and safety in hospital in the days following the life-changing (and often traumatic) experience of giving birth.",
        "background": "As new parents, we believe it is wrong that some commercial representatives have unlimited access to enter secure NHS postnatal wards, drop in uninvited on new mothers just hours after they have given birth, and pressurise them to share their personal data in exchange for a pack of free samples.",
