        "additional_details": "Politicians must not have the right to manipulate the people\u2019s vote for t heir own agenda.  Their job is to deliver the result to LEAVE the EU and the default option of No Deal must remain in any further negotiations/votes.  Politicians cannot predict the outcome of a No Deal Brexit and should not be allowed to push the idea that it will  be a disaster when they have no idea if it will or not.  The default NO DEAL position MUST be allowed to remain on the table in any further negotiations/votes.",
        "background": "The referendum question was leave or remain part of the EU, not to stay half in and have no say. Whether the electorate \u201cknew what they were voting for\u201d is immaterial.  A democratic vote was made and the decision was to LEAVE.  To go against that decision goes completely against our constitution.",
