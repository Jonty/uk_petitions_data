        "additional_details": "As a teacher it is common for me to hear some of my students reflect that under exam pressure they panicked, or that due to nerves they couldn\u2019t concentrate well, etc. After all their hard work for many years, their final grade is strongly affected by exam pressure and in particular time pressure. Young people do not need to be put under pressure of time. We put tremendous pressure on our youngsters. This is one way that we could easily reduce that pressure.",
        "background": "I propose that the time for all exams be increased by 50% for all students, with no additional content. In this way students know that it is only their knowledge and abilities which are being tested. They will have plenty of time to express their learning and abilities.",
