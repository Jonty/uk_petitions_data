        "action": "Facilitate local elections in Northamptonshire ASAP after original May 2019 date",
        "additional_details": "The electorate has a contract with government and politicians as the their representatives. Representatives are elected for a period of time, and the electorate has the opportunity to re-elect or replace politicians at the end of that term.\r\n\r\nCancelling elections breaks that contract. With no confirmed plan forward, it currently seems unlikely that the electorate will be able to elect in 2020 either.\r\n\r\nThis is undemocratic. The government should facilitate elections to existing authorities now.",
        "background": "Elections to local authorities take place in May 2019. In Northamptonshire these elections have been cancelled as unitary authorities might replace existing authorities, but the Secretary of State still hasn't decided what will happen and so it's now looking unfeasible to happen by April next year.",
