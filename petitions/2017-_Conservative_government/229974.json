If I received certain benefits I could get the dentist for free, but as always regular hard working people of the country who don\u2019t qualify for benefits have to pay for everything. Your teeth are important, it's part of your health and can cause major problems if there is something wrong. Nobody should not need to pay to be seen or treated by a dentist on the NHS!",
