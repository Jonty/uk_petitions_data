This is not morally right to forget about the taxpayer's concerns to work on something that politicians know very little about. There should have been discussion on leaving the EU as to whether it would be possible. Instead, the Prime Minister called a referendum without knowing how to carry out a Brexit Vote. People's welfare and country was not at the front of their mind.",
