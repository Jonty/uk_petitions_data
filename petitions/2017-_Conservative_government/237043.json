There\u2019s a few hospitals right there!",
        "background": "Because the balance of trade with the EU is massively in UK favour, we could rebate every penny paid in export taxes on goods going to EU. By doing this there would be zero effect on cost of UK goods in the EU because any export tariffs will be refunded.",
