        "additional_details": "According to the House of Commons library statistics 30th Nov 2018: \r\n \r\nUK exports to EU = \u00a3274 billion \r\nUK imports from the EU = \u00a3341 billion \r\nAssume a nominal tariff of 11% both ways: \r\n\u00a3274B * 0.11 = \u00a330B \r\n\u00a3341B * 0.11 = \u00a337.5B \r\nTherefore if we rebate the \u00a330 Billion to UK manufacturing, we would make a profit of \u00a37.5 Billion. There\u2019s a few hospitals right there!",
        "background": "Because the balance of trade with the EU is massively in UK favour, we could rebate every penny paid in export taxes on goods going to EU. By doing this there would be zero effect on cost of UK goods in the EU because any export tariffs will be refunded.",
