Why should the poorer in society pay for a room that is being used when others buy houses with multiple spare rooms that they will never use. These rooms could house people and just because they own their property doesn't mean they shouldn't have to pay a tax. Otherwise why should someone on such a low income have to pay for a room that they need just because the person staying in the room is above a set age.",
        "background": "I am proposing that anybody with spare rooms whether they own the property or not should pay a tax for the room they are not using. In this day and age housing is a massive concern and why should the poor who are actually using their bedrooms have to pay poor tax. I propose changing this for good.",
