        "additional_details": "With this law in place, it means women cannot be convicted or rape. With the law changed, there would be justice for those who have been forced to accept what happened to them as only sexual assault, and victims who have kept quiet would be able to reach out and come forward.",
        "background": "The growing number of victims speaking out about their experiences of sexual assault or rape, women are being convicted of lesser charges due to the current law in place that states, 'rape occurs when one person penetrates another with their penis without the consent of the person being penetrated'",
