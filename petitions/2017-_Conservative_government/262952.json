        "additional_details": "On 9/9/19, the suggested date, Neptune will be closer to the Earth than at any other point in the year, it\u2019s position means the sun will illuminate it and will be visible all night. \r\nObviously turning every single light off isn\u2019t practical (airports, hospitals etc) but for most this would be a really simple thing to do.",
        "background": "If all lights are turned off we will be able to see the Milky Way and other astronomical phenomena with the naked eye. This would be a truly mesmerising sight for all. Furthermore, not only will turning lights off save us all money but it also saves energy so it brilliant for the environment too.",
