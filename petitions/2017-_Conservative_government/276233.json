I was given SSP which at the time was \u00a383 per week only after the first week. This amounted to 3 payments of SSP = \u00a3249 as opposed to the usual \u00a31,500 full time wage. This did not pay my monthly rent costs or council tax as I still had a family to feed. I am still paying rent and council tax arrears of today as a punishment for being ill in hospital while employed full time.",

All that is available is SSP. \r\nThere is more incentive to being unemployed.",
