        "additional_details": "This was far more extreme than the halloween displays that I have seen in the past, and feel that it is inappropriate in such a setting. If a shop sold halloween merchandise only, then I would be able to make sure that my children were kept away from the shop and thus avoid anything that might frighten them. However, having such a chilling display in a large store selling all manner of products is irresponsible, and gives no thought to how a child might react.",
        "background": "I was visiting The Range retail store with my wife and children at the weekend. Upon entering the store we immediately noticed around five frightening, life-size halloween figures ahead of us. My younger children were visibly scared and shocked to be confronted by them.",
