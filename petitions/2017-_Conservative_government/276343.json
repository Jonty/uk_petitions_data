But this doesn't always happen. Therefore I would like to start a petition to start a law that the council or anyone else who finds a deceased pet, that it is to be reported and scanned for a microchip for the owners to then be informed.",
        "background": "Cat owners should never have to go through the heartbreak of not knowing what's happened to their missing cat. Unfortunately cats that have been run over and deceased are not always microchip checked and are then disposed of without the owner knowing. Pets are family, no one should go through that.",
