        "action": "Do not force electric vehicles to sound like internal combustion engine vehicles",
        "additional_details": "Making an electric car louder is not only pointless, as most new ICE cars are virtually silent at low speeds, and most people wear headphones so can\u2019t hear nearby cars, but discourages the EV revolution, which is an imperative part of protecting the environment and keeping our planet habitable.\r\nThe European Federation for Transport and Environment says vehicle noises are a \u201cmajor cause, not only of hearing loss, but also of heart disease, learning problems in children and sleep disturbance.\u201d",
        "background": "The EU is creating a new rule that requires EVs to emit a noise like an internal combustion engine when traveling below 12mph.\r\n\r\nDue to an electric motor being almost silent, EVs are more pleasant to drive, and have little to no effect on noise pollution, especially in densely populated areas.",
