        "additional_details": "Snares are mainly set on shooting estates to stop foxes from catching the 'game' birds.\r\n\r\nBritain is one of the few European countries where so-called free-running snares are still used and most countries have banned them.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that snare use can be controlled by a Code of Practice - but this is impossibly to enforce!\r\n\r\nOne council has banned snares to protect British wildlife -\r\nhttps://www.league.org.uk/news/council-bans-snares-to-protect-british-wildlife.",
        "background": "Snares are compared to landmines for the indiscriminate way in which these wire traps capture a wide range of animals \u2013 from foxes to family pets to protected species.\r\n\r\nA snare is an archaic thin metal wire noose intended to catch animals by lassoing and trapping them.",
