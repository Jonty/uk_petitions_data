        "additional_details": "Although large fracking companies suggest that fracking will lower the price of gas bills, the question is will the decrease in price be substantially low enough for us to damage the earth we live on, and the earth our future generations will live on.\r\n\r\nFracking has proven to be a danger not only to the environment, but health. Chemicals have been proven to seep into water pipes and drains underground, contaminating the water supply in countries where the fracking process has already began.",
        "background": "Hydraulic fracturing, known as Fracking, is a process of drilling into the earth before a high pressure mixture of water and chemicals are directed at the rock to release the gas that is inside.",
