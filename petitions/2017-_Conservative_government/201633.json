The funding for social services has slowly been decreased until they're almost at breaking point now. Social workers are forced to leave vulnerable young people with carers without being introduced. Its harmful to the children and the parents and is causing emotional distress.",
        "background": "I got brought into foster care in 2008 and throughout the years I have seen how the lack of funding has affected how these services have worked. Social workers are given over 30 young people to look after when the most they should have is 16.Lack of funds means they can't give the service they want.",
