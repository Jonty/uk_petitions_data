        "additional_details": "Every day hundreds of lives are made unbearable due to harassment and abuse by neighbours. Police are unwilling to get involved as they find it difficult to impose the penalties currently available such as restraining orders and injunctions. I believe that a separate law should be in place to look at neighbourhood harassment. There are so many people who find their everyday lives unbearable.",
        "background": "Under the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 harsher laws have been put into force to protect people from stalking and harassment. The Police find it harder to enforce penalties against someone who lives in close proximity, such as a neighbour. New, more easily enforceable penalties are needed.",
