        "additional_details": "Between 2000 and 2018, the UK has come below 20th position in the Eurovision song contest 10 times and invests hundreds of thousands of pounds into the EBU with very little benefit. The BBC are not able to offer a credible national selection to select the artist as they cannot afford to spend money on such aspect. If the UK withdraws from Eurovision, more money can go towards better TV production for various shows and showcase more of what Britain is good as well as even hosting local song shows",
        "background": "The BBC invests in hundreds of thousands of pounds into a competition that the United Kingdom fails every single year with a national selection process that is not fit for purpose. If the BBC and the UK withdraw, it can save money to invest in other projects that the BBC are great at.",
