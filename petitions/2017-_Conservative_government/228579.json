        "additional_details": "We all know that manufacturer's fuel consumption figures are very unreliable. This way people will pay the fair amount due in tax based on their consumption and their mileage. It doesn't penalise the drivers who have to have a car because bus services in their rural area are non- existent and without a car they wouldn't be able to get to hospitals for appointments or to the shop for essentials.",
        "background": "Instead of wasting valuable police resources chasing untaxed drivers, when they should be tackling more serious crime, scrap VED and add 10 pence to the price of a litre of fuel. That way, the more you drive the more you pay.",
