        "action": "Restrict the public sale of fireworks to silent firework types",
        "additional_details": "My pet dog absolutely hates the time of year when Fireworks are let off, the sale of explosive fireworks should be banned and replaced with \"silent fireworks\" which are available on the Continent. This would allow people to enjoy the firework displays without disturbance to animals and people with young children. Restrict the sale of industrial strength explosive fireworks to licenced displays only",
        "background": "When it comes to Guy Fawkes night and New Years Eve the disturbance created by the sale of fireworks is extreme. The general public should only be able to purchase \"silent fireworks\" to limit the inconvenience they cause. Pets and people of nervous disposition experience terror during this time.",
