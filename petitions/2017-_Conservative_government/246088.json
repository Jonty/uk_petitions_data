        "additional_details": "Regulation in terms of age restriction exists in many other areas of life where children can be potentially exposed to inappropriate material. This includes a watershed on tv, certification of films in cinemas,  age restrictions for purchase of alcohol and tobacco, knives etc. There are currently no restrictions on the age at which a child can be given the use of a mobile phone with internet access. The access restrictions and controls are in the hands of parents and carers, many of whom feel they have a lack of technological know how to establish effective controls.",
        "background": "Children are allowed access to the internet via smart phone use at an increasingly early age. This is allowing them to be exposed to online bullying and inappropriate web based content. It is impacting on the emotional and mental health and well being of a generation.",
