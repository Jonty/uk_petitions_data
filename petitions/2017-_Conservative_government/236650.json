MPs are not able to give themselves pay rises, so we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nThe Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) is responsible for deciding on MPs' expenses and pay. IPSA is independent of both Parliament and Government.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to abolish IPSA and introduce a referendum system, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
