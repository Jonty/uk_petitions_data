        "additional_details": "The legal limit of litters per bitch should also be lowered from six to four, to protect the health of the mother. It should be mandatory for the buyer of a puppy to first see the dog at home with its mother. This should crack down on the reselling of dogs through a third party.",
        "background": "Puppy farms breed masses of dogs for profit with little regard for their welfare. Many dogs in pet shops come from these puppy farms, so by banning their sale it will help drive them out of business.",
