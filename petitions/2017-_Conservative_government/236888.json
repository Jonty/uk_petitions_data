        "additional_details": "Through this I have seen how therapeutic horses can be to people. Horses can help reduce stress levels and anxiety. The Riding for disabled (RDA) have used horses to help the disabled find something they can be good at so they don\u2019t feel isolated. Horses were there for soldiers through the war and charged into battle bravely to save their rider and how do we repay them? We send them to slaughter. Thousands of horses are killed each year in UK slaughterhouses.",
        "background": "I have volunteered at local riding schools for a number of years. Horses can be there as a companion for people who feel lonely. They can even be used to help restore confidence for disabled. Horses have been a vital part of our community\u2019s and don\u2019t deserve slaughter.",
