        "additional_details": "The democratic system is systematically undermined every day by individuals, corporations and organizations who act to influence the actions, policies and decisions of government officers on their own behalf or for a selected group\u2019s personal advantage or gain to the exclusion of the majority.\r\n\r\nIt is important for government officials and MPs serve the public interest first and not get mislead by lobbying parties or advisors who inadvertently act in a lobbying capacity.",
        "background": "The government should change the law to impose a 10% tax on all payments to lobbying organisations.  The tax receipts could be used to establish and fund a public taxpayer interest group which would review all lobbying activities and participate and publicly report on each policy decision change.",
