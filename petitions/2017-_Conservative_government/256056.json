        "additional_details": "The Department for Education outlines in section 15 of the \u201cSearching, Screening and confiscation\u201d policy that schools have the right to legally search the content of the phone without the parents/guardians consent. The police should only have this power. They also cannot be held responsible for any damage caused to the phone. They have the power to delete files if they feel necessary. The guidelines are blurry and parents/guardians are helpless! This needs to change!!!",
        "background": "The Headteacher confiscated our child's phone and held it over the weekend into the school holiday for taking a photograph with their friends! We were powerless to get that phone back. We exhausted every possibility but were turned away from school.",
