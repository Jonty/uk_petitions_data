        "additional_details": "There should be no compromise, the Government leaflet produced before the referendum was clear, leaving the single market, customs union, EU law, freedom of movement and all other aspects of the EU. Anything else is a betrayal of democracy.",
        "background": "David Davis's team produced a white paper for a withdrawl agreement that included a free trade deal that was agreed by Donald Tusk and it was discarded. Instead we now have far worse deal that does not deliver leaving the EU and keeps us under EU law. It is not what was promised to leave voters.",
