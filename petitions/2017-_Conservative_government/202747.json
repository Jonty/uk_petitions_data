        "additional_details": "Children who are flexi schooled, are marked absent which obviously does not look good for their schools attendance records. In the past children who were flexi schooled were marked with a code B which means that they are engaged in approved educational activity off-site) instead of forcing schools to mark them as absent.\r\n\r\nWe need code B brought back.",
        "background": "Flexi schooling offers children the opportunity to attend school part time, allowing them to enjoy the freedom of being home schooled part time. Full time school is not suited for every child, children learn in different ways, sitting at a desk 5 days per week is not for all children.",
