        "action": "Globalisation should be made unlawful by modernising the offence of Treason.",
        "additional_details": "The prime imperative of globalisation is the destruction of the nation-state. It cannot be argued therefore that for any MP to support such a policy without explaining that they intend to destroy the nation-state has to be an unlawful act and should be made unlawful as an act of Treason. Globalists conspire against the democratic will of the 17.4 million people who voted for Brexit and thereby voted to leave the globalisation policies imposed by the European Union.",
        "background": "All political parties have members who support globalisation without any mandate and without explaining to the people what globalisation is and as such to introduce it [by stealth] is undemocratic especially as those who believe in it are sabotaging the referendum vote to leave the European Union.",
