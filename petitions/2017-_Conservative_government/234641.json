        "additional_details": "The people of the UK were ill-informed on the consequences of a BREXIT. \r\n\r\nA proper impact assessment by Govt and politicians in 2016 was not presented. Now after two and half yrs we have that assessment, done and presented by the Govt in the recent days. This is what the citizens of this country required in 2016. It is now the right time and the only basis of holding a real referendum by this country.\r\n\r\nThe House should vote to immediately revoke Article 50 and call for a new referendum in 2019.",
        "background": "Article 50 should be revoked and a new referendum be called for on Brexit. The result of the 2016 referendum were marginal and based on mis-information and the illegal spending by the leave campaign. Many citizens were ill informed and voted wrongly. A responsible Govt will take the right actions.",
