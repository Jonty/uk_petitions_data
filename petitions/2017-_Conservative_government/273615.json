        "action": "Reinstate U.K. Government Subsidies for Tidal Energy",
        "additional_details": "Tidal energy generates more power and is more environmentally and grid friendly than wind or solar. It is predictable and unlimited. The UK holds 50% of Europe's tidal energy resource and 9% of the global share. The UK currently holds the lead in the technology but is in danger of throwing it away through inaction. A tidal energy industry in the UK would create jobs, exports and inward investment particularly in the post-industrial regions, ports and shipyards that we are seeking to rejuvenate.",
        "background": "Tidal energy is more environmentally friendly than wind or solar but is not commercially viable until the government reinstates subsidies stopped in 2016. Renewed support would enable tidal turbines to be deployed at scale, thus driving down the cost, as was so successful with wind and solar energy",
