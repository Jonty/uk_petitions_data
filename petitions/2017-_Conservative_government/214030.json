            "details": "Cannabis is a Class B Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that controlled drugs, such as cannabis, are harmful and can damage people\u2019s mental and physical health, and our wider communities.\r\n\r\nThe evidence from the Government\u2019s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (\u2018ACMD\u2019), is that the use of cannabis is a \u201csignificant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society\u201d. The ACMD\u2019s most recent advice on cannabis is set out in its 2008 report:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/acmd-cannabis-classification-and-public-health-2008\r\n\r\nGiven these acknowledged harms, the Government does not consider it appropriate to hold a referendum on the legalisation of cannabis. Whilst the debate is an important one, the eleven previous referenda have centred on fundamental constitutional issues such as devolution and the UK\u2019s membership of the EU.\r\n\r\nThe legalisation of cannabis would send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs. It would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade, nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery this can cause to families and society. As such, the Government\u2019s position on Cannabis remaining a controlled drug remains clear and there is no intention to hold a referendum on the matter.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
