        "additional_details": "Cycling becomes a more common way to commute to and from work on a daily basis. In bigger cities often we can use cycle lanes that improve the safety of cycling. Anyhow sometimes, as for instance in Tooting and Balham in London, even on Red Route parts of cycling route cycle lane is being shared with parking spaces that can be used from 7 pm. In reality, they are occupied even shortly after 6 pm and it's very rare to see any car being fined or removed after that time. Especially in the winter months, with limited visibility and slippery roads, it becomes a real hazard. Many people work until 6 pm, when they start to come back home roads are heavily parked and cycles have to share narrow lanes with car, buses and HGVs.",
        "background": "In many places, designated cycle lanes placed on red routes are occupied by parking spaces available to use from 7 pm. Having many people work until 6 pm that means it's very likely that when they are most needed, cycle lanes are unusable.",
