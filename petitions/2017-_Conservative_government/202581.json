        "additional_details": "Halton Council and the Mersey Gateway Project claim the crossing will bring prosperity to Halton. These claims are unfounded. Effectively the only thing the crossing will achieve is the alienation of Liverpool, St Helens, Warrington and the surrounding area. The new crossing will only carry around 50% of the traffic of the old crossing as people will find alternative routes. Once Warrington becomes busier will the Government then toll there. Where does tolling end?",
        "background": "The Mersey Gateway crossing is due to open imminently. Users of the crossing who reside outside of Halton will have to pay for the use of this crossing. This is unfair and unjust. All other toll routes in the UK have a viable alternative. This one doesn't.",
