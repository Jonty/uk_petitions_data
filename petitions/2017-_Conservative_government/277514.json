        "additional_details": "Data is being sucked onto the cloud at an alarming rate and we have no idea who in the future will use this data and for what purposes. Most of us have heard stories of data misuse by tech companies. Apps like ClassCharts (developed by Edukey, a TES company) process children's behaviour data and use it to create individual behaviour charts for use in classrooms. As well as jeopardising children's privacy, apps like these may cause some children to feel shame and distress at school.",

I don't think the data is safe and the rules about who gets to look at the data might change.",
