        "action": "Bring forward the implementation of 2% BIK for electric vehicles to April 2019",
        "additional_details": "Currently electric vehicles, particularly those with longer ranges that may suit company car users better, typically have a higher purchase cost than petrol or diesel cars.  Company car users typically keep the same car for 3 years so those making decisions now are likely to avoid electric vehicles because of the increased BIK in 2019.  Bringing the 2% BIK forward to April 2019 would mean that the company car users would be much more likely to choose an Electric Vehicle now.",
        "background": "The government want to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles to help reduce CO2 and improve the environment.  Benefit in Kind for electric vehicles is due to fall to 2% in April 2020 which will help with this. However it is due to rise to 16% in April 2019.",
