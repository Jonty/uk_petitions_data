        "additional_details": "Leeds is the 26th most populated city in the EU (Bradford 57th). All other cities in the the top 65 have a form of mass transit. The metropolitan area is the 24th most populated. All other areas in the top 50 have a form of mass transit. Leeds was found to be the most toxic city in the UK in 2018, heavily caused by the reliance on cars due to poor public transport. Resolution to this problem must be provided by central government (not the five WY local authorities) through an independent review.",
        "background": "Leeds and the wider West Yorkshire region are the most populated areas in the EU without a mass transit system. We demand Parliament look into the previous failings to the region, committing to bring mass transit to Leeds/West Yorkshire through central government support and funding.",
