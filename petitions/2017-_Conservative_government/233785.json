        "action": "Make the DWP form a vulnerability team to support disabled & vulnerable people",
        "additional_details": "I have been working in the world of welfare & benefits advice for 25 years and have seen on a daily basis the difficulties disabled and vulnerable claimants can have with their benefits. Energy companies, water companies and financial services have made great progress providing supportive services for vulnerable customers and I believe it is time that DWP are made to support disabled & vulnerable customers in the same way. The formation of a DWP vulnerable customer team would save lives.",
        "background": "Many disabled & vulnerable benefit claimants have problems with their benefits and are left in vulnerable situations, often with no money and no support. We are asking the government to make the DWP form a vulnerable customer team to support disabled & vulnerable claimants requiring urgent help.",
