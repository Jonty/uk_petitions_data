        "additional_details": "There needs to be a signed agreement when parents split detailing the days that the non-resident parent can see the kids. This should be done at the local council and be a document that is recognised by the court of law as a binding contract. In addition: \r\n\u2022 CSA should be overhauled to take into account not just the non-resident\u2019s income, but their cost of living. \r\n\u2022 The 48 hour fortnight law should be changed to 53 hours, giving the leaving parent a chance to see their kids after school. An extra one day in a week during school half term should also be introduced.",
        "background": "There are parents who have their kids full time, that use the kids as weapons against their ex partners, refusing contact or extra contact to the children, if certain demands are not adhered to. \r\nThis in turn is causing suicide, mental illness, physical illness, and financial hardship.",
