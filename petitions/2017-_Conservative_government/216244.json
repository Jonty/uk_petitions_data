        "additional_details": "Here are some facts (http://www.theworldcounts.com/counters/how_consumerism_affects_the_environment/toilet_paper_environmental_impact):\r\n\r\n- The toilet paper we use could go around the planet every 2 minutes, or travel to the sun and back every 10 days.\r\n\r\n- The difference between using new toilet paper and toilet paper made from recycled materials is 400 million trees, 660 million tons of water, and 45 million tons of oil.",
        "background": "All of us use toilet paper every day.  Has it ever occurred to you that most toilet paper is made from new trees?  Recycled toilet paper is not widely available in shops in this country.  It should be the only option available because of the huge negative impact it has on the environment.",
