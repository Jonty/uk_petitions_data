        "additional_details": "We ask that a suitable Secretary of State who has a working knowledge of and an interest in local politics is appointed.  We also ask that this is a full time post.  We ask that the newly appointed Secretary of State insists on discussions between all parties and seeks a resolution to this impasse as a matter of urgency. \r\n\r\nIf any MLA does not agree to actively engage in discussions to re-establish a legislative body, we demand that the UK government stop their salary with immediate effect.",
        "background": "This petition, from the MLAs Get #Back2Work movement, demands that the UK Government do everything in its power to get MLAs to return to work.  It is two years since Northern Ireland has had a functioning government. Education, Health Services and Industry are all suffering as a result of this.",
