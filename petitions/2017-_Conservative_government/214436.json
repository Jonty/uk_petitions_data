        "additional_details": "Gw pharmaceuticals or British sugar who\u2019s CEO is married to a health minister have been growing in the Uk since 2010 and last year doubled the total yield to 95 tons for export.\r\nThey also produce a drug called satevex and sell  for \u00a3125 per gram to the NHS yet the government says that it has no health given benefits. Well if there is no health benefits how can you charge the NHS (uk gov owned) so much for it and why use a herb that doesn\u2019t have any benefits? Legalise it now",
        "background": "The Uk\u2019s Drug policy for cannabis is wrong and Hypocritical, because they have issued GW Pharmaceuticals a licence to grow medical cannabis and now the UK is the largest exporter of cannabis in the world, but at the same time it is illegal for the population to use a health giving herb. Hypocrisy.",
