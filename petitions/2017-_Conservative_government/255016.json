        "additional_details": "I know many staff that work in the NHS who drive fully electrical vehicles who do not have the benefit of using an alternative fuel, if their car isn't charged they simply cannot drive.  While the use of electric cars is rising, the amount of available charging points is not, and fining drivers who do not have a chargable vehicle would discourage drivers for using these precious charging bays from using these as parking spaces.",
        "background": "Electric and hybrid vehicles cut emissions and can even save drivers money, the government is actively trying to encourage drivers to switch to Electric vehicles but the limited free charging bays provided are being taken up by people who simply wish to park their cars.",
