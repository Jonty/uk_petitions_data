        "action": "Raise awareness of Nitrogen Dioxide exposure by expanding the UKs sensor network",
        "additional_details": "Exposure to any amount of nitrogen dioxide impacts our health and  our children's health.  Despite this there is limited coverage of the exposure we face in our daily lives.  There are few monitors and no public information showing pollution across our transport network, in schools, offices and levels inside vehicles. We therefore call upon the government to increase awareness of NO2 exposure by funding additional sensors and research into hotspots so information is available to the public.",
        "background": "Levels of Nitrogen Dioxide across the UK are constantly over WHO limits, causing detrimental damage to our health. Awareness of high pollution areas is still low as the monitoring set up covers very few locations so people cannot take informed decisions to reduce their exposure.",
