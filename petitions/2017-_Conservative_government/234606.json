        "additional_details": "The train company has not hit it's targets which they alone set. \r\nWith peak services into London being late almost everyday in and out. \r\nConstant signal failures or trespassers and broken down trains see's only the fare paying travellers suffer. \r\nServices are getting worse overall year on year. \r\nAction needs to start to prevent fare rises when services promised are not met.",
        "background": "Southeastern trains have suffered delay after delay and cannot deliver on their timetable. This would warrant an argument of unfair dominance towards their 3+% rise for 2019.\r\nCustomers believe this is unfair and an abuse of their power over commuters.",

The price of train tickets is the responsibility of train operating companies. \r\n\r\nWhile the UK Government and Parliament do not directly set the price of train tickets, the Government can set the rate by which train operating companies can raise some ticket prices. You could start a new petition calling on the Government to change this rate, or a petition asking for other changes to the way in which train fares are set.\r\n\r\nIf you want the Government freeze rail fares across British service providers in January 2019, you may wish to sign this petition instead: \r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227305"
