        "additional_details": "Today's elderly are no more vulnerable than the younger generation going on holiday. The older generation will not get in a drunken unconscious state, or be high on drugs.\r\nFor example; on a ship or in an hotel out of say, 3,000 elderly people, you may have one or two that may require medical attention. On that 1 or 2 week holiday the insurance profit made is madness.\r\nThe older generation are subsidising all other insurance applicants, this is ageist and against those with any medical condition.",
        "background": "People live longer and are fitter, all other insurance is not based on age or health. It is an excuse to boost profits and reject claims.\r\nThey are discriminating due to age and also those that have any sort of medical condition present or passed.\r\nAfter 10yrs no medical claim.  A clean sheet again.",
