        "action": "Bring back the death penalty in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "As well as this that bringing back the death penalty in the UK will lower major crime rates. This is because potential murders or armed robbers may see the death penalty as a reason not to commit the crime because they will not want their life taken. As a result of the death penalty being brought back the major crime will decrease because criminals will fear death and this will make Britan a safer place.",
        "background": "I believe that bringing back the death penalty in the UK will result in saving lots of money. This is because to house someone in prison costs an average of \u00a3100,000 per year. By bringing back the D.P it will save the UK money and enable them to use money on things like education and the NHS.",
