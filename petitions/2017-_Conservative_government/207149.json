        "additional_details": "Earlier in 2017, the UK celebrated that measles had been eradicated in this country. This was hindered in the 90s by the work of (former Doctor) Andrew Wakefield. I accordance with WHO policy, 'eradicated' does not mean it was completely destroyed. It takes a 95% clearance to gain this status. There has, however, been a resurgence after the rise of the antivaxxer movement and foreign nationals entering the UK who carry such diseases. It takes one person to spread childhood disease.",
        "background": "At various stages throughout childhood, vaccines are administered to prevent fatal diseases that have killed millions of children in recorded history. They're vital to our survival and to those who cannot be immunised for medical reasons. Herd immunity only works if enough people are vaccinated.",
