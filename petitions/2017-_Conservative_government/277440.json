        "action": "any brexit deal done with the EU must be put to a confirmatory UK referendum",
        "additional_details": "On Friday 17th October the DUP announced they could not back the deal being proposed though it was not finalised. Other parties will be divided. Parliament may or may not meet on 19th, and will not be a substitute for a national debate around a yes no referendum. Only a referendum can decide on the future of the UK and the parliamentary process will only divide the nation. A referendum on a yes no basis can produce a majority and only a majority can be democratic",
        "background": "The proposed deal is highly controversial and divisive. The implications are unknown and could not have been discussed in the 2016 referendum. That vote is now unlikely to have a majority as many voters will have died, 2 million young can now vote in a General Election though this not an alternative",
