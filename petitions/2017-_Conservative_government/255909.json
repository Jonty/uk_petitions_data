        "additional_details": "I voted remain, I accept the majority. The PM is not listening to parliament who do not agree with her ideas. We have to leave so now should leave with the majority of parliament agreeing on one answer. A G.E will give a majority one way or the other. At this point we just need to leave with one path forward, to make the most of that path and do what the British do best. Keep calm and carry on.",
        "background": "The PM has not made headway in talks with MPs to back her deal, a majority must be reached to prevent catastrophic consequences for citizens, no more time should be wasted. A new General Election could find a majority either for or against her but we need an answer quickly.",
