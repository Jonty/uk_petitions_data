        "action": "Hold a public inquiry into the effect of the term Islamophobia on free speech.",
        "additional_details": "The term is frequently criticised in articles and online for its conflation of legitimate criticism of a faith with animosity towards a group of people. It is widely perceived as an attack on free speech, and a step towards a situation where only officially sanctioned viewpoints may be expressed.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that a public inquiry be held to understand the effects of this term on free speech, and give the general public a chance to make their voice heard on the matter.",
        "background": "The government admits that there is no official definition of the term, and hence there is no clarity about what does and does not constitute Islamophobia. Given that being labelled an Islamophobe can be disastrous to a person\u2019s career and public standing, this is creating uncertainty and fear.",
