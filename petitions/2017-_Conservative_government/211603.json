        "additional_details": "These management companies do not engage in controlling traffic turn around but rely on ANPR technology to take advantage of human error and public naivity to extract revenue aided and abetted by DVLA.  This data should only be released in cases of damage or injury and for police action.  The appeal system is bias, and it is a shallow victory to win an appeal without compensation matching the claim.  This would reduce the tendency to issue dubious tickets for revenue purposes only - be fair.",
        "background": "Car park management businesses have taken the place of the clamping bandits by introducing \"contract to park\".  DVLA should not assist any civil debt action!  The everyday mundane action to park a vehicle does not warrant a 'contract' = cash cow.  The just answer is a fixed fee or pay on exit-sorted",
