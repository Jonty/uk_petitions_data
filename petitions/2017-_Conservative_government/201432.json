        "additional_details": "A couple with 2 incomes of 49k combined 98k inclusive of taxable benefits will be entitled to full child benefit and no taxation on either earner.  Where as for a couple with one higher earner for example 58k incl taxable benefits and one lower earner say 6k combined 64k.  Would still be entitled to child benefit however the higher earner would be subject to taxation.  For a family with 3 children the benefit would be 2.5k/yr with tax of 2.4k/yr.  This simply is not fair and needs reform.",
        "background": "Currently eligibility for child benefit for couples is calculated on the highest earners salary and taxable benefits.  Basically the higher earner is accountable for taxes if earning over 50k regardless of the salary of the lower earner.  For couples with one higher earner the formula is unfair.",
