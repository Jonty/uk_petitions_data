        "action": "End the new flight restrictions on passengers travelling from Northern Cyprus",
        "additional_details": "Many passengers have been flying to London via a touch-down in Turkey for over 40 years without incident. Therefore This is perceived as a political decision. It has nothing to do with security. Ercan is one of the safest airports in the world.\r\n\r\nThis situation impacts the elderly and disabled, driving passengers south to Larnaca or Paphos airports.\r\n\r\nWe urge the UK government to reverse this policy immediately.",
        "background": "In light of recent security policies in the USA, the UK has followed suit by insisting that passengers in transit from Ercan airport to Stansted (or U.K.) undertake extensive additional security checks at Istanbul airport.",
