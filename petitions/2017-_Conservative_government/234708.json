They ignore all emails, if you're lucky to get a response, it's a generic email, phone line is out of order or constantly engaged. And their chat service is always down. It also resorts to blocking you leaving to join a new supplier. \r\nIt even refuses to refund \u00a3100's worth of credit\r\n\r\nI ask this company to compensate it's customers for all the undue stress it has caused them! For their time spent on phone calls and emails.",
