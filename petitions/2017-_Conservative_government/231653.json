        "background": "The Chequers proposal is a betrayal of the Brexit referendum as it keeps Britain subject to EU law, and the Irish backstop amounts to the annexation of part of the UK by the EU. Both of these facts are contrary to the will of the British people as expressed in the referendum.",
