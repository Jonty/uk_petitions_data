        "additional_details": "Belgium, Germany and Canada have introduced baby hatches where a parent can abandon their newborn baby anonymously. This means that despite this desperate act, the infant is safe and warm and an alert is generated so that someone arrives to care for the child straight away. \r\nThis is scheme is needed in the UK to ensure that these parents have a safe space to leave their child and do not have to resort to leaving the infant at risk.",
        "background": "There have been several cases of newborn babies being abandoned. Most recently and sadly was the case of baby Pearl in Rochdale, Manchester who was found dead in the woods. \r\nMany countries have baby hatches to allow babies to be abandoned safely, where they can receive immediate attention.",
