        "action": "Stop explosive housing growth without infrastructure to support it",
        "additional_details": "This government is determined to build houses. It\u2019s a free-for-all where councils don\u2019t have a 5 year supply of housing land. Green fields around communities outside the green belt are targeted by developers. Local resources are overwhelmed, villages swamped. Country roads and junctions can\u2019t cope. Growth should be spread evenly across council areas to avoid disproportionate impact, not concentrated in a few villages. Petition raised by East Leake in Rushcliffe but happening elsewhere too.",
        "background": "We call on the government to: (a) change planning laws and emphasis so that adequate infrastructure has to be provided alongside new homes; (b) provide grant funding where developer contributions alone are not enough to build new schools and health centres and improve the roads.",
