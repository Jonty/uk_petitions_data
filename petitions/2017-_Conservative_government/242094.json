        "action": "Introduce universal recycling information on all packaging sold in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Lots of symbols on packaging are easily confused with recycling information, such as: plastic resin codes, mobius loop and the green dot. In many cases products with these symbols cannot be recycled. But with a universal system in place the confusion would be eliminated.\r\nSo, sign this petition to introduce universal recycling information on packaging sold in the UK. This will help prevent recyclables from being thrown away and reduce the burden from non-recyclables being put in the recycling.\r\nhttps://www.recyclenow.com/recycling-knowledge/packaging-symbols-explained",
        "background": "Recycling labels on packaging are often conflicting and unclear, resulting in many recyclables ending up in landfill. Since it varies what local authorities recycle, it is seen as hard to have universal info, but schemes like \u2018On-Pack Recycling Label\u2019 show that general information can be conveyed.",
