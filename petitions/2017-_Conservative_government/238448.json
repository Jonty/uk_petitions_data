        "background": "Aberdeenshire council have recently been given the go ahead to collect, Aberdeenshire area's bin's every 3 weeks instead of the every 2 weeks collection. Aberdeenshire council will currently supply the house hold with an extra bin but this will be smaller in comparison to our general waste bin.",
