Affordable housing is not affordable for the average person,  prices of homes range from 150.000 and above. A two bedroom flat on the 1st floor costs between \u00a3300.00 & \u00a3400.000 pounds. A home bringing in \u00a330.000 A year will not be able to afford this. Each year the Government get their pay rise, I suggest that the Government give the people a vote on whether they have achieved their promises before their rise can be granted.",
