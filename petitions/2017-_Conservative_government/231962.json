        "background": "Firework explosions are producing blind panic in animals that are lead to serious injury, deep-rooted, debilitating fears and death. The explosion of fireworks also releases poisonous chemicals and particle-laden smoke, contaminating our natural environment. A ban on public use will simply not work.",
