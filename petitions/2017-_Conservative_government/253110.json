        "additional_details": "As a result of these actions these mps must be forced to to hold by-elections to be re-elected, to ensure the seats they hold have been voted for by the people they represent. How can we the british people allow a new party with no votes to sit in our parliment voting on their own agenda's, power without votes cannot be allowed. These MPs resigned, they no longer represent the mandate they was elected on.",
        "background": "The independent group of MPs who stepped down from their party still hold their seats in parliment, they are now creating a new party without a mandate from the electorate, this unelected party will now hold seats in our parliment. This is completely unacceptable.",
