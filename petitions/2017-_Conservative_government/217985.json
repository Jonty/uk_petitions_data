This needs to change, the laws regarding horses on the roads needs to be updated to protect us from drivers who drive off from a scene leaving huge vet fees, dead  horses and horses  which may never be able to be ridden on the roads again.  riders are now using cameras we have evidence which needs action to be taken from the police. businesses are being ruined because of no compensation or any action from the law",
