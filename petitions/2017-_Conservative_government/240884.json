        "additional_details": "Online dating websites are not regulated as they should be, you don\u2019t need formal proof of identification to be on there so fake accounts are active. This means that children can get dating accounts before consensual age, and it also allows users to pose as someone else. This needs to be dealt with accordingly by means of making it a legality to have to show identification when signing up to these social profile websites.",
        "background": "Dating websites allow any user to get an account without verifying who they are as an individual, by means of identification. This poses a great threat to anyone online and allows users to setup fake accounts or be dishonest about who they are, their age and we must do something to change this!",
