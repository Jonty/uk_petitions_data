        "action": "We want Government funded support for teachers with mental health issues",
        "additional_details": "From research, we have discovered that the majority of mental health support systems were for young adults that stop aged 18. Granted, NHS adult mental health support does exist, however the time patients must wait for this service is incredibly long. This then creates an ongoing issue for people who are still suffering after the age of 18, and are being placed on the never ending waiting list of adult mental health services.",
        "background": "We strongly believe that there should be more government funded support systems put in place for teachers who suffer from mental health illnesses. Also for teachers who feel like they are under too much pressure from crippling workload and could benefit from support to help deal with this.",
