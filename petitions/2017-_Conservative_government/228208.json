        "background": "The average UK commuter spends 11% of their salary on travel, representing up to 5 times as much as passengers in other European countries.\r\n\r\nThis will be worsened in January when a permitted rise of 3.2% is inflicted. Once considered this increase contributes to a 9% rise since 2016.",
