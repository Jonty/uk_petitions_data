        "additional_details": "Adults should be leading by good example. You can't teach responsible drinking while drinking in front of them. It should be respected that there are parents that want to raise their children in alcohol free environments. \r\n1 in 5 children are affected by a parents drinking this also needs to be taken into consideration, for some of those children school is a safe and fun environment. \r\nThere is no argument for alcohol at schools, other than \"we want it\" However there are many disadvantages to it.",
        "background": "Alcohol plays far too big a part in society as it is. Alcohol is a grown up thing that children should not be part of. By having alcohol at children's school events we are not only weakening the safeguarding of the children attending, but also showing them that we drink to have a good time.",
