        "additional_details": "On stagecoach a Child ticket is \u00a32.95 per day and \u00a34 for a adult.This is a ridiculous jump considering there is such a minimal age gap between 15 and 16.At this age most people if working get paid minimum wage for minimum hours, so when traveling to work and to school especially why should a large amount of money go to bus services.If anything there should be an smaller price for buses or a student card for free travel during the week.Bus is the only option for teens and it\u2019s getting too much.",
        "background": "People aged 16 and above have been required to pay full fare adult prices on buses which are becoming very expensive.Once above 15 travel services deem that you suddenly have enough money to be paying adult prices. When teenagers don\u2019t get paid adult wages it\u2019s unfair to pay higher prices for travel",
