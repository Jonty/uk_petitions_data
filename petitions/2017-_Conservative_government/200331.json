If dog owners cannot take responsibility for owning a dog then the people who are elected to keep us safe must act for our us and our children. All dogs in any public areas should be on a lead. Dog owners of which I am one need to be more responsible and understand dogs can and do kill. If you are out with your dog be understanding there maybe other children like Anton scared of your dog.",
        "background": "On April 22nd 2016 my grandson Anton was horrifically attacked by a neighbours pet dog, the dog was not on a lead as the owner set out to walk it. It grabbed my grandson causing severe injuries. \r\nI see way too often dog owners walking with their dogs in public areas without the dog being on a lead.",
