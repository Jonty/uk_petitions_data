        "additional_details": "According to the National Audit Office in 2016 37% of prisoners in the UK where suffering from a mental health crisis in 2016. They also stated that in the same year there was 120 self inflicted deaths, and a reported 40,161 self harm incidents reported. The cost to the tax payer is staggering and these issues are causing unprecedented pressure on our prison and police services.",
        "background": "For too long people going through a mental health crisis are not given the needed support which results in them being put through the criminal justice system instead. This petition is asking for a mental health report to be mandatory before an offender appears before the courts.",
