So far this year just 1 poll supports Leave compared to 74 for staying.\r\n\r\nIf our political masters are truly intent on delivering on \u2018the will of the people\u2019, what is stopping them from asking \u2018the people\u2019 to confirm what their will is today?\r\n\r\nAnother vote does not mean less democracy, it means more.",
