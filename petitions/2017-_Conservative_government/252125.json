The continued underfunding of the NHS and nursing shortages\r\n3. Failure to end austerity causing more and more people to use food banks and commit suicide\r\n4. Continuation of the unacceptable MP expenses scandal at tax payers expense\r\n\r\nThe list is not exhaustive and crosses all 3 main parties wherein all 3 have failed the UK\r\n\r\nThe people demand their right to choose via General Election.",
