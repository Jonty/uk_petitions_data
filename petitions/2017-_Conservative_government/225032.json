        "additional_details": "Having grown up with Staffordshire Hull Terriers, the stigma that surrounds them and other breeds alike breaks my heart. It\u2019s time owners are made responsible for their dog\u2019s actions, as their behaviour is a reflection on how they\u2019ve been brought up. I believe it\u2019s time the list of banned breeds in the UK under the Breed Specific Legislation is removed and instead a list of unfit owners is created. No dog deserves to be known as \u201cthe devil dog\u201d when if brought up right are wonderful family pets.",
        "background": "After the suggestion of Staffordshire Bull Terriers get added to the list of \u201cbanned breeds in the UK\u201d is coming up more and more. I feel it\u2019s time the list in general is removed and replaced with a list of unfit owners to banned them from owning not just dogs but all animals in general.",
