        "action": "Make English Literature an optional subject for GCSE",
        "additional_details": "English Language should remain as a compulsory subject in the GCSE subject selection while English Literature should be optional as it is not a useful skill in later life. Furthermore, the amount that students are required to learn can be overwhelming for them and also requires significantly more effort relative to other subjects.",
        "background": "Many students feel that learning quotations for novels that are outdated and not relevant to today's society is unnecessary and a waste of time, therefore making it an optional subject and replacing it with a lesson dedicated to life skills would prove to be much more useful for the students",
