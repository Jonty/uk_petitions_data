        "action": "Make animal welfare part of the schools curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "It is appropriate to teach animal welfare in schools as many jobs and careers involve working with animals. We should have an understanding of what is involved in the farming of livestock, what actually takes place in a slaughterhouse and the fact that eating animals is not a necessity. \r\nChildren should be made aware of the environmental impact of factory farming and large scale fishing. Facts regarding human nutritional requirements, exactly where and how animal products are obtained and our personal responsibility for all forms of life on earth needs to be studied.",
        "background": "Cruelty to animals is sadly a very common occurrence in the UK. Some is deliberate and some born out of ignorance. Respect, compassion and understanding for all animals is most important if we are to make any positive progress as a society.",
