Therefore, to date, ministers should only have been dealing with any laws, regulations and practicalities necessary to enable the U.K. to continue \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d on the leave date. \u201cThe separation agreement\u201d. \r\nOnly after leaving should any negotiations on the the actual terms have been negotiated. \u201cThe divorce\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s really not that difficult. How dare Ministers presume to know better than those who put them in their jobs in the first place.",
        "background": "Since the EU referendum ministers have increasingly decided that \u201cthey know\u201d that those who voted to leave the EU did not vote for no deal. This is factually incorrect. \r\nAll ministers working to stop Brexit should immediately apologise to the country and resign.",
