        "additional_details": "QE and bank bailouts were in the trillions, that was considered an emergency and the money was found within weeks. Money is needed for green measures now for the whole UK and for households e.g. an electric car, solar panels, rain water collection/reuse systems, air source heat pumps, underfloor heating, thermal stores, wind turbines etc. This debt can be paid off over generations, no need for huge tax hikes; this is an emergency, so act like it is and take a lead other countries can follow.",
        "background": "QE and bank bailouts were in the trillions. This petition demands \u00a330,000 for each household for green measures towards making their residence and residents less dependent on fossil fuels. It, also, demands whatever amount in trillions it takes to deal with the climate change emergency.",
