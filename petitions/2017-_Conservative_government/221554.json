In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"unnecessarily loud vehicles\". We're also not sure whether you to ban vehicles with over a certain noise level, or whether you only want to ban the use of modified exhausts. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. If you want engine noise emissions to be tested during MOTs, you may wish to sign this petition instead:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220264\r\n\r\nYou are more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n"
