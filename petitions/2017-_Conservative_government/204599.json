        "additional_details": "It is important to an animal advocate to share and post in groups to help and save the lives of animals. Networking gets the word out for lost and found dogs, so they can be reunited back with their owners or find them a safe loving home if they are abandoned. Networking of animals who for no fault of their own find themselves stuck in kennels with no family, this can help find them a home where they can be loved and live out the rest of their life feeling the love they deserve.",

Every person who does this is a volunteer, they dont get paid for this, it is all done out of kindness and love for all the animals in need of help.",
