        "action": "Revoke/repeal any bill designed to stop No Deal Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The fact that members are now saying they won\u2019t approve a general election until after they have ruled out a no deal Brexit proves they are well aware that this is what the electorate voted for in the referendum (i.e. leave means leave), and three years on they are still trying to subvert the result. If Parliament really wants to honour the voice of the people, it can not remove the option of No Deal.",
        "background": "This is unsound as the British public voted to leave the EU in 2016, and by its very definition that means no deal - otherwise it isn\u2019t actually leaving is it. It is not Parliament\u2019s call to implement such a bill in the circumstances. The idea is deeply flawed and undemocratic.",
