        "additional_details": "My daughter was recently admitted into hospital, she was there for a week, I had to take it as holiday because i would lose a lot of money if I took it as sick.... firstly I\u2019m not sick and secondly it\u2019s not a holiday, I should be entitled to get paid time off for my child care, but it must be proven time off obviously, I however took it as holiday as I had no choice, this I feel is unfair as you should no be punished for a child sickness, I would work if I was ill, but children are different",
        "background": "I find it ever so unfair when you work hard to support your children, children are far more likely to pick up bugs and illnesses, parent should not have to lose pay or take holiday to cover the time off to look their child it should paid by the employer",
