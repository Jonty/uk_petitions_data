        "additional_details": "Whether you believe in anthropogenic climate change or not, this issue is real that will effect all of us. If any politician does not support this call to action then we need to vote them out of office. \r\n\r\nWHO declared climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century, we need to act now.  \r\n\r\nSince fracking is not the solution to our energy demands, our energy infrastructure could instead be changed to support hydroelectric, tidal stream power, wind turbines, and solar power.",
        "background": "The IPCC report suggests that we have got 12 years before we will reach the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. By then the mitigation of climate change will be impossible. The government has to act now to ban fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) as our energy needs can now be met by renewable means.",
