        "additional_details": "It seems recently many young women who are under 25 have come forward with cervical cancer hence the petition to lower the age of smear tests which was debated but not changed. Are these cases being noticed due to the campaigning? Is the campaigning happening because Cervical cancer is becoming so common? Is this happening due to the hpv being injected and our bodies not fighting it off? We should not be injecting the hpv into boys until we are aware of the results from the current vaccinations.",
        "background": "This should be delayed until there is scientific evidence if there are benefits of the vaccine within women. The first year of women to receive the vaccine within school will be due to attend their first smear test within the next year.",
