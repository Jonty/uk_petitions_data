        "action": "Make breaching Child Arrangement Orders a criminal offence enforceable by police",
        "additional_details": "Giving police power to enforce this crime would reduce the amount of people making a mockery out of the system. It would allow what the court has already decided as right and safe for the child, to continue without dispute.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be an instant deterrent, such as the issuing of an on the spot fine, with the amount increased after further breaches. Alternatively community service.\r\n\r\nWhy should the child suffer any longer then they have to when an informed decision has been made?",
        "background": "Breaching a Child Arrangement Order is a crime but currently the police are powerless. If an order is breached then the only option is to accept it or return to the courts to request enforcement action is taken against the other party. The process takes months, is expensive and emotionally draining.",
