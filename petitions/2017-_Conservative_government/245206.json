        "additional_details": "The European Research Group is a lobbying organisation made up of right-wing Conservative MPs whose specific aim is to lobby for Brexit. This is an unacceptable use of taxpayers' money since slightly under 50% of voters in the Brexit referendum voted to remain in the EU. This group does not carry out true research, it is simply a lobbying organisation. Furthermore, as it has plotted to bring down the UK Prime Minister (Source: The Economist Magazine) and is currently implicitly threatening members of parliament for their votes on matters concerning Brexit (Source: The BBC) it is a threat to UK democracy and we should not be paying for it.",
