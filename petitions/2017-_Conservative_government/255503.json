In particular, we're not sure whether you want to end charges for parking in all NHS car parks or only those operated by private companies.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition calling for an end to all hospital car parking charges, which you might like to sign. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/240157"
