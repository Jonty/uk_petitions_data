        "action": "Reform the UK prison system by adopting a more rehabilitative approach.",
        "additional_details": "Rehabilitating offenders equips them with skills necessary to enter the world of employment. 50% of offenders have a reading age below 11 and 82% have a writing age below 11. To manage everyday tasks people need a reading age above 11 and so once offenders serve their sentence, they re-enter society with the same lack of skills they entered with. This means that they are likely to get involved with things that led them to prison in the first place, resulting in reoffending. Things must change!",
        "background": "The UK prison system is failing. It does not meet the aims of punishment or prevention and doesn't even act as a deterrent as 47% of people leaving prison reoffend within a year (70% for those U18). This needs to change and we propose the change can come from more actively rehabilitating offenders..",
