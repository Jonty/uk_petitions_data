The conservative government has failed on reducing the deficit, massively failed on supporting the NHS and made a complete hash of international affairs and most of all leaving the E.U. The people do not want a coalition government with Island and the people want a general Election called.",
        "background": "This petition is raised to describe the fact that we the people do not recognise the coalition government, we do not recognise the prime minister as democratically elected and do not want her poorly advised Brexit it plans implemented.",
