Manufacturing passports overseas presents no security concerns, with up to 20 per cent of blank UK passports currently being produced in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe contract was awarded on 18 April 2018. All passports will continue to be personalised with the holder\u2019s personal details in the United Kingdom, which ensures that no personal data will leave the UK. This also ensures the continued need for British jobs to service the new contract.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
