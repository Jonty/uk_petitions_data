        "additional_details": "I started work at 18 and have been on minimum wage since then, I am now 20 and I've been seeing my colleages coming out with an extra \u00a3200-\u00a3300 every single month with their \u00a37.50 an hour and to think I could start my life up with that extra \u00a3200 would mean the world to me and I assume it would to alot of other people my age! I work hard every month doing the same work as everyone else to get payed less! It doesn't make sense at all! We should ALL get a set minimum wage that's the same!",
        "background": "18-21 yr olds are paid \u00a35.60 hrly and 21-25 are paid \u00a37.05, why are us youngers being thrown into the pond with lower wages even when we are doing the same job as other colleagues, everyone talks about Equal rights with Women and Men but not about Equal rights between age groups! Its Discriminating!",
