        "additional_details": "Following on from this tweet, after being admonished by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, Donald Trump then insulted Mrs May and the people of Britain further in a second tweet.\r\n\r\nRegardless of your feelings on the Brexit referendum, Britain must now seek to self govern and lead by example. We cannot allow a state visit by a President who has issued a tacit endorsement of a UK fascist hate group. We must demonstrate to the world that independent Britain is compassionate, principled, and just.",
        "background": "On 29th November, Donald Trump retweeted misleading Islamophobic content from the deputy leader of the far-right UK fascist organisation \"Britain First\". In doing so he endorsed their views and placed himself in direct opposition to our Muslim family, friends and colleagues across the UK.",
