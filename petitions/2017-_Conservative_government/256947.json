        "additional_details": "The PM has failed to get her deal through parliament, it remains unchanged with little hope of passing unless it ties us closer to the EU, which is BRINO and the only thing MPs will accept. Her deal is unacceptable to Parliament and the people, so this current delay has to be productive by first replacing the PM with someone who believes in Brexit as is a strong and stable leader.",
        "background": "As Brexit has been extended by 6 months, it is now time to have a PM who can deliver a real Brexit, one who can stand up to the EU and can form a unified cabinet.  As the Tory party failed to remove the PM, we the electorate demand she steps down in favour of a true Brexiteer so the UK can leave.",
