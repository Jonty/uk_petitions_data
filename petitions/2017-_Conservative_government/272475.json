Dissolution is no longer a Royal Prerogative power, it's a statutory provision under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN03861/SN03861.pdf\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about leaving the EU in October 2019 which you might like to sign:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/254329\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/257347\r\n\r\nYou're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition."
