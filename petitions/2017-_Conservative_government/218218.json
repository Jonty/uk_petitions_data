        "additional_details": "Farm animals that are in a sanctuary environment, that will never be entering the food chain nor being rehomed I don't believe need to have ear tags nor slap marks or tattoos for pigs. \nI believe that ear tags are pointless in a sanctuary, they must be extremely annoying, they can get infected, tags are caught and pulled out. I understand the government want a tractability system in place but microchipping will allow all the information that is needed to be on the microchip.",
        "background": "Identification ear tags on farm animals for me and many others are a constant reminder of what certain animals are bred for and where they have come from. I have a farm animal sanctuary and all of our animals will be living the rest of their lives at the sanctuary, so ear tags are not necessary.",
