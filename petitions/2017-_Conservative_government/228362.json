        "additional_details": "Denying a vote to citizens most affected by the decision to leave the European Union was a dereliction of UK democracy. The failure of Parliament was allowing this injustice. The duty is to ensure it never happens again.\r\nHow can anyone be confident that their private life will be respected if British citizens find themselves living in EU countries with no clear status and without the protection of the Citizens Directive 2004/38 and all EU acquis (body of EU law) that protects citizens?",
        "background": "Pass Bill to benefit overseas electors before any further EU vote or general election. 2022 will be too late. Hundreds and thousands of British citizens living and working abroad are disenfranchised, unable to vote on issues which affect them directly (in breach of their basic human rights).",
