        "additional_details": "There is a difference between summer and winter tyres. Winter tyres are made of a different rubber compound with a high silica content which makes them softer and tread pattern has small slits in the tread blocks so they grip the road better, and allow you to safely brake on snow and ice. Drivers are better off with winter tyres whenever the temperature dips below 7C. Cars with winter tyres have significantly shorter braking distances about 20 percent on wet surfaces a little longer on snow/ice",
        "background": "It's that time of year when temperatures start to plunge and drivers should be switching to winter tyres to avoid being caught out by snow and ice on the roads. Winter tyres can cut accidents and give you much better grip on the road even in wet condition",
