        "additional_details": "No parent wants to think about needing to perform CPR on their own child. But administering effective CPR can literally be the difference between life and death. \r\n\r\nParents should be taught life saving skills for in an emergency situation. \r\n\r\nHealth Visitors are skilled professionals whose role is to support families and help them to raise a healthy and happy child. We are petitioning to get infant CPR training provided as part of their post discharge visit. \r\n\r\nPlease sign and help save a life.",

His chances of survival were increased considerably by his daddy administering effective Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).",
