        "action": "Introduce a law banning retailers charging less for plastic-wrapped multipacks",
        "additional_details": "The kind of plastic used to hold food and drinks cans/cartons together takes many years to degrade and can break down into microplastics, which have a particularly devastating impact on our oceans. We've already seen the benefits of charging consumers 5p for shopping bags: single-use plastic bag sales have fallen dramatically. I believe consumers should also pay for the kind of plastic that holds multipacks together by making it illegal for supermarkets to charge less for them.",
        "background": "Many supermarkets offer discount for multipack products, but often these are wrapped in single-use plastic. I believe consumers shouldn't be incentivised to buy unnecessary plastic, when exactly the same amount of product can be bought without plastic holding it together.",
