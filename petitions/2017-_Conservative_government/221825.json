        "action": "Ban charities from distributing collection bags made from plastic",
        "additional_details": "Many campaigns and laws seek to ban or reduce plastic. The UK taxes 5p on plastic bags. People now use a durable \"bag for life.\" David Attenborough's Planet Earth II ended with a poignant call to reduce plastic use. Charities have a genuine desire to make the world a better place. They can continue this noble work and fundraise without dumping tons of plastics on doorsteps. Plastic clothing collections bags are a wasteful, inefficient and environmentally destructive practice which should end.",
        "background": "Charities regularly distribute plastic bags requesting donated clothes. Excessive plastic use severely damages the environment. Millions of tons end up in oceans. Animals die from eating it. Plastic comes from oil, causing greenhouse gases. A charity can do its work without distributing plastics.",
