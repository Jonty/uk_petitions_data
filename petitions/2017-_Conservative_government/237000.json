        "action": "Make audio recording mandatory for all PIP assessments.",
        "additional_details": "Currently you have to contact Atos 3 days in advance to ask permission to use audio recording equipment in your PIP assessment. You have to pay for this equipment yourself and give the assessor an exact copy at the end of the assessment. This means you have to pay out for TWO dictaphones. You also have to sign an agreement, on the day, prior to any recording.",
        "background": "Thousands of people are having to appeal the decision made for their PIP entitlements. To help prevent any misunderstandings between patients and assessors, it should be mandatory for DWP (or ATOS) to audio record every assessment.",
