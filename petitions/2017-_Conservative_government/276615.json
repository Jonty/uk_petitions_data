        "action": "A law that forces a by-election on any MP who changes party after being elected.",
        "additional_details": "Many elected MPs believe they are entitled to switch party at their own will without consulting their constituents and without any consequences. \r\n\r\nThis is an undemocratic exercise as their constituents in a general election vote for the party they want in government and to represent their values but the MP is allowed to move a a completely different party with different values thus no longer representing the majority of their constituency.",
        "background": "The majority of UK voters vote in a general election for the party they want in their area and ultimately in government, not the specific candidate. The proposed law would make it so that if a MP wishes to change party after being elected in another, they would have to face a by-election.",
