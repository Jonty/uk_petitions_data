        "action": "Make prostitution legal in order to make sex workers safe and keep them healthy.",
        "additional_details": "Before creating this petition, we did research on both the advantages and disadvantages of legalizing prostitution and how it would affect people. We also conducted primary research and gave out a questionnaire in school asking teachers their opinion on the issue and explaining how people, especially sex workers, would benefit if it were legal. 61% of the teachers agreed that it should be legalized before we told them the advantages and disadvantages, and 75% agreed after learning the benefits.",
        "background": "For our citizenship GCSE qualification, we must choose an issue that we believe needs attention, and should be discussed as many people are being affected by the stigma on sex workers.This affects their health and safety as they are scared to be tested for STIs or report cases such as rape or abuse.",
