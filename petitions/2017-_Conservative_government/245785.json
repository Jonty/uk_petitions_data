No such silences were held for the Muslim Victims of Christchurch. It is clear that the Premier League, FA, EFL and clubs care less about Muslim lives than they do about other lives. Just as terrorism has no religion, mourning knows no religion. The deaths of those innocent lives must be mourned by people of all walks of lives. The Discrimination and inequality was at show this weekend.",
        "background": "Not a single minute's silence was held at this weekends football matches. Not in the EFL, nor the FA Cup, nor the Premier league.  Considering silences were held for 'lesser' atrocities (think Charlie Hebdo), this is clear discrimination and inequality.",
