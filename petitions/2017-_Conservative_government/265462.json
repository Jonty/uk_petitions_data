        "additional_details": "Some do hold their own policies but more training needs to be given to teachers to adhere to these effectively.Schools do recognise that Bereaved children are a priority,yet aren't equipped to offer full support. Without clear guidance teachers are avoiding intervention through fear of doing more harm than good.\r\nIntervention at the earliest will hopefully prevent further mental health issues developing. By not having a plan and training in place is letting these children down.",
        "background": "There is currently no official rule for a school to provide a Bereavement plan. It is time that changed.\r\nThrough research and speaking to many teachers and TA's, its clear that further guidance & help is desperately needed. Schools need to develop a bereavement plan and train staff accordingly",
