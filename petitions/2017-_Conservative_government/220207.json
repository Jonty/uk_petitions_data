        "additional_details": "We have elected officials in place who are they to serve us. We have proper procedures in place to deal with matters of national concern. There is no reason why Jamie Oliver should strong arm himself into political discourse as he is doing with the proposed ban of '2 for 1' pizza deals. We do not see Lewis Hamilton getting involved with the Department of Transport even though he is a F1 driver. Who is to say a cheap pizza is not as healthy than ones served at \"Jamie's Italian?\"",
        "background": "Jamie Oliver deems it appropriate to get himself involved in deciding the government's policy regarding nutrition. He, a celebrity chef worth \u00a3400 million, speaks condescendingly on what lower income people should and should not eat? This plutocratic exercise of influence must stop.",
