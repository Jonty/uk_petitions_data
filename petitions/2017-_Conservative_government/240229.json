        "additional_details": "A lot of people already have turned to streaming through other sites to stop paying the fee, because they already pay a fee to watch their content.\r\n\r\nIn this modern age, we need to either abolish this fee altogether, or make it into a packaged fee, where there is a small fee for the performing arts sector, and those who want to watch BBC can pay the higher fee.",
        "background": "The majority of the people of the UK hereby call upon the government to abolish the BBC element of the TV licence fee, they keep putting up price hikes at a time when a lot of the general public can\u2019t afford it, with the already inflated taxes.",
