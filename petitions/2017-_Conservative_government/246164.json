        "additional_details": "Today I am starting this petition in the aftermath of the New Zealand attack. The sheer shock and horror of this vile attack has attracted international condemnation and whilst our government has condemned this attack no steps have been taken to respect the deceased. The lives of these  deceased Muslims matter just as much as the lives of non Muslims. We need to eliminate the importance of one over the other with a need to embrace each other's tragedy, in doing so we tackle division and hatred.",
        "background": "Unfortunately, in recent years we have experienced an increase in terrorist attacks on a global scale, affecting people of different race, religion and nationality.\r\n\r\nI implore the government to respect Muslim lives lost with a minute's silence at schools and sporting events.",
