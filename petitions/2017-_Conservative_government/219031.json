        "action": "UK must introduce ID cards urgently to ensure Windrush scandal is not repeated.",
        "additional_details": "National Identity Cards are used in most of the Western World & with machine-readable technology cheaply available, as used in passports, the system will be easily set up. Illegal migration is a blight on legal migrants & already congested roads, housing & public services. With over a million illegal people in the UK, ID cards will help deter those wanting to come illegally in lorries, ID will also reduce chances of terror attacks by assisting security. Political Correctness mustn't stop this.",
        "background": "The recent Windrush scandal occurred because some migrants who came between 1948 and 1971 never applied for British Nationality or came using their parents passports and never travelled abroad so didn't have any ID. The Home Office system needs to get into the 21st Century before more scandals occur",
