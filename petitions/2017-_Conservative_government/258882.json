        "additional_details": "In a recent report, 'RePair' published by Health Education England (2018), financial pressures was one of the top five reasons students left their courses. \r\nThe Royal College of Nursing (2018), state that application to nursing courses for September 2018 have dropped by 12% since the bursary was cut. Mature student applications have dropped even further with a 16% reduction.\r\nMany mature students commute many miles to their university of choice, due to family commitments. Whilst undertaking a full time degree many can not work along side studying and clinical placments, which deepens the financial burden. \r\nWith the added expense of ever increasing childcare costs, it is inevitable mature student application rates are falling.",
        "background": "I and many others who have children have found the cost of childcare a struggle whilst studying for a nursing degree. Myself and others on similar courses, work upto 40 hour weeks within the NHS just like the rest of society, the only difference is students like us now have no bursary system.",
