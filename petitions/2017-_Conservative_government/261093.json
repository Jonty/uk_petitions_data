We're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nTeaching about animal sentience is currently a decision for individual schools, rather than the Government or Parliament. State-funded schools have to follow the national curriculum. Independent schools have to offer a \"broad and balanced curriculum\". You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06798/SN06798.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition with a clear action for the UK Government or Parliament. For example, you could start a petition calling for teaching of animal sentience to be included in the national curriculum.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to include your full name or initial plus surname."
