        "additional_details": "As a family we have still tried to push Methanol Awareness but alone, our message doesn't spread far enough. 17 more tourists have suffered Methanol Posioning in Zante recently and I don't suspect this will be the last cases unless we create some awareness for tourists. We need support to from our government to raise awareness and save lives.",
        "background": "After Cheznye passed away in Thailand in 2013, our family started a campaign to make other tourists aware of the risks of Methanol Poisoning when abroad. After countless discussions with the governmental figures they decided that Methanol Poisoning awareness was not a priority for them.",
