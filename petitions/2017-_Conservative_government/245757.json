        "additional_details": "The answer..there has never been a major prosecution of any IRA in this country.The rate of killing between UK soldiers being killed and IRA members killed is shocking. UK soldiers was 90%-10%, which means the IRA killed 90% more. It's about time this country unites and ends this once and for all for our soldiers.\r\nPlease sign and share if you are a soldier, connected to one or a civilian who just cares about how hard your soldiers work to keep you safe. \r\nOUR SOLDIERS SHOULD NOT BE PROSECUTED!!!",
