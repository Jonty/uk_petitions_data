        "action": "Make the Care Certificate a mandatory minimum qualification for all care staff",
        "additional_details": "In the childcare industry, a nursery must ensure 50% of their workforce are trained to a minimum of Level 2 NVQ for the protection of the children in their care. Aside from DBS checks, many carers are providing care to elderly people in their homes where they live alone, and are doing so without a minimum level of skill.\r\n\r\nAs we face the realities of an aging population in the UK, what price do we put on providing the best possible care for our elderly relatives, friends, and relatives?",
        "background": "The Care Certificate course, an outcome of the Cavendish review back in 2013, has still not been made mandatory training for care workers.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is still no mandatory minimum level of training for care workers and no quality assurance for training in the care industry.",
