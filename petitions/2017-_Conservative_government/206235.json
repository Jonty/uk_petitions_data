        "additional_details": "It is blatant racism that they have banned Tyler for lyrics that were written over half a decade ago, but allow far-right bands that have Nazi sentiments in their lyrics to preform in social clubs up and down the country. What is also preposterous is that The Home Office also acknowledged the fact that it was written from the perspective of an alter ego, thus making Tyler's work no different than that of American Psycho, written by Bret Easton Ellis - a book prominent in modern day literature.",
