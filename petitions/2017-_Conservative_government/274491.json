        "additional_details": "If every GP surgery had a paediatric probe it would save un neccessary referals to hospitals and use of ambulances when children can be treated at the surgery. The extra pressures could be taken from the NHS just for having something so simple as a paediatric oxygen probe. \r\nThe doctor tried to get my babies oxygen levels from his finger using an adult monitor, how can this be right?",
        "background": "On a recent visit to the GP surgery with my 4 month old, he was sent up to hospital as they were unable to obtain his oxygen levels in the surgery due to not having a paediatric probe to measure his oxygen levels. They only have adult readers. This only puts extra pressure on the NHS.",
