It can be done if the military are not in charge of the process - turkeys don't vote for Christmas. It is world transforming.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to the UN should be that: \r\n1. Each state cuts military expenditure and arms by 10% a year for a decade. \r\n2. All arms production and selling stops. Arms firms have 5 year falling state subsidy while they refocus their business. \r\n3. The UN has a (reducing) armed force to clear out terrorist and other armed groups. \r\n4. The UN and all nations police these policies with open access to all military systems. \r\n5. UN Courts decide issues of injustice, infringement of disarmament and international disputes.\r\n",
