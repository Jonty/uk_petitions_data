        "additional_details": "Once a child is adopted the trauma some of them have faced does not suddenly disappear and the support they require needs to be accessible for them especially in education and I believe this starts with training for all staff in schools and nurseries. \r\nFailing in education due to lack of understanding of an adopted childs needs is unacceptable and I want the government to have to answer to why the statistics are so high.",
        "background": "Having been a foster carer, now a parent of two adopted children and working in education, I have decided to speak out for all those families who live with the reality that adoption can bring for their children and education. The statistics for adopted children failing in education are unacceptable.",
