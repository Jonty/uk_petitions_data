        "additional_details": "Upon exposure to this atomised irritant, it was blasted into my home under 3,000 psi of machine fed pressure, I initially suffered a severe burning sensation in my eyes, nose, throat & chest, which continued to cause much discomfort for approx. 6 weeks afterwards; some of my neighbours were similarly affected.\r\n\r\nOn researching the topic I've discovered up to 1m older UK homes may be at risk of this hidden toxin & the EU's listed this substance as a contributory factor to leukemia & nasal cancer.",
