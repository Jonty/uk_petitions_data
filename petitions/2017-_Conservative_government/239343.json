        "background": "New motorcyclists from aged 17 are forced to ride up to a 125cc and have a maximum power output of 11kw. This is very low and can be unsafe, similar to mopeds as they're normally restricted to 28 MPH.\r\n\r\nThis limit has been proven unsafe in many circumstances and should be reconsidered.",
