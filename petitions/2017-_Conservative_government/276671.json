        "action": "Provide girls with free menstrual cups during sex ed week.",
        "additional_details": "Doing this will help in many ways, menstrual cups are good for 10years at least, being reusable means taking out the need to find funds each month for period protection. Girls will stop missing school and feel supported with their monthly flow, most schools give out free condoms like that's the only part of the reproductive system that matters. It will also combat plastic waste going to landfill or ending up in the ocean. It's a win on many levels and most brands are quite cheap.",
        "background": "Girls all over the UK are missing school as they don't have access to period protection and admittedly at a monthly cost it's not cheap. I would like the government to provide menstrual cups free during sex education week to every girl and teach them how to use them.",
