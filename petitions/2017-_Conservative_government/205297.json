If the centres can\u2019t take these thousands of unwanted dogs within a week, it\u2019s curtains, because the pounds are full to bursting, but more and more dogs are pouring in daily, from useless or panicked owners, and misguided or greedy breeders. So an estimated 21 dogs a day are put down in England. It would take at least five years of nobody breeding any dogs at all to get our dogs down to a manageable level.",
