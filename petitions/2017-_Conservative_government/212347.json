        "additional_details": "By helping us sign the petition, you could be helping people who are suffering in silence. If more information was provided by the medical profession then diagnosis would be easier. I would like to get a plan of action to get leaflets and adverts showing symptoms and how a patient can manage. I don\u2019t want anyone to feel like they are alone with this condition.",
        "background": "Loin Pain Hematuria Syndrome is a rare kidney condition. It has only been documented by just over 1000 worldwide due to it being so rare. This condition is severely disabling, often meaning the person can not work or care for themselves. More information needs to be known and more research done.",
