        "background": "When my daughter started travelling to secondary school, from Whitstable to Canterbury, a 6 mile journey, in 2013, the price was \u00a350. Since then, the price increases were as follows; \u00a3100, \u00a3200, \u00a3250, \u00a3270. At 16, the price is now \u00a3400. Education is compulsory until 18, why the increase?",
