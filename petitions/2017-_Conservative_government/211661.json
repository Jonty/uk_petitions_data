        "additional_details": "An employee earning \u00a312000 a year from employment is topped up with approx \u00a3500 of extra support in a month. If a self-employed worker earning \u00a312,000 a year earns an extra \u00a3200 in a given month it would reduce their entitlement by \u00a390, while taking home \u00a3200 less in another month would increase their entitlement by just \u00a35.How is this fair?\r\n\r\nSource: Resolution Foundation",
        "background": "The requirement of MIF removes flexibility for the disabled, zero hours contracts and self employed workers, which by nature can be seasonal and erratic.It undermines the contribution that disabled and self employed people make and throttles entrepreneurs who could ultimately go on to employ others.",
