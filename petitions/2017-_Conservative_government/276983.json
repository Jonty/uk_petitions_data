        "additional_details": "The review should be commissioned by the Department of Education and be led by an independent Chair, endorsed by youth leaders from representative organisations, such as UKSCN. It should cover all aspects of formal education in England, including tertiary education. It should start summer 2020 and report by spring 2021. As well as reviewing current practice, it should make a series of costed recommendations where appropriate.",
        "background": "If young people learn about the climate emergency we can prevent the mistakes of the past and change the future. We believe climate change should be a learning entitlement. We call on the government to commission a review on how our education system is preparing students for the climate emergency.",
