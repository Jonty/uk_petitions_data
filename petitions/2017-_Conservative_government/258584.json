There needs to be a scheme for families to be able to still work and it be affordable! We are doing what the government ask yet get nothing in return when the help is really needed. People struggle every day to feed their children and keep a roof over their head no one deserves the worry of extra Bill's during school holidays.",
        "background": "I personally work 25 hours a week, and I struggle during school holidays and especially the summer holidays. There is no help for low income parents, I have had to leave jobs previously just to be at home with my child. I'm expected to pay \u00a3150 a week on a low income.",
