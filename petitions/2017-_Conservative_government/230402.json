        "additional_details": "Our hope is that one day, disabilities will no longer be a barrier to living life to the full. People with disabilities should never face discrimination and should never be excluded from buildings or activities because of a lack of access.\r\n\r\nIn a recent report by the Children's Commissioner Sally Holland, it was discovered that 4 out of 22 councils did not have their strategies in place even though they are required to do so by law, and the government have not updated their guidance since 2004!",
        "background": "We want there to be an introduction of legislation which mandates all UK schools to be fully accessible.This will include setting out national guidelines for schools to follow, taking the responsibility away from the local authorities ensures there will be consistency in the levels of accessibility.",
