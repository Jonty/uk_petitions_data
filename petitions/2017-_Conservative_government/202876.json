        "additional_details": "Failure to publish 50+ studies on the impact that BREXIT could have on the UK & more importantly on Constituents prevents MPs from complying with the Code as they are not in possession of the facts. The documents should be made available to the House to allow them to meet their obligations to the people who have elected them.",
        "background": "The release of BREXIT Impact Study documents to MPs will allow them to carry out their duties under The Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament & act accordingly in the best interest of their constituents.",
