        "additional_details": "Any economic value from a trade fair is of little worth when it is associated with mass displacement and slaughter. Instead, the UK should be holding perpetrators to account, and deploying sanctions to prevent further suffering. The UK has officially stated \u201cit is the Burmese military who are the root cause of these longstanding problems.\u201d Companies attending the trade fair will be linked to the military, and hence those in Myanmar who benefits from UK trade are those complicit with atrocities.",
        "background": "The UN is calling for investigations for genocide following gross human rights violations committed against the Rohingya and minority populations. The Myanmar corporate sector is closely linked with its military, and the UK should not be trading with companies complicit with these atrocities.",
