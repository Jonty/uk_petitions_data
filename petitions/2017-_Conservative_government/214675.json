        "additional_details": "FIGS-Fighting Inequality for Girls on the Spectrum is a national campaign group set up to raise awareness of autism in girls, protracted time taken to get diagnosis, the impact on mental health and lack of suitable educational provision. A poll of our members showed the average age of diagnosis for a girl is 15 years for a boy it is 5 years. There is clear evidence to show the importance of early diagnosis and support, when this doesn\u2019t happen it can lead to mental health crisis.",

We are calling for a gender neutral assessment which will flag up the multiple presentations of autistic spectrum condition.
