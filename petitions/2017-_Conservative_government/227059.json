        "additional_details": "A number of motorbikes and some cars frequently disturb me, often during the night or very early morning. Most people with whom I discuss this have also been disturbed.\r\nOne motorcyclist wakes me any time between 5:30 and 6:30am. He starts from his home, which I haven't yet identified, pushing his bike, and starts it up outside my house. He clearly knows it is too loud and avoids disturbing his own family.\r\nThe Chief Medical Officer has expressed concern about air and noise pollution.",
        "background": "There are an increasing number of motorbikes and cars with exhausts that can be heard through double glazing and from over a quarter of a mile away. They disturb sleep, prevent conversation and cause stress. Their only purpose is to draw attention to the vehicle",
