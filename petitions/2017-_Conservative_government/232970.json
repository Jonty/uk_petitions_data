        "additional_details": "This 'misleading' starts from the top down. Something is seriously wrong if the PM of this country could claim pre- Brexit Referendum that it is 'clearly in the National interest' to remain in the European Union but subsequently continues to use the same terminology (in the National Interest) to defend here plans to take this country out of the European Union. This is both unethical and misleading. Trust in the political system needs to be restored and politicians need to be held accountable.",
        "background": "Trust in politicians and the political system is the bedrock of democracy. In the still ongoing Brexit debate (and in other discussions) many untruths were/are presented as facts by politicians. This has eroded trust in the political system immensely, is unacceptable and needs to change.",
