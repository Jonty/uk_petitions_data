        "action": "Ban the sale of new fossil fuel burning cars by 2025",
        "additional_details": "Technology in the automotive industry has reached a turning point - access to battery electric vehicles is better than ever and improving constantly. However, the automotive industry continues to profit from the burning of fossil fuels. Only a drastic change such as this, creating the largest market for zero-emissions vehicles in the world, can force them to innovate and compete to bring the cost of this technology down. Exemptions of limited duration should be made only for specialist vehicles.",
        "background": "Current government strategy is to ban the sale of new fossil fuel burning vehicles by 2040. This policy is grievously inadequate, as estimates show that to avert the worst effects of climate change, global emissions must be cut to zero before 2030.",
