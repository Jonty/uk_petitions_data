        "additional_details": "The Government's refund guidelines for NHS workers quotes 'Payments made by employers to workers getting full-time instruction can be exempt from Income Tax & NI contributions if certain conditions are met' (Gov.uk).  The responses from HMRC and Trusts when trying to reclaim Tax & NI has proved to be a long laborious, inconsistent process, with lack of clarity and lack of publication of refund possibilities. Some have received Tax & NI, some only tax and others nothing whilst identical contracts.",
        "background": "The WAT scheme introduced to assists NHS workers improve their knowledge on a qualifying WAT course, any payments received was to be exempt from Income tax and NI'. Virtually all staff had tax and NI deducted but reclaiming these payments for many is inequitable, inconsistent and often refused.",
