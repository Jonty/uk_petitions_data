        "action": "Make national rugby accessible to all to watch",
        "additional_details": "How can we be expected to support & celebrate our own nation in a sport in which we are world class when we are unable to watch without subscribing? The move of national sport from terrestrial TV to subscription services is going to gradually quench the ability for supporters to follow their nation & ultimately reduce participation in the sport. Not only will this reduce the passion for our nation but reduce any future prospects for a world leading team when we are at the very peak of the game.",
        "background": "Home nation rugby should be available to all through live coverage on terrestrial tv channels.\r\nIt is absurd that one of our home nation teams playing one of our most popular sports is now only available to those who can afford to, and pre-plan to use subscription television.",
