        "additional_details": "A self employed parent who can biologically have a child can receive statutory maternity leave and pay.  If for whatever reason they have chosen to adopt a child this self employed parent has no rights to adoption pay and leave.  \r\n\r\nBy leaving self employed adoptive parents to self fund and not work over this leave, it places another barrier to the adoption process.\r\n\r\nA prospective adopter will have a strengthened application if they can show how one parent can commit to adoption leave.",
        "background": "Statutory adoption pay and leave is not available to those who are self employed however statutory maternity leave and pay is.  This is discriminatory against those willing and wanting to give the best start to an adopted child by being at home to nurture, care and develop a bond with their child.",
