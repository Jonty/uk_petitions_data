        "additional_details": "Votes for \"No\" are wasted votes. They do not indicate whether the given choice was the most hated option or the second-most favourite option. If Parliament is to provide an answer to Brexit, it must do so intelligently and by means which maximises the value and meaning of every single vote cast. This cannot be achieved by separate Aye/No on four or more choices.",
        "background": "Parliament used Aye/No voting for the several Brexit choices on two occasions. This is the least intelligent means for producing a consensual, meaningful winner. MPs should rank their choices in order of preference such that a transferable vote can determine the most popular outcome.",
