It would also to save the NHS time and money when appointments need to be cancelled for this reason.",
        "background": "Patients can usually request to see a doctor of the same gender when booking medical appointments on their own accord, but this petition calls for medical providers to give their patients agency on who they are seen by for sensitive appointments such as breast checks and pap smears.",
