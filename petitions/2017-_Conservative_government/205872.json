        "additional_details": "Announced in the news today (22nd November 2017)- source The Independent News.  One paragraph says hunting will be reintroduced and labs can test with as much cruelty as they wish with no pain relief!! This is disgusting and shouldn't be allowed to happen. Animals have feelings and can feel every inch of pain just like any normal human being! It is a shame the UK government cannot see this!",
        "background": "The government has voted that animals do not have feelings or feel pain. This is absolutely absurd! If this is true then when/if Brexit happens any animal can be a victim of cruelty, neglect and hardship with no repercussions! Ban animal testing and any form of cruelty!!",
