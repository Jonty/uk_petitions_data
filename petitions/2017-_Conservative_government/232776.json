The obesity crisis is serious, but this is not the solution.\r\n\r\nBBC report: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46179175?SThisFB&fbclid=IwAR2_MwWYdlQU4p8SeoADkSdm40-8ajWkqgkqdzXQTKH0iXH0tz0U2qpM3a0",

Large, thick milkshakes are a tasty occasional treat, and virtually everyone treats them as such.",
