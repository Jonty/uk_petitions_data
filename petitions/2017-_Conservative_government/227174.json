        "additional_details": "The Council misses out on the initial payment.\r\n\r\nThe home owner has no reduction\r\nin Council Tax.\r\n\r\nThe road is not private and so any member of the public can park or drive on or through it.  There is absolutely no benefit to the house owners who are paying hugely for the upkeep.\r\n\r\nThe only person to gain is again, the BUILDER.\r\n\r\nI ask the Government to stop this farce. Amend the 1980 Highways Act and insist that all roads are adopted and maintained by the councils as we all pay our Council Taxes.",
        "background": "Previosly good quality roads on new housing estates, were adopted by Councils and added to the highways programme to cover maintenance. Instead of paying a fee to the Council some Builders keep ownership of the the roads bring in a mgmt company & charge huge rates to the home owners for the upkeep.",
