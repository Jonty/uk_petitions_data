        "additional_details": "My father was a political refugee following the 1980 elections in Jamaica, it was hard for mum as a single mother with little education. I migrated to the UK in 1997 to join my wife who was having our first child. My mum traveled back and forth to the UK for visits. When we were about to have our 3rd child in 2002, we decided that it was best for her to stay and that was the start of our struggles with the Home Office to get them to grant her indefinite leave to remain.",
        "background": "On 24/11/2017 my mum was detained at a IR centre and hastily removed from the UK giving us little time to prepare given her age. The NRC just sent her back without proper consultation or duty of care as to how she would be cared for once she is there, since her immediate family is here in the UK.",
