In particular we're not sure which public offices you're concerned about.  \r\n\r\nWe can only accept petitions which call for clear actions that are the responsibility of the Government or Parliament. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for people convicted of animal cruelty offences to be disqualified from being Members of Parliament, if that's what you'd like to happen."
