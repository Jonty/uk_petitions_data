Furthermore, third party JavaScript allows them to change NHS page content as they see fit, access data on it or act as the user on pages. I've complained directly to the NHS, ICO and Ministers in the hope of getting this fixed, but it is still a serious problem.",

Instead, Facebook and other companies went on to get data for a further 7 years. NHS privacy policies say that there's tracking. Such 3rd parties should be barred from NHS websites and mobile apps.",
