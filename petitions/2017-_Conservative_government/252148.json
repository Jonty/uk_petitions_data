        "additional_details": "Campaigners, politicians and civil servants - on both sides -  variously lied, exaggerated and misrepresented facts, causing the referendum result to lack integrity. We need a law like Perverting the Course of Justice  to ensure electoral decisions are not based on lies or deliberately misrepresented facts and that opinions and speculation should be presented as such and not fact. It happened in the Europe and Scottish referendums and without legislation it'll happen again.",
        "background": "The mess we are currently in after the Europe Referendum is caused by  the lack of integrity of the information given to base our decision on. Campaigners lied, exaggerated and misled us and an important and consequential decision lacked dependability. The law must be used to prevent a recurrence.",
