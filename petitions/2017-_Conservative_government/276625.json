Petitions which reach 100,000 signatures are almost always debated. The Committee may decide not to put a petition forward for debate if the issue has already been debated recently or there\u2019s a debate scheduled for the near future. We're therefore not sure exactly what further action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for petitions with over 250,000 signatures to be debated in the main chamber, if that's something you'd like to see happen. \r\n"
