        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson has time and time again proven to make countless mistakes, bigoted comments and has already failed to get the EU\u2019s support for his Brexit plan describing it as \u201csimple and full of cheap promises.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhether you are for Brexit or not, Boris is not a suitable MP to take on this role, especially as he has let the UK down during lesser roles.\r\n\r\nTwo previous PM\u2019s have stepped down in this role after creating this mess. Let the people decide who is suitable, we are a democracy after all.",
        "background": "Over the recent period of the Conservatives being voted in, both Cameron and May have quit their positions and we have been left with whoever the party decides. It should be the people\u2019s vote not the parties. Johnson has proved why he is not a suitable fit, including his infamous racist remarks.",
