        "additional_details": "I'm creating this petition to help others in my situation, who physically cannot work due to a motor vehicle accident. Crashes, accidents and injuries sometimes cannot be helped, if you've been injured from the same case to mine or one similar, why should the injured party suffer due to carelessness of another person? It's certainly not fair that the injured party has to live off of \u00a3360 a month when the other person can go back to work and earn their standard living wages a month.",
        "background": "I'm currently receiving sick pay of \u00a3360 a month, due to being hit by a car off my motorcycle by a car driver resulting in breaking my shoulder. The \u00a3360 a month that i receive soon disappears due to bills and it's very hard to live off of this amount of money a month, when i physically cannot work.",
