        "action": "Introduce impact of humans/plastic on the environment to the primary curriculum.",
        "additional_details": "The response from people of all ages after watching David Attenborough's Blue Planet II was overwhelming - people want to change the way we use plastic. However children of a primary school age do not necessarily have access to the information provided by the series. Educating all children across the country allows them to make their own judgements on what is right or wrong for the future of plastics and inform them for when they're old enough to vote on such matters.",
        "background": "The effect we as a species have on the environment, especially when discussing plastic, is extremely important and may have considerable consequences on the lives of today's children. Educating them will help them understand how to help and protect the environment and their future.",
