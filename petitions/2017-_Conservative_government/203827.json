        "additional_details": "The Scottish Independence Referendum of 2014 refused the vote to citizens of the UK born in Scotland, but who resided in another nation of the UK. Since this would likely impact their citizenship (stateless?) and ability to work, they should be able to vote.\r\n\r\nThis is a general petition, and is not specific to a future Scottish Referendum. Any citizen of the UK, born in a UK nation (Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England) where their birth-Nation has a referendum, should be able to vote.",
        "background": "If a UK nation considers a referendum about independence from the union, or a related topic that affects the stability of that union, then voters born in that nation, and who are citizens of the UK residing within the UK, must be able to vote on the referendum topic.",
