        "action": "Require all car manufactures to offer retrofitting of L.E.D DRL",
        "additional_details": "In the research conducted by the European Commision in 2006 it has been confirmed that they have potential in reducing road deaths due to making the vehicle more visible to other road users during the day and are then switched off when sidelights/dipped lights are switched on. \r\n\r\nThird party retrofitting systems are available but are not very reliable, hence why I wish all car manufactures to offer LED DRL's that would be installed by the manufacturer themselves.",
        "background": "I acknowledge that it is now a legal requirement for new cars to be fitted with DRL, however older vehicles can be retrofitted with them as they have a lot of benefits.\r\nThe point of the petition is to make it a legal requirement for all car manufactures to offer retrofitting LED DRL's",
