        "action": "Raise the legal sex age to 18 years of age",
        "additional_details": "At the age of 16 we are told that sexual intercourse is okay when that just is not the case. If you're not ready to be parents you should not be having sexual intercourse at 16 you should be planning on what you are going to do at college, not worrying about being a parent, and as explained you should be an adult to be a parent not a child.",
        "background": "Under 18 years of age we are classed as children therefore children can not make a decision on sexual intercourse as they will not have the correct mentality and full understanding to do so. This will also allow for children to get through further education instead of becoming teenage parents.",
