        "additional_details": "Since the introduction of Citizenship Education in 2002, political support for the subject has wavered. Right now, the subject is not a policy priority for the Government. Due to low subject status and the lack of funding for trainee teachers, there are only 40 Citizenship teachers being trained per year. Quality Citizenship teaching helps our young people to gain political understanding and develop the skills required to have their voices heard: it must be the cornerstone of our democracy.",
        "background": "As Citizenship teachers we're concerned about the status of our subject. There is currently a postcode lottery which determines the provision of quality political education in secondary schools for our young people. This is unfair and reinforces inequality. It is time for our Government to stand up.",
