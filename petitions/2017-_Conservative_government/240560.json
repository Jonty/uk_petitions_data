        "background": "As students at Anglia Ruskin (Chelmsford), we are forced to use the park and ride system as there is no parking on the University campus. This adds time to our already long commutes and an unnecessary amount of money. We understand that we are paying for parking and use of the bus, but we HAVE to.",
