        "additional_details": "It's a condition that one is born with and it will never not be there. There isn't medication to lessen the symptoms of Autism or to control them. There is a lack of education with the very people we put our trust in. The DWP response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request stated 80% of Mandatory reconsiderations are rejected as performance indicators. That's almost 9 out of 10 people! There is much needed information being missed out in assessments where invisible illnesses are concerned.",
        "background": "Regardless of where on the Autistic Spectrum an individual is, low or high functioning, they are similar but all have different needs. The biggest problem all ASD sufferers have in common is social and communication skills.",
