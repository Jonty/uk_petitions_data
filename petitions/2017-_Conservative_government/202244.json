        "additional_details": "Vets Now recently charged \u00a3140 for emergency consultation, to update the database \u00a317 and admit the pet to hospital \u00a3200.80 then administer the medication, blood test and scan which eventually totalled \u00a3702.04. A further \u00a3700 was issued and then consulation and putting the pet to sleep costing \u00a3240. \r\nThe total cost was \u00a31640.84 with VAT and didn't result in saving the life of the pet as the Vet wanted more money costing over \u00a33000. \r\nRidiculous prices which need agreeing and regulating.",
        "background": "Veterinary fees are excessive and affect the consumer in many ways. The fees also push up the pet insurance fees where many pet owners cannot afford these. \r\nThe vets know the owners don't have the money and then charge excessively knowing the owner will pay the fees to protect their beloved pet.",
