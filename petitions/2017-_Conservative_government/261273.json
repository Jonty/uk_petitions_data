        "action": "Set a limit of \u00a33 per day for parking at railway station car parks",
        "additional_details": "Commuters across the country face extortionate parking fees every day, on top of their rail fares. Parking at railway station car parks can cost commuters as much as \u00a323 per day. This is an unnecessary tax on hard-working motorists.\r\n\r\nIn many areas, it is cheaper for commuters to drive to nearby residential areas and get a taxi to the local train station, putting pressure on residential roads and restricting access for locals.\r\n\r\nSign the petition above for fairer charges at railway car parks.",
        "background": "Parking at train stations is too expensive.\r\n\r\nAt present, car park operators are not offering value for money. With the cost of living ever increasing, this is an unnecessary tax on hard-working people.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for a \u00a33 per day limit at all train station car parks across the UK.",
