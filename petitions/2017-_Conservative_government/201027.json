        "additional_details": "This plan is masked as a benefit to the local area and society as an Energy Centre but has little/no advantages to the local community, individual health, the environment itself, not to mention the toxicity of polluting the air with energy waste, going against the core strategies for cleaner air. Numerous pages across Facebook have been created in an attempt to prevent this harmful Enery Centre being based in this area. Please sign the petition to make our voices heard.",
