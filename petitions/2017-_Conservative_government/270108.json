Parliament voted against a deal, against alternative options and will carry on doing so. \r\n\r\nPM Johnson should go the the Queen and ask for a prorogation of parliament until brexit is delivered. The government are committed to leaving the EU by 31st Oct and this is the only way they are able to.",
