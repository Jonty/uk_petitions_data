        "additional_details": "500 characters is insuffient to provide the supporting examples. In short, when interviewing political candidates the BBC employ subliminal/psychological tactics to present candidates they do not approve of in a negative light. BBC website articles are written with a political / social bias. They display an ideological bias and agenda within their light entertainment, have a history of scandals, are niether fair nor balanced, but deeply politically motivated. Examples available on request.",
        "background": "As a publicly funded corp the BBC should be neutral in its reporting. However it is deeply politicized and continually displays political/social bias across all its content. As such it should privately fund its self as any other politically bias network would and no longer receive public funding.",
