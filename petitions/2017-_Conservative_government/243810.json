        "additional_details": "Even if the money does get awarded back to the tenants, no repercussions are taken against the agencies who were trying to overcharge. Due to both no consequences for the agencies and financial circumstances for the tenants, these excessive charges are frequently being accepted. This happens time and time again with student properties and happened to myself in all 3 of the houses I rented whilst at university. It is unacceptable to take advantage of people in vulnerable situations and receive no consequences.",
        "background": "Many letting agents deem it acceptable to try and charge excessive amounts for repairs at the end of a tenancy, which are not often undertaken. The only way to overcome this is through the DPS which takes many months to complete and affects those in vulnerable financial situations who cannot wait.",

For example, you could start a new petition calling for the DPS to be given powers to seek fines on landlords if that is something you would like to see happen."
