        "additional_details": "Walking through supermarkets we often pick things up for their convenience without giving a second thought to what happens to the packaging once we\u2019re done with it. Recently however, we have seen shocking footage of marine life facing the consequences of human waste such as a mother whale not wanting to leave behind her dead calf, poisoned by plastics. This cannot go on. Seeing the devastation caused as you\u2019re about to pick up something wrapped in plastic might make you think twice about it.",
        "background": "Putting images or warnings about the damage caused to our environment, particularly marine life, by single use plastic bags and packaging will deter people from buying these items and push large producers of such items to use biodegradable alternatives. We cannot let nature suffer our waste anymore.",
