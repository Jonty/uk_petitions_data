Doctors portray every mum should be healed fully by 6 weeks postnatal check & after this time you seem to be forgot about. There should be more support for mums after this time like there was through pregnancy, not just for physical but also for mental health as well. It\u2019s something I feel very strongly about as you can be well 18 weeks and still not healed.\r\n",
