How dare a scheme which does not benefit anyone in the effected area at all destroy landmarks, homes and livelihoods \u2013 not to mention the years of upheaval while the project is being built. The scheme is a waste of taxpayers money \u2013 it was originally predicted to cost \u00a332.7billion, but now costs have skyrocketed to \u00a356 billion and counting. So we need your help!",

If the project was stopped this money could be put towards much better uses! \r\nThe rail will destroy nearly 10,000 acres of land, over 2,000 buildings, including 1,000 homes and over irreplaceable 60 woodlands.",
