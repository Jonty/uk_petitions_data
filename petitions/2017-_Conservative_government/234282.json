        "additional_details": "In the current age of coipies media options,  the BBCs relevance is questionable. With austerity measures in place,& strain on NHS, police, and services personnel the circa \u00a33.9bn of licence monies would surely be better spent on our frontline social responsibilities than on a broadcaster.Split 3ways this funding could provide \u00a31.3bn each and train and pay for 10,000s of new nurses and officers, which is of due consideration due to potential drop in overseas worker numbers resulting from Brexit",
        "background": "The TV licence fee funded the BBC circa \u00a33.9billion in 2018, and I believe this would be better spent on our NHS,  police and armed forces than on what is fundamentally a media outlet. Split 3 ways it would train and  fund salary of tens of thousands of nurses, police officers and forces personnel",
