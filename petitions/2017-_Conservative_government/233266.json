        "additional_details": "We currently trade with the rest of the world under WTO regulations. This does not currently create customs or border issues so should not be feared as the result of a no deal.\r\nIf we could establish a free trade deal with EU for goods and farm produce, there would be no need for either a hard border between NI and the Irish Republic, nor between differing parts of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "Mrs May originally said \"no deal is better than a bad deal\". The current draft Brexit deal is a bad deal that does not achieve the detailed outcomes she originally described for Brexit. She should negotiate a free trade deal for the UK (ie no hard border required with Eire) or leave with no deal.",
