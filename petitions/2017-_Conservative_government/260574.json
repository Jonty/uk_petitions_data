        "additional_details": "School education grant cash has not kept pace with inflation so its value is worth less year on year and valued teachers & assistants are being lost due to these severe circumstances. Children are our future and they deserve a first class education. Investment in our schools should never be seen as a burden on the taxpayer. We ask the government to increase funding so that we can all share in the prosperity of the future, knowing the next generation of great minds have been invested in properly.",
        "background": "North East Schools are being hit hard by government under-funding. There's not been an increase on a per-pupil basis from 2010-17. Fishburn Primary School are facing funding cuts of \u00a330,000+ by 2019/20 compared to 2015/16 and this is forcing the school to make redundancies to cope with the deficit.",
