        "additional_details": "The road, directly outside the school, is 5.5 metres wide. The legal width, to allow 2 lorries to pass each other, is 6 metres. There were over 250 objections to this, which the Council chose to ignore. The applicant has fabricated figures, stating that previous operations in the area allowed 32 HGV movements per day. These figures are a lie, yet nobody from the Council has even checked! Our children\u2019s lives are in serious danger if this is allowed to go ahead.",
        "background": "Residents and parents have been battling this for two and a half years. Our local Council have recently passed an application, which will allow 40 x 44 tonne lorries pass a primary school. They cannot do this without mounting the pavement!",
