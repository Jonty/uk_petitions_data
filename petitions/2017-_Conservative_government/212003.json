        "additional_details": "Under the Theft Act 1968, pets are regarded as property, however, most pets including dogs, cats and horses experience emotional distress when stolen.\r\n\r\nDespite the emotional impact of the crime, minimum sentences may only include community service or a small fine.\r\n\r\nEnforcement of existing laws do not currently act as a deterrent or fit the crime. This petition calls for the reclassification of pet theft and tougher sentencing.\r\n\r\nFor more information http://www.stolenandmissingpetsalliance.co.uk/",
        "background": "More than 60 dogs are stolen every week in England and Wales, but less than 5% of cases lead to convictions.\r\n\r\nPets are sentient beings, but pet theft is seen as no different to the theft of an inanimate object.\r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the reclassification of pet theft and tougher sentencing",
