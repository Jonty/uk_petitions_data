        "additional_details": "First Aid qualifications are valid for 3 years from the date of issue. \r\nIf learning these vital skills while in school was mandatory, it could mean that one day your life could be saved by someone passing, simply because they had received the right training.",
        "background": "Unfortunately, far too many people wouldn't know what to do if they came across somebody in need of emergency treatment. From choking babies, bleeding or loss of consciousness, if people were given these skills while at school it would stay with them and could mean saving a life.",
