        "additional_details": "The number of children being removed from families due to a 'FUTURE RISK OF EMOTIONAL HARM' is ever increasing. Who can predict the future? Early intervention would be more beneficial for families, to develop needed skills and stratagies. Many first time mums are having their children removed before they have had the chance to demonstrate capability. Due to reasons such as learning disabilities, mental health and a history of domestic abuse. \r\nMore family working must be done before removal.",
        "background": "In the UK, children are removed from their family homes every 20 minutes. That is over 504 a week.\r\nThe number of children removed is rising at such a fast level. Is this really due to an increase in child abuse? Or is it due to a failure to provide family support before the situation esculated?",
