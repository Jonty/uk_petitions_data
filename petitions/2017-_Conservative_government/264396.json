        "additional_details": "According to plastic free, the UK produced around 5 million tons of plastic waste a year. This means the average family throws away 40 kg (40 bags of sugar) worth of plastic waste away each year. This ends up in landfills where it doesn't break down. A lot ends up in our oceans where it is eaten by marine animals, this in turn works its way up the food chain and eventually back into us. \r\n\r\nhttp://plasticfree.co.uk/plastic-stats/",
        "background": "Recently Canada announced it is to ban all harmful single use plastics throughout the country by as early as 2021. This petition aims to ban the use of single use plastics which are estimated to exceed 65 billion single use plastic items, a day in the UK by 2025.",
