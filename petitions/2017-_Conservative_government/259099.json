        "action": "Allow farmers/landowners to continue to shoot pests under general licence",
        "additional_details": "It's hard to understand how these environmentalists think that by banning ordenery people from being able to safely and humanly control a pest that is causing either damage to crops/livestock or causing a problem to health is beyond belief. For example song bird population is already decreasing so by banning the shooting of magpies/crows under general licence is going to dramatically elevate this problem even more so, not to mention the amount of new born lambs farmers lose corvids every year",
        "background": "After hearing that natural England has bowed to a legal challange from environmentalists and has withdrawn all general licences which allowed farmers/landowners to legally shoot 16 species of birds the government classed as pests is sad news. We are losing so much here. Its time to fight back",
