        "additional_details": "If the child care costs in the early stages of parenthood (1-4 years old) saw some form of contribution this would greatly increase work place gender equality as we would see more mothers continuing with full time employment after entering parenthood. Equality would be increased as employer concerns towards employing woman of child bearing age would be greatly alleviated.",
        "background": "New mothers are entitled to 9 months paid maternity leave with the option of a further 3 months unpaid. Once elapsed due to childcare costs it usually results in mothers having to reduce their working hours or leave their place of employment altogether.",
