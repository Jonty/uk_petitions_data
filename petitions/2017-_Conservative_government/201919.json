Even the court findings that the vote is illegal do not justify violence by police against peaceful citizens.",
        "background": "The behaviour of the Spanish national police and Guardia Civil in relation to the Catalonian independence referendum is shocking and has no place in a Western democracy. The British government should stand with the Catalan people and demand a free and fair referendum on their independence from Spain",
