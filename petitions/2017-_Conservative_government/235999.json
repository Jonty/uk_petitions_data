        "additional_details": "It is a legal requirement in the UK that dogs of 8 weeks or over are microchipped and the details are updated but this clearly is not working with many dogs being identified with no updated microchip information. The government should make dog ownership similar to car ownership and V5C documentation. Therefore if you sold or transferred ownership to someone else it is the current owners responsibility to check and collect proof of name and address and send details to the microchip company.",
        "background": "Many people will have seen the cctv footage of a dog being abandoned on the side of a road in Trentham on 17/12/2018. The dog apparently had two previous owners but microchip details were not available of the current owner.",
