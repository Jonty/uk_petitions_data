        "action": "Make members of the House of Lords representatives of local councils",
        "additional_details": "The transfer of power from local lords to democratic local authorities destroyed the balance of power between national and local government, and the balance of power within Parliament, undermining the foundations of parliamentary sovereignty.\r\n\r\nTo restore those foundations, we ask that Parliament re-establish the House of Lords as the aggregate voice of local government, by making its members representatives of elected local authorities, subject to recall and re-appointment by them at will.",
        "background": "The doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty emerged as the cornerstone of our constitution for pragmatic reasons, having developed when the Lords were local rulers \u2013 making Parliament the place where different sources of power came together. However it has now become an arbitrary convention.",
