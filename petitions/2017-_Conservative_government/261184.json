        "additional_details": "There is no cross service consensus of responsibility for supporting children with SLCN, resulting in children falling through the gaps and a postcode lottery. Individual services often \u2018defending\u2019 their limited resources. The introduction of academies/trusts limit accountability for the support schools do or don\u2019t provide.  The pressures on health are resulting in limited specialist services and early intervention which could prevent the majority of these difficulties is often unavailable.",

Current pressure on public services mean these needs are not being met, causing long term difficulties  and increased costs.",
