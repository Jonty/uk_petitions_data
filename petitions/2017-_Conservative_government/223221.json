        "action": "Ban the importation of animal fur into the UK",
        "additional_details": "100 million+ animals are killed for their fur every year.\r\nThe Agreement on International Trapping Standards is aimed at the protection of the practice of trapping of wild animals for their fur with \u2018humane\u2019 standards. However, the trapping of wild animals for their fur can never be benign, the standards set in this agreement fall well below humane standards defined by veterinarian experts in the UK. Rather than extend the agreement, the government should ban the import of all fur into the UK.",
        "background": "The UK government has already limited the importation of animal fur into the UK by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91, however certain animal fur can still be imported, some from countries with poor animal welfare rights. The government should ban the importation of ALL animal fur into the UK.",
