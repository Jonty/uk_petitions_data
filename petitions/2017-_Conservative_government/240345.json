        "additional_details": "The linking of salary to GDP will help ensure all parties concentrate on ensuring EU deals are agreed and the national wealth and welfare prioritised. If they don\u2019t, their overly generous pay and pensions will be reduced in line with growth or recession figures. If the country does well, their salaries will also increase.",
        "background": "As MP\u2019s on all sides have shown a complete disregard as to what is best for the Uk and instead concentrated on what is best for their own party, we should link their salary to GDP post brexit so that they have an interest in ensuring that Brexit is a success.",
