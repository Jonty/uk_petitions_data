        "action": "Require train seats in new trains to be more comfortable",
        "additional_details": "Already influential voices within the Rail industry are expressing concern at the new seats. At a time the Government is urging people to reduce carbon footprints and use alternatives to cars, whereas seats on buses are getting more sumptuous and comfortable, seats on new trains are far less welcoming and comfortable than they were 50 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt's not too late to pressurise the Government to change the seats, the cost will be absorbed by those passengers who don't desert the railway for good.",
        "background": "The Government must undertake an urgent reassessment of the comfort of seating in new trains, including services between England and Scotland.  It must require the relevant rolling stock companies to refurbish seats to improve passenger comfort, within the confines of current EU standards.",
