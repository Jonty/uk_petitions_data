        "additional_details": "Root and branch reform is required so the enquiry will be granted legal powers to break up each political entity to the point where they become self-contained and coherent.\r\n\r\nAll signatories pledge that they will not vote for The Conservative or Labour party at a national level until reforms are implemented",
        "background": "Brexit proves that rather than representing a single policy position each party is riven with contradictory schisms failing to deliver on electoral and conference pledges. The electorate has been deceived. Self-interest has prevailed over national interest so it's time to break up the duopoly.",
