        "additional_details": "The UK has a number of domestic problems such as rising knife crime, homelessness, and families suffering on low income jobs without much support. Cuts to the police, NHS, rising taxes, and other aspects have contributed to this downfall. By spending our hard earned taxes on war, the government is clearly not putting its citizens first, rather they\u2019re allowing us to suffer domestically, and potentially suffer even more fatally by dragging us into a war we shouldn\u2019t be part of.",
        "background": "After escalating tensions between the UK and Russia over the spy poisoning incident without clear evidence of the perpetrators, our PM is now considering sending the military to Syria to combat the government and its Russian allies, despite again no clear evidence who was behind the chemical attack.",
