        "additional_details": "Doctors would be stricken off for malpractice, as well as police officers for negligence. They would face loss of income, loss of reputation and even prison time. \r\n\r\nSo why are politicians who hold the future of our nation in their hands allowed to act in such a way with minimal repercussions. \r\n\r\nI am calling for a full and thorough investigation of all involved in The brexit campaign as well as any third party involvement, to ensure that the law was respected and followed.",
        "background": "To ensure any politician or person involved in breaking electoral law regarding Brexit and leaving the EU, face criminal action if found guilty. \r\nPlacing superficial sanctions and fines are not enough! They must be held accountable for their involvement with the full extent of the law.",
