If required, paid for from MPs own wages, non reclaimable; \r\n2. Cheapest standard bus/ rail travel from constituency to London. If First Class wanted, anything over and above cheapest fare to be paid from MPs wages, non reclaimable and\r\n3. Cheapest hotel accommodation for overnight stays in London, maximum \u00a375 per night. \r\nThat's it. Nothing else.",

Previous claims have included dog food, a duck island, a moat and mortgages/ rent. This has to stop. If these fripperies are allowed as expenses what exactly are their wages for?",
