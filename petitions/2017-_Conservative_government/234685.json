        "additional_details": "Strip clubs have no place in a civilised society where equality should be the norm, not the exception. It is time for women to be treated with respect and valued for more than their bodies. Allowing such an industry to exist encourages sexual violence and exploitation to women. Let's adopt the icelandic approach and ban these outdated institutions. If society does not value women enough to ban this archaic display of sexism then how can we expect women to value themselves. It is time for change.",
        "background": "Ban strip clubs in the UK. They are demeaning, degrading and sexually exploitive to women. Whilst these establishments exist they pose a major obstacle to achieving equality between the sexes. Strip clubs convey the idea that women can be bought and hold no value. It is well past time for change.",
