        "action": "Allow Lauren Southern entry to the UK",
        "additional_details": "Lauren Southern has never been charged with any offence, her activities are well documented in her videos and writing. In preventing Southern access to the UK - based on a factually inaccurate allegation which lacks proper context - freedom of speech and expression is under threat. The government is setting a dangerous precedent with their decision as reasonable, conservative, christian citizens will now fear reprisal from the police for expressing opinions or beliefs similar to Southern's.",
        "background": "Lauren Southern is a Canadian christian-conservative journalist, activist and broadcaster. Yesterday, whilst applying to enter the UK at the border in Calais, Southern was detained and questioned by police under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000. She was then refused entry on grounds of 'racism'.",
