        "additional_details": "EA pulled out of the franchise after Rugby 08 for reasons we not quite sure. It must not have been a financial success. But 2008 was a long time ago and the world of rugby was a completely different place. It\u2019s exponential growth over the last few years surely warrants another crack off the franchise by EA?\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve opened a line of contact with EA Sports and we plan on bringing this petition to them if we can get enough signatures. If we get enough, who knows what could happen? Hopefully they will see there\u2019s a market out there for a rugby game once again.",
        "background": "It\u2019s been almost ten years since EA Sports brought out their last rugby game, the ever popular Rugby 08. Since then we\u2019ve been given plenty of rugby games, but none have them have lived up to expectations.\r\n\r\nRugby 08 however, was simply glorious.",
