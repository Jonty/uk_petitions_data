        "additional_details": "The above industry which should be illegal is done in the full knowledge of and in fact assisted by the websites paid to advertise the tickets initially. For example on some sites you will often find no tickets available but will be redirected to a sellers marketplace which in fact looks almost identical to the main website in that you can select seats and areas etc but the tickets are vastly inflated. This behaviour is nothing short of exploitative.",
        "background": "There is an entire industry that has been built on exploiting music fans who statistically are young and in lower paid employment. This industry seeks to block purchase every ticket that it can for popular artists and events and then resell them at extortionate prices.",
