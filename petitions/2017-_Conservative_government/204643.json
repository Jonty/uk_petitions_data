Just because abortion is a \"women's issue\".\r\nWhile the charity offer support to pregnant women, they offer no support post pregnancy and campaign against abortion and similar resources.\r\nAbortions are necessary for women who cannot/do not want to continue their pregnancy and advocating otherwise is dangerous and sometimes fatal.\r\nInstead their share should be shared around to the other charities listed.",
        "background": "In order to justify the tax on tampons and other sanitary items, the government promised to donate the approximately \u00a312,000,000.\r\nto organisations that directly help women and children. One of the approx. 70  charities picked is Life:an actively anti-abortion group.",
