        "action": "Urgently simplify the voting process for EU citizens in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "There are 3.5million EU citizens resident in the UK, who love our country, but after the 2016 EU referendum result, many have been left feeling unwelcome. For those people, voting in the 2019 Euro Election was an opportunity to express their disappointment at the UK government's position on 'Brexit'. To lose that democratic right due to registration errors is disgraceful and only exacerbates their feeling of abandonment and brings into question not just the vote but our democracy.",
        "background": "The 2014 and 2019 European Elections resulted in thousands of EU Citizens living in the UK losing their ability to vote due to the arduous and extra registration hurdles they had to overcome compared to their British counterparts. This is undemocratic and leads to an unfair election result.",
