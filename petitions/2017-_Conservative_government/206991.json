        "additional_details": "Earlier this month Jim McMahon, the Member of Parliament for Oldham West and Royton, introduced a bill to lower the Voting Age to 16. MPs who didn\u2019t support the Bill exploited an old House of Commons rule that means that Bills that are still being debated on a Friday afternoon at 2:30pm aren\u2019t automatically voted on. This makes it very hard for them to become law. This is not just undemocratic, this is indefensible!\r\n\r\nhttp://metro.co.uk/2017/11/03/tory-mps-accused-of-filibustering-to-block-bill-lowering-the-voting-age-to-16-7052134/\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/jim-mcmahon/4569\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-41862264\r\n",
