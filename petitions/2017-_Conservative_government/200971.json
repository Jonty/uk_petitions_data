        "additional_details": "We the people of Northern Ireland call upon James Brokenshire and Westminster to Introduce a normal political structure (voluntary coalition) in Northern Ireland, like in England, Scotland and Wales even the ROI. \r\n\r\nThe most current political crisis should be the last straw.  The current political system (Mandatory Coalition) is having a total negative on the lives of everyone, regardless of community or religion.  \r\n\r\nWe should no longer be forced to endure a 2nd class system of government in NI.",
        "background": "The current political setup (Mandatory Coalition) is a system of government unfit for purpose. Politics here in Northern Ireland shifts from crisis to crisis, from deadlock to deadlock and has collapsed on more than one occasion.  It's time to normalise politics in NI (Introduce voluntary coalition)",
