        "additional_details": "In recent years members of the public and elected members of local councils in England have been placed in a position whereby, if they have a concern about misappropriation or failures to comply with their governance & processes, they can only complain to the authority. Government handed powers to councils which allowed them to regulate themselves. \r\nWhere this is failing across England [Rotherham/Northampton] the government cannot effectively intervene earlier or have no powers.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call on the government to introduce powers that enable the government to audit local councils in England when legitimate concerns/complaints are received. This power would also enable government to take control of the council & suspend senior members/officers where appropriate.",
