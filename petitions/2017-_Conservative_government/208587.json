        "additional_details": "Gambling addiction is now the highest suicide rate. More needs to be done and offer extra help to those who need it. The self exclusion scheme which is offered does not work. Gambling advertisements are everywhere which entices vulnerable and recovering addicts back in. There are so many casino sites out there who use different gambling licenses, however are linked. This is so a gambling addiction can sign up to another sister site and the self exclusion doesn't apply. The casino wins again.",
        "background": "The government need to reanalyse the online gambling industry rather than just the FOBT in bookmakers. The government receive in excess of 1 billion a month from UK casinos in tax. The money paid to charity's to help gambling addicts recover is well under budgeted and the charity's cannot cope.",
