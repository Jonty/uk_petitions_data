        "additional_details": "Our Officers in Luton are inundated with exceptional volumes of calls, to a point where they are unable to attend crimes in progress due to a lack of resources.\r\nThis has happened numerous times In the past 6 months, to a point where local residents do not report crime because they know Police will not attend.\r\nOur own local Policing Team should have up to 10 officers, but due to cutbacks and lack of funding we are now down to 3, which is a reduction of 70%, and this is echoed across the county",
        "background": "Bedfordshire is classified as a rural Police force, yet it has every major crime that larger cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and London have. Luton alone has an International Airport, Gun, Gang and knife crime, terrorism and hate crime, as well as a massive problem with anti social behaviour.",
