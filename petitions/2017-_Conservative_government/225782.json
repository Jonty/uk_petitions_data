        "additional_details": "A jab that protects against a virus that causes cervical cancer will be given to boys aged 12 to 13 in England. \r\nThe policy decision brings England into line with Scotland and Wales. \r\nHPV vaccine is already routinely offered to girls of the same age at secondary school and is free up until they turn 18.\r\nExperts and campaigners have been calling for equal access to the jab, which can also guard against oral, throat and anal cancers.",
        "background": "Today 24/7/18, the government announced that boys aged 12-13 will receive the HPV vaccine from 2019. While this is great news,   I would like to petition the government to increase the age limit to the same that is offered to girls, up to their 18th birthday.",
