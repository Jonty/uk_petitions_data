        "additional_details": "Puppy farms are a money making machine, the puppies and parents are not cared for at all and innocent people buy a puppy in good faith because they want a forever companion and generally end up losing the puppy due to health problems.\r\nUsing bitches as breeding machines is disgusting and no reputable breeder would ever do this. There is simply no need for puppy farms at all, they are cruel and should be stopped.",
        "background": "We brought our dog that we believed to come from a loving family home and it turns out it was a front for a puppy farm. Our puppy was seriously ill and has subsequently lost her life.",
