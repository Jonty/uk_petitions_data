        "additional_details": "On the NHS website the first lines on the what happens when you stop smoking page are - Stopping smoking can make a drastic improvement to your lifestyle and health in ways you might not expect. \r\nAnd \r\nOnce you stop smoking, some of the benefits are immediate and some are longer-term.\r\nThey then include personal stories of people who quit smoking. The question is which approach works better? The warnings or the benefits? Or even a mix of both? It seems that the one sided approach is naive at best.",
        "background": "Smoking warnings are scare stories that may impact people but they are all one sided and only convey the negative aspects of smoking. Why not include the positive aspects of stopping smoking. Short texts documenting the benefits along with the negative could work better than the usual scare stories.",
