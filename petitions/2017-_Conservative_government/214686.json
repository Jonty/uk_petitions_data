This does not deter them from further abusing children.  A child's innocence and trust is gone forever. Their veiw of the world and adults changes in that moment and they'll never ever really feel safe again. Our view of the world is shaped by our early experiences. 25 to Life imprisonment is the only solution to protect our children and stop abuse.",
