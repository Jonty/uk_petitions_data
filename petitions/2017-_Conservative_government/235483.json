        "additional_details": "Vets must scan any dog not registered with their surgery using scanners which detect ALL types of microchip before treating the dog unless treatment is urgent. If asked to euthanise a dog who is not registered the vet should take all reasonable steps to contact the owner. This new measure will also protect stolen and abandoned dogs whose identity will have to be checked before treatment.",
        "background": "A healthy dog was put to sleep by a Rescue who agreed to find him a home. The vet did not know the dog and took no steps to ascertain who the owner was. If the microchip had been scanned it would have shown the person who brought him in was not the registered keeper and had no right to euthanise him",
