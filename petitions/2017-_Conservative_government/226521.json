        "additional_details": "At the moment I'm doing 37.5 hours a week for 7 weeks at a nursing home while also completing assessments. On top of this I need to work Saturday and Sunday at my own job to earn some money. This means I'm working 7 days a week for 7 weeks just to get buy. I have to travel to my placement and provide meals to bring as it's a long day. \u00a3500 A month isn't livable but if we were to earn even another \u00a3500 over the 7 weeks this may mean we don't have to work ourselves in to the ground.",
        "background": "A student nurse gets \u00a3500 a month bursary even while on placement. Sometimes we can do up to 12 weeks of intense placement at a time and during this time are expected to do 37.5 hours a week. This means it's difficult to be able to fit in shifts at our paying jobs.",
