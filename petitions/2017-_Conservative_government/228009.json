        "additional_details": "Reform the system as bullying ruins the lives of victims regardless of age or disability this new body should have all the powers necessary to investigate complaints from students/parents against schools & local authorities where children have been forced out of school, expelled, parents labelled & false reports made. Sadly, it is a daily occurrence for some schoolchildren and is sometimes so severe that victims lose out on schooling, self-harm or even take their own life. This cannot be right.",
        "background": "The Department for Education refuse to investigate complaints from innocent students who suffer school bullying or targeting by school staff/other authorities by not obtaining all the relevant records needed for a fair investigation. We need a new body to investigate failures over the last 25 years.",
