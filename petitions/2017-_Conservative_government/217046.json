        "action": "Ban the sale of pencil sharpeners with easy release blades. ",
        "additional_details": "How is that an under 18 can\u2019t go and buy a knife, razor or anything with a blade but can go and buy a pencil sharpener which has a removable blade? There\u2019s even a video on YouTube that shows you how to remove it although it is only a tiny screw holding it in so it\u2019s not rocket science! To ban all under 18s buying one is not perceivable but I do believe they could be manufactured differently such as having a non-tamper screw. If the Government bans those where the blade is easy to release, industry will follow with a safer product. Something has to be done.",
        "background": "Many young adults these days with the pressures of school, friends and social media struggle at times and sadly turn to self-harm. As a parent you can hide all the sharp cutting items in your house only to find your child using the removable blade from a pencil sharpener.",
