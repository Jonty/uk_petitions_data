        "additional_details": "Most cinemas list details such as, 2D, 3D, IMAX, DOLBY sound,  Lux Seating, Recliners, audio descriptions etc, but never screen size or seating capacity.\r\n\r\nConsidering the information that has to be provided by law in all aspect of society, I.e, financial risk's with lending, ingredients, allergy and calorific data on food packaging, hygiene ratings on restaurants, call recording notifications ect. \r\n\r\nit's surprising that screen size or capacity in cinemas is censored that directly affects an experience we are paying for. \r\n\r\nLet's change this for everyone today :-)",
        "background": "There is inherent censorship on screen sizes or seating capacity. The high cost of cinema tickets, has no gearing towards the size of screens and can represent bad value when you compare a 475 seater IMAX screen that can be as large as 20 x 26 meters, to a screen a quarter of that size with 69 seats",
