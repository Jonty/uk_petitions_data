Sometimes when a specialist doctor has prescribed MORPHINE for a sufferer a nurse may suspect that patient to be a drug addict which stresses the sufferer and worsens the condition. Some sufferers are facing benefit cut and being told they should work.",

Patients suffer: excruciating pain throughout the body, needing MORPHINE in times of crisis, shortness of breath, swollen hands and fingers and frequent headaches.
