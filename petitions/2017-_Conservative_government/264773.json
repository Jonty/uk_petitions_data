        "additional_details": "The reality is that UK TAX payers pay twice, once for their own and then through their Tax\u2019s for the over 75\u2019s.\r\n\r\nWhilst I don\u2019t disagree, that the over 75\u2019s shouldn\u2019t have to pay, equally, many of the arguments for them not to are equally applicable to many others. For example, many others who are on low income.\r\n\r\nQuite simply, it is about time that the BBC became a \u2018self funded\u2019 enterprise & stood on its own merits and feet, just as the many 100 or so other TV channels do.",
        "background": "Abolishing the TV licence, would remove the current controversy over TV licence funding for over 75\u2019s, provide a welcome relief and financial benefit to ALL UK TV licence holders, and ensure that the BBC operated in a cost effective and efficient way, and within a fair and competitive market place.",
