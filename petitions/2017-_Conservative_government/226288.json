        "action": "Encourage Overseas Territories to ensure the rights of LGBT+ people",
        "additional_details": "Additionally, transgender identity is not legally recognised in many of our territories. Laws, such as the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the Equality Act 2010, should be implemented to reflect the values of the UK. If the UK cannot implement these laws, then our government should encourage the territories to conform. Many territories are military bases. The British Military prides itself on openness, diversity and inclusion, so why can't the territories they serve do so too?",
        "background": "In almost all, if not all of the British Overseas Territories, LGBT+ residents do not enjoy the same rights LGBT+ people enjoy in mainland Great Britain. While some BOT residents enjoy equal marriage, others have no protection from discrimination, like we have in the UK.",
