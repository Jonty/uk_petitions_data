        "action": "Abolish the Y10/11 compulsory English speech examination.",
        "additional_details": "It can also create an unnecessary amount of anxiety for students who struggle to speak out loud and can easily feel the pressure of standing up infront of the class to do a speech that you have to remember at the top of your head. The fact that you are recorded while doing so doesn't help one bit. Overall, this is an unnecessary waste of time that just puts students who need to revise GCSEs under more pressure.",
        "background": "In school, you have to waste time preparing for a speech that ends up not affecting the English GCSE at all. In the weeks leading up and lessons leading up to the day of the speech, revision and other resourceful uses of that time can be used instead.",
