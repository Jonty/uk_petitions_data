        "additional_details": "If the result is the same as the 2016 EU Referendum, then on 22nd May 2019 the UK would leave the EU with a deal, as decided by Parliament, or without a deal if Parliament cannot agree on an option. If the result is to remain in the EU, Article 50 would be immediately revoked. In this case, the UK would actively participate in reforming the EU from within.\r\n\r\n3 years on from the referendum, it is completely democratic to have a final vote to determine whether the \u2018will of the people\u2019 is unchanged.",
        "background": "We are told that the 2016 EU referendum question of Leave or Remain was flawed in its design. However, the proposed alternative format would be too complex for many voters. Therefore, for ratification, a People\u2019s Vote with exactly the same wording as the 2016 EU Referendum should be run immediately.",
