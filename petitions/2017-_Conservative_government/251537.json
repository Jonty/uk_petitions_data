Junctions where this is not possible should be posted as \"no left turn on red\" (common in the USA). Introduce \"flashing amber\" as a default traffic light caution between certain times, particularly on roundabouts with multiple sets around their circumference. This core practice is common in many countries, not least Saudi Arabia, where driving standards are poor, but this appears successful. Conduct an extensive review.",
