        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that Social Media platforms should be required to provide an optional time limit feature to users. This way people can decide for themselves exactly how much time they choose to allocate to Social Media. \r\n\r\nThese companies know that their users are addicted but its not in their interest to be part of the solution. This feature will allow people to take control of their usage. \r\n\r\nFight back and give yourself the tools you need to protect your Mental Health",
        "background": "As a nation we spend more and more of our time on Social Media. People are often shocked to see just how much time they spend on these sites. Numerous reports and studies have been released about the adverse effects this is having on our Mental Health, but nothing is ever done about it.",
