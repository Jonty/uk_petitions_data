        "additional_details": "The current income requirement for British citizens to bring their non-EU spouses to the UK is \u00a318,600. According to BBC, Migration Observatory estimates 47% of working people in the UK don't earn enough to meet the new requirements. Britons earning minimum wage (\u00a316,000) should have the right to a family. Meanwhile, members of the EU with non-EU spouses and children are not subject to any income requirement. We propose lowering the income requirement so that citizens can be with their families.",
        "background": "After having a long distance relationship for nearly a year, i married my husband. I'm a British Born Citizen, He is a United States Citizen. I could not meet the income requirements, even on a job paying more than the Living Wage. Families shouldn't have to be apart due to this. Ever.",
