        "action": "Revoke Article 50 if no Brexit deal has been agreed by 21st March.",
        "additional_details": "Whoever is at fault for landing us here, 'we are where we are'. If you think that there is nothing to fear from 'no deal' Brexit and refuse to believe the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, then I suspect you will not be voting for this petition. But if you have taken any time to consider the evidence and its consequences on livelihoods of UK households, particularly those without the resources to counter them, then you should support this petition. Please, let's rethink this - while we can.",
        "background": "This is a plea to open-minded, responsible people on both sides of the argument to urge the government - and/or MPs via an amendment - to acknowledge that if a Brexit deal has not been reached by 21st March, only the revocation of Article 50 will prevent the UK from plunging into 'no deal' scenario.",
