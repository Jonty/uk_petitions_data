        "action": "Whatever Brexit deal is negotiated must receive the approval of a People\u2019s Vote.",
        "additional_details": "Daily the media report confusion and division within Govenment and the political parties about what terms they want from Brexit. As a result it is vital that the matter should be finally decided by the people. The issue is too important to leave to politicians. If the result of a vote is approval of the deal then Brexit should go ahead on that basis. If the deal is rejected then the Government\u2019s Article 50 letter should be withdrawn.",
        "background": "It is obvious that the vision of Brexit put forward by the Leave Campaign cannot be achieved. It is vital that the British people now have the opportunity to decide whether the deal to be negotiated by the Government is good enough to meet the needs of Great Britain and it\u2019s people.",
