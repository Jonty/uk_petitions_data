        "additional_details": "In our troubling economic & geopolitical times there has always been TMS.  From Swanton to Swann, Aggers to Daggers, Johnners to Blowers and Martin-Jenkins to Mitchell - never have we been without their comforting words, dancing over the airwaves from some far-away land; our light in the winter darkness, our comfort in times of hardship.  It is the great unifier - young, old, rich, poor, all nationalities & none.  I'm all for the free market, but this is too far.",
        "background": "On Wednesday 18th April it was announced that the BBC had lost the audio rights for England's overseas tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies in 2018/19.  Test Match Special has a history that goes back to the first full live fixture to be broadcast over the radio in 1957 - lets keep it that way.",
