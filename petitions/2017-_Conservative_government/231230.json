        "additional_details": "Leave voters were voting for a more prosperous, fairer country, not a country where the NHS, farming, hospitality and some manufacturing industries would suffer due to lack of staff or difficulties with trade, border and travelling arrangements, ( particularly Ireland) would be in question and prices for basic goods would rise. Also, voters were not aware of threats to environmental controls and science. The list is endless.",
        "background": "Businesses, unlike politicians, are subject to rigorous scrutiny before publishing influential statistics, and can be  punished for misleading shareholders. The 2016 Leave campaign had no such scrutiny and misled voters to encourage them to vote based on lies.",
