        "additional_details": "by lowering the speed from 60pmh i believe this will prevent any future unnecessary accidents and heartbreak. my partner of 18 years was killed on a quiet country lane of which both drivers were driving aproximatly 60mph, I believe if this would have been a lower speed limit then my partner would be here today and my children would have their dad\r\ni live in a rural area where there are long and windy county roads, there are often flowers laid and im constantly hearing of accidents and death. this needs to stop and lowering the speed limit will give more of a chance of survival and peace of mind for our loved ones when out travelling",
        "background": "id like to reduce the speed on our country lanes due to so many accidents and deaths. each year between 1800 and 3000 people a year are killed on our roads and that's not including non fatal accidents.",
