MPs are already required to register and declare financial interests. If there is a conflict between their personal interest and the public interest, they must resolve it straightaway and in favour of the public interest. Complaints that a Member has breached the Code of Conduct are examined by the independent Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\r\n\r\nYou can find the Code of Conduct for the House of Commons here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/code-of-conduct-and-rules-of-the-house/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly how you would like these rules changed. We can't accept petitions about the House of Lords because their rules are something the House of Commons or UK Government is not responsible for."
