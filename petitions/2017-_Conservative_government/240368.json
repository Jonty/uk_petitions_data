        "action": "More funding for treatment of women's pelvic conditions to reduce waiting times",
        "additional_details": "While the symptoms are not life threatening they are certainly life altering. Just because the help we need as women is more invasive it does not mean we should just be left in pain. It must change. I have endometriosis and have been waiting over 18 weeks since my initial consultation for a laparoscopy. I've been in A&E 5 times whilst waiting for date because the pain is unbearable and no painkillers help. Women must be offered more support.",
        "background": "Women with female-specific pelvic problems such as fibroids, pelvic inflammation and endometriosis may be left in severe pain for months as there is not enough funding to get quick treatment. These conditions despite the awful symptoms, are not considered serious and are massively underfunded.",
