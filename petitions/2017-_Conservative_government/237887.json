        "additional_details": "The pram will always be in front of the adult when being pushed. Crossing the road can be a hazard that cars may not see - with special consideration to darker prams, when a crossing is not available & along country roads.\r\n \r\nHaving reflectors will enable vehicle drivers to see the hazard a few crucial seconds before they would have without the reflectors.",
        "background": "The law regarding light reflectors on prams/strollers in the U.K needs to change. Prams/strollers are currently not required by law to have any reflector of any kind, with priority given to style & the safely of the actual pram.\r\n ",
