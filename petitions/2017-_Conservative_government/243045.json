        "additional_details": "Each year in the UK, there are 30,000 cases of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The chances of survival if there is no CPR performed and a Defibrillator is not used are very slim. Every minute that passes where someone is not performing CPR and using a defibrillator on a patient in cardiac arrest, decreases their chance of survival by 10% every minute. If a defibrillator is used within 3-5 minutes of cardiac arrest, survival rates jump from 6 per cent to 74 per cent. This is why AEDs are crucial.",
        "background": "Too many people each year Die of not having access to a public Automated External Defibrillator. If these devices were made readily available on high streets, this would save a number of lives and increase the rate of survival or out of hospital Cardiac Arrests.",
