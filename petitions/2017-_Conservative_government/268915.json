        "additional_details": "This money should be spent on the NHS, police, schools & education, reducing knife crime, the climate emergency, services for the disabled, youth services etc. The promised money from leaving the EU is never going to materialise so we shouldn\u2019t be wasting more tax payers money on this project based on lies and false promises.",
        "background": "After years of underfunding of public services and Tory austerity it\u2019s an absolute disgrace that the government are now planning to spend \u00a32.1bn on no deal; for which there is no mandate.",
