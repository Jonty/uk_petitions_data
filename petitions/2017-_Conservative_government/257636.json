        "additional_details": "It is incumbant on Parliament to regain the electorate\u2019s trust, it's not representing the people when it only allows the constituents to remove an MP during an election or when they commit a crime. Constituents should be able to recall an MP and hold them to account if they believe standards under the Parliamentary code of conduct have been breached, or they have breached their trust to the electorate. Acting on their conscious is no longer an acceptable get out clause after the brexit fiasco",
        "background": "Recall of MPs Act 2015 to include extra provisions, If an MP acts in a dishonest way or fails to abide by the majority of their Constituents\u2019 wishes. Its no longer acceptable that MPs can say one thing publically or in a manifesto and then act in a way that is completley contrary to their statement.",
