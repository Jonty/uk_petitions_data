        "additional_details": "Along with the health risks associated with not having appropriate menstrual support, it is now more frequently affecting women at work and the education of girls as many will remain at home due to the inability to purchase the necessary items.\u2013 many of these staff are on low incomes themselves \u2013 this in itself can cause financial difficulties. It is also impacting on staff in schools as they are often purchasing these items to ensure that girls do not take time out of the classroom.",
