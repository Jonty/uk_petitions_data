When animals are being burned alive and having their little legs broken and their eyes poked with sticks, this is an evil act which has to be stopped. Not just for domestic animals but for all animals who are being treated with such devilry by so called human beings. \r\nThere is no one to speak out for these animals to help put an end to this evilness towards them.",

At present time they are only given bans on having animals and this is not in any way acceptable. \r\nThis has to be changed.",
