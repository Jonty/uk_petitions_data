        "action": "Have a MAJOR overhaul of whiplash claims for car insurance.",
        "additional_details": "No young driver should have to spend 10% of their salary on car insurance simply because people abuse the system. Car insurance in the UK is quickly becoming a joke compare to other countries who would just laugh at a whiplash claim. The government needs to have a major overhaul on this issue before prices become so high that it becomes entirely infeasible to insure anything larger than a Nissan Micra especially since compared to a modern Vauxhall Corsa small cars aren't nearly as safe.",
        "background": "Car insurance prices, especially for young people, are increasing every year at a rapid rate; They are going to hit a record high this year. A major cause of this is whiplash claims for minor accidents. There has already been a reform but its not enough. Current prices are unacceptable.",
