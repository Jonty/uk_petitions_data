        "additional_details": "Nobody likes this deal. The EU does not want no deal either so let's start again with a united front while thoroughly planning for a no deal along side the new negotiations. This can be conducted, negotiated and concluded much better by the UK. We must keep no deal on the table while doing all we can to avoid and preparing for it. Thanks for reading.",

Party politics needs to be put aside and the main parties dissolved to form a united government to negotiate the best possible deal for the United Kingdom.",
