        "additional_details": "2 recent Stats show 77% of teachers say a huge increase of able bodied children are going to school in nappies & its effecting their teaching and the childs concentration. One report says Nursery staff say they haven't had any training to help teach Toilet Training so they are not getting children school ready. More help is needed to edcucate & encourage parent's & carers asap so in turn this will put a stop to this & help the impact it has on the environment & our childrens education & wealfare",
        "background": "Children are going to school at the age of 5 in nappies & the problem is growing. We are throwing away in the UK alone 8.5 million nappies a day 3.10 Billion a year! They take 500 yrs to decompose & often in a plastic nappy bag too! Nappies also release methan gas which is  damaging our environment.",
