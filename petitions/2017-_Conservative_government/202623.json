        "additional_details": "I phoned British Gas after having no access to my boiler as I waited for my landlord to complete the gas safety inspection. Despite not using gas for three months, I had to pay arrears even though I could not use the gas for three months. It is a mandatory fee whether you use gas or not. They put the fee in the small print and fail to make it clear they are charging nearly \u00a3100 Pounds/annum just to be able to have the option of consuming energy. This perpetuates fuel poverty and needs to stop.",
        "background": "Whether or not you are metered for energy you are charged a daily rate for energy even if you abstain from using it. British Gas charges \u00a30.26 per day for using no gas, which amounts to a \"no use tax\" of nearly \u00a3100 Pounds per year. This means many people are in fuel poverty even when using no fuel.",
