Now she needs care 24/7 but because she owns her house she is not entitled to the care from the government,but yet people who haven\u2019t given nothing to society or have never owned their home are entitled to this,it should be equal to everyone. My nan should not have to sell her home it\u2019s where she feels closest to my grandad she should be offered a carer without having to sell.",
        "background": "People work all their lives to pay their mortgage, become mortgage free but the moment they turn ill and need round the clock care the only way the can get this is by selling their homes. It should be equal to everyone regardless if you own your home or not.",
