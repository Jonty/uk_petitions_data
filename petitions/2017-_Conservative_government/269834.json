        "action": "Table Kashmir issue before the UN Security Council as an urgent threat to peace.",
        "additional_details": "The UK has a moral duty to help resolve this dispute which is a legacy of the British Empire. Tensions are high since India abolished Jammu & Kashmir\u2019s special constitutional status without any consultation. In 2018 the Supreme Court of India ruled that Article 370 had acquired permanent status and that its abrogation was impossible. Many human rights violations have been reported.\r\nIndia and Pakistan have shown that they cannot resolve it by themselves so the UN must be involved. A nuclear war between India and Pakistan would be a global catastrophe. Over 3 million Britons trace their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent, and conflict in Kashmir risks harming community cohesion in Britain. Accordingly, the UK cannot afford to ignore this issue.",
        "background": "The UN Security Council has previously  resolved on a referendum in Kashmir to finalise its future. India has not held it. Wars have occurred and bilateral talks have failed between Pakistan and India, both nuclear states.Under Article 35 of the UN charter, the UK can bring this matter to the UNSC.",
