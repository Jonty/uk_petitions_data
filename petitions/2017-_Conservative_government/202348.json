        "additional_details": "In May 2017, both of my grandfathers passed away. My company did not grant compassionate leave either time, giving me the only option to take it as unpaid sick leave. This pushed me into financial difficulty which I have yet to come out of, playing catch up each month. \r\n\r\nMy cousin had the same situation, having to take annual leave on the day of our grandfathers death.\r\n\r\nFamily members dying is hard enough to deal with emotionally, the worker should not be affected financially as well.",
        "background": "Make compassionate leave for close family members (parents, children, siblings, partners, in-laws and grandparents) compulsory for companies to recognize, and for the leave to be paid so the surviving family member is not left shortpaid due to the relatives death.",
