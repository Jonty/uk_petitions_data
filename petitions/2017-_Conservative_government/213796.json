        "additional_details": "I contacted charities and IVF support groups and found that it\u2019s actually illegal under the Medicines Act and the Drug trafficking Act to give them to someone else. \r\n\r\nIVF clinics or infertility charities should be allowed to redistribute the medication, helping families that cannot afford the drugs.",
        "background": "IVF medication is extremely expensive and is very often left over in large quantities due to miscalculation or like in my case because the treatment didn\u2019t work. I have \u00a3800 worth of perfectly good medication (non-refrigerated) and my only option is, incredibly, to DISPOSE OF IT.",
