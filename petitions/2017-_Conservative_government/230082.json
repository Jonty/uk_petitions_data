        "additional_details": "by signing this petition hopefully we will finally have some much needed traffic lights installed.  This will reduce the amount of collisions that happen on that roundabout, the time spent sat in traffic and also the danger of queuing back onto the motorway at peak travel times.",
        "background": "Anyone who regularly commutes using Junction 29 of the M1 will know how much of a problem traffic is at peak times when trying to exit the motorway when travelling southbound.  Installing traffic lights could significantly reduce time spent in traffic and reduce the risk of collisions when exiting.",
