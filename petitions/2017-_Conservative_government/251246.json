Schools will be expected to have taught LGBT+ specific-content \"at a timely point\". \r\n\r\nYou can find more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/social-policy/education/relationships-and-sex-education-in-schools-whats-changing/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out when you think schools should have taught this content by, or requiring schools to teach it as stand-alone content rather than as part of RSE lessons if these are things you would like to see happen.\r\n"
