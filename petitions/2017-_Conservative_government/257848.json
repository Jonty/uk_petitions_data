        "additional_details": "There are increasing concerns over the effects of 5G transmissions on the health of humans and other species.  Please  commission an independent assessment of the risks and place a moratorium on further 5G development until this has been completed and published.\r\n\r\nSince there are large areas of the UK that do not yet have access to 3G or even 2G it would seem wise to complete that rollout before proceeding with this.  There is no demonstrable demand for 5G.",
        "background": "Several administrations have banned 5G technology over concerns that it may harm public health and the environment.  It would be prudent to undertake proper studies into the safety or otherwise of 5G before proceeding with its rollout.",
