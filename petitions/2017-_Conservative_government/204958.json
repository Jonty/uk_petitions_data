        "additional_details": "We fine drivers who park in a disabled parking space, so more should be done to fine people who use parent and toddler spaces when they don't have children present. Most parking spaces aren't big enough to get big car seats out. Should Women really have to walk a mile to get to the shops after giving birth? I suggest we give parents permits and enforce fines to drivers who take advantage of these big spaces. Like we do with those who park in designated disabled spaces.",
        "background": "Its shocking how many people abuse the 'parent and toddler' spaces in car parks. After giving birth and trying to find one of these spaces at a local shopping centre, I witnessed a man park his brand new 4x4 in one so he didn't get it scratched. This behaviour needs to stop as its not fair.",
