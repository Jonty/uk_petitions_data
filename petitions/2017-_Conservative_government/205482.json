        "additional_details": "The aid budget will be about \u00a314 billion a year over the next 5 years and there are about 48 million people on the electoral register for local elections. That's \u00a3300 per person per year. There are about 170,000 UK charities supporting both UK and foreign good causes. Examples - 1000 supporters of a local hospice or school could direct \u00a31.5m goes there over 5 years; or through your local church 100 people decide to commit to a medical facility eradicating AIDS in Africa - that's \u00a330,000 per year",
        "background": "Imagine you decide each year which UK charity/ies should be paid \u00a3300 (your share of the overseas aid). It could be a UK charity supporting foreign aid as at present or you may feel it would be better spent at home e.g. on a hospice, the local secondary school, animal welfare, medical research, etc.",
