        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is falling behind on recycling rates compared to other developed nations such as France and Germany causing 60% of waste going to landfill. This needs to change. I propose that we can end this through making recycling compulsory, through methods such as: an increase tax for if landfill waste increases, a tax reduction for companies that increase the percentage recycled, similar to charity donations and encouraging new generations to recycle through education within schools.",
        "background": "The united kingdom is falling behind on the amount of recycling compared to other European countries. We could fix this by making recycling compulsory, a tax reduction (similar to charity donations) and education for younger generations that will encourage new generations to recycle more often.",
