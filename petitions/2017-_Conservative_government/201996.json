Major demonstrations in London and the Manchester 1st October 2017 demonstration by more than 50,000 people who travelled from all over the United Kingdom, received no national coverage by the BBC despite being featured by all other news media.\r\n\r\nThe BBC is now a publicly funded Tory government propaganda organisation.",
