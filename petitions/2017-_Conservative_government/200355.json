        "action": "Prevent the current changes to pharmacy regulations being debated by the DoH",
        "additional_details": "The government has said that they wish to \"better utilise the skills of pharmacists in healthcare settings such as hospitals and GP practices\", but have put no proposals forward to guarantee jobs for the many community pharmacists and Locums that this will put out of work. People who have been at the heart of the community helping patients will now find themselves without work, and those patients will find they have reduced access to pharmacy services.",
        "background": "The planned changes to pharmacy regulations aim to allow a pharmacy to open and allow prescription-only medicines to be given out without a Responsible Pharmacist present. This will inevitably result in both patient harm and reduced access to pharmacy services for patients.",
