        "action": "Reconsider blood donation guidelines affecting female partners of bisexual men",
        "additional_details": "This excludes women whose only long term partner is a man if their partner has ever had sex with another man. Despite this, a bisexual male partner can give blood if it has been 3 months since the last instance of sexual contact with a male. Exceptions may be made if the male partner is willing or able to attend an appointment as well.\r\n\r\nThis petition requests that guidelines be reconsidered to allow women who have had sex with men who have slept with other men but not in the past 6 months.",
        "background": "Currently NHS blood donation excludes female partners of bisexual men from donating blood. \r\n\r\nYou must not give blood or platelets for at least 3 months after sex\r\n(If you are a woman) a man who has ever had oral or anal sex with another man, even if they used a condom or other protective.",
