        "additional_details": "What's suggested is a Maximum cap based on the house value, most importantly low value housing costing under \u00a3250,000. A maximum rent of \u00a3500 per month is more than sufficient for the landlord to not only cover costs but still very profitable.\r\nThis WILL help millions of people in the UK better off and have a better living standard.",
        "background": "Private housing rent costs are through the roof!! No longer is it affordable to cover rent and have money spare for millions of people in the UK.\r\nLandlords in the UK are making it impossible for low paid workers to get a better future for their family.",
