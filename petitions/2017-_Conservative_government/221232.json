        "additional_details": "I believe that no one should have to suffer due to unjust laws and that everyone should have the right to access natural, safe, effective and inexpensive medicine. Fibromyalgia and CFS/ME sufferers have little chance of finding any medication to help their condition. There isn't one specific drug designed for treatment of symptoms. Drugs that are prescribed may have damaging side effects and some patients show little to no improvement after taking them.",
        "background": "Cannabis is currently a Class B substance, defined as a \"drug that has no therapeutic value\". I believe that to be untrue. Cannabis-based medicines are already available on the NHS to a select and lucky few.",
