        "additional_details": "Last month there was a debate in the main chamber of the House of Commons on climate change, inspired by the strike by school children over climate change. This was the first time in 2 years it had been debated here and only a handful of MPs turned up. This shows how little is being done for this important matter. Therefore I have put forward this petition to allow climate change to be discussed more often.",
        "background": "I feel very strongly about climate change. It affects the future of our planet and the human race. If action is not taken soon it will be too late.",
