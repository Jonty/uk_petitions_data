If you voted to leave and she hasn\u2019t changed your mind for you , then sign this petition and let\u2019s give her a shout out to let her and her government know we\u2019re still here and waiting for her to get us clean out of the eu\u2019s grasp.",

After nearly 3 years with no resolution we should now leave with no deal .",
