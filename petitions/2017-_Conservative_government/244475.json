        "background": "Music is a subject of analysis, yet the A level syllabus makes it a subject reliant on memory. \r\n\r\nStudents are required to memorize 40+ 'set works', with required knowledge of other 'wider listening' pieces.\r\n\r\nI strongly believe that students ought to have access to a score in their exam.",
