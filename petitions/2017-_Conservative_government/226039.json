        "additional_details": "More than just a complaint of prices, this is action against the exploitative practices of event organisations that force young people, families and fellow festival goers into spending extortionate sums of money on top of already rising ticket prices. \r\n\r\nThis not only does this place financial worries and stresses on festival-goers, but also represents the growing length at which festivals use their separation and exclusivity to unfairly and forcefully exploit consumers.",
        "background": "Having spent \u00a35.50 and \u00a36.00 for 400ml cans of cider and beer respectively, I have created this petition in order to curb the rapidly rising prices of alcoholic drinks at festivals.",
