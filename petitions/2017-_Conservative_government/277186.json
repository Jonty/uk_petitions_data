        "additional_details": "Mental health is a large amount of calls the police receive and unfortunately there is lack of training considering. I believe that due to this there are a lot of occasions where inappropriate care is provided and this could cost lives or significantly impact them. Please provide the police with more training and allow them to provide the care which people deserve. It is time we take a stand as mental health matters and no more lives should be lost.",
        "background": "Every two minutes in the UK the police get a call about mental health. This is 720 calls a day and a large proportion. I am campaigning for the police to get more training to ensure there is a better understanding in the police force of mental health and so that hopefully more lives can be saved.",
