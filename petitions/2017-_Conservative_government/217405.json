Instead, the information came from the Turkish city of Gaziantep.\r\n\r\nWashington has been threatening to launch an attack on Syria following a reported chemical incident in the city of Douma, which supposedly occurred on Saturday. Pro-militant sources accused the Syrian army of dropping a chlorine-filled munition on the area, killing and injuring dozens of civilians. Russian military specialists who visited the location of the alleged attack after the militants left the area, found no signs of chemical weapons use or victims of the purported incident.",
        "background": "Urgent: In the light of the alleged chemical weapons attack in Douma - Syria, this government may want to launch air strikes on Syria. We, the petitioners want this government NOT to do so, before a full assessment of the alleged attack, not to take actions based on unreliable sources and reports.",
