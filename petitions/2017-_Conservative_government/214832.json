        "action": "Stop plans to cut Cannon Street trains on the Hayes (Kent) train line",
        "additional_details": "The Hayes line would in future run to London Bridge, Charing Cross and Victoria. The paper states that the \u2018 small number of passengers who currently travel to Cannon Street, would need to change at London Bridge\u2019.  The trains to Cannon Street are already extremely busy with no seats available by the time the trains reach Catford. Cutting the services would have a huge impact on local commuters, not only increasing their travel time but also further overcrowding at London Bridge.",
        "background": "Following a government consultation on the future of south eastern rail services, the secretary for State for Transport is recommending that companies bidding for the south eastern train franchise should make their bid based on the proposed change to cut services to Cannon Street from 2022.",
