Doing it this way will be significantly cheaper, will mean less inconvenience to voters, will increase turnout and will provide elected MPs valuable information relating to what their own constituents actually want. The electorate has a right to change its mind. A lot can change in 4 years, the political make up of Parliaments can completely change and so can the view of those who voted in the referendum to leave the EU.",
