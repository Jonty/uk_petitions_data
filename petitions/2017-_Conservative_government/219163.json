        "additional_details": "The people of our nation care about health. Our Government does not. Deaths from air pollution and cancer will increase due to HS2. People are losing their homes and livelihoods, our heritage being destroyed in perpetuity, nearly 100 ancient woodlands lost and millions of acres of farmland destroyed for this out-of-control vanity project.  Our Government has its priorities wrong. \r\nStop HS2 and spend the \u00a355.7 billion on treating cancer patients instead.  HS2 is a cancer in our society that must be stopped.  It takes 80 years for the environment to recover just from the construction of a new high speed railway.",
        "background": "We recognise cancer is an incurable disease.  This petition is not trying to put the money being wasted on HS2 towards finding a cure for cancer.  This petition wants the money to be spent on treatment for all cancer patients. 450 people die each day from cancer. HS2 is the cancer in our society.",
