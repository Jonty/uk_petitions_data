        "action": "Ban diesel cars, post-Brexit",
        "additional_details": "Last July, the UK banned diesel cars by 2040, because EU diesel testing failure had worsened breaching of NOx targets. Many German cities exceed EU limits. So, last February, Germany\u2019s highest court ruled that cities can ban the worst diesels.\r\n\r\nCar makers and politicians move between both spheres in Germany, the major EU budget contributor. It got EU CO2 regulations to favour diesel, ignoring NOx. VW cheated on emission testing. With 3 jailed, police are investigating 3 of VW\u2019s top people.",
        "background": "Diesel NOx cheating kills 23,500 UK people a year prematurely, at 10 times the USA\u2019s gun death rate. The UK cannot wait 23 years and see 540,500 die early. We must follow the Germans and ban diesels immediately Post-Brexit.",
