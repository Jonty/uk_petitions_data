        "background": "The 5p charge on plastic bags has reduced plastic bag usage by 83%.\r\nStudies show that people are more likely to respond extra charges than they do to discounts. Rather than offering a discount for bringing a reusable cup, a 10p charge on every cup would be a much more effective way to reduce waste.",
