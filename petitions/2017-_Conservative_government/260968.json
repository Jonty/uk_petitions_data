        "additional_details": "VAT on fossil fuels which harm the environment are remaining at 5% which will do little to encourage the public to change their current habits. It should not be legal to allow damaging energy sources to be cheaper and more accessible than those that can help reduce the effects of climate change.",
        "background": "The government recently declared a climate emergency, yet their decision to increase VAT on Solar Panels and their installations goes directly against working towards a sustainable energy source and making it affordable for all to access.",
