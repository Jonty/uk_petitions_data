We were initially told by the government that the bell would still be rung for important national events such as Remembrance Sunday and New Year\u2019s Eve . However, a very notable date in our diary, March 29th 2019 is being overlooked. This date signals Britain departing from  the EU. In the circumstances this extremely important date in our history should not be overlooked and this historic event should be marked with appropriate cannon fire from the Tower of London",
