        "additional_details": "The John Roan, Greenwich; Littlegreen Special School, Compton and Springfield Primary, Birmingham are facing forced academisation despite widespread opposition. \r\n \r\nAcademisation has created fragmented provision, reduced accountability and democratic control, and the proliferation of obscene CEO salaries. Concerns about academisation include the exclusion of SEND children and the use of \u2018off-rolling\u2019 by MATs who seek to improve their position in the league tables; meaning children could be denied access to education. The law must change.",
