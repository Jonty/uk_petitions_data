        "action": "Scrap the proposed legislation for Speed Limiting Technology from 2022",
        "additional_details": "Not only have the general public had no say on the introduction of this legislation. The AA have stated that \"a little speed\" helped with overtaking or joining motorways. It is arguable that poor driving should be policed rather than just limiting the speed for all as the speed limit technology will do nothing for those who decide to do 70 mph, 5 ft from the next car's bumper. They're far more dangerous than the driver doing 85 mph in a very clear outside lane.",
        "background": "The European Union have proposed legislation that will create mandatory speed limiting technology on new cars after 2022. Not only is this an attack on our freedom, it is a huge and controversial piece of legislation that was in no manifesto, nor the general public have been unable to vote on.",
