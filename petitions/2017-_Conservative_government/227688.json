Providing the vaccine as a catchup will save lives, and save NHS money.",
        "background": "- Many women missed the HPV vaccine while at school due to parental abstention or missed appointments.\r\n- The HPV vaccine is currently only available to women on the NHS up until age 18\r\n- The vaccine retails at \u00a3450 at high-street pharmacies - utterly unaffordable for most.",
