        "action": "Declare China having breached the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration",
        "additional_details": "Through a range of measures, China has eroded Hong Kong's executive, legislative and judicial institutions that once safeguarded Hongkongers' civil and political rights and freedoms. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has even called the JD a \"historical document\".\r\nAs a JD co-signatory, the UK has a unique legal right to hold China to its promise to Hong Kong. To do so, the UK should first declare China having breached the JD to show the UK stand with Hongkongers in their fight for freedom.",
        "background": "The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declarations (JD) is a legally binding treaty between the two sovereign states to lay the groundwork for British Hong Kong's handover in 1997. China declares that it will grant autonomy and guaranteed Hong Kongers' rights and freedom for 50 years. China broke its promise.",
