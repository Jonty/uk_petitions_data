        "additional_details": "Plastic carrier bags get into the water supply and sea causing harm to wild life and also in long run the food chain - Paper can be made to be biodegradable so if dumped would not cause harm to wild life and so would not harm us - let the UK \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 be a world leader in starting to bring back the classic Paper Carrier Bags for shops and then front leader in Paper or biodegradable card for packaging for manufacturers",
        "background": "The Government introduced the 5p charge on carrier bags in shops they are now planning to implement it across all. BUT what they should be doing is stopping plastic being used- Paper Carrier Bags and packaging is far better for us and can be recycled easily this would be Enviromentally safer.",
