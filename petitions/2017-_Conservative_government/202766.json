According to Campaign For Better Transport: More than half (52%) of fatal accidents on motorways involve HGVs but only 10% of motorway vehicles are HGVs. HGVs are also involved in 1 in 5 fatal crashes on A and minor roads, and its worsening each year. Let's reverse this trend and use technology to prevent more deaths.",
