Most of the labels on packaging, such as traffic light nutrition labels and litter campaign labels, are there due to voluntary schemes.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking the UK Government to encourage the industry to add labels to essential oils and scented candles to raise awareness of the danger to pets."
