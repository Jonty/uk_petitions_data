Not to mention the harmful effects to 2nd hand smokers, air pollution & the environment due to the plastics in them when people throw them on the ground, on top of the costs to the NHS to treat people with smoking related illnesses & the increased burden to councils to clean up cigarette buts on the ground.",
        "background": "Ban the sale & use of any tobacco product to anyone born on or after 2008. There's no reason for a 10 yr old to start smoking. Nor does this infringe on existing smokers right to continue smoking. Why tackle the effects of smoking, when you can simply prevent them from starting in the first place.",
