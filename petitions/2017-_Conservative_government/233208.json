This means they can claim an extra 25 p from the Government for each pound donated.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the Government to increase the amount of money that can be claimed by charities through Gift Aid if that is something you would like to see happen."
