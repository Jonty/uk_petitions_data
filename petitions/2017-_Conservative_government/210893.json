        "additional_details": "To qualify for the disability part of working tax credits you must receive PIP, but nowhere in PIP is your ability to work assessed. The PIP assessment is unconcerned with your quality of life and tries to fit disabled people into narrow tick boxes which often aren\u2019t appropriate. Many feel that the PIP assessment is poorly suited to its purpose. The general public, disabled in particular, should be consulted and in partnership with doctors, a new system drawn up.",
        "background": "Many disabled have been taken off their benefits despite no improvement to their condition. The PIP criteria does not adequately assess the effects of disability and is far too severe. It should be changed under the advice of doctors and disabled people.",
