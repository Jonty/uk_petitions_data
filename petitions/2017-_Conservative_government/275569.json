        "additional_details": "Domestic Abuse is a Parenting Choice however despite this Sheriffs are failing survivors & putting children at risk from the abuser their mother fled from. Too often Family Courts will only exercise the \u201cfathers rights\u201d with no concern for the safety of the child & detrimental impact on the child\u2019s mother. Sheriff\u2019s & too many \u201cFamily Solicitor\u2019s\u201d lack any understanding of abuse & become enablers in allowing the abuse to continue.",
        "background": "As a survivor of Domestic Abuse & a victim of the failings of Family Court System, I believe there has to be compulsory training for Solicitors & Sheriffs in Family Courts on Coercive Control & Domestic Abuse. To understand that abusers use Family Courts & Legal Aid to continue the abuse.",
