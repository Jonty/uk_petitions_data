        "action": "Provide minimum wage laws to those in teacher training",
        "additional_details": "The government offers bursaries for secondary school positions for those in certain areas or with certain qualifications. Working full time in a school severely limits the trainees to gain a secondary job to provide supplementary income. Primary trainees are eligible for student finance, which provides a very limited income and has to be repaid. Their service to a career path so important for our next generations deserves at least minimum wage.",
        "background": "Primary school trainees are working for free and should be allowed minimum wage. Teachers training on programs such as Schools Direct or SCIITT hold a full time position in a school and are paid nothing, despite being relied on as members of staff. Please sign this petition.",

For example, you could ask for trainee teachers to be paid for the time they spend on placements in schools, if that's what you would like to happen. \r\n"
