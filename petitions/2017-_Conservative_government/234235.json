        "additional_details": "Recently with brexit we have been sold lies from politicians seeking personal gain by preying on people who do not have a full understanding and grasp of the issues. This is nothing new. Throughout history this country has been misled by MPs which has led to the deaths of UK citizens. They must be held accountable.\r\n\r\nThis is not only about brexit. The Leveson inquiry proved the evidence for going to war in Iraq was fabricated. \r\n\r\nKnowingly misleading the electorate must be a criminal offence.",
        "background": "Members of parliament have a duty to be honest with the electorate. This should be enshrined in law. MPs found to be deliberately misleading the electorate by misrepresentation of fact or unable to provide legitimate research to verify their statements should be found guilty of fraud & imprisoned.",
