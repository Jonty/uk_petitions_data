        "additional_details": "Green Party MP Caroline Lucas had submitted an amendment clause (NC30) to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, which sought to transfer the EU Protocol on animal sentience set out in Article 13 of Title II of the Lisbon Treaty into UK law, so animals continue to be recognised as sentient beings under domestic law. A very narrow  majority of 18 Members of Parliament rejected it.",
        "background": "I feel the decision of the UK Government to exclude the status of animals as sentient beings, in the EU withdrawal bill is wrong, and I would urge them to review this decision.\r\n\r\nI would therefore implore the Honorable Members of Parliament to use their conscience and reconsider this.",
