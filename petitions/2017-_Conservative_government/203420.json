        "additional_details": "Over 100 artists are no longer issuing new licenses for their music - with favourites such as Prince's Purple Rain and Bon Jovi\u2019s Livin\u2019 On A Prayer excluded.\r\n\r\nCompanies which re-create hits without the vocals are baffled by the move because it deprives the artists of royalties.\r\n\r\nThe ban already applies to online streaming services but will be extended to discs. \r\n\r\nWe are asking the writers, artists and labels to reconsider and reverse this ban.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this now to help us bring back karaoke",
        "background": "In 2014 the major music publishers enforced a rule that tracks by certain artists and writers could not be sold as karaoke tracks online as downloads or streams. On 1st October this will be extending to discs. So no one will be able to sing Adele, Coldplay, Abba, Prince and many others.",
