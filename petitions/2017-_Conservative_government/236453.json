        "additional_details": "There seems to be very little support for people in the armed forces once they have left, they have no support which leads to problem with mental health then homeless. Once on the street there is no help at all for the men & women who have served this country. Top brass and the politicians need to do more to support or serving and ex serving troops. They need to start caring about the troops more and invest in the troops they have now rather than spending all this money on recruitment campaigns.",
        "background": "In 2018 there was as I know 79 suicides from serving or ex serving personnel in the UK armed forces and 13,000 homeless ex serving personnel. Plus the 25,000 ex serving troops receiving care for their mental health, however it is estimated only half are actually receiving care.",
