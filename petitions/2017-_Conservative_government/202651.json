        "action": "Provide a FREE phone Universal Credit helpline",
        "additional_details": "On 11th Ocober 2017 during PMQ's Jeremy Corbyn asked the Prime Minister to provide a free phone helpline, however the PM decided NOT to respond to this particular question.\r\n \r\nUniversal Credit (UC) is supposed to be a benefit to help people into work and support them while they do so. Providing a helpline that is essentially a premium rate number for people that are already under financial pressure is indefensible and totally unfair and a free phone number should be provided as soon as possible.",
        "background": "The Universal Credit Helpline for England and wales costs claimants 55p PER MINUTE to call.  This is an indefensible policy that puts much more pressure on already overstretched claimants calling the helpline to chase payments, chase delayed processing of claims and many other reasons.",
