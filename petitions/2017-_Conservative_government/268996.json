        "action": "Upgrade A2 Motorcycle License to Catagory A using a motorcycle instructor",
        "additional_details": "A motorcycle rider who is 24 or above will have passed their motorcycle test to achieve a category A License which costs a lot of money as a rider is required to rent a bike, take time off work, pay for lessons and complete 2 tests. An A2 motorcycle rider will have completed the exact same tests using a lower powered motorcycle. However this means an A2 rider with 2 years experience on the road must pay the money all over again to obtain the category A licence.",
        "background": "In Northern Ireland if you are over 19 and under 24 the highest engine motorcycle you can get is 600cc which requires an A2 license. I would like to see a change that allows people to change from A2 license to A using a much more cost effective way such as allowing an instructor to pass a rider.",
