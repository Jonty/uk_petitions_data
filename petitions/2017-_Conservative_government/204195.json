        "action": "Start teaching a language thoroughly from the school year of reception (age 4/5)",
        "additional_details": "A DfE representative found that there is no requirement to teach languages in all years in KS2, as long as the content of the programme of study has been covered by the end of KS2. The UK needs a multilingual population in order to succeed in a globalised world, for global citizenship, security and to operate efficiently in trade and investment. The research, commissioned by the British Council, also revealed that UK schoolchildren are now less likely to speak a foreign language than those in any other European nation.",
        "background": "Teaching a language from primary school level is not yet compulsory at key stage 1, which is a major part of a child\u2019s development. If taught thoroughly from a younger age, the more likely a child is to remember the language, which will also help in their working future.",
