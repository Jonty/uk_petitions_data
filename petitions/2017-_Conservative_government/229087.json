        "additional_details": "There was a recent story about a 12 week old kitten that had its testicals cut off with scissors by 2 people and left in a box and dumped in a park to die, no one will get prosecuted for that because it isn\u2019t a criminal offence and I feel it should be and that the laws should be changed so it is a criminal offence that can and should be prosecuted",
        "background": "This petition started because there are too many cases of animal cruelty and abuse showing up everyday and I feel that animals should be treated and have the same rights as humans, it is a criminal offence to harm someone so why shouldn\u2019t it be an offence to harm an animal",
