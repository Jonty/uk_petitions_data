        "additional_details": "Commons Briefing Paper 07212 of June 2016, regarding the EU Referendum, makes clear the status that the referendum result would have. Despite this, the result has been taken as a mandate for action. Parliament represents all UK citizens, whether they can and do vote or not, and should not facilitate a vote by c.26% of us as 'the will of the people' but act in what it judges the best interests of the UK and all its people. That judgement must be established.",
        "background": "Despite the importance of this topic, there has never been a debate in the House of Commons specifically on this question. Parliament's first duty is to always act in what it considers to be the UK's best interest. Hence, that consideration needs to be made and should dictate action.",
