        "additional_details": "Like many others i learned the hard way my 1st born son lost his life swimming in open water aged 13. The 1st time I heard the words \"cold water shock\" was when I was looking up how my physically fit son could have died. I started visiting schools in my son's memory to teach the dangers in & around open water my son was not alone in not knowing the dangers in fact he was part of a majority. This needs to change water safety/ drowning prevention needs to be a part of our national curriculum now!",
