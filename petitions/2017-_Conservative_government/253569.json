        "additional_details": "The past two years\u2019 negotiations and parliamentary debates have demonstrated that our political machinery is quite incapable of getting on with it. We are condemned to months and years more dispute over what Brexit means. All possible views, opinions and judgments have already been fully aired. Hold a confirmatory referendum as soon as possible - within 1 month, with no campaigns.",
        "background": "The overwhelming public response to Brexit is to get on with it. There are only two ways \u2013 either leave now without a deal, or repeal Article 50. This binary choice should be given to the people for their decision in a rapid confirmatory referendum, in which all \u2018partisan\u2019 campaigning is outlawed.",
