        "action": "Ban the use of domestic Wood Burning Stoves to improve air quality for all",
        "additional_details": "Breathing clean, unpolluted, fresh smelling air should be a basic human right, but yet in modern Britain it is not as people are permitted to set fire to wood in order to create heat, which is completely unnecessary in 2018. Household wood burners should be banned immediately before more people are duped into buying them under the green banner and releasing more harmful particulates into the air. It is a shame to think that breathing clean fresh crisp winter air is currently a thing of the past.",
        "background": "Wood burning stoves are becoming more and more common which is evidenced by the tangible and demonstrable drop in air quality in recent years. You do not need any scientific equipment to witness the drop in quality. Just step outside on any cold day or night and you will smell the foul acrid smoke.",
