        "additional_details": "As of now, hundreds and thousands of men, women, non-binary and everyone in between are being unfairly discriminated against for choosing to wear certain things or acting in a \u201ctoo effeminate\u201d way. Clearly this is a perpetuation of the machoistic ethos of Victorian education and should not have made its way into the second half of the 20th Century, let alone the 21st Century.\r\nTwo of the most prevalent examples:\r\n-women may have long hair but men cannot \r\n-women may wear earrings but boys may not.",
        "background": "Currently there are discriminatory uniform policies in schools, and various other types of institutions up and down the UK. This is not okay. This must end, and I ask with your help to raise awareness about this cause and bring it to the fore of the government\u2019s attention.",
