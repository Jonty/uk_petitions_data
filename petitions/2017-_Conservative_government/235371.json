        "additional_details": "Endometriosis is a condition affecting 1 in 10 women worldwide where the tissue that lines the womb is found outside the womb, typically in the pelvic region. \r\n\r\nWomen with Endometriosis often suffer with fertility issues. Surgery often heightens the chance of conceiving naturally, however not all women are successful. Women should be considered for egg freezing via the NHS prior to undergoing surgery should they have extensive issues with ovary involvement or risks of having ovaries removed.",
        "background": "Hi, my name is Aimee and I suffer with stage 4 Endometriosis. I want women with this condition to be considered for egg freezing prior to undergoing treatment and surgery to limit their chances of becoming infertile. Usually, the NHS will only fund egg freezing for cancer patients having treatment.",
