        "additional_details": "I know from experience and from talking to families in this area that children are already struggling to get the support they need in school. Children who do not have the support they need cannot access education in the same way as other children can. It is not feasible to place children with additional support needs in mainstream schools and then cut their support, it will have a devastating impact on them. Educational Support should be a priority. This is not inclusion this is discrimination!",
        "background": "Highland Council have indicated that as part of their proposed budget cuts there will be cuts to Autism Support, ASN staff, PSAs &.Educational Psychology. Schools are already struggling with tight budgets & overstretched staff. We have to ensure NO child loses out as a result of council budget cuts.",
