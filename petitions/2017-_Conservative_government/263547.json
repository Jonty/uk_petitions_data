If it is deemed that the rate is high enough to immunise at up to one month then all under 16s should be offered the same protection. To not do is negligence. Furthermore it is excluding those who are not financially able to ensure the health of their children.",

Parents are required to have their older children immunised privately at a cost of \u00a3120. All under 16s should be offered protection from TB under the NHS immunisation programme.",
