        "additional_details": "Vlogging is a form of online video blog usually shared via YouTube in which an individual talks to a camera, adrressing the audience. 100s of vlogs and drive with me videos can be accessed at the click of button. Those featured in these vlogs are popular young adults acting as role models for young and vulnerable teenagers who won't always realise they can be putting their own and other lives at risk if they are inspired to copy the actions as the youtubers face no consequence for their actions",
        "background": "Many youtubers are creating vlog videos whilst driving where they are talking to and looking at their camera and therefore becoming distracted from the road and becoming dangers to themselves and other road users. This will be encouraging others, especially young inexperienced drivers to do the same",
