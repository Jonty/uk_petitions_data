        "additional_details": "A recent online video showed a parking enforcement agent ticketing two ambulances because one had parked on a double yellow line and one because it parked in a disabled bay as it was the only space big enough.  The crews had stopped briefly to pick up water as they have no designated rest periods and are constantly on call.",
        "background": "Current regulations allow marked police cars to park otherwise in accordance with traffic regulations ie they are allowed to park on double yellow lines.  Currently fire and ambulance vehicles must be on an emergency call to do this.  All emergency vehicles should have the same rights.",
