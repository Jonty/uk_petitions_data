        "additional_details": "We are calling on the Government to halt the UK\u2019s badger culls and release key data that suggests the culls are not working. \r\n\r\nTo-date approximately 32,000 badgers have been killed since the culls began in October 2013 and now the government plans to roll the culls out across the country killing tens of thousands more animals.  Persecution of badgers has also escalated. Restricting cattle movements, stricter cattle testing, vaccination, monitoring and enforcement is the answer, not culling.",
        "background": "We believe the majority of people in the UK oppose the Government's badger culls.  The government is ignoring sound scientific evidence that states they are ineffective, inhumane and could make matters worse. They are also proving to be extremely costly to the taxpayer.  Transparency is also needed.",
