        "additional_details": "Firstly, this could be a start to ending homelessness. This is proven by the fact for majority of jobs they ask for an address, therefore these buildings would give homeless people addresses towards getting a job. \r\nFurthermore, homeless people won`t be in different ranges of weather conditions. There are many more reasons why this would help. I`m asking you to please do your part and please sign this petition!",
        "background": "I strongly believe it would be a solution to help the homeless by transforming all the empty buildings into houses for the homeless. Majority of it this could run on donations. Helping to transform the buildings, homeless people could be asked to help decorate and other things to help.",
