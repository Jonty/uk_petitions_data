        "additional_details": "Numerous examples of Israeli incitement against Palestinians have been documented over the last decade alone. Our government rarely addresses this particular issue nor do we apply pressure in order to tackle it head on. We must ban individuals who are considered to have invited hatred, racism and violence against Palestinians from entering the UK to send a clear message that such is abhorrent, unacceptable and a factor that prevents peaceful dialogue and reconciliation.",
        "background": "It is incumbent upon the government of United Kingdom to ensure we are not seen to be complicit, or endorse in any way, any Israeli official or ordinary citizens who is on record inciting hatred, racism & violence towards Palestinians. Such individuals should be refused entry to the United Kingdom.",
