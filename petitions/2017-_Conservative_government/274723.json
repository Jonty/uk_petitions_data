        "action": "More assistance on TFL for parents with prams and more accessible lift access.",
        "additional_details": "My personal reasons for this petition came to light. When I as a new mother decided with a fellow mother, to take our 4 month and 6 month old babies out for the day in London.\r\n\r\nOur first hurdle was getting down the stairs with a baby and pram at Turnpike Lane Station.I thought it would be best to ask for help, from someone at the station. But unfortunately he said, that he was the only assistant and could not help. This made me aware of how hard it could be for a new parent to be able to travel with ease around London. It also highlighted, that it would be hard for anyone who is unable to independently walk.",
        "background": "This petition is to show the need for more staff on the London transport network. Who are able to help parents manoeuvre in and around London using public transport. In addition to having accessible lift access in more stations.",
