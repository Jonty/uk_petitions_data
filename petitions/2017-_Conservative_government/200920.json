        "additional_details": "300m tonnes of plastic is produced every year. Only 1/3 gets recycled. \r\nBulky packing makes customers buy more. It\u2019s one of the reasons why:\r\nWe waste 7.3 m tonnes of food each year.\r\nWe are disconnected with fresh food, everything we buy is in the plastic containers, packaging etc.",
        "background": "We can use biodegradable or cotton bags. Fresh fruits/vegetables don't need to be packed. We should be able to return the plastic bottle to the shop and receive some money back (deposit).It would teach children, how to make some pocket money. The producer would have the responsibility of recycling.",
