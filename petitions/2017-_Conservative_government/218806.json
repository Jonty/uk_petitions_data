        "additional_details": "Many of us have cousins spread across the Commonwealth who still maintain close family connections with us despite the fact that they have been out of the UK for a few generations. If they wish to return to our island, then we should allow them to do so. In addition most of them have a great understanding of our political system and culture, as well conform to our standards. An act such as this will put us in a better position with the Commonwealth and help fill the Brexit labour shortage.",
        "background": "Currently, the Home Office only allows for Commonwealth Citizens who have at least one UK born grandparent to obtain an ancestry visa. We want to change this and extend this visa to Commonwealth Citizens who have at least one UK born great-grandparent.",
