        "action": "Make cycling on a road a criminal offence",
        "additional_details": "Cyclists are a public menace on british roads, maliciously disrupting the flow of traffic and causing danger to themselves and those around them. They force all vehicles unfortunate enough to encounter them to drop to lower gears, travelling with lower fuel efficiency until it is safe to overtake them. Restricting them to cycle paths is better for the environment and for the safety of themselves and other road users, and will make for a happier and more pleasurable journey for everyone.",
        "background": "It should be a criminal offence for cyclists to cycle on the road, and they should be limited only to cycling on cycle paths. Fines should be incurred for all cyclists that make a public nuisance of themselves on the road, and the collected money can be used to maintain and fund new cycle paths.",
