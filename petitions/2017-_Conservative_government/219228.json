        "additional_details": "There has been many cases in the press and complaints online of vet practices charging extortionate prices for out of hours treatment on their beloved pet. Vet companies can charge what they like, act how they like and time and time again get away with this leaving the consumer at the mercy of out of hours when their pet is injured or seek emergency treatment.",
        "background": "There is no Ombudsman for Vet Practices in the UK that is independent and external.\r\n\r\nWe have Ombudsman for communication, gas, electricity, NHS. When a consumer of a Vets company raises a complaint about a Vet company (not a vet) there is no Ombudsman for when things go wrong.",
