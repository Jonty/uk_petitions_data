        "additional_details": "The European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 allows us to elect our MEPs by a Regional PR Closed List system. \r\n\r\nThis system means we elect our MEPs as a group by party to represent us locally in European Parliament through a list decided by political parties themselves.\r\n\r\nMany countries like Spain and Italy have an PR Open list system, making candidates more accountable to the electorate whilst fairly reflecting the votes of electorate through taking their political party vote into account.",
        "background": "At the moment we just elect MEPs as a group by Political Party not as individuals (closed List). \r\nI propose, instead, an PR Open List for the 2019 European Elections so we can elect the candidate by their individual agendas as well as their Party agenda, making them more accountable to us.",
