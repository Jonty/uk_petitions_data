        "action": "Ban plastic cutlery, cups and plates in the UK, from now.",
        "additional_details": "By 2020 it is estimated that the number of plastic items in the oceans will out weigh the number of fish, and by 2050 it is estimated that 34 billion tonnes of plastic will have been produced since 1950. We have to take action now. The government's plan to reduce single use plastics by 2042 unfortunately seems like it will be too little too late - simply aiming to reduce consumption of plastic will not do enough to help curb the environmental damage we have already done to our planet. I believe the only way to combat this problem is to ban these items full stop and straight away. Plastic bags in Kenya and plastic cutlery and cups in France have been successfully banned so why in the UK can we not do the same?",
        "background": "All too often are we see images of plastic covered beaches, wildlife killed by single use plastics and horrific images of young children working landfill sites, because of over consumption by the western world resulting in vast amounts of waste. I think its time we took a real stand point.",
