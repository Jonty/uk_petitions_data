        "additional_details": "I informed them in writing I would record the whole meeting & it would not be edited. I would send an unedited copy of the recording to the other people at the meeting. Also the recording was for my own use, for any court proceedings or taking legal advice. I would not distribute it on the internet. This is allowed under the Data Protection 1997 Act, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 & the Human Rights Act Article 10. There is no law saying I need their permission. I am not a data controller so I am not bound by the act.",
        "background": "I wanted an audio recording of a meeting with social services as I have a disability which makes it difficult to take notes and affects my memory. I also felt under stress and worried that things I have said or others have said might not be recorded accurately. I wasn\u2019t allowed to record it.",
