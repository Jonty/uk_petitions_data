        "additional_details": "Free voting is traditionally allowed on matters of conscience. Given the unprecedented importance of Brexit and its fundamentally irreversible nature, it should be treated as a matter of conscience. MPs should be given a free vote and allowed to fulfil their primary duty, which is to use their best judgement to act in the best interests of the country and their constituents.",
        "background": "Brexit is an issue of unique importance for our country's future which should transcend party politics, yet MPs are being whipped to support the party line. This is not only inappropriate in this context, it amounts to an order to them to put party before country. This is totally unacceptable.",
