        "additional_details": "If a student was not very talented at either Maths or English and they were to fail their exams, they would be held back for life, just because they struggled at one subject. Students should not be forced to do all core subjects at GCSE level, they should be allowed to pick and choose between subjects that interest them and subjects they are good at. Using this system, students will be more enthusiastic throughout school.",
        "background": "The British Education System is outdated and is solely geared towards the 'role-model student'. Today's schools do not allow the students to discover their passions, and instead are forced to memorise facts that they are not interested in and will be useless to them after their exams.",
