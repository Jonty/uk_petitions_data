        "additional_details": "Student finance is classed as annual income even if students don\u2019t apply for it. So students who do not apply for maintenance will automatically lose benefits and any additional help due to the \u2018assumption\u2019 that students have applied for it. This leaves low income families no option but to apply for the full loan in order to meet financial short falls whilst studying and then having to pay back the full amount of loan when earning over the threshold. (Which is less than the annual average wage).",
        "background": "Student finance is classed as annual income and is used to deduct benefits for low income households. This therefore leaves many students in extreme financial difficulty, using their loan for financial short falls.\r\nIf a loan is to be paid back, it should not be classed as annual income.",
