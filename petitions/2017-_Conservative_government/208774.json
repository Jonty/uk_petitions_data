        "additional_details": "Given the importance of Higher Education to a prosperous and democratic society, it is important that it is appropriately regulated. This requires a board that understands the sector and is committed to furthering the pursuit of knowledge across all disciplines and for the support of all members of society. Expertise should be drawn from outside and from within the sector. The exclusion of academic and professional services representatives and of a member of the NUS is of particular concern.",
        "background": "The OfS has responsibility for putting \u201cthe student interest at heart\u201d and promoting fair access to HE. Therefore we request an independent review of the appointment process to the board to assure it has been transparent, recruited the best qualified & meets public duties under the Equalities Act.",
