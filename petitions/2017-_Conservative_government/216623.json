There are groups who are fighting for a change and rescuing dogs from this fate (please see https://www.instagram.com/slaughterhouse_survivors). How are we supposed to fight for the protection of wild animals like lions and tigers across the world when we do this to an animal we call \u2018mans best friend\u2019?",
