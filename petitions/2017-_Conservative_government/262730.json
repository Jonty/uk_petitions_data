        "additional_details": "Brexit has been a highly emotive and divisive process and the manner in which future negotiations and decisions are carried out directly impacts us all. Therefore it is imperative that the person who is the leader of Britain during this process has been democratically elected by the public, and not just chosen by a select few. We call on the next Conservative leader to table a motion for an early general election and for the House of Commons to back it, to enable us to move forward united.",

This person should democratically  obtain a public mandate as they will represent us all through the next stages of the Brexit process and beyond.",
