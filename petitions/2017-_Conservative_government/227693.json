        "additional_details": "From personal experience, I feel that you do not get the same level of care with a normal GP, as they are not necessarily trained across the mental health spectrum. They rush the 10 minute appointment because they have 100s of patients to see per day. This needs to change. There needs to be a dedicated member of staff for times of crisis, and for people that maybe need longer appointments to explain their issues.",
        "background": "I feel as if the current system in place in GP surgeries is inadequate for the amount of people that are facing mental health issues in this country.\r\n\r\n'At any time, one in six adults has a mental health condition and one in 100 has a severe mental illness.'
