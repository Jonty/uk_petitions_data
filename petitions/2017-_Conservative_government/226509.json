        "additional_details": "Quote Theresa May: \"We don't know what the outcome will be\". The referendum was advisory, not conclusive. The result of the referendum has now been proven to be illegally biased (something \"our\" government is choosing to ignore). Hence, the \"vote\" (actually an opinion poll) is now null and void. The referendum was voted for with no indication of any actual facts. 2yrs ago there was no detail about what \"brexit\" actually entailed. Today, still no detail. For all these reasons:  STOP BREXIT.",
        "background": "It's so desperately simple. The Government's standard response to these kinds of petitions is \"The British people voted to leave the EU and the government respect that decision\". BUT, the government themselves DO NOT KNOW the outcome of that decision, so how can they possibly respect it???",
