        "action": "Force all local councils to offer a dedicated plastic waste bin",
        "additional_details": "For example in Swindon if we wish to recycle plastic we have to buy white bin bags and then the waste will be collected. No it doesn't cost much but it is obviously enough to put people off and that is evident every bin collection day. So while the government think about what the consumer can do to help the issue with plastic bottle return points, I think they need to also look at what they should be doing and this is a simple step already offered by other councils.",
        "background": "In the wake of the current plastic crisis I find it staggering that there are still councils like mine in Swindon that do not provide people with a dedicated plastic waste bin.",
