        "additional_details": "Despite the lack of service improvements, failure to deliver compensation, the disruption caused by new timetables, consumers are still being told that fare increases are justified.\r\n\r\nNational Punctuality (PPM) in Q4 of 2017 was recorded at 86.4%, indicating a decline of 27pp compared to 2016-17. (Source: orr.gov.uk)\r\n\r\nNational Reliability (CaSL) in Q4 of 2017 was 4.8%, which also indicates a drop in quality of service and a decrease of 1.4pp compared to 2016-17. (Source: orr.gov.uk)\r\n\r\nThe ORR also discovered that 59% of consumers that made complaints to National Rail providers in 2017-18 were dissatisfied with the outcome of their complaint.\r\n\r\nThis petition proposes that all regulated train fares are frozen in January 2019.\r\n",
        "background": "This petition asks the Government to commit to a \"fares freeze\" for regulated fares next year, as rail fares are expected to increase by 3.2% in 2019.",
