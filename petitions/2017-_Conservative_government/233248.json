        "additional_details": "The referendum was \"in or out\", not half in! Other MPs who come across as well principled, honest and genuine and say Britain could aim for a WTO withdrawal from the EU. A good starting point to begin a real negotiation. No need to send \u00a339B(!) of hard working tax payers money to the EU. No need to become a vassal state. A much better deal for the UK must be possible. If not, no deal no problem.",
        "background": "Theresa May has lied to the British public since becoming Prime Minister. She has wasted two and a half years only to present a deal with the EU that betrays the hard working British people. With the UK's huge trade deficit, the average person has been left feeling they could negotiate a better deal",
