        "additional_details": "Yesterday, I received a truly horrifying voicemail that all parents/families dread \"your daughter has been hit by a car\". Knowing the route she takes to school I instantly knew that it would have something to do with the crossing of the A308 at The Black Dog Junction; our worst fears had been realised. \r\nThis junction controls 14 lanes of traffic and is used by 100's of vehicles/pedestrians each day, yet there is not a safe crossing system in place for pedestrians. An urgent review is required.",
        "background": "We would like as much support as possible to put pressure on the powers that be, to install a pedestrian crossing at the junction of the Black Dog/A308/Chertsey Road. It is ludicrous that a junction which controls 14 lanes of traffic, does not have a safe pedestrian crossing system.",
