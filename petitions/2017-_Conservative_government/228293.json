        "action": "Ban the sale of filtered cigarettes across the UK.",
        "additional_details": "Over 4.5 trillion cigarette butts find their way into the environment every single year. It's estimated that a cigarette butt will take 10-12 years to break down.\r\n\r\nBy banning cigarette filters we could eliminate a massive percentage of plastic/litter finding its way to our streets, rivers and oceans almost overnight benefiting us, wildlife and the environment. It's likely to encourage more smokers to give up too.",
        "background": "It is widely accepted that cigarette filters have little to no health benefits for smokers. Many understand that cigarette filters contain large amounts of toxic chemicals but most people do not realise they contain plastic and are the biggest ocean pollutant on the planet.",
