        "additional_details": "Many are fondly familiar with unwrapping a 3-pack of Reese's cups. Recently, the company has responded to a greater demand, and introduced 5-packs. Whilst this is great, what isn't so good is the fact that each cup is individually wrapped in non-recyclable plastic. This has detrimental effects on marine life, ranging from zooplankton to sea lions. Please, take a step in the right direction. If Reese's have never individually wrapped their 3-packs, they don't need to do it in the 5-packs.",
        "background": "Reese's are renowned for being the go-to American snack for chocolate fans across the country. Help us address the ever-growing plastic dilemma, and save the environment by addressing the individual wrapping of each Reese's cup in the new 5-packs, which are sold in stores nationwide.",
