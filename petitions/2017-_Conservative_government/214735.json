        "action": "Introduce new regulations for the development of Artificial Intelligence.",
        "additional_details": "Many experts, including founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and Professor Stephen Hawking, have raised concerns over the development of AI. Many in particular believe that, by 2045, the point of Technological Singularity will occur. This means that, if AI is developed, without regulation, it could surpass human intelligence.\r\n\r\nAI is useful at the present time, however, continuing to develop this, without limits, is dangerous. Machines will always make mistakes, let's not become inferior to them.",
        "background": "Artificial Intelligence is intelligent behaviour, exhibited by computers. Currently AI is at a primitive stage, home assistants are starting to play a role in our lives, but what they can do for us is limited. I want to see new regulations, for further development of AI and Machine Learning.",
