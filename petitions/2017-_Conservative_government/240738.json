        "additional_details": "If a child with type1 goes on a school trip/over night residential the school has to provide extra staff in order to take care of the child properly. In school the child also requires extra 1:1 time from an adult at least 3 times a day (normally more). Families do get disability living allowance, but this doesn't cover all the costs. The current estimate of prevalence of type 1 diabetes in children in the UK is 1 per 700\u20131,000. 65.6% of type 1 children are under the age of 14(diabetes.org.uk)",
