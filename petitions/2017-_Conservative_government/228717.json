        "additional_details": "There has been a significant increase in recent years and young people aren't reporting issues such as anxiety or depression. \r\n\r\nWe need trained staff and support in schools; there are so many young people that need support but do not know how to speak out. Without services providing adequate support for all young people, there is absolutely no way we will be able to climb out this dark hole we currently find ourselves in.",
        "background": "As a young person, I feel it is my duty to break the stigma of mental health. If we can manage this problem right from the root, we can decrease suicide rates and prevent mental illnesses from progressing.\r\nStatistics shows that mental health issues in young people have increased 6X since 1995.",
