        "additional_details": "For hundreds of years pet dogs have been given the same legal status as a bed (property) which is ludicrous. \r\n\r\nA bill was approved in France as a result of a petition of 700,000  against the1804 law that states animals are just \u2018movable goods\u2019. \r\nThe bill now describes animals as \u2018living and feeling beings\u2019. \r\n\r\n'Animals suffer, they have emotions and feelings. It is not a question of making animals subjects of the law but simply of protecting them against abuse and cruelty.\u2019",
        "background": "So many of us see the heartache that others go through when they lose their dog or have it stolen as they do not know whether it has been sold on or used for dog fighting or bait. I have seen so many stories and photo's of appalling injuries that dogs have sustained as a result of human behaviour.",
