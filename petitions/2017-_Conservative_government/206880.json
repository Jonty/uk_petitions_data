        "action": "Stop plans to cut Victoria trains from the Bexleyheath line",
        "additional_details": "The Government has ignored their promise that these changes would only be made \u201cif passengers supported it.\u201d\r\n\r\nCutting these services would be a disaster for commuters in areas like Bexleyheath, Welling, Blackheath, Eltham, Kidbrooke and elsewhere who do not have access to the DLR or the Underground, so have to depend on the rail network.  In particular, elderly and disabled passengers, who use the service to access Kings College Hospital at Denmark Hill, will face much more difficult journeys.",
        "background": "The Government has confirmed that all services on the Bexleyheath Line to Victoria will be cut after the new franchise is awarded in 2018, despite the Government\u2019s own consultation showing that 89% of respondents were opposed to plans to cut the number of local rail destinations.",
