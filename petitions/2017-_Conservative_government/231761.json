        "additional_details": "Since the introduction of the High Income Child Benefit Charge in 2013, thousands of mothers have decided not to claim child benefit, losing out on vital NI credits towards their pension. We call on the government: a) to lift the restrictions on making backdated claims for child benefit, and b) to use government records to identify women missing out and to contact them about this situation. Note: 8 out of 9 child benefit recipients are women, but the issue would apply to some fathers as well.",
