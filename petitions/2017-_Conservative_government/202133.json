        "action": "The UK government should impose economic sanctions on Spain over Catalonia.",
        "additional_details": "A fundamental British value (or so we teach our children) is the importance of democracy. A right to vote and determine the future of your own people is a right protected under the European Convention on Human Rights and a pre-requisite of EU membership, not to mention the hallmark of a fair and free society. The UK government's response should recognise this by imposing sanctions against Spain or taking other diplomatic steps to secure the rights of the Catalonian people.",
        "background": "On 1st October 2017 the people of Catalonia voted for independence despite attempts by the central Spanish government to prevent the referendum. Scenes were shown across the media of the brutality shown towards Catalonia citizens, but the UK's response since has been shameful.",
