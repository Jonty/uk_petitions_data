        "additional_details": "In November 2016 the American public elected Donald Trump as their 45th President. Putting aside any personal dislike of either Mr Farage  or the President, we can not deny they have a unique relationship. It is a relationship that not one individual in the British government currently possesses with the US President. \r\n\r\nWe should be using this \"Special Relationship\" between Mr Farage and the President to aid the planning of a future trade deal between us and the US.",
        "background": "Nigel Farage was the pioneer of Brexit. Without him the British public would have never been given a referendum. As we approach the one year anniversary of Article 50 being invoked, we now need more than ever to start talks regarding future trade deals with other nations around the globe.",
