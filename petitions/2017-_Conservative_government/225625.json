        "additional_details": "They all have been through so much lately, and I got to realise, why do we celebrate the army, who rightly protect us (My little girl's father is ex military, bomb disposal), but not these people, who risk their life for us on a daily basis. They deserve our support. So very much. Please do help me giving them the chance to parade, be proud, be cheered, be supported.",
        "background": "Recently, I celebrated my daughter's 4 year old birthday. I invited the local Fire crew, then local Police. I was absolutely overwhelmed with their kindness in turning up and taking the time in talking to the little ones, their patience, their absolute dedication to their job.",
