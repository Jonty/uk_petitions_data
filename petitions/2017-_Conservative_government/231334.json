        "action": "Scrap free television licences for the over-75s",
        "additional_details": "According to TV Licensing there were 4,455,000 over-75s licences in force in 2017. At the current cost of \u00a3150.50 per licence, this represents a total cost of \u00a3670 million that is covered by households that pay for a television licence.",
        "background": "According to Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the over-75s consume many more BBC services than others, yet are not required to pay for a television licence. This means households that are not eligible for a free licence are being forced to subsidise the over-75s which amounts to age discrimination.",
