        "action": "Recall Parliament to debate WTO effects of no deal exit from the EU",
        "additional_details": "The two chief promises are around security and the economy.  WTO  is clear on these points. In Ireland we are promised a free border but WTO is clear that there \"must be border checks\" (GATs).  GATs is clear that checks should be done \"at the border\". Contrary to any hoped for open border. In relation to Tariffs GATs is equally and unequivocally clear that once a tariff is set then it must be applied equally(GATs), this can be economically disastrous. WTO, unlike the EU cannot waiver",
        "background": "Parliament has debated many aspects of a possible withdrawal agreement orremaining in the EU but little has been said about the effects of World Trade Organisation rules ie General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, unnegotiable rules are designed to level the playing field across the world.",
