        "action": "Protect Women. Make IVF Safer. Amend IVF Law.",
        "additional_details": "Protecting the welfare of women undergoing IVF treatment is absent in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act. Consequently, the Human Fertilisation Embryology Authority (HFEA) is unable to monitor or regulate guidelines on clinical practices relating to the administration of drugs and dosages during IVF. This is why this petition is asking for the Act to be amended. \r\n\r\nTogether, let\u2019s make this process safer. Please sign and share this petition with your friends and colleagues. Thank you.",
        "background": "At 25, high dosages of IVF drugs led me to have a heart attack. I am not alone. Last year around 3,700 women undergoing IVF suffered from Ovarian Hyper Stimulation Syndrome. \r\nThat\u2019s why I want an explicit commitment to women\u2019s welfare added to the Human Fertilisation & Embryology Act.",
