        "action": "Return power over admissions to academy schools to local authorities",
        "additional_details": "We\u2019d like to see changes to the rules of legislation requiring academy schools to be bound to local education authorities and not be able to ignore rules they do not want to adhere to. We\u2019d also like all public schools admissions authorities decisions to admit a child to a school to be final and binding. Academy schools are only bound by decisions made solely by the Secretary of State for Education. This is a situation that allows schools to completely ignore local schools authorities and this must change.",
        "background": "Currently UK academy schools are not bound by local authorities\u2019 admissions decisions. They are regulated by the Education and Skills Funding Agency, which is slow to respond to local authorities\u2019 issues with academy schools.",
