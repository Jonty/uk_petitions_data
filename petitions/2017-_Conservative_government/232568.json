        "additional_details": "Any urban area within Europe of a similar size has either a tram, light rail, or underground network \u2013 some have two of the three. Examples include Turin, Prague, Vienna, Stockholm, Lyon, and our neighbours Manchester. HM Treasury figures show that London receives nearly \u00a32600 per person in transport spending whereas Yorkshire and Humber receives \u00a3160. Transport for the North estimates the North is owed a \u00a359 billion catch-up spend to bring our level of investment up to London spending.",
        "background": "The West Yorkshire Urban Area is home to a population of approximately 2.3million people. If less wealthy countries are able to ensure their sizeable cities have mass transit systems, it should be of national concern that the UK, as the 9th wealthiest country in the world, is unwilling to do so.",
