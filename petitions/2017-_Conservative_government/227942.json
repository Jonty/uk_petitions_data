        "additional_details": "There has been continued undemocratic resistance to this vote ever since the result was in.  Both from those in the establishment and others with a personal agenda .  This government has insisted that no second referendum will be forced upon this nation.  We want to strengthen its resolve and ensure that it stands by this stance.  We cannot keep having vote after vote until the one side gets the result it wants.  It had its chance to persuade the populace and failed.  Don't deny democracy.",
        "background": "The nation in 2016 has already had its referendum on the issue of EU membership and rejected the option of continued membership.  The options simple and the answer clear.  In the largest numbers ever in this country over 17 million people voted to leave the EU.  This must now happen without delay.",
