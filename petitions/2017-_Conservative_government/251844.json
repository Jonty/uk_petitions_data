        "additional_details": "Many motorcycle, moped & scooter owners use their vehicle for work, others it is their pride and joy for leisure. Some scooter or moped riders work in the gig economy as fast food delivery riders which no insurance company will provide any cover other than 3rd party only cover. This is a big problem for any deliveroo or justeat rider who has their bike stolen.\r\nSentences imposed are not tough enough and many re offend. \r\nAlso what about the other vehicle they crash into, who pays the cost in end.",
        "background": "In the last 12 months an unprecedented increase in the theft of motorcycles, especially scooters and mopeds has been recorded. The police are doing as much as they can, but the time now comes for harsher sentences. We need to send the message that if you steal a motorcycle, you will go to prison.",
