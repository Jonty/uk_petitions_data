You can vote for the brexit party for a clean break brexit the conservatives for a deal or anyone else to stop brexit all together so why wait? The public are fed up of mps that we voted in because they said they would honour our vote and now doing all they can to stop it.",
        "background": "As there is a call for another vote on brexit this could be fixed with a general election as parties could be picked for the type of brexit people want. Nobody wants a 2nd referendum as its un-democratic. Give us a general election to kick out mps blocking what the public voted for.",
