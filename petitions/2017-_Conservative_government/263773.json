Furthermore, another BBC article stated that 40% of 22-29 year-olds had less than \u00a31000 in savings. With cuts to public services I think the government has a responsibility to help people provide their own safety nets.\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48354692 \r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45744552",
        "background": "A recent UN report claimed there are 14 million people in the UK living in poverty. While definitions of poverty vary, I believe a key underlying issue is the lack of education with regards to money management. A skill that I'm sure the majority of UK adults would agree is an essential life skill.",
