        "additional_details": "Many leisure centres have vending machines full of snacks high in sugar in the reception/waiting area. The  NHS strongly suggests us to reduce sugar for our children. I strongly believe that is not  right to put sugar in front of a tired child and have to tell them that you shouldn't have it. One in four children in the UK is overwight.",
        "background": "If I take my children to swimming pool or a gymnastic class is because I want them to be healthy and not have them see just in front of them high sugar snacks that are many times present in the reception/waiting area. What is going to be: the big tantrum for a no sugar or the sugary treat.",
