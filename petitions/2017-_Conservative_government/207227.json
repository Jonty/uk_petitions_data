They differ from Myanmar\u2019s dominant Buddhist groups ethnically, linguistically, and religiously.\r\n\r\nThe government refuses to grant the Rohingya citizenship, as a result they have no legal documentation, effectively making them stateless. Myanmar\u2019s 1948 citizenship law was already exclusionary, and the military junta, which seized power in 1962, introduced a law twenty years later stripping the Rohingya of access to full citizenship.",
