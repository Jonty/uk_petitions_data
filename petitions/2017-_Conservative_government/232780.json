        "additional_details": "Examples of successful Eco Bridges are in The Netherlands (over 66 crossings), Australia, Germany, California, Florida, Canada and many more. All have been successful in increasing numbers in wildlife.\r\nThe 4 ways that roads negatively impact wildlife: 1 decrease in habitat, 2 increase mortality due to wildlife-vehicle collisions, 3 prevent access to resources on the other side of the road, and 4 they subdivide wildlife populations into smaller and more vulnerable sub-populations.",
        "background": "We should be funding safe alternatives for animals to pass over or under our busy dangerous roads. We build these roads through their habitats and offer nothing to prevent thousands of animals deaths occurring each year. Something must be done to help protect our struggling wildlife population.",
