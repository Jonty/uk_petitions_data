They charge for works with no proof of work being carried out. This year they raised the price by 29.4% per month raising the price by \u00a353.18 a month, costing an extra \u00a3638.16 per year! The company do not carry out the agreed works properly and demand payments or legal action will be taken against home owners for non-payment. The company also do not deal with complaints efficiently. ",
