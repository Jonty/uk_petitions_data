        "additional_details": "I am a citizen, with a voice and a computer.  I just can't continue to pass the increasing number of people on the street and try to give them change for a cup of tea without recognising that the problem needs to be tackled strategically/politically.  I also worked as a health visitor and saw first hand how many families don,t have consistent access to meals.  The problem is huge and needs a strategic response at a national level.  Food, clothes and shelter for all is not too much to ask.",
        "background": "Poverty is a very real phenomonon for many in the UK today and the inequality gap between the rich and the poor continues to widen. Lets underline the boundaries of our civilisation. Too many people will sleep in the street this winter. Lets end homelessness and hunger in the UK, 1 meal at a time.",
