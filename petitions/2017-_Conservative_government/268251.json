        "additional_details": "When buying food in a supermarket it is difficult to make environmentally conscious choices because as a consumer, we are not informed of the impact of the food we buy. The CO2 produced per g is not a perfect indicator of the environmental impact of a food as plastic packaging, other greenhouse gases and many other factors can increase a product's environmental impact. Nonetheless, it is a step in the right direction and it would help consumers make more educated choices in aid of the planet.",
        "background": "Supermarkets are legally required to display the calories, sugar, fat and salt content of foodstuffs sold to help British people stay healthy. Now, so people and the planet can stay healthy, it should be mandatory for the CO2/g produced to be clearly displayed on a packet.",
