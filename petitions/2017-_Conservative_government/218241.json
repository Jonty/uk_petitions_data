        "additional_details": "Not allowing them to take their devices to school would promote their conversational skills (they would be forced to talk to one another), allow them to focus more on their lessons, stop contact with parents during the day (we are busy with work and do not need the worry) and reduce online bullying.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s about time the UK Government woke up to this epidemic of device use at school and started to realise what effect it is having on the working force of tomorrow.  Let\u2019s do something now!",
        "background": "Our children are struggling at school. They are distracted by the thrill of social media via their mobile device. This must stop so why allow them to take the device onto school grounds?  If they have a problem at school, or we need to contact them urgently, we should go via the school office.",
