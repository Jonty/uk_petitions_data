Before I can get more assessments & appeal  I need the completed review returned. I will soon need to apply for secondary school & if I do not have the correct updated legal info she will not get the help she needs. The LA's have a legal obligatory duty of care that was set by the government. They are not adhering to the rules, regulations and procedures in the majority of cases brought to them.",
        "background": "SEN kids need EHCP's. Each submission new or review has a 20 week process time. We ensure paperwork is complete and returned within  time frame given but LA's do not follow suit. Every school & parent says the same. ALL have urgent needs as SEN kids NEED additional support due to their disabilities.",
