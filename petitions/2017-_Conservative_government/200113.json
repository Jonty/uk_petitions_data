Having these extra weeks helped me bond with the baby instead of never seeing her due to work. Here's my story:\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/mt-yyjEotE0\r\n\r\nThis is something that benefits both the mother and the father, and is incredibly important for bonding in the early stages of a babies life.",
        "background": "2 weeks is not enough time to help with the mother and bond with the baby. 4 weeks should easily be the minimum to give dad's a better chance to bond and give the mother more support.",
