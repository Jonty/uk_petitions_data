        "additional_details": "Theresa May has achieved one thing in the past three years. She has united remainers and brexiteers against her deal. No one wants it. MPs don\u2019t want it, remainers don\u2019t want it and those who voted leave don\u2019t either.\r\nPlease listen Mrs May, we don\u2019t want your deal. It\u2019s time to take it off the table, your deal is dead.",
        "background": "Theresa May is making our country a global laughing stock and is making a mockery of Parliamentary Sovereignty. The word of our elected MPs is important and should be heard. They speak for us. She is ignoring them time and time again. Enough is enough.",
