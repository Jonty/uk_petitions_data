        "additional_details": "We are now in a situation where the regulating body, CAA, says that cost sharing with people found online is perfectly acceptable, and a brilliant way for people to build their hours whilst both passenger and pilot contribute to the cost, as long as no profit is made. \r\nUnfortunately, aircraft insurers are not insuring cost sharing flights as they don't see it as being private aircraft usage, even though it is no different to just taking up a friend and splitting the cost.",
        "background": "Recently, the Civil Aviation Authority released guidance that cost sharing websites, such as Wingly, are perfectly legal, and are just a way of sharing the joys (and costs) of aviation. Now, Insurers are taking it upon themselves to make cost sharing more difficult for pilots and passengers alike",
