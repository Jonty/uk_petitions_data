        "additional_details": "Even among Stonewall\u2019s own staff, people who dedicate themselves to the betterment and improved health of our community, 86% have experienced mental health issues first-hand. \r\n\r\nChildren need to be educated on LGBTQ+ issues to make them aware that it is normal, so kids, like myself, don't grow up thinking it's wrong. Mental health needs to be in education so they know when the way they're feeling is not normal and that speaking out is healthy. \r\n\r\nMental health is a killer. Education is the cure.",
