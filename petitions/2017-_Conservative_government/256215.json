        "additional_details": "This is how our democracy is meant to work. We, the people, are represented in the house and should keep the pressure on that house to keep it inline. all too often the British public allows Westminster to play games with the people.\r\n\r\nWe need to take control of the Brexit mess we see ourselves in and that requires to either have a 2nd referendum or to try reaffirming our parliamentary mandate.\r\n\r\nIf the result is hung then the results will be weighed against other voting systems, such as PR to avoid further coalitions of chaos.",
        "background": "The hung parliament we have now is unable to break the Brexit deadlock. If we can not have a 2nd referendum on Brexit, then we the people demand the calling of a general election make a clear mandate of whom we want to decide the details of Brexit.",
