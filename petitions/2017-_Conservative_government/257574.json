        "additional_details": "We call upon Parliament to add memory difficulties as a disability to the Disability Discrimination Act, obliging service providers to make adjustments for such individuals. Multiple methods of technological identify verification exist that do not require memorization, and if none are applicable, individuals may be offered traditional non-computerized equivalent services which do not require technological verification.",
        "background": "As a result of Increasing mandatory computerization of services and the insistence that memory tests constitute identity verification, those with memory difficulties - especially the elderly - are denied service or even accused of fraud, causing great distress and actually increasing fraud risk.",
