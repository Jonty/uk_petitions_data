        "additional_details": "Those with learning difficulties, mental health issues, dementia and many other people are unjustly suffering  at the hands of unscrupulous individuals who, due to the lack of adequate safeguards, believe they can abuse and bully without fear of facing the consequences.\r\n\r\nAn independent office would ensure that complaints are investigated by a separate body and not the organization involved with the complaint. \r\n\r\nVulnerable people deserve justice the same as everyone else.",
        "background": "The frequent disclosures about abuse of all kinds of people who are vulnerable clearly demonstrates the failure of existing controls.  An independent body is needed to investigate complaints and enforce the measures needed to resolve the problems identified.",
