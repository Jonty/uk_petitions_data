        "additional_details": "100s of 1000s of children here in the UK use sign language or signing systems to aid communication. I strongly believe that if all primary schools promote a sign of the day/week children will learn the basic word signs. This doesn\u2019t have to cost, it can be done in person or using videos. it won\u2019t take time as it can only take less than a minute each time in assembly/registration. I know schools can choose to teach sign but it should be compulsory. How can inclusion ever be down to choice!",
        "background": "This can be simply a sign of the day/week shown in assembly or registration & doesn\u2019t need to take up precious time/money. My brother is my inspiration, he has severe disabilities and uses sign to support his speech and communication. Nobody should be socially isolated due to communication barriers!",
