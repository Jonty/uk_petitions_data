Add these \u201cnormal\u201d obstacles which is enough to cause mental health problems to existing mental health problems that many young people have, they become extremely vulnerable and high risk to self harm and even suicide. Please create a better mental health provision for them.",
        "background": "We have a child and adolescent mental health services and adult mental health services but no special provisions for our most vulnerable age group 14-25 year olds. The jump between CAMHs and Adult services for 18 year olds is too sudden and does more damage than help. Mental illness needs more care.",
