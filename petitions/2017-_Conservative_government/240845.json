They also do hugs and kissing on way back to their home openly. There is only school classroom from where they get intraction or familarity to each other.\r\n\r\nWe humbly request to allow separate girls and boys classes in primary and secondary schools.There are many independent girls only school in England but no state girls only school.",
        "background": "Little immature girls and boys should not study together in one small room with close distance. As such by free mixing of little boys and girls they become friends. We being muslim can't bear any friendship between boys and girls. We want modest educational environment for our little girls and boys.",
