        "action": "Make it illegal for any part of the NHS to be run by any private company.",
        "additional_details": "As private companies are run for profit they will try cheaper forms of treatment instead of the more expensive treatment with a higher chance of success. In Swindon when paediatric services where handed to Virgin, waiting lists where wiped clean without parents or GPs being informed. This meant that a large number of children suffered unnecessarily to make Virgin look efficient. Taking on NHS staff, it's impossible to provide the same service cheaper so you can only get a lesser service.",
        "background": "All medical services provided by the NHS should only be run by the NHS. Handing them to private companies only encourages them being run for profit and not provide best practice or best medical solutions for the patient. In the long run this actually costs more.",
