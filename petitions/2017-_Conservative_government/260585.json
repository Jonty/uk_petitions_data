        "additional_details": "The UK needs to join the rest of the world and legalise electric scooters and other portable electric vehicles to ensure a greener future for urban mobility.\r\n\r\nIn my recent holiday to Paris I noticed how well E-scooters were utilised to get in and around the city and I couldn't believe that an outdated UK law is not only stopping us from cutting down on our cost of commute, but also a barrier to innovation and technology.",
        "background": "Global Action Plan found that London is the worst UK city for costs to the NHS from pollution from cars and vans, totalling \u00a3605m. To get people out of cars and off our strained public transport system we need to allow viable eco-friendly alternatives for people to get around.",
