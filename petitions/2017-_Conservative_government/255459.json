It isn't given by Parliament, so Parliament can't take it away. In any case, we can't accept petitions asking for an honour to be taken away from someone. MPs use the term honourable to refer to each other in the House of Commons, but it isn't a formal title that can be removed.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign this petition, which calls for MPs to be able to call each other by their names only:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231250"
