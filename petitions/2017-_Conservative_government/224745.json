This size isn\u2019t even enough for a 1 Guinea pig never mind 2\r\n\r\nThe stores dont handle the animals daily. The hamsters are in enclosures far too small with too many in together.\r\n\r\nThe store focuses too much on the ore common pets like dogs or cats and not enough attention on the small animals or reptiles. Enough is enough. Would you treat your dog like they treat furries?",
