        "additional_details": "In the absence of such an agreement, the UK should not leave the EU. We cannot accept that the important rights of where UK citizens can live, work, study and retire are restricted by Brexit. We ask this to protect the rights and freedom of all British citizens, including those who were too young to vote in 2016 and future generations. Restricting this freedom and these important rights is not acceptable in a modern democracy.",
        "background": "We ask that the UK only leaves the EU if, by Brexit day, an agreement has been reached with the EU that keeps the freedom of movement rights of all British citizens (wherever they live) with the current terms and conditions. We refer here to the rights to live, work, study and retire in the EU.",
