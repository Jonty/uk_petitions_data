        "additional_details": "Police, teachers, and even down to care workers, supermarket staff, cannot use a mobile while, doing their duty of work, as it would be viewed as undermining their commitment, and performance, why should MP\u2019s be allowed to do such, they are supposed to be in a trusted position to run our country efficiently, and that cannot be achieved by being distracted on mobiles, their is a ban on using a mobile while driving as it affects concentration, so remove the right from MP\u2019s while in session",
        "background": "Due to the current turmoil in the United Kingdom over brexit, and the debates in parliament, It is increasingly obvious that when viewing on television, most MP\u2019S always on mobiles most of the public can\u2019t use mobiles at work. Let\u2019s ban MP\u2019s so they have full attention on matters being discussed.",
