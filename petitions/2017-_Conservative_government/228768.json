        "additional_details": "Farthinghoe has been in need of a bypass for more than 20 years but the funds and political will have not been available.\r\n\r\nLast year there was a consultation and a route chosen.\r\n\r\nIt isn't sensible to spend money re-opening a road which isn't fit for purpose. Public funds should be spent instead on creating a safe and sustainable solution in the form of a bypass.\r\n\r\nThe road passes within feet of Farthinghoe village primary school and the children are much safer thanks to the closure.",
        "background": "The recent road closure at Farthinghoe provides the occasion to finally address the problem of heavy traffic passing dangerously through this lovely village.",
