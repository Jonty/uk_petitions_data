        "additional_details": "Calculations are based off of money you don't have ie you have a gross income of \u00a33300 per month (which cms will use to calculate) however you're actually getting \u00a32600 net income. A huge \u00a3700 difference. \r\nA child you pay for is worth \u00a3300 a month yet the children in your own home are work \u00a310 a month each!\r\nPeople have committed suicide due to cms calculations and pushing them.",
        "background": "We currently calculate child maintenance on the paying parents income before tax based in income they do not have but rather 20-40% less. Many parents are left unable to live and go to lengths such as suicide. Yes pay for your child but it has to be fair. Also children within their home suffer too.",
