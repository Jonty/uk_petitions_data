        "additional_details": "We suggest further that every voter state both a first and a second choice.   It is time, both in parliament and as a nation, that we accept that we must work with people with whom we disagree.\r\n\r\nIf the government succeeds in negotiating an alternative deal with the EU before October 31, then parliament should decide which deal to offer to the people on the referendum.\r\n\r\nAnyone objecting to this suggestion cannot truly believe that the will of the people is paramount.",
        "background": "Extending article 50 still leaves parliament divided, and after an election the next parliament may be as unable to reach an agreement as the current one.  A referendum that offers a choice between a hard Brexit, May\u2019s plan, and revoke article 50, is one whose result can be implemented.",
