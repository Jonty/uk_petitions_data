At the moment, we are dealing with the exceptionally large number of petitions that were started following the petition to \"Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU\", which gathered over 6,000,000 signatures. That large number of petitions means that dealing with petitions is taking slightly longer. \r\n\r\nYou might like to sign and share one of these petitions: \r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/256356  \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/235185\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234179\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/254329 \r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233104\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234393\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241054\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233020\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/243477\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233622\r\n\r\n"
