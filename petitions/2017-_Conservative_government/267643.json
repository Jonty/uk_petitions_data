The UK has good relations with most African countries, but it needs to be recognised that no single issue does more damage to the image or influence of the UK in Africa than this visa question.\u201d",

It's inaccessible to many Africans, under resourced, unaccountable & widely perceived as biased or even discriminating against Africans. We want the government to investigate this & enforce the same rules and critieria for all nationalities.",
