        "additional_details": "Legalising cannabis and marijuana for both medicinal and recreational use would bring thousands of new jobs to the economy, it would make the country billions of pounds each year and would even aid the war on drugs by taking illegal and black market cannabis off the table. It is the future and I believe that legalising both uses is the only way forward if the government want to help fight drugs on the streets of the UK.",
