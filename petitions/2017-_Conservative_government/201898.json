        "background": "Theresa May has today pledged \u00a310bn (unfunded) for Help-to-Buy. This will increase housing demand, not supply, adding further to the unaffordable property bubble. It ignores the systemic issues in Britain\u2019s housing sector and will likely help those that need it least.",
