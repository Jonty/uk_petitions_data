        "additional_details": "I believe this because half term is time for relaxing and spending time with family and friends rather than homework. Students are already stressed and anxious enough about getting homework in on time following half terms without increasing stress levels. My point is that homework should not be due in the first week back after half term or a PH day. It's fine to set it before half term due at least a week after the first day back so students have enough time to complete it without pressure.",
        "background": "I believe all homework for primary and secondary schools should be discarded and banned over half terms (>1 week) and long weekends (34 days due to public holidays or inset days)",
