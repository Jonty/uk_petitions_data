        "additional_details": "The BBC's have angered many of its viewers. There are many countries in Europe & in the world that trade with EU without membership. It has exaggerated an unrealistic threat to the livelihoods upon leaving the EU. It has always reported in favour of the EU, against the government position and in deed the position of the will of the people, that was democratically expressed in the referendum. EU has repeatedly denied to address the concerns of UK. Most MPs fail to see it & represent the people!",
        "background": "The BBC never seems to report the lies, the falsehood & the unrealistic threat upon leaving the EU. It fails reporting the rejections of UK concerns by EU over the past many years, even before the referendum. The repeated rejection of the UK people has lead to the referendum & the present situation.",
