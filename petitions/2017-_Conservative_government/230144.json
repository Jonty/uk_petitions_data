        "additional_details": "His first commentary was in 1948 at the age of 25 in an amateur capacity and only becoming a full time commentator at the age of 55. He joined the army in 1942 rising to the rank of Captain and then followed a career in advertising. \r\nKnighting Murray Walker would be a very popular move by UK Government and petition that would be very well supported. \r\nMr Walker is now 95 and Sir Murray Walker would be just and deserved.",
        "background": "Murray Walker has become a national treasure after starting his full time  broadcasting career at 55 years of age. He became the voice of Formula One not just in the UK but on the F1 world stage. He received an OBE in 2009.",
