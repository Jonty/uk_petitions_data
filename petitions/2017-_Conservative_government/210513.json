There are suitably qualified doctors waiting to join NHS but prevented by no VISA\r\n4. Doctors are working under unfair conditions and should not be forced to work 7 days a week.\r\n5. The burden of PFIs and PF2s are unfairly placed on individual trusts. The Govt. should take out capital loans as they are cheaper in long term. Existing ones should be bought out.",
        "background": "1. Re-introduce SEN nurses to fill current vacancies\r\n2. Re-introduce a bursary for nurses qualifying via university degree\r\n3. Grant VISAs for Drs and GPs waiting to come to UK\r\n4. Reverse the 'new' contracts forced on hospital doctors\r\n5. Confirm that no further PFIs or PF2s will be agreed",
