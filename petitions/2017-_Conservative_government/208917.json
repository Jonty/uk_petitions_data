        "action": "Stop reducing child maintenance monies by allowing travel expenses to be claimed",
        "additional_details": "Child maintenance is normally sought via the CMO as a last resort when other avenues have been explored for fairness for the child. The key focus for resident and non resident parent should be THE CHILD and providing financial and emotional stability as if you hadn\u2019t separated.  This claiming process looks to add conflict. Child maintenance was set up to aid THE CHILD. The non-resident could chose to move away 100\u2019s of miles away yet the child would be monetarily disadvantaged as a result.",
        "background": "Did you know that when child maintenance monies are awarded through the CMO (previously CSA) they allow the non resident parent to claim travel expenses (regardless of how far they wish to move away) against the child maintenance award thus lowering it further. Stop disadvantaging our children.",
