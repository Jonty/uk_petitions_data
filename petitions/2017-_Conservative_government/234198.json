        "action": "Hold a second EU membership referendum, including votes at 16",
        "additional_details": "For the Scottish independence referendum, the franchise was extended to include votes at 16 as the Scottish parliament understood how much it's going to affect their future.

        "background": "Around 1.5 million people aged 16 or 17 were excluded from voting in a referendum which is going to greatly impact their future. It's undemocratic for the government to completely ignore the opinion of these very capable people - we should have a say!",
