        "additional_details": "I received a devastating letter from the Pennine Lancashire Neuropsychology Service on the 6th October 2017, informing me that the service has been closed. The referrals from Lancashire has been passed to Preston, but Preston is NOT commissioned to cover Pennine Lancashire. I\u2019ve tried to contact my local CCG but not got anywhere. This is unacceptable as it is a very necessary service that gives people the treatment we desperately need! Please support me in getting the service back.",
