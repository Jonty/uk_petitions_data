        "additional_details": "Meningitis is difficult to spot - 49% of children with the most common type of bacterial meningitis are sent home after a first GP visit. Parents/carers of these children should be given 'safety netting' information about meningitis and sepsis to protect their child.\r\n\r\nParents want consistent information and safety netting reduces GP re-attendance. \r\n\r\nAn audit of NICE Guideline CG102 and Quality Standard QS19 will determine if safety netting information is offered and help improve outcomes.",
        "background": "30% of young babies with bacterial meningitis receive inappropriate pre-hospital management, which results in delays in getting help. An audit of national guidelines is key to improving early diagnosis and survival.",
