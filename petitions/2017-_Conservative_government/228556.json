Retrain magistrates and CPS",
        "background": "The effects of Domestic Violence are far reaching and do not stop at the physical abuse, the victims often lose their jobs, homes, friends and mental health, often resulting in diagnoses of PTSD, anxiety, stress and depression.\r\nThese crimes should be dealt with more severely with longer sentences",
