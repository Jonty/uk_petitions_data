        "additional_details": "This could be managed by advertising an email address to report the offence. A photograph of the driver using a mobile device along with the car registration should be sufficient enough for prosecution. \r\n\r\nOn a number of occasions I have been left infuriated when passing drivers using their phones. As we all know, all it takes is one mishap to cause a serious accident. \r\n\r\nBy calling on the public It could save more lives by putting it in their hands not just the eyes of police forces.",
