        "additional_details": "We are moving in to a time where children are struggling with self love, love of others and the ability to handle emotions, not being able to handle emotions results in dissociating with them, this is why most children and adult are currently suffering. We need to teach children how to love one another for internal attributes and ensure meditation in the morning so they are ready for their day. Children work harder than we think and deserve the right care, they rest their bodies what about minds",
        "background": "The mental health and crime rates are at a controllable level if you actively put in place the right solution. Mindfulness meditation and self love and appreciation of others should be taught compulsory in schools as this could mean the difference for our next generation. This can only be positive.",
