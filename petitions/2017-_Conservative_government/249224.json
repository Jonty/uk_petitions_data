        "action": "Form a government of national unity to resolve the Brexit crisis",
        "additional_details": "In previous situations of national crisis such as World War II, partisan politics has been abandoned in favour of forming a government of national unity. We are in such a crisis, and yet the government is paralysed due to competing political interests. \r\n\r\nAll other issues are presently being sidelined due to the severity of Brexit: given this, Labour and the Conservatives must now join forces to form a government, setting aside their differences for the good of the country.",
        "background": "The partisan nature of parliamentary politics is preventing progress on Brexit. Senior politicians have expressed a view that the standard parliamentary model does not work when a single issue dominates the nation like Brexit does, and that a government of national unity is the only way forward.",
