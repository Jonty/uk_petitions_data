Dementia is an unpredictable illness where every minute, hour and day can be different and you can also not predict someone\u2019s life span. In addition to this if someone\u2019s mental well being is compromised this can contribute to worsening dementia symptoms. \r\n\r\nDementia and Healthy Living (scie.org.uk)\r\n\r\nMedical evidence should be sufficient to be automatically eligible for PIP",
        "background": "Dementia is a progressive illness with no cure, therefore terminal. When someone is diagnosed under 65 they often are in work, have family and may provide the main household income. The diagnosis itself if difficult enough, to prove the difficulties faced through an application is added pressure.",
