        "action": "Carers must be included in the key worker scheme",
        "additional_details": "The importance of affordable housing for carers has not received the attention. It is essential that carers live in all parts of our communities to provide invaluable service to the UK population which is currently experiencing a high number of old people requiring the services of the carers. Financial challenges due to Poor wages, high cost of accommodation especially in more affluent areas makes it difficult to attract and retain carers. I suggest the carers are included to the key worker scheme to support them and ensure that they provide safe and excellent services, and also make them appreciated by their govt",
        "background": "Carers are largest source of care in the UK and should be included in the key workers living scheme. Despite the govt attempts this scheme does not extend far beyond. The fact is that what constitute the term key workers is narrow and the individuals that fall outside this definition are left out.",
