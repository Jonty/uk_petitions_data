        "action": "Change the 5p charge for plastic bags to 10p and replace with bags for life",
        "additional_details": "A ten week trial by Tesco to stop selling single use 5p carrier bags and offering 10p reusable bags for life recently saw a 25% reduction in bag sales as shoppers either brought their own or purchased the more expensive bag (made from 94% recyclable material). \r\n\r\nThis move will help fewer bags needing to be sent to landfill while continuing to generate money from bag sales that goes directly to environmental charities.",
        "background": "The introduction of the 5p bag charge in 2015 reduced usage in England by 85% but there is still work to be done to minimise our negative impact on the environment, especially marine life. An increase would raise more money for charities and replacing single use with bags for life will reduce waste.",
