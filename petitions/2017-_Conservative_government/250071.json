        "additional_details": "The traffic light system used to help people make healthier food choices has already been implemented. It would not be difficult to introduce a similar system for climate impact. The climate rating should include any emissions that effect the climate (Methane, CO2 etc.) from the production of the food and also transportation to the UK if applicable.",
        "background": "The world is currently in a climate crisis. Changing our diets is a simple and convenient way of reducing our impact. Make it easy by printing the effect on the packaging. The public currently has no way of knowing which products have the worst impact on the environment.",
