        "additional_details": "This enforceable policy will also improve the often intial featureless and baron appearance of new build houses and housing estates lacking in green cover anything more than the few street trees which are sometimes planted. It will also significantly increase wildlife habitat and lower the average temperature adjacent to the houses on very hot days, especially in heatwave conditions. It will also improve visual character and people's well being significantly.",
        "background": "Britain needs to increase its tree cover to help combat climate change and increase wildlife habitat. This is already a government policy. Planting two native British trees like birch, Mountain ash, hawthorn or whitebeam in gardens of all new build houses is a simple and cheap way to achieve this",
