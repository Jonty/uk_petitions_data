        "background": "The Government still claims that cannabis has no medical benifits, despite the fact we as a country grow and distribute the most amount of \"Medical\" cannabis.\r\nThe facts are there, Cannabis is far safer than Alcohol and Tobacco. Yet we are still forced into the black market. \r\nThis is so wrong!",
