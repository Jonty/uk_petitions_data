        "additional_details": "The rules have been changed again in 2011 to restructure the Tier 2 ICT Visas. Under these rules, Tier 2 ICT Visa holders who obtain Visa after April 2011 are eligible for settlement. This petition is for enabling ILR after completion of 5 years for Established-staff category Visa holders. As this Visa holders stayed in the country for more than 6 years, but not eligible for ILR under 5 year route. The number Visas issued between April 2010 and 2011 are very less and few people are remaining in the country right now. So, please enable ILR for Established staff category Visa holders under 5 year rule.",
        "background": "As per the current rules, Tier 2 ICT Visa holders which was issued before April 2010 are eligible for ILR. In April 2010, rules have been changed and Tier 2 ICT Visa was given with the name as Established-Staff until April 2011. This Visa can be extended any number of times but not eligible for ILR.",
