        "additional_details": "Capt. Hannaford\u2019s notes, photographs, his in-depth interview at 95 for the IWM with a Channel 4 documentary highlight his belief that the bomb disposal service men and women were forgotten. Footage included other WWII bomb disposal officers telling their heroic story and acts of courage of all their servicemen. Whilst researching I discovered the most powerful evidence was a quote from our great statesman Winston Churchill who said, \"Bomb Disposal should be recognised for their dangerous work!\"",
        "background": "A watercolour began my journey of discovery leading to the heroic acts by the artist Capt. John Hannaford & his colleagues. 350 men were killed defusing, clearing bombs, UXBs, over 50,000 across the UK. Many were killed clearing mines from our beaches. They deserve official recognition.",
