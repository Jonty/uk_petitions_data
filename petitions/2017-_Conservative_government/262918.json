        "additional_details": "Human rights are not and should not be a controversial issue. So why in 2019 is same-sex marriage illegal in parts of this country? When I first started campaigning for human rights I remember being shocked at the number of countries in which equal marriage wasn\u2019t legal. It was months before I realised it applied to my country. Yet no one ever talks about it. Maybe we should.\r\n \r\nArticle 16 (Universal Declaration of Human Rights)- Men and women... without any limitation have the right to marry",
        "background": "As the Northern Ireland assembly is currently not sitting, their outdated laws on Same-Sex marriage cannot be changed. This petition would allow the government to then change the laws to match the rest of the country, a long overdue change.",
