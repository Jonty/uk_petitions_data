        "additional_details": "Licensing is the middle way between a ban (https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201443) and doing nothing (https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205672).\r\n\r\nHunting is regulated more tightly elsewhere in Europe. The Scottish Government is exploring licensing; by signing this petition you will encourage them. In England, Defra has done little to regulate driven grouse shooting and it is time it did. Legal sustainable shooting estates have nothing to fear from licensing.",
        "background": "Licensing will help end poor practice on uplands managed for driven grouse shooting, which can entail environmental damage and illegal killing of raptors, such as Hen Harriers.",
