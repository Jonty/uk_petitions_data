        "additional_details": "Childminders have a very demanding job, some of us work well over 60 hours a week as there is lots of paper work and planning to be done.  We are left with outstanding bill that parents don't pay and our own bills cant be paid as our wages are not paid by the parents\r\nthis is why they government should pay us directly instead of the money going to the parent",
        "background": "Childminders are very important as they allow parents to go to work, the government pays the parents a percentage of the childcare costs, however childminders loose every month as parents use the money and don't pay our bills, we are left chasing parents for money that we have worked for",
