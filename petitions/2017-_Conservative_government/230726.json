With the roll out of 5G we are seeing an increase in public awareness to these affects which are said to be up to 10 times higher. Our children are more susceptible to these microwave frequencies and need protecting from them.\r\nLittle research has been done by the companies and local authorities adopting these technologies in our city centres and communities.",
        "background": "5G and predecessor technologies are known to cause cancers and other ill affects in humans. An ammendment needs to be added to safeguard children from local authorities and government rolling out untested technologies which causes or is likely to cause significant harm.",

It does not cover health risks or technologies.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for more research into EMF technologies if that is something you would like to see happen."
