        "additional_details": "In most countries (throughout Europe and especially Ireland) you can really tell when an election is on because the lamp-posts, bridges and traffic railings are festooned with coloured placards and banners, often with photos of the smiling candidates.\r\n\r\nI used to be against it, but now I can really see the point in letting people feel there is something is happening.  We have gone way too far in banning these notices.  Trials should be run in selected parts of the country at the next election.",
        "background": "The laws in the UK against fly-posting are so restrictive that, unlike in most other countries, elections are totally invisible to people on the street.  Yet during the Christmas season the councils find time to put up decorations on every lamp-post to remind us that we need to keep shopping.",
