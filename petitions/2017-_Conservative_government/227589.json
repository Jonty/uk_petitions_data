This is one of many mental health issues within the UK that is unheard of and for the most part, unknown. Often overlooked as Depression or Anxiety, BPD needs both awareness and more accurate diagnoses. We hope with this petition this can become a reality.",

Those who suffer with BPD don't usually realise until late into adolescents, around 1 in 10 diagnosed end up committing suicide",
