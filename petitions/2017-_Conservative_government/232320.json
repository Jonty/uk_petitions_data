        "additional_details": "Theresa May and the accomplices have continually capitulated to EU demand and have done so without any consideration of what the public voted for in the referendum. We hear that open borders will remain, our military will still be part of PESCO and generally, any 'red line' highlight during the referendum will be ignored. We are, under current treason, to receive a Brexit in name only. This is not good enough and all those involved are to be fired and a charge of treason investigated.",
        "background": "Due to continuing serial betrayal of the People's Vote in which we voted to leave the EU completely (ie a hard Brexit), we demand that all those perspns guilty of allowing this betrayal be removed and be replaced by true patriots.",
