        "additional_details": "Hedgehogs are continuing to decline in the UK, according to a new report.Surveys by citizen scientists show hedgehog numbers have fallen by up to 95% since the turn of the century.\r\nConservation groups say they are particularly concerned about the plight of the hedgehog in towns and rural areas.Slug pellets contribute to this number.Hedgehogs are an endangered species we must do all we can to help these mammals.\r\nThere are many natural ways to curb slugs without the need for dangerous pellets.",
        "background": "Many pesticides are potentially dangerous to hedgehogs and slug pellets are no exception.  Hedgehogs may eat the pellets, and they are very likely to eat the poisoned slugs and snails. As hedgehogs are an endangered species, pellets should be banned in the UK.",
