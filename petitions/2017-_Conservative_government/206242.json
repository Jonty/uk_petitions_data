        "additional_details": "Night shifts workers are regularly paid a premium on top of a companies normal wage but for many this is not the case. Since the introduction of the NMW (which was a good thing in general, though it does require some revisions) many night shift workers are now paid the national minimum wage.\r\n\r\nI propose that workers who work between the hours of midnight and six o'clock in the morning are paid a mandatory extra \u00a32 per hour above the current national minimum wage.",
        "background": "Currently the National Minimum wage is the same regardless of the time of day or night you work. \r\n\r\nStaff who work night shift should receive a higher NMW by law.",
