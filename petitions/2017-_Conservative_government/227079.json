        "action": "State categorically that Canada has our support in its spat with Saudi Arabia.",
        "additional_details": "We should back Canada fully against Saudi Arabia and show them that they are not alone in standing up for human rights in the world. Cowardice and arms sales should never come before long term friends and relations. Many of us have family members in Canada and our history goes back all the way. How embarrassing that our government has put money before pride, morality and friends.",
        "background": "At a time when Britain is leaving the EU and restrengthening our links with our Commonwealth friends, why have we turned our back on Canada during their assault by Saudi Arabia? We share a monarchy and history, so an attack on Canada is also an attack on us and our way of life.",
