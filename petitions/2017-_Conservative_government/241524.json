        "additional_details": "However. This freedom is ruined from the sky-high prices of car insurance for young drivers, averaging at \u00a31.6k. How about if I say, in 2012 (this fact is true) , there was 146,000 personal injury collisions, with 30,750 involving one young driver- which isn\u2019t even 30% of the collisions.  Young drivers are \u2018freshly trained\u2019. Their knowledge is new, and are always learning. If we wasn\u2019t required as being safe on the roads, none of us young drivers would hold driving licenses.",
        "background": "When turning 17, driving opens up a whole new world of freedom and independence for young people. The average 17 year old would typically be living with their parents, attending college with a small weekend job bringing in some small disposable income every month to enjoy themselves.",
