        "additional_details": "In most cases the 'guardian' met the child for only a few minutes. The Children Act also claims parents have responsibilities towards their child but no rights regarding their child. As the Children Act refers to welfare of children in court hearings it is being used in court to strip parents of their Parental Rights (as affirmed in Article 8 of Human Rights Act 1998) and allow strangers such as doctors, 'guardian' and judge to decide to withdraw medical treatment and make sure the child dies.",
        "background": "In 1989 the British government adopted UN Convention on Rights of the Child suggetion and created the Children Act 1989. To make sure the welfare of the child is paramount the Act decree that a 'guardian', a complete stranger, will decide what is the best interest of a child rather than his parents.",
