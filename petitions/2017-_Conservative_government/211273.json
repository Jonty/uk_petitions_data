        "additional_details": "These children will, later in life, pay taxes as a normal citizen would, but will not benefit in the same way.\r\n\r\nAs well as this, over 3,000 children that do apply, are denied the citizenship and not refunded the \u00a3973 fee.\r\n\r\nThe right to these has been given to these children by parliament, but currently they are being sold by the home office.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the issue, you can read this article:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/534zx8/the-british-born-kids-who-cant-afford-to-be-british",
        "background": "The price for British citizenship for children is currently \u00a3973, and without this they can't vote or claim student loans. The Home Office makes over \u00a3500 profit for each application and this makes many families unable to afford citizenship. The government are putting a price on democracy.",
