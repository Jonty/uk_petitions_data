        "action": "Make Tv licences free for students studying Media and/or television.",
        "additional_details": "A lot of media students I have spoken to have also gone without a television licence which has affected their study. However, students are not willing to break the law and pay the \u00a31000 fine, just to help improve their research and their grade.",
        "background": "Living in London and being a student is expensive. That, combined with the low maintenance loans, budgeting is a big part of being a student. Paying \u00a3147 a year to watch television, that is involved in our study, means a lot of people don't have access to this resource due to their budget.",
