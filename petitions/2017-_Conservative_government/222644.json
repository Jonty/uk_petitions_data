        "additional_details": "There are three obvious ways of doing this.\r\n1: When a general election is held, who ever finishes second gets a seat in the lords, thus making parliament more democratic.\r\n2: Use the votes in a general election, and then turn them into Proportional Representation, and this would make house of lords represent votes cast.\r\n3: Every council ward appoints a representative to house of lords, this would give greater power to local government.",
        "background": "The House of Lords is unelected and thus unaccountable to the british people, and thus needs ending in its current form. While having a second chamber is necessary, it should be elected by the people and for the people.",
