        "additional_details": "Nightmare stories of cowboy builders ripping off unsuspecting customers are easily found throughout the Internet or in the media. Sometimes these customers have paid in excess of \u00a3100,000 for dangerous, faulty or incomplete work. The customer can take the builder to court but often told that as the tradesperson or Ltd company has no assets they cannot receive their money back. Its time we put an end to this culture in the building industry and eradicate cowboy builders!",
        "background": "Many homeowners are left out of pocket when building work is completed to a poor or dangerous standard, or often not completed at all. We ask for compulsory regulation and an independent ombudsman to be set up to assist these homeowners when needed and put an end to 'cowboy builders'.",
