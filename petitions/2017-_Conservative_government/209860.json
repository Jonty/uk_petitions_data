        "action": "Release the 2012 NHS reform risk Assessment.",
        "additional_details": "This petition requests that said document is released in the name of transparency.  No law was implemented to allow the government to pursue its current restructuring of the NHS and a reorganisation was guaranteed to be \"off the cards\" by the prime minister.  The current government has no mandate to reorganise the NHS and create ACOs.  We request access to the risk assessment in order to see if this was predicted prior to the 2012 HaSCA and whether the current collapse of the NHS was preventable",
        "background": "In 2012, the Health Secretary vetoed the publication of the risk assessment relating to the changes introduced in the Health and Social Care Act. The Information Commissioner's office declared that in the circumstances this was unreasonable and requested they be released.",
