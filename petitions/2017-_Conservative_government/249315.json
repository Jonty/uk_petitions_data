        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum has divided the people and our politicians. No matter how we voted with the information we had, the result was for UK to leave the EU. Any country should have the right to exist as a democratic sovereign nation and still be able to have friendly terms and trade deals with its neighbouring countries and rest of the world. Economists disagree as to the consequences  of Brexit, but any disruption and harm will be minimised if the MPs from all parties unite and support the PMs deal.",
        "background": "Prime Minister's deal may not be perfect and may not meet all our expectations, it is still the best option we have to come out of EU in an orderly manner and honouring the will of majority in 2016 referendum. Not respecting this will jeopardise the faith of British people in our democracy.",
