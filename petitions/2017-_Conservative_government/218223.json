        "action": "Make it compulsory for all new homes in England and Wales to have solar panels",
        "additional_details": "- The Government aims to build 300,000 new homes per year yet only 8,400 homes a year install solar [BEIS/HMTreasury]\r\n- 400,000 people in Britain are in fuel poverty [Citizens Advice]\r\n- The MyGridGB home with solar and battery storage has half the energy bill and carbon emissions of an average UK house. Over 65% of it's electricity comes from renewables [MyGridGB.co.uk] \r\n- Scotland already has a scheme to encourage solar on new build homes.\r\n- The average solar install costs less than \u00a34,500",
        "background": "Solar panels reduce bills by allowing homes to generate some of their own electricity. Installing solar during construction can reduce costs by over a third and with storage they can halve electricity bills. Despite this, there is no meaningful regulation forcing house builders to install solar.",
