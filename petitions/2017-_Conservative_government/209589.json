Don't abandon us now, help our veterans access this essential treatment. The NHS propose that all veterans should attend a day centre which is totally unrealistic, just ask the mental health professionals at Combat Stress. Please sign this petition!!",

The NHS  has decided to remove ALL FUNDING for the charity \u00a315M annually. This is a disgrace and an outrage as Combat Stress has the most experienced professional staff to deal with PTSD!",
