That means we can\u2019t accept a petition about releasing wolves in the whole of the UK, because the UK Government is only responsible for that in England. \r\n\r\nIt's most likely to be practical for wolves to be released in Scotland. That would be a decision for the Scottish Government to take, not the UK Government or Parliament. \r\n\r\nThe Scottish Parliament has its own Public Petitions Committee. If you'd like to send your petition to the Scottish Parliament, you can find out more here: http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/gettinginvolved/petitions/index.aspx\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling on the UK Government to allow the releasing of wolves in England, if that\u2019s what you\u2019d like to happen. The UK Government is responsible for issuing licences for the reintroduction of non-native species in England, but doesn\u2019t usually release the animals itself. Reintroduction schemes are usually run by non-governmental organisations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
