        "additional_details": "Given the recent passing of Gordon Banks, widely recognised as England's greatest ever goalscorer, I decided to start this petition to bring about a Knighthood for each member of the 1966 World Cup winning team. Sadly, posthumously in some cases.\r\n\r\nA goal scorer will not score goals without supply from their teammates and the team will not will matches if the concede more goals than they score. \r\n\r\nThe World Cup was not won by two players.",
        "background": "Football is a team game and every component part of the World Cup winning team played a role in taking home the Jules Rimet trophy. \r\nIt is grossly unfair, therefore, that the only members of that team awarded a Knighthood are Geoff Hurst and Bobby Charlton.\r\nThis should be rectified immediately.",
