        "action": "Abolish The Requirement For Purchasing A Licence To Watch Television In The UK",
        "additional_details": "Although many people now pay subscription fees to various platforms, media and channels, the law states to watch any kind of live television you must have first purchased a licence. The entirety of this fee goes to the BBC and its contractors. The BBC no longer provides a value for money service and its output isnt better nor more original than competing channels. In recent years licence payers have paid into an organisation which has been at the centre of several high profile controversies.",
        "background": "With it looking increasingly likely free TV licenses for over 75s and disabled people will be removed, it again asks the question whether it is both practical and fair that persons in the United Kingdom be required by law to purchase a licence to watch television. Surely, it is time to change.",
