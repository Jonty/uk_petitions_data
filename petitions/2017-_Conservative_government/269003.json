        "action": "Create an environmental impact indicator scheme for food products sold in the UK",
        "additional_details": "To measure the impact of each food, a full life cycle assessment would need to be carried out on a food product to assess impacts such as CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions, water usage (particularly in areas of limited supply) and land degradation from growing/farming and transporting products. The grading system output could be a score from 1-5, a grade from A-E or a traffic light system. An impact per calorie or mass of product would also be a consideration.",
        "background": "Consider climate change as a national health risk. An environmental impact based indication system on food products, similar to those indicating fats and sugar content, would allow consumers to make more educated choices regarding their diet and help to reduce their impact on climate change.",
