        "additional_details": "Im calling for all old ipp and eds sentences imposed to be rightfully reviewed as to wether a person is genuinely dangerous and that future cases are decided accordingly\r\nMy nephew was handed an eds sentence and his life is marked because of it those who know him know hes not dangerous and during his time in prison has never hurt anyone and has mentored many lads who struggle to read and write... your whole life shouldnt be determined by one person who may or may not be in a good mood on the day",
        "background": "The british justice system is severely flawed an eds sentence deems a criminal dangerous to the public ... judges are ordinary people and they make single handed decisions they arent qualified to make ... deciding an individual is dangerous should only be made by mental health professionals",
