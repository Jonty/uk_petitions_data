        "additional_details": "Fast food such as burger meals are always cheaper than healthy food. This is why people tend to not eat healthy as they cannot afford such a lifestyle. By reducing tax you are giving back to the people, an option to improve health.\r\n\r\nIf the UK government cut tax on healthy food, more people will buy it and live healthy and in the coming generations there could be less load on the NHS by healthy living. Conditions such as diabetes and heart attacks could be reduced by lifestyle changes.",
        "background": "The UK Government has introduced sugar tax which does not really address the issue. NHS overstretched & overworked.\r\n\r\nMost health issues can be avoided by eating healthy, however it's too expensive for the working class and the poor to buy healthy food.",
