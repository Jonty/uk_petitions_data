        "additional_details": "Environmentalists have warned that a growing trend to lay artificial lawns instead of real grass threatens the loss of wildlife and habitat across Britain.\r\nMathew Frith, director of conservation at the London Wildlife Trust, said: \u201cYou are using fossil fuels to make it, so there is a carbon impact there, you have to remove a significant amount of soil to lay it so you are reducing the direct and indirect porosity of the soil, you are removing habitat which a wide range of species are dependent on and at the end of its life this is a non-biodegradable product which ultimately goes back into landfill.",
        "background": "Biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate, yet we are seeing an increase in the installation of artificial grass across the UK. This needs to stop if we are to give nature a helping hand against the many threats which it already faces.",
