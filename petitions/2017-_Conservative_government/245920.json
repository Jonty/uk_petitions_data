        "additional_details": "It\u2019s important to have that help put in place. So many people may seem like everything is ok when it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve started this petition for mandatory check up appointments after a person has been to therapy. To check on a person\u2019s health and where their mindset is. This appointment could be every 6 months so that person who is struggling knows the help is there and can go back into system of doing counselling if they are still struggling. This is something I really want to see make a difference.",
        "background": "As mental health is becoming more of a isssue it\u2019s important to make sure we have the best support possible to help with dealing with suicide especially. E.g, help from therapists after they\u2019ve finished their counselling to have mandatory check up appointments to see how their progress has been.",
