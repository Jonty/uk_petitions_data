        "additional_details": "Sickle Cell patients struggle to qualify for benefits as the requirements don't seem to cater to disabilities that include intermittent asymptomatic states. SC patients also require lifelong monthly prescriptions. As many patients are unable to work, this is an extra financial burden that is stressful. If this burden can be lifted, it will contribute somewhat to a slightly better quality of life for people who already suffer so greatly.",
        "background": "Sickle Cell Anaemia: genetically inherited haematological condition. Patients suffer acute chronic pain affecting the bones & joints caused by vaso-occlusion, ischaemic injury, high risk of infection & stroke. Stress, low temperature & physical activity are a few of the triggers of this condition.",
