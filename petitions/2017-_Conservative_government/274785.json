        "action": "Stop the Government\u2019s lying adverts about the UK leaving the EU on 31st October.",
        "additional_details": "These adverts are false propaganda designed to give the impression that the Government is getting on with Brexit by 31st October despite time and the law making this impossible. Parliament cannot hold the government to account due to the prorogue so this petition could illustrate further why Government acting without Parliamentary scrutiny is entirely wrong. Complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority could be ignored as this body doesn\u2019t cover political matters.",
        "background": "The Government is spending many millions on adverts telling people to \u201cget ready for Brexit on 31st October\u201d.  In reality there isn\u2019t enough time to ratify a deal and \u201cno deal\u201d is illegal, forcing the Government to ask for an extension. This means the adverts are not honest or truthful.",
