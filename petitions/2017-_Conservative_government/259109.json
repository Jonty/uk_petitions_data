In most cases, it\u2019s the impact that a health condition has on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for support or protection under the law. \r\n\u202f \r\nYou can find out more about showing that you're disabled under the Equality Act here:\u202f\u202f\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for a Government funded campaign to raise awareness of vestibular conditions if that is something you would like to see happen."
