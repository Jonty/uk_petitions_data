        "additional_details": "We want to;\r\n\r\n- Ensure the 6 million people missing from the register are included,\r\n\r\n- Save time and money by using an automatic system, similar to the National Insurance system,\r\n\r\n- Take down an unnecessary barrier to democracy,\r\n\r\n- Ensure everyone has a voice.\r\n\r\nFor more information on how the policy could work, read our in-depth policy analysis here: https://talk-politics.com/policy-analysis-automatic-voter-registration/",
        "background": "TalkPolitics is calling for the electoral register to be operated on an 'opt-out' basis, rather than 'opt-in'. We are calling for all UK citizens to be automatically added to the electoral register before their 18th birthday.",
