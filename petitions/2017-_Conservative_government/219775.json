        "additional_details": "A good breeder only has pups if asked, I know one and they are in total agreement on this.   \r\nThey have a web page but don\u2019t sell pups on it.  People get their pups,either through the kennel club or word of mouth.\r\nThere\u2019s no way of regulating this, it\u2019s a great outlet for those who just see these  animals as objects to make money from.  The only way to help put a stop to it altogether is to make it illegal!! \r\nOnline is mainly how puppy farming, back yard breeders sell the manly sickly pups they breed.\r\n People\u2019s pets are mainly stolen to either sell online or backyard breed from them.",
        "background": "This would drastically cut down this crime and animals being sourced as bait.   Rescues don\u2019t sell, but charge a fee, in most cases won\u2019t cover the vets bills.  Rescue are full to bursting, due to all these criminals who steal pets etc. I\u2019m a member of many who\u2019ll back me on this.",
