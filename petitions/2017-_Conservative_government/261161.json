        "additional_details": "Before creating this petition, I have read countless stories about Year Six children experiencing anxiety about SATs testing, and no child of this age should have to go through this.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways for the government to measure a school\u2019s performance, such as Ofsted inspections that reflect all year groups. \r\n\r\nRespected bloggers are advising parents about helping kids cope with mental health issues during SATs - this speaks volumes! https://matr.org/blog/sats-mental-wellbeing-for-parents/",
        "background": "10 and 11-year-olds are being subjected to examinations in the form of SATs that are more about gauging the performance of schools than anything else. \r\n\r\nI strongly believe that these tests are having a negative effect on their mental health due to the stress that they can cause.",
