        "additional_details": "Too many children nowadays are so worried about their weight it\u2019s disgusting, websites should be held accountable for the way their content promotes self-harm and eating disorders.\r\n\r\nProtecting young people from online adult content is one thing, but continuing to promote self-harm, anorexia and bulimia is just as bad.\r\n\r\nI believe any website or blog that promotes these things whether Facebook, tumblr, Twitter, Instagram should be held accountable by a new law.",
        "background": "As someone who has seen friends struggle with eating disorders, it is horrible to see how easy it is to find pro Ana blogs and diets on tumblr and other websites. I think it should be illegal for websites to publish material that promotes self-harming and eating disorders.",
