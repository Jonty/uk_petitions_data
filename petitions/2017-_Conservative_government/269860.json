        "additional_details": "When the plastic straws trend was growing on social media it helped me to see how clueless we are about the real plastic waste. I invested more into the situation and found out that plastic straws only take up 0.03% of the oceans plastic waste. \r\n \r\nWhen I heard about ghost fishing I knew what i wanted to do about it, and that was to ban plastic fishing nets. The Government should also encourage other countries to do the same.",
        "background": "Plastic fishing nets (ghost fishing) is killing our oceans. A recent study found that fishing nets made up around 46% of the oceans plastic. This percentage will only increase if we do not put a stop to it.",
