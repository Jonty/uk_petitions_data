        "additional_details": "GCSEs have recently been reformed to be assessed \u2018mainly by exams\u2019 and to contain \u2018more demanding content\u2019, but many teenagers are suffering as a result. We need a limit on the amount of GCSEs we can be made to sit (I had to sit more than double the amount that my college requires) and we need coursework to be brought back. It\u2019s not fair that many of us have to put our mental health on the line as the cost for good grades.",
        "background": "I\u2019ve had to sit 24 exams this GCSE exam season. It is scary how many of my peers have suffered from things like suicidal thoughts, self harm, anxiety, and panic attacks. We want less exams, less pressure and we want going to school to be more about learning and not about doing exams.",
