        "additional_details": "The majority of services tend to treat people for their Autism Spectrum Condition or their mental health condition, failing to recognise the complex dynamic between the two. Therefore it is vital for all mental health practitioners to undergo mandatory Autism Awareness Training.\r\n\r\nThe AutismMentalHealthCampaign is to raise awareness and promote an understanding of the mental states of those on the spectrum, with an aim for services to establish the link between Autism and Mental Health Conditions",
        "background": "Autism Spectrum Condition itself is not classified as a mental health condition, however there is a link between the two. An added mental health condition can enhance and intensify pre-existing autistic traits \u2013 therefore it is essential to have support in place.",
