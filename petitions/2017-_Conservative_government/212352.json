        "action": "Change the British military's standard issue rifle to the C8/L119",
        "additional_details": "Already a proven rifle, the swap would increase the effectiveness of a single infantry soldier in a firefight. The similarities to the US M4 would also allow spare parts to be used between us and our most powerful ally, and allow soldiers to pick up each other's weapons, for whatever reason, and already be used to an extremely similar one.",
        "background": "The British military's current rifle, the SA80/L85, is completely outclassed by the Colt Canada C8SFW Carbine, with its higher stopping power and rate of fire, already in use by special forces, the Royal Military Police and Royal Marine 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group",
