        "additional_details": "The Brexiteer rallying call of Sovereignty needs to be explained in terms of the benefits we lose to the benefits we gain. Woolly and vague comments like chart our own trading future, need to be drilled down to a workable plan. There is an expectation that we will do a positive trade deal with Trump, given Trump\u2019s isolationist policy that just won\u2019t happen. China is going the same direction. This is the wrong time to be charting our own trading future.\r\nOn the 23rd of June 2016, the UK went to the polls, ill-informed and dangerously misled by politicians on both sides.\r\nOur Government are not demonstrating leadership.",
        "background": "We know what we currently have, it\u2019s not perfect but it works. Our current position inside the EU, gives us commerce and therefore jobs by which we can put Bread on the Table. The EU regulations and standards give us the highest quality, most efficient products in the world, which are safe.",
