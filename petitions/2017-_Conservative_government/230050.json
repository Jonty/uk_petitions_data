        "additional_details": "In our local NHS hospital a large multinational retailer only sells plastic bottled drinks.\r\nA local chain of bakeries only sells drinks in plastic bottles.\r\nThere is already too much recyclable plastic that isn't recycled in the world. Drinks bottles use New plastic, not recycled plastic. Cutting down on New plastic for these drinks bottles will cut down the plastic that will then enter into the environment. \r\nQuicker, and easier to implement that a plastic bottle refund scheme.",
        "background": "Plastic is causing catastrophic effects in the environment we all live in. \r\nSo why do many large, and small High Street retailers still sell ONLY plastic bottles of drinks? \r\nIf there is a choice, people will be able to choose to not have plastic. The % should increase 10% each year for 4 years.",
