Mental health is a disability and needs to be considered a serious condition that needs more ways to help. Not everyone is able to attend therapy sessions with a one to one talk or group therapy sessions. A therapy dog would help those with mental health problems, have a dog to sit with on the plane, Go places to feel safe. A dog that cuddles you when you\u2019re upset",
