        "additional_details": "Over 1/4 of young people have developed mental health issues due to the pressures the exam board are putting on to them, and nothing is being done about it! It\u2019s very unfair that the main way people are being judged is based on a number on a piece of paper. It\u2019s disgusting to think that some children go home and don\u2019t want to go back to school because they have been brainwashed into thinking GCSE\u2019s determine the rest of your life. Something needs to be done about this, please.",
        "background": "GCSE\u2019s have become a memory test and have taken over lives of young people. Due to this many are developing mental health issues. Introducing coursework across all subjects can allow people to be graded on their actual abilities rather than how well they can remember 5 years worth of information.",
