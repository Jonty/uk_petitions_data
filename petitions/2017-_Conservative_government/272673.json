However there is no consensus about how to move forward.  Parliament is there to represent the people and it is time for the people to choose who they want to represent them.",
        "background": "The people no longer have confidence in the present parliament as the Government no longer has a majority in the House of Commons. We need a vote to change parliament.  The people want to choose who goes to the European Council on 17th October 2019, whether that be Jeremy Corbyn or Boris Johnson.",
