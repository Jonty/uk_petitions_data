        "additional_details": "I understand it is so difficult for mums to take that leap back to work when childcare costs so much money!!! Unless you're unemployed or less hours you don't seem to be entitled to anything. Nurseries then have the right to charge for days the nursery is closed. Including Bank Holidays, training days & other. Some of us working parents that don't have family then have to pay out double fees or have to take annual or unpaid leave for this facility. It's another penalty that should not be allowed.",
        "background": "I am a full time working parent, I have been since my daughter was 9 months old. I have paid in the region of \u00a31300-950 a month for my child to attend full time nursery. Nurseries still have the right to charge full fees when closed or Bank holidays. Which means double fees or unpaid/annual leave.",
