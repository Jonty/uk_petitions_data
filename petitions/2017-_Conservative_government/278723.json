A 1977 Law Commission report found that \"[t]here is probably no offence properly described as \"sedition\" in English law\" and \" there is likely to be a sufficient range of other offences covering conduct amounting to sedition\".\r\n\r\nYou can read the report here: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2016/08/No.072-Codification-of-the-Criminal-Law-Treason-Sedition-and-Allied-Offences.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
