        "action": "Reform the Veterans UK system. Reduce timescales for new claims and appeals.",
        "additional_details": "The current system is unfit for purpose. Veterans are waiting for far too long and are regularly having their claims rejected only to be overturned at Tribunals. This system needs a complete reform. Veterans are battling for years to get what they are entitled to. Those not in a position to fight just fall through the gaps and are forgotten about. There is no ownership of cases and the whole system is completely impersonal and inefficient. Veterans have spent a career being used to efficiency, strict standards of discipline and performance and if they are injured, they are faced with this woeful system. It has to stop.",
        "background": "I have experience of this this system and find it inefficient, uncaring, under resourced and focused on rejecting as many claims as possible by default. This system needs to be overhauled as a priority with much higher standards of service.",
