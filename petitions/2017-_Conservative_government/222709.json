Expulsion or suspension may be used only if a member has been found by the House of Lords Commissioner for Standards to be in breach of the Code of Conduct, the finding of breach has been upheld by the Committee for Privileges and Conduct, and that Committee has recommended expulsion or suspension (as the case may be). The final decision on whether to expel or suspend is for the House of Lords as a whole."
