Why is it the more a working NRP earns the more they have to pay the other parent? Why does the child suddenly require more money because the NRP has got a better job or worked overtime. NRP's often work extra hours to try and compensate for CMS/CSA payments and then they are required to pay the other parent more because their income has increased?",
        "background": "Non resident parents (NRP's) are paying far too much to the resident parent of their child/children. This is causing severe depression and suicidal tendencies in NRP's. NRP's have to try and provide for their families at home whilst paying out a huge 25% plus of their income to their ex partners.",
