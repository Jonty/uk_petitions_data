        "additional_details": "The UK is facing an unprecedented housing crisis in terms of supply, cost, and the extremely high private rents.  Young people are trapped for YEARS as tenants, or living with parents, because there are precious few affordable homes in many places.\r\n\r\nThere are whole new-build housing estates and blocks of flats which are sold off in advance (often before the property is even built) and become 100% BTL empires from the very first day, not available for people to actually buy for themselves.",
        "background": "Too many new-build properties are sold as buy-to-let \"investments\", often at first refusal before they are even complete.  This restricts supply, keeps prices inflated, and usually keeps young people off the property ladder and in the trap of high private rents.\r\n\r\nThis should be outlawed.",
