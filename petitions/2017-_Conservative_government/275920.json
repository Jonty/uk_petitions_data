        "additional_details": "Without bees and other pollinators our planet will go downhill rapidly, we aren\u2019t proposing anything extreme we are simply asking to use a different pesticide instead of one that damages our declining bee population, surely you can agree that the need for more pollinators to help our planets ecosystem far out weighs the need for extra profit by farmers who Would rather use a cheaper pesticide that damages bee populations than fork out a bit more to save our planet.",
        "background": "Without bees and other pollinators we would be in big trouble, a massive cause of bee deaths each year is due to pesticides/herbicides, we propose a ban on all pesticides and herbicides that contain neonicotinoids as it can hinder learning and navigation in bees, for example, and harm reproduction.",
