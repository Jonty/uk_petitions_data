        "additional_details": "Last year the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that we have only 12 years to avoid the worst-case scenarios of climate change and biodiversity loss. Here in the UK, these include massive food and water shortages (and consequent starvation and drought), widespread flooding, and related societal and economic collapse.\r\n\r\nRunaway climate and ecological changes pose an existential threat to the citizens of this country. Our survival now rests on immediate government action.",
        "background": "For the UK Government to meet Extinction Rebellion's demands: declare a state of climate and ecological emergency, act now to halt biodiversity loss and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2025, create and be led by the decisions of a Citizens\u2019 Assembly on climate and ecological justice.",
