        "additional_details": "If we consider a firkin of beer is sold as containing 72 pints, then due to losses a typical barrel can supply 69 - 70 \"Full\" pints. If that firkin of beer is sold with a short measure of 5% on each pint then the firkin could provide approximately 74 saleable \u201cpints\u201d to the retailing establishment. Given that most brewers will have declared and paid duty on 69 - 70 pints that means the Government is also losing out on duty on these 4 \"extra\" pints sold, as well as the customer being undersold",
        "background": "The alcoholics drinks market routinely breaks the Weights and Measures act, no other retail market would be allowed to sell such short measures to its consumers on a regular basis.\r\nA pint of drink should be a full pint, not a short measure.",
