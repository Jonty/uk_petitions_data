Social services should be allowed to judge the situation professionally and help the child seeing the mother and father equally or when suitable for the child. This should be put in place so fathers do not have to fight for months without seeing their children or get into debt but then still expected to pay for the children. This is not just to protect fathers, it's also to protect the children who are caught up in the middle of it all.",
