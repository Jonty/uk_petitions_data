        "action": "Raise the police funding within the UK to make our streets safer.",
        "additional_details": "The total police budget in England and Wales in 2018/19 is \u00a312.3 billion, \u00a38.6 billion of that being funded by central government. From 2010/11, funding has fell by 19% which is a problem as more young people in major cities like London are getting stabbed and living in fear due to the lack of police patrols on our streets. The crime rate in London has gone up by 20% since 2014/15 and as of September 2017, we had the lowest number of police officers in at least 20 years. This is an issue we have to face now.",
        "background": "Every time we turn on our TVs, we witness another deadly crime committed, another life lost, another family broken. I am Adon and along with my friends Alex and Aaron, we have decided to focus our Active Citizenship GCSE project on the rising issue of crime within the major cities of our country.",
