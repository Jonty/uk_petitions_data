It should say who is responsible for your building on any letters you receive about works on the building.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government or Parliament to change the law to require landlords to replace single-glazed windows with double glazing, if that's what you'd like to happen. \r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about energy bills, you can find out more information about where to get help here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/energy/energy-supply/get-help-paying-your-bills/grants-and-benefits-to-help-you-pay-your-energy-bills/"
