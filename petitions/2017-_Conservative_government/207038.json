        "additional_details": "Where disproportionate housing growth is allowed, holistic planning of infrastructure is needed. Developer contributions alone aren\u2019t enough to build new schools and health centres. Country roads and junctions can\u2019t cope with the additional traffic.  Government needs to fund infrastructure.  Growth should be spread evenly across an area, not concentrated in villages without green belt protection.  Petition raised by East Leake, Nottinghamshire, but it\u2019s happening elsewhere in the country too.",
        "background": "The government is determined to build houses. It\u2019s a free-for-all where councils don\u2019t have a 5 year supply of housing land.  Green fields around certain communities are targeted by developers.  Schools, health centres and roads are not provided.  Local resources are overwhelmed, villages swamped.",
