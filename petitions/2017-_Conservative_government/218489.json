        "additional_details": "With around 10% of the UK\u2019s carbon emissions in 2016 coming from domestic agriculture https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/679334/2016_Final_Emissions_Statistics_one_page_summary.pdf\r\nwe should consider ways in which to reduce this.\r\n\r\nCompanies like Tesco once opted to add carbon labels to some food products on a voluntary basis; however, they then dropped this policy in part due to other retailers failing to follow suit.",
        "background": "The current rate of climate change is having devastating effects on the planet with natural disasters becoming more commonplace.\r\nSome food products are much more carbon and water intensive in production than others and having these labels will allow us to be more informed.",
