        "action": "Make it compulsory for all cyclists to wear reflective jackets in the dark.",
        "additional_details": "Most of the cyclists I pass in the Autumn/Winter months wear dark clothing and rely on a small bicycle light to make them noticeable to drivers. It is not safe and it is not helpful. I feel that these cyclists are putting their own lives at risk by not wearing reflective clothing and by not doing so, also putting drivers at risk. I feel quite strongly about this, mostly because the reflective jackets are not expensive, so there is no excuse not to wear one.",
        "background": "I frequently drive in the dark during the Autumn/Winter months and have noticed how frequently I pass cyclists that are not wearing anything reflective. To ensure the safety of cyclists and of drivers, I feel that it should be compulsory for them to wear a reflective jacket in the dark.",
