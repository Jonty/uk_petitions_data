        "additional_details": "Most of the cyclists I pass in the Autumn/Winter months wear dark clothing and rely on a small bicycle light to make them noticeable to drivers. It is not safe and it is not helpful. I feel that these cyclists are putting their own lives at risk by not wearing reflective clothing and by not doing so, also putting drivers at risk. I feel quite strongly about this, mostly because the reflective jackets are not expensive, so there is no excuse not to wear one.",

To ensure the safety of cyclists and of drivers, I feel that it should be compulsory for them to wear a reflective jacket in the dark.",
