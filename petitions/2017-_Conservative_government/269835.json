        "action": "Stop Jeremy Corbyn from becoming PM and therefore delaying BREXIT on 31 Oct 2019",
        "additional_details": "The continued bickering of MPs, instead of listening to what the people want and voted for.  People are tired of the delay and the continued cost to the taxpayer to sort this out.  Another delay will call a General Election and the major parties will suffer as the Brexit Party emerges to win seats as they did in the recent EU elections.  It is time for this country to move on, before democracy is lost.",
        "background": "Jeremy Corbyn has announced he is gathering support for a vote of no confidence in the current Government. He is proposing to other MPs to be installed as a temporary PM and delay Art 50 again, past 31 Oct 19.  The people voted to leave in 2016 and are tired of internal Government bickering.",
