        "action": "Make maintenance loans proportionate to the average living costs in the area",
        "additional_details": "Maintenance loan is currently proportionate to your families income, with the exception of studying in London which takes into account the higher prices. However, there are places such as Brighton which is also a very expensive place to live. Someone studying in Brighton will struggle to live off their maintenance loan compare to someone with the same maintenance loan in somewhere such as Leeds. This puts the person studying in Brighton in a difficult position to come up with additional funds",
        "background": "Maintenance loans should be made proportionate to average costs in the area of study in order to help students living in more expensive areas be able to complete their degree without worrying about struggling to afford rent/food/bills etc. Maintenance loan is often not enough to cover students.",
