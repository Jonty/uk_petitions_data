        "additional_details": "Another leadership contest within the Conservative party, given the extension already provided to the UK by the EU to deliver a workable Brexit plan, is a waste of time that will achieve nothing.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of Theresa May is as much to do with lack of confidence in the entire Conservative Party as it is with her. That the Conservative Party is unable to agree on a way forward for Brexit further illustrates the party's incompetence.\r\n\r\nGive the choice to the people. Hold a General Election.",
        "background": "Theresa May has resigned her post as Prime Minister. The Conservative political party has announced its intention to hold a contest for leadership in two weeks time. This is a waste of time, and unacceptable. The only way forward is a General Election.",
