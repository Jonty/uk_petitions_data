It's a nasty circle of spending to keep playing the game. Unfortunately alot of players end up quitting and then play another game where they are forced to quit that game too.\r\n\r\nThis has to stop. Even if it means all free games start charging to download it.",

These games get you addicted to the games and to keep fully enjoying the game you have forced to spend real money by buying in-game chest items. If you dont then you will not be able to progress much.",
