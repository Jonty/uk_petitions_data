        "additional_details": "A new dawn is breaking in the UK and around the world. Many in the UK establishment, much of the media, many of the elected politicians, most of the unelected peers, as well as various celebrities and organisations and millions of British people are openly and deliberately trying to ignorel democracy in the UK because they do not agree with the democratic result of the EU referendum. If they can ignore democracy, why can't we who do not vote Tory or Labour?",
        "background": "The democratic process that was once cherished by tens of millions of us in the UK is now being dismissed and treated with contempt in regard to the result of the EU referendum. If democracy can be IGNORED when it comes to the EU referendum result, then surely the result of ALL votes can be ignored.",
