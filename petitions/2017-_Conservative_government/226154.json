        "additional_details": "I would like this to become a compulsory a part of the curriculum.  Children should be taught to have an understanding of different families and various family groups in order to ensure they grow up without prejudice, are open and inclusive to all families they come across inside and outside of school. In a generation which supports gay marriage, doner baby's and same sex families children need to be taught about the world in which they will grow up in. This should be compulsory curriculum.",
        "background": "I am a single gay female with a 5 year old son conceived through a sperm doner. I would hate to see my son bullied as a result of other children of his age not having an understanding of different variations of families and not being accepting of other children who do not have a Mum & Dad.",
