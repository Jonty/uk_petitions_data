        "action": "Parliament to debate withdrawal of British support for Iran Nuclear deal.",
        "additional_details": "The Iran deal has produced great international controversy since its signature in 2015. To many, the very idea of bribing a terrorist-supporting state not to produce nuclear weapons has always been a dangerous nonsense. The British government talked a big talk against Russia with the Skripal poisoning, but seems completely blind to Iran's recklessly dangerous actions. This double standard needs be justified with full public parliamentary debate about withdrawing from the Iran deal.",
        "background": "On May 1st, BBC reported US response to Israel's claim of secret Iranian nuclear weapons factory hidden in Northern Syria, with the goal of producing 5 nuclear warheads. Israel presented evidence to show that Iran lied and defrauded the deal. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-43958205",
