        "additional_details": "It is not right  that you are classed as a couple in life but single after a death. The law needs to be changed so that couples who have been together for a certain number of years, especially when claiming benefits together, can be treated the same as a married couple. My grief has been worsened by constantly being told if you don't have the piece of paper you can't register his death or claim any help, as a widow/widower could, for example help with funeral costs.",
        "background": "My partner of 26 years recently died. Although we were treated as a married couple for benefits whilst he was alive as soon as he died our time together did not count any more. I couldn't register his death and am not entitled to any of the benefits widows get.",
