I feel that policies which ban any sort of \"alternative\" style despite it being completely safe and legal suppress human creativity and lower staff morale. I believe a change in the law is necessary to allow for the differences between humans and to show that people who express themselves in such ways are capable of being productive and professional members of a school or workplace.",
