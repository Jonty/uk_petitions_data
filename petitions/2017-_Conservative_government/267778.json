The online system should be extended to include complaints against all types of pensions and benefits.\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM IS THAT CLAIMANTS CANNOT PROVE THAT THEY MADE A COMPLAINT. THERE IS NO PROPER TRACKING SYSTEM\r\n\r\nHMRC's online complaint form via the personal tax account is an example of a system that works extremely well. The complainant receives a PDF containing full details of the complaint together with a tracking ref\r\n\r\nThe DWP should adopt and introduce the same type of complaint form/ features as HMRC",
        "background": "The DWP complaints process is a complete failure.\r\n\r\nTelephone complaints are in the majority of cases not investigated and no formal response is sent out\r\n\r\nComplaints in writing are often ignored",
