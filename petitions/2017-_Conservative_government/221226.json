        "action": "Ban Abortion in 2018",
        "additional_details": "Many women have more than one abortion. This costs taxpayers' money, some of which goes to private providers, and increases pressure on our NHS, which is already under huge strain. 2012 figures suggest that the NHS may spend over \u00a3800,000 a week on \u201crepeat\u201d abortions. That is the hidden cost of abortion. The Government must invest more in educating people to avoid unwanted pregnancies and provide better support for young mothers and single mothers. Everyone has the right to life.",
        "background": "Abortion should be illegal in all circumstances. The Abortion Act of 1967 left loopholes that allow too many abortions. There are alternatives to abortion: keep the baby, adoption or fostering, and medical research to prevent abortion being the only option when women are at risk during pregnancy.",
