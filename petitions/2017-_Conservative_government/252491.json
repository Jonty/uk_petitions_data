        "additional_details": "Government and Parliament are struggling to reach consensus or compromise on Brexit, given that any option taken risks alienating a substantial portion of the electorate.\r\nTo break this deadlock, the mandate and responsibility could now be returned to the electorate, via a properly informed referendum, wherein the eight indicative options and their likely consequences can be explained fully and impartially, voted upon, and 'scored' in a weighted system of preferences to avoid further deadlock.",
        "background": "With the continued deadlock faced by Parliament in attempting to implement Brexit, as demonstrated by all indicative voting options being defeated in today's proceedings, and following repeated rejections of the Prime Minister's deal, taking these options to the electorate may offer a way forward.",
