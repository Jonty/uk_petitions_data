        "additional_details": "Our son is 15 weeks old had tongue tie up until very recently where we gave in and had a private consultation to have his Tongue Tie divided due to it causing him problems. His bibs were saturated, hasn't gained much weight, couldn't latch onto the teat and pooling milk in his mouth and not swallowing for several sucks. \r\nIt can cause speech & dental problems and the inability to chew solid foods as well as emotional factors. It can cause mums problems like sore/cracked nipples, low milk supply and mastitis. Unfortunately it went unrecognised for 15 weeks in our case even though we pointed it out. It takes just a few seconds to snip and would potentially reduce the amount of appointments and referrals if dealt with early on.\r\nReference: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/tongue-tie/",
        "background": "Tongue Tie can affect around 4-11% of newborns and it's a malformation which restricts the movement of the tongue. It can cause difficulties from a young age and as they grow.  It can cause mothers issues around breastfeeding or terminate breastfeeding like in our case.",
