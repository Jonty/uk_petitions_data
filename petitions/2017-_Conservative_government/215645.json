In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about this here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for Parliament to set a specific legal minimum sentence for people convicted of perverting the course of justice, if that's what you'd like to happen.
