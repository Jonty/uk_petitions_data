        "additional_details": "companies are made responsible for the environment that people are working in at home, allow workers to opt out of this protection so they can work at home. Companies should only be responsible for the computers and equipment they supply nothing else. this will allow people with children to work from home. also companies can use more part time workers.",
        "background": "Because a lot of people travel into work in cities we are overloading the traffic infrastructure, creating pollution. parking problems and destroying country villages. Give companies incentives to allow them to support home workers, remove laws making companies for being responsible for home areas.",
