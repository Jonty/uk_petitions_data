        "action": "Legalize cannabis for medical and recreational use.",
        "additional_details": "Whenever this petition is brought up the response given by parliament is that cannabis is a harmful substance, however, I can\u2019t seem to find any proof at all of deaths caused by cannabis; besides that, cannabis also has medical benefits when properly administrated. Tabacco and alcohol on the other hand are substances that have absolutely no benefit to one\u2019s health but it\u2019s completely legal. How does that make sense?\r\nAlso, it doesn\u2019t seem fair that we have people being sent to jail here for the same thing that people in other countries are free to do. We are all humans the same way, we should all be treated the same way and given the same rights.",
        "background": "With a significant amount of first world countries legalising consumption of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes, it only makes sense for England to do the same. Apart from the negative stereotypes that surround cannabis users, there is no actual logical reason as to why it isn\u2019t legal.",
