        "additional_details": "Phoenix Communications believes these charge are totally unjustified as 084 & 087 numbers still have consumer perception of being local or national, not premium rate. The mobile networks are raking in millions of \u00a3's per day whilst consumers get fleeced for calling these numbers from their mobile phones. For example a 10 minute call to 0844 number would cost a mobile user on EE, Vodafone, O2 or Three between \u00a34.40 & \u00a35.50 on top of the ppm 'service charge'.  Let's get this stopped!",
        "background": "In addition the network access should be announced to the caller before the call is connected. Currently the four major mobile operators (EE, O3, Vodafone and Three) charge a \"Network Access Charge' of between 44ppm and 55ppm to call 084, 087, 090 and 118 numbers.",
