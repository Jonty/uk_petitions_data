        "additional_details": "I know how hard the staff work after spending time in Hospital recently. The staff are constantly getting fines for parking, especially when the carpark is full and you have to just abandon your car. I don't work for the NHS, and it is crazy that our national insurance gets wasted through parking fees via the staff having to pay. Please help and support this petition.",
        "background": "Time and time again, I hear about NHS staff being fined and having ridiculous parking charges just to go to their place of work. It is unfair. Why not give the staff this removal of fees and it's like giving them a pay rise.",
