        "additional_details": "Current CPS sentencing guidance for 16-17 year olds, is set to 4 months minimum detention and a training order, in the worst scenarios: ( https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/offensive-weapons-knives-bladed-and-pointed-articles ) Clearly, this is not a deterrent.\r\nThe proposed tariffs would apply to all ages. To ensure the new tariffs are clear, a campaign to publicise them to the target audience (10 years old and above suggested) should be conducted through National & local media.",
        "background": "The current sentencing tariffs are insufficient and ineffective as a deterrent. On first offence, a minimum sentence of 6 months custody which may be suspended for 5 years, depending on specific circumstance. On second offence, a minimum sentence of 5 years custody, with no option of early release.",
