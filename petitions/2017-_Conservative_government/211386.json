        "additional_details": "By standardising the tax rates on all forms of income, employment tax rates will fall since the disproportionate tax benefits available to the super-rich only will be reduced to create a fair tax system.\r\n\r\nAll income say, under \u00a31m, including receipts from loans from non-UK sources and gains from share schemes, should be treated equally for tax purposes and thereafter a minimum tax rate of 10% should cap any excessive tax breaks. \r\nPersonal allowance and capital gain exemption could also be combined.",
        "background": "If you receive most income from your employment, there is a 99% chance that you are probably \u2018poor\u2019 or, at least, not part of the 1% high wealth individuals.\r\nThe wealthy avoid high employment income tax rates and instead exploit generous allowances and lower tax rates on all other forms of income.",
