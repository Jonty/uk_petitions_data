        "action": "Allow American author Robert Spencer to enter the UK and speak freely",
        "additional_details": "Spencer was barred from entering Britain by then Home Secretary Theresa May. Mrs May deemed his presence in the UK as \"not conducive to the public good\". Spencer had committed no crime, had not incited violence, but expressed his views about the Koran and Mohammed. We demand that this ban is lifted and that Robert Spencer be allowed entry to the UK.",
        "background": "The prominent American author Robert Spencer was barred from entering the UK in 2013. Despite having committed no crime, Mr Spencer was prevented from speaking in Britain following his criticisms of Islam, a subject on which he has written widely. He should not be denied UK entry because of this.",
