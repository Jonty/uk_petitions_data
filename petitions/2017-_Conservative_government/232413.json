        "additional_details": "Recognising the stress to animals, in 2018 the Italian town of Collecchio in the province of Parma introduced legislation that insists on silent fireworks displays. None of the beauty is lost, only the noise. \r\nMore details are available here: https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2018/07/05/italian-town-silent-fireworks/\r\n\r\n2018  commemorates the centenary of the end of World War One. The ending of terrifying noise of bombs and gunshot. Let us also celebrate and mark the silence that peace brings.",
        "background": "The noise from fireworks can cause stress to humans and animals. By definition they are generally held late at night when dark. \r\n\r\nIn particular, animals ave no comprehension of the activity and are prone to \"acoustic stress\". Spectacular silent fireworks are available and used in other countries.",
