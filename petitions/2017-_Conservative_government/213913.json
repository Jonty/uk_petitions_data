Many thousands of people are hospitalised yearly due to the use (or OVER use) of alcohol.\r\n\r\nIt is a scourge on our young people, in whom we are now seeing record levels of binge drinking amongst teenagers and people in their early 20s. \r\n\r\nThe Beer federation at one point put out a literal \"Beer goes with everything\" advert. Why is this OK?\r\n\r\nNO MORE ENCOURAGEMENT OF DRINKING BY GLAMOURISING IT IN OUR TV ADVERTISING!",

Pretty much all of them glamourise alcohol use, making it seem like you'll have a more adventurous life by drinking.\r\n\r\nLet's save our people, help alcoholics quit and reduce binge drinking, by banning alcohol advertising on TV completely!",
