        "additional_details": "Currently the sentence for assaulting a police officer ranges from a from a fine to a maximum of 6 months in prison. \r\n\r\nRecently a police officer in the West Midlands police was assaulted and had a large chunk of hair ripped from her head whilst attending a domestic incident, her attacker received a paltry 12 weeks suspended sentence. \r\nhttps://www.itv.com/news/central/2018-01-12/police-woman-has-hair-ripped-out-after-being-assaulted-on-shift/ \r\n\r\nThis kind of lenient sentencing will only serve to demoralise the police when they should be given full support from the courts. I therefore propose that a minimum custodial sentence of 18 months be introduced for any assault on a police officer.\r\n",
        "background": "The police do a difficult and quite often thankless job in order to keep our communities safe, all too often this can be a very dangerous job.",
