        "action": "Remove the \"Henry VIII Powers\" from the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill",
        "additional_details": "In it's current form the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill gives the Government the power to change UK law without Parliamentary scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThis power can be used safely, such as amendments to the breeds of dog in the Dangerous Dogs Act, however it has also been abused. In 2013 Chris Grayling MP attempted to introduce a residency test barrier to obtaining legal aid.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot more at stake here: Consumer Protection, Employment, Snoopers Charter, Environmental Protection, rights of Appeal.",
        "background": "When 37.5% of the electorate (51.9% of those who voted) voted to bring back power the UK Parliament, it was not their intention to immediately hand over that power to the Theresa May and her Government.\r\n\r\nWe fought 2 Civil Wars in England to give Parliament the power to control what is UK law.",
