        "additional_details": "It is becoming increasingly clear that in order to circumvent the law regarding \u201ccold calling\u201d certain companies and organisations, notably those dealing with PPI claims, are turning to the use of \u201ccold mailing\u201d in order to attract customers.  And while we do not wish to prevent ANY company from attracting customers, the use of \u201ccold mailing\u201d (as with cold calling) is an invasion of privacy, especially when the recipient of any such mail has generally NOT given their permission for their personal details to be forwarded to a third party.\r\n\r\nWe therefore call upon HM Government to immediately introduce legislation to outlaw \u201ccold mailing\u201d.",
