        "additional_details": "With the publicity on Fb and tv ppl are still ignoring warnings about leaving there dogs in cars on a hot day. At present we get a lot of abuse of owners if we confront them as to how long a dog has been in a car with temperatures recently nearly 30 degrees outside. Police dogs have died and yet the public still ignore all warnings. More needs to be done to protect the voiceless animals. At present there is no law here to help us save a life but there needs to be",
