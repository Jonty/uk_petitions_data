        "action": "Retain Current Responsible Pharmacist Legislation and Reject Remote Pharmacist",
        "additional_details": "The government has proposed that pharmacists could end up signed in as the Responsible Pharmacist for more than one pharmacy at a time and therefore not physically available to patients. The government's proposals will ultimately lead to medicines dispensing & supply taking place without the supervision of a pharmacist. This will be detrimental to patient care and safety and the legislative changes must not go ahead. More information can be found on this website: the-pda.org/patientpetition2018",
        "background": "Whilst a pharmacy is open it is a fundamental patient right that a qualified pharmacist is available on site at all times to consult in person, without the need for an appointment. Patient safety would be at risk if a pharmacist wasn't present in a pharmacy.",
