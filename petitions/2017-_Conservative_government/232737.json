        "additional_details": "More than one in three people sleeping rough have been deliberately hit or kicked or experienced some other form of violence whilst homeless. If these individuals could spend the night on a bench, they could be away from the floor, nightclub doors or store entrances, in safer areas. The homeless are entitled to the same as any person, and these benches must be banned.",
        "background": "Just under a quarter of a million people are estimated to be sleeping rough in Britain, 2018. 'Anti-homeless' benches force the homeless to sleep on the cold floor this winter. Divided benches are an example of how the housing problem has not been tackled, with efforts to only blanket the truth.",
