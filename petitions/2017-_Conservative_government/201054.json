I've learned many other pets have too been victims. A simple reminder like this may help to build an awareness of the risks they pose to pets.",

Most of the labels on packaging, such as traffic light nutrition labels and litter campaign labels, are there due to voluntary schemes. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking the UK Government to encourage the industry to add labels to packaging to raise awareness of the danger to pets."
