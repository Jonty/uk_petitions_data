        "action": "Stop companies in the Uk selling on debt to third party debt collectors.",
        "additional_details": "I would like parliament to look into the law and legislation into third party companies buying debt in the uk.  The debt belongs & sits with the original company. I want the government to make it illegal to purchase debt in the uk and third party companies not to be allowed to chase purchased debt in the uk. Make it law for companies to chase their own debts without contracting another company. To make companies allow people in debt to pay small manageable payments until debt is paid",
        "background": "8.3 million people in the uk are in debt that they cannot pay. Debt collection companies are making huge profits from this, by buying debt from companies. These debts should not be allowed to be purchased by third party companies as the debt does not legally belong to the third party.",
