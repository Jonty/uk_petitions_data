        "action": "Give Parliament a meaningful vote on any future Syrian Airstrikes.",
        "additional_details": "The Organisation for Chemical Weapons Proliferation has not given its verdict or opinion over the alleged use of Chemical Weapons in Syria. The Prime Minister should have recalled Parliament, something she can do easily, presented her evidence and given Parliament the deciding vote. Instead, she subverted democracy and now she MUST promise to have Parliament vote on any future intervention, or legislation must be brought to take away her ability to order such Airstrikes without approval.",
        "background": "On April 13th, the Prime Minister, without the consent of Parliament or the people, conducted airstrikes in Syria with US and French forces. After 2003, a precedent was set that Parliament had the right to a vote over foreign intervention. In 2013, David Cameron was defeated over Syrian Airstrikes.",
