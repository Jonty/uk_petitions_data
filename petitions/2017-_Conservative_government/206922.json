        "action": "Withdraw the UK's State Visit invitation from Donald Trump.",
        "additional_details": "Donald Trump as candidate and president has repeatedly published patently false information with regards to the Islam faith, crime, and domestic/foreign terrorism in our country. This only serves to increase tension within our communities and worsen the division we already experience.\r\n\r\nMost recently he has shared unverified videos from far-right group 'Britain First'. When condemned for this action, he and his administration patronisingly dismissed the concerns of our Government and Parliament.",
        "background": "Throughout his candidacy and onto his presidency, Donald Trump has made it clear that he does not share or respect our British values, as set out by our government and Prime Minister on multiple occasions.\r\n\r\nSuch a person should not be extended the honour of a State Visit to our country.",
