        "action": "Enact New UK Legislation to Ban Food Waste",
        "additional_details": "The \u00a317 billion of food thrown away in the UK (WRAP). In the last 5 years, homelessness has also doubled and three million school children also risk hunger. Inspiringly, France has passed a law to ban food waste with fines and imprisonment for defaulters. In the UK, too, nutritious rescued food can feed the homeless and children in schools. The Government must uphold the right to food for every citizen and urgently pass a strong law to tackle food poverty and food waste.",
        "background": "No country in Europe wastes as much food as the UK, despite millions of children, homeless and vulnerable people sleeping hungry at night. In 2016 France banned food waste and made it compulsory for supermarkets to donate unsold food to charities. We urge the UK government to enact a similar law.",
