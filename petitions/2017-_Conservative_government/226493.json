        "additional_details": "It's not rocket science to see that these collars are wrong and cruel. They can be used on domestic dogs with owners who aren't trained in using them correctly.\r\n\r\nIt's not fair that dogs are walked using these horrible things digging into their necks and pinching their skin and in some cases seriously hurt in the process. \r\n\r\nI can honestly say after putting it around my arm and pulling on it, I would never use it on my own animals and find it impossible  to understand why anyone would want it on their pet.",
        "background": "After coming across a prong collar, me and my colleagues who work in the dog/pet industry spent a while trying it on ourselves, researching where it is banned and looking at the damage that can be caused when in the wrong hands. It is currently banned in Scotland and Wales so why not England?",
