        "additional_details": "I'm British, but have lived in Sweden for over 20 years. I still have many strong connections to the UK. \r\n\r\nI am greatly concerned by Brexit, but had no vote in the 2016 referendum. I feel this is wrong, as it will have a considerable impact on my rights and life as a British citizen living overseas. Supporting The Overseas Electors Bill is important to me and the many millions of other British overseas residents.\r\n\r\nWe should support this bill and its passage through parliament.",
        "background": "This petition is on behalf of British citizens living outside of the UK who are not allowed to vote in elections or referenda as they have lived outside of the country for more than 15 years. Nearly five million British citizens live outside of the UK, with 60% of these people affected by this rule.",
