        "additional_details": "A decision taken by Ford UK to scrap a rare Standard 10 was recently highlighted and reversed. The mint condition classic had been sent for scrap by Ford after it was traded in for a Transit. There are many other examples of historic vehicles being sent for a similar fate. They should have legal protection.",
        "background": "Make it illegal for manufacturers to process vehicles which have Historic Vehicle on their V5 documents though any scrappage scheme. A simple way to avoid losing rare road heritage is to make all vehicles with Historic Vehicle on their V5 document, legally exempt from scrappage.",
