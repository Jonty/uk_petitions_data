They should have legal protection.",

A simple way to avoid losing rare road heritage is to make all vehicles with Historic Vehicle on their V5 document, legally exempt from scrappage.",

We have encouraged and continue to encourage manufacturers to come forward with further manufacturer led scrappage schemes as a way to help some owners of older vehicles to purchase a cleaner vehicle. \r\n\r\nThese schemes are independent of the Government and it is for the manufacturers to choose how to dispose of the older vehicles. While we have been clear that we want to see these older vehicles scrapped to improve air quality, where a manufacturer receives a vehicle with historic value they are able to choose to preserve it. \r\n\r\nThe Government has committed to helping local authorities support individuals and businesses affected by local air quality plans, and has invested \u00a3220 million Clean Air Fund.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport",
