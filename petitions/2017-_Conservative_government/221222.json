He expressed his \"deep concern\" about the EU's latest regulatory nightmare warning it will \"significantly interrupt transatlantic co-operation, create unnecessary barriers to trade for everyone outside the EU\". The costs do and will fall disproportionately on small and medium-sized businesses.",

It seriously damages Export and the Service sectors. An appropriate incentive by a tax allowance to offset ongoing costs will assist",
