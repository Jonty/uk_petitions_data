It is toxic to humans, can induce Parkinson\u2019s disease & is highly toxic to fish. \r\n\r\nAzadirachtin is lethal to bumblebees at concentrations 50x lower than those recommeded to farmers. It is banned in the UK, but both it & Rotenone are permitted in the EU, and so could enter our food chain.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government must take the lead in lobbying the EU to ban these dangerous pesticides.\r\n\r\nDOI: 10.1007/s10646-014-1365-9\r\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0008762\r\nDOI: 10.1186/cc3528",
        "background": "The EU voted to ban nicotinoids as it harms bees. This was supported by the UK Government.\r\n\r\n2 pesticides - Rotenone & Azadirachtin, are dangerous to bees but still permitted for use in the EU. These 2 pesticides are now being substituted for banned neonics.\r\n\r\nIt's time they were banned.",
