Let\u2019s ensure these MPs do not get the opportunity to rub their failings in our faces and take a pay rise for the next 5 years as a protest by us the voters in signing this petition. Sign this petition if you think all MPs should have a pay freeze for the next 5 years.",

We should have left on 29th March but now face delays. Those we elected to serve us have failed, let\u2019s show our disappointment by blocking their pay rises.",
