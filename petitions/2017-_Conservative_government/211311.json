        "additional_details": "In may 2017 a family pet was mauled by 3 big dogs, described as bull mastiff, pit bull and staffordshire bull terrier dogs, the family pet was a king charles cavalier which stood no chance against these 3 massive dogs, but somehow the dog survived. The owner of the dogs is a young lad who has been training them to rip apart cats and lets them run loose when going for walks. 28th Jan 2018 they attacked a Labrador and killed it, again the owner just walked off with the dogs.",
        "background": "Hoping to change the law so that anyone who wants to own a dog has to be 21 plus and also have to buy a license for dogs deemed 'bad breeds' such as bull mastiffs, bull dogs, staffies to stop idiotic people from having 'easy' access to these dogs.",
