        "additional_details": "In Pakistan oppressive laws mean Ahmadis often live in fear and are denied basic rights. Ahamadis cannot vote, their mosques are often targeted, for example, in 2010 where 86 Ahmadi worshippers were killed during Friday prayers and they can face up to 3 years in jail for calling themselves Muslims. \r\n\r\nPakistan has just elected a new PM. PM Khan says that he want an just and equal society. There is now a golden opportunity for the UK Government to pressure Khan to address the persecution of Ahmadis.",
        "background": "All over the world a small sect of Muslims known as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community are persecuted and oppressed. Perhaps no other place do Ahmadis face worse persecution than in Pakistan.",
