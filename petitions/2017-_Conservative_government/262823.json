The public require a new vote on whether to remain or not as the consequences of the decision are becoming more apparent.  Also the current government have not delivered on their promises and have ignored calls for a second vote despite 6 million signatures in a petition asking to halt proceedings. They have failed in their duty and a General Election must take place.",
        "background": "Current government have failed in the management of Brexit and delivering their promises. A new public Brexit vote is needed due to the complete mismanagement of the proceedings and the lack of/false information given to the public to gather votes during the first EU referendum",
