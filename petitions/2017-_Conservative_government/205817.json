        "additional_details": "Last week, MPs voted on the transfer of a clause from the Lisbon Treaty (NC 30) into UK law. A majority of 18 MPs voted against the clause, so it has not been transferred into U.K. law. The clause protected all animals who aren't pets. It gave them an identity and recognised that they feel pain and emotion - just like humans. This is scientifically proven to be true. But now animals can be tested on and abused freely as their capacity of feeling pain and fear is no longer recognised in U.K. law.",
        "background": "As part of the bill for the withdrawal from the EU, MPs voted that animals do not feel pain or emotion. Not only is it proven that they do, this is a huge step back in animal welfare rights in our country. It is a full scale emergency for wildlife and all animals. This urgently needs to be revoked.",
