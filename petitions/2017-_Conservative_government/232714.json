        "action": "Make it illegal for secondary schools to isolate pupils",
        "additional_details": "Schools should not be allowed to isolate pupils for more than one hour, the secondary school I attended (till August 2017) this year would isolate students for something as trivial as a short haircut. Isolation is infringing on the liberties of young people across the country and it should not be tolerated, the problem is more widespread than I thought as many schools across the UK use isolation to reprimand students. Segregation does not breed well rounded individuals.",
        "background": "Across England, many secondary schools isolate students for hours, days or weeks at a time, this is only detrimental to a students\u2019 mental health but questionably against the human rights of pupils, this is not a punishment but a custodial sentence in some instances",
