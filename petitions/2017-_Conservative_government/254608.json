        "additional_details": "IF Brexit is indeed the will of the people, then delaying it for a year so a change in Government can take place is not a big ask.\r\nIf Brexit is going to happen, a deal that allows us a level playing field with the world and the EU must be negotiated.\r\nIt is obvious that the deal on offer is not good, a good deal would pass through Parliament without months of deadlock.\r\nAny final deal should also be put to the people to approve and if rejected, then article 50 must be revoked.",
        "background": "The Government have wasted 2 years over Brexit, have not secured a good deal and are locked in a stalemate that is leading the UK into a no deal scenario.\r\nMP's across all parties are putting their party before the public.\r\nIt is time for a general election",
