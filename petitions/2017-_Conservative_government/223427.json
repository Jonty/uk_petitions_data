        "additional_details": "A65 is a prime example of this in Cumbria. Every single day there is a dead animal on this road. And most other roads around these parts. It's disgusting how we destroy every we touch let alone what we are doing to the animals. Finding a half dead mangled deer at the side of the road and having to put it out of its misery is the worst thing I've had to do and it's not the first one. Please get on board",
        "background": "Living in the countryside it breaks my heart to see dead birds, deer, foxes, rabbits and badgers dead on the road. Animals just trying to live in a world that we have added thousands of cars to. They are being punished by humans. We already rule the world. Save the wildlife while there's time",
