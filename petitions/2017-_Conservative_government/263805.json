        "additional_details": "The anti-Brexiteers were very vocal in their claim that they actually won the European election, despite the Brexit Party having more MEPs.  However, when Labour won the Peterborough by-election there was no such outcry, despite the anti-labour vote being far greater than the pro-Labour vote.\r\nCompulsory voting, with the option(s) to express dissatisfaction with all candidates will mobilise the views of those who feel disenfranchised.",
        "background": "In the European Election, the losers claimed victory.  In Peterborough, more people voted against Labour, but Labour still claimed victory.  Compulsory voting with the ballot option of expressing dissatisfaction with the candidates will put any 'victory' into perspective.",
