        "action": "Government to adopt a single comprehensive measure of poverty as standard",
        "additional_details": "The current government measure of poverty uses 4 different measures based simply on mean income.\r\n\r\nConsidering stagnated wages, rising costs, homelessness rising, impact on disabled people, rising childcare costs, overcrowded housing etc. These issues should always be taken into account when measuring poverty, not just a mean income.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, think this parliament should legislate adopt the same as or similar to the Social Metrics Commission new measurement of poverty as a set standard.  (see below)\r\n\r\nhttp://socialmetricscommission.org.uk/MEASURING-POVERTY-SUMMARY-REPORT.pdf",
        "background": "Government does not have an official standard measure of poverty and currently uses measures based simply on mean income.\r\nThis is not an accurate measure of poverty. We demand parliament legislate to adopt a comprehensive measurement similar to or the same as Social Metrics Commission measure.",
