In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"independently verified Accounts & itemised Bill\". The European Court of Auditors audits the revenue and expenditure of the EU budget every year.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about the auditing activities of the ECA in 2016 here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eca.europa.eu/en/Pages/DocItem.aspx?did=41192\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
