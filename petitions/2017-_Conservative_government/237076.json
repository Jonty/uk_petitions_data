        "action": "Make companies who have joint bills chase both parties for the debt",
        "additional_details": "Severn Trent, Council Tax etc are all bills that will chase the home occupier for a full balance. However if an account has been in two peoples names previously it isn\u2019t possible to split the bill and chase the other person. This is leaving many single parents with huge debt that they struggle to pay. Universal credit will split an advance repayment if there is a break of parties as should all other companies to make the system fairer. Particularly for victims of gambling, control and abuse.",
        "background": "A lot of newly single mothers or fathers, who may have been subject to controlling behaviour, are left with bills that were half theirs but whilst paying them are not receiving help from the other payer. It should be made law that companies bill both payers so that the system is fairer.",
