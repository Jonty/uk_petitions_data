Government cannot agree on how to leave yet will not consider a peoples vote on a \u2018PMs deal or no deal\u2019 brexit; this would be the next democratic step. The UK should leave the EU on the 29th of March 2019-By Law.  Instead, remainers are ignoring 17.4million voters and fighting for another referendum, after 2yrs of brexit brow beating, the country are losing the will to live. Fight back!",
        "background": "The UK voted to Leave the EU in 2016. The largest constistuency to vote remain was London. The majority of our government also voted remain. Now Londoners and many MPs are doing everything in their power to evoke article 50 to stop Brexit and force another referendum. Save democracy in the UK.",
