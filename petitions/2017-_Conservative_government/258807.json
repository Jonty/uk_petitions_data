Wildlife and natural habitats are being wiped out through irresponsible behaviour. The costs involved are astronomical all though thoughtless use of these disposable fire lighters.",

During the summer of 2018 the moors were decimated by wild fires again through irresponsible people lighting barbecues on the pennine moors. This needs to end now before habitats are wiped out.",
