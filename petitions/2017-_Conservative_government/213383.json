        "additional_details": "It is an affront to British values for Kensington and Chelsea to continue to use the title \u201cRoyal\u201d. The council leader has resigned. Responsibility for Grenfell Tower residents has been taken away from the council by HM Government. A public inquiry has been ordered by HM Government.",
        "background": "On the Prime Minister\u2019s advice, Wootton Basset was awarded the title \u201cRoyal\u201d as a result of it's dedicated action. If this honour can be awarded it can also be removed. This should apply to Kensington and Chelsea as a result of the action prior to and inaction following the Grenfell Tower tragedy.",
