        "additional_details": "There is much evidence from around the globe of proven affects to marine life from microscopic plankton to large cetaceans all are affected in some form either directly or indirectly. This may be somewhat more acceptable to some for the purposes of marine conservation or possibly even renewable energy if it benefits the planet long term, but surely not for fossil fuel exploitation which only serves commercial gain and is in stark contrast to the recently declared climate emergency.",
        "background": "Marine seismic surveys are viewed as a necessary evil in order to discover new fossil fuel reserves, there is little or no non-commercial benefit & the impact to marine life is significant, including altering migration patterns, hearing damage for dolphin / whale species & mortality of zooplankton.",
