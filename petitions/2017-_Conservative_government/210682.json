        "additional_details": "A general survey of customers has revealed that more and more E-cigarette users are going online to websites based outside of the EU to obtain non-TPD products such as 6ml tanks and larger bottles of nicotine containing eliquid. This is having a damaging effect on one of the UK's fastest growing industries, putting the jobs of thousands in needless jeopardy. More and more people are turning to e-cigarettes as an alternative to quit smoking and are being limited to options available to them.",
        "background": "The TPD act came into effect in May 2017. Since then, businesses in the UK have suffered due to maximum tank sizes of 2ml AND a maximum 10ml bottle size for nicotine containing eliquid.",
