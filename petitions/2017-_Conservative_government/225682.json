        "additional_details": "The principle of not executing those convicted of crimes, no matter how heinous, must extend to Britons who are tried abroad too and it is the Government's duty to advocate for sentences that do not result in executions. \r\n\r\nSajid Javid has unilaterally decided to change the Government's long standing policy of seeking assurances that the death penalty will not be incurred for Britons tried overseas. This change was taken without consulting the public or Parliament and shows a lack of principle.",
        "background": "The U.K. Government has declined to seek assurances that British citizens being tried in the USA will not be subject to the death penalty. This is wrong and sets a dangerous and illiberal precedent.",
