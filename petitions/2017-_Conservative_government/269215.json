        "action": "Recognise single parental discrimination as a protected characteristic in Work.",
        "additional_details": "This type of discrimination is on the fact that an employee has a caregiving/ parental responsibility rather than gender. Single parents are vulnerable to above because the law doesn\u2019t protect them, from bullying, unfair treatment in the workplace, etc. And therefore they are unable to protect themselves in the workplace from such incidents. It is important that government recognise the vulnerability single parents have in the workplace due to their family status and to protect their rights.",
        "background": "The current characteristic of single parent discrimination in the workplace as being possibly \u201csex discrimination\u201d is not clear enough and/or does not accurately include the type of discrimination that single parents can and do face as a result of being a sole caregiver/ their family status.",
