        "additional_details": "It\u2019s a fact that the whole world is not going to turn vegan, so the slaughter of farmed animals for meat isn\u2019t going to stop. But we can change the way they are treated, by monitoring the farms/slaughter houses in order to prevent the cruel and evil treatment that these animals receive. It\u2019s not an invasion of privacy, there are cameras in most work places, so this proposal is no different. If you care about the well-being of animals, please sign this petition and pass it on.",
        "background": "More and more we\u2019re hearing stories of horrific animal abuse in farms and slaughter houses, I read today that two men have pleaded guilty to such acts after being caught on camera. So what I propose is that cameras be put in place in farms/slaughter houses to help prevent this cruelty.",
