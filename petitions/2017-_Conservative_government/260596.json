        "action": "Make all school uniform VAT free regardless of size.",
        "additional_details": "I believe this issue has been discussed before and rejected due to possible exploitation from smaller adults who could use items like skirts, pants or shirts for work. If all uniform can not become VAT free due to this then I propose making all school specific uniform VAT free. By this I mean items with school logos on which could not be used anywhere else. \r\nOR\r\nMake it possible for parents to claim the VAT back for all purchased uniform.",
        "background": "At the moment parents with children who require larger size school uniform have to pay VAT on this, for example a blazer that costs \u00a333 in a smaller size would cost \u00a340 just one size bigger due to the added VAT. School uniform can be very expensive but to charge VAT on top is unfair.",
