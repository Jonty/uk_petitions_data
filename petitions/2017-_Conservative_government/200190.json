I am very concerned that we could see a third year of children being assessed unfairly.  At present, it is almost impossible for a Year 6 child with spelling difficulties to be assessed as being 'at the expected standard' in writing. Let's start celebrating and acknowledging what children can do, rather than punishing them for what they can't!",
