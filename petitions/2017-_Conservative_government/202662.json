        "additional_details": "Blithbury Reindeer Lodge was set up by Mr Swinnerton in 2007.  Under the current scheme, the lodge would be affected by a purchase of land and the relocation of the B5014. All the land is utilized for grazing and relocation is not an option. Realignment of the road will cause disruption, noise and air pollution. If the land is acquired the lodge will have no option but to close.",
