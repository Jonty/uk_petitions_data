Give the public an immediate general election to decide whether we wish to retain a no deal option, or whether we wish to surrender to the mercy of the EU.  All the main parties have claimed the only solution is to pass the decision back to the people, it's now time to make good on that statement and give us an election without further delay or deception.",

It's time to decide whether to retain a no deal option to force a deal from the EU, or continue onwards with indecision and no resolution",
