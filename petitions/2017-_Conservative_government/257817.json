        "additional_details": "Parliament has been trying to undermine the result of the 2016 referendum by underhand methods.  Not taking part in the European Parliament elections will provide a clean break from the EU without having to wait until 31 October 2019 at which point the European Commission is highly likely to delay the UK's departure from the EU yet again.",
        "background": "Both the Conservative and Labour parties have said that they do not want to take part in the European Parliament elections on 23 May 2019.  By not taking part the UK will save the cost of over \u00a3100m.\r\nIf the UK does not take part in these elections it will have to leave the EU on 1 June 2019.",
