        "additional_details": "Our hospital is in a poor state of repair, it needs desperate reconfiguring and has a major back log of maintenance issues. The subsequent cost would be so high that building a new hospital would be more beneficial.\r\n\r\n\u00a0The barracks location would be ideal for transport links (ambulances wouldn't need to travel through gridlocked town centre) + new site could include the mental health services (currently at a different location in town) and plenty of space for parking.\r\n\r\nWe need capital funding!",
        "background": "Grantham & District hospital needs significant investment to bring it up to fire & safety standards + be sustainable for the NHS long term plan.\r\nFinancially, its more feasible to build a new one at one of the major developments in town. \r\nWe need capital funding to help us build it, please help us!",
