        "additional_details": "Loyal members of our Armed Forces continue to be harassed and persecuted by lawyers, who's only concern is to financially benefit off the backs of our heroes, the people that sacrificed so much already and gave so much for this country.\r\n\r\nTheir historic claims are contrived and unjustified and they need to be stopped. Enough is enough. We will be demanding that our soldiers are afforded the same as those who were our enemies in The Good Friday Agreement - Pardons for all British soldiers.",
        "background": "On the 20th July 1982 the IRA planted bombs in Hyde Park and Regents Park killing 11 young soldiers, Those murderers still have their freedom in the UK, protected by The Good Friday Agreement, while our own brave British military veterans have no such protection from our government.",
