        "additional_details": "I use NCP assuming it\u2019s the safest place to park. Turns out they don\u2019t have CCTV! My car has been damaged by another vehicle and the driver didn\u2019t leave a note, so I have to foot the bill. It\u2019s nearly Christmas and I have a baby. Somebody else\u2019s cowardly actions mean I have to pay a high excess to claim on insurance and lose my no claims bonus, or pay out more for private repairs.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re sick of paying for others\u2019 crimes, please sign my petition to make all car parks install CCTV. Thank you.",
        "background": "Have you ever returned to your parked car and found it damaged by another vehicle? \r\n\r\nIf the driver of the other vehicle doesn\u2019t leave a note, they are committing a hit and run offence.\r\n\r\nBut without CCVT, the chances of catching them are slim and YOU are forced to foot the bill!",
