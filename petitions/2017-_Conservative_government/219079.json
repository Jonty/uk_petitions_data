Within two weeks of changing my number and not having given it to any companies, I started receiving calls from various numbers in the London area, during which I was played back a prerecorded message.\r\n\r\nTPS does not cover this form of harassment, yet the victims of it waste just as much time as if they had a live human speaking to them. There should be no exception for this type of call.",
        "background": "The Telephone Preference Service is completely ineffectual and needs to be amended. Currently, TPS does not cover cold callers playing back a prerecorded message, only those where a live human is placing the call and speaking to the victim. This must change.",
