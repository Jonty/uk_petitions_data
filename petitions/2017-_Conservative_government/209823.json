        "action": "Devolve responsibility for immigration policy in Scotland.",
        "additional_details": "We, Scots welcome immigrants to come and live in Scotland, and work in Scotland, when England doesn\u2019t.  We welcome especially EU migrants, who pay their taxes raised in Scotland and contribute to our economy and if they go, we will miss out.  So we need them.  I know we haven\u2019t known about this before, but countries like Canada and Australia have regional/provincial immigration policies within a nation-wide framework.",
        "background": "It looks like the EU migrants are now leaving the UK after Brexit and we don\u2019t want that.  So, I call on the UK government to devolve some powers over immigration, especially the responsibility over immigration policy to the Scottish Parliament.",
