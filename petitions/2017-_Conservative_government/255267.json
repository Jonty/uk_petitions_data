        "additional_details": "There are other countries which enjoy membership of the Single Market whilst also not being members of European Union.\r\n\r\nOur demand, therefore, is the retention of our right to live, love, travel, trade, work and retire across 27+ other nations without the need for visas or checks on our earnings and bank balances. The removal of this automatic right is an inherently elitist act and must not be supported by the Government of this country.",
