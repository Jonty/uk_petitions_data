        "additional_details": "Boris Johnson MP previously auctioned off a picture of a bus which raised \u00a38,000 for charity. As a potential PM his artistic qualities should be well known & shown widely, not left as a hobby for his quiet times. Sir Winston Churchill, Johnson's hero himself made fabulous art works that are inspirational to us all. From a famous quote from Churchill  \"If you are going through hell, keep going\"\r\nsee here https://bbc.in/2J6WD74  https://bbc.in/2xp6BeJ  https://bit.ly/2ZNL1wq  https://bit.ly/2Jd15kv",
