        "additional_details": "Recently my cat Mew was hit by two vehicles on Devonshire Road. I saw the CCTV footage, the first car was coming fast when he hit her; she was dragged from underneath his car to the next. In the footage she was alive and for a few minutes then she passed away. \r\nOn Blackbird Road my cat Tiny was hit and died on the spot. The road should have speed bumps so people are more careful while driving. \r\nThere have been many accidents on Blackbird Road in Leicester. It is important to add speed bumps here",
