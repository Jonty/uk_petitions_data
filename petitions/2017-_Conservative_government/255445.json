        "additional_details": "All children deserve to be believed. They have a right to feel safe. These men should not be allowed to continue to see their victims just because they fathered them. It is the ultimate control and the emotional affect this has on children has far reaching consequences. Children deserve to be heard and protected. Family courts should always make decisions based on the best interests of the child and not the wishes of the accused parent.",
        "background": "Currently in the family courts, contact can still be given to parents who have previously been accused by their own children of sexual abuse. Often with minors the CPS do not have evidence to secure a conviction so these people are released without charge and can resume contact with their victim(s).",
