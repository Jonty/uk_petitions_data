        "additional_details": "These exams can create multiple mental illnesses due to the constant need to revise - 2/3 of students who suffer from mental health problems blame the pressures of succeeding in school. 6 in 10 students report they feel levels of stress that interfere with their day to day lives. Additionally, 77% of all students report that they have a fear of failure - a significant reduction of work load during these two years would considerably ease this situation.",
        "background": "During year 12 and 13 in the UK you are expected to complete a two year course consisting of 3 A level subjects - it is known that these exams are difficult however the extent of the word difficult is an understatement; the amount of content needed for these exams is excessive and should be reduced.",
