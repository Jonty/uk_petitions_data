        "additional_details": "I found out in 2014, that I had GBS. I only knew when I went to hospital as I was spotting. Drs examined me and took a swab test. 2 days later, My GP rang me to tell me. My Pregnancy notes where flagged up with a sticker so all Midwife & hospital staff were aware. Upon my due date, I had blood tests, and upon pre delivery (C Section) the hospital had bags of my blood type on standby, and antibiotics incase anything happened. Also, they were prepared if anything happened to baby.\r\nPlease note, it affects both Mother and Child lives.My Daughter is now 4 years old. If it wasn't for the swab test. It may have been different for both of us.",
