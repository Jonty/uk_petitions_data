In most cases, it\u2019s the impact that a health condition has on the person\u2019s life that qualifies them for support or protection under the law. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about sex discrimination here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/discrimination-because-of-sex-or-sexual-orientation/discrimination-because-of-sex/\r\n\r\nYou can find out more about showing that you're disabled under the Equality Act here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/protected-characteristics/showing-you-re-disabled-under-the-equality-act/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to issue guidance and fund an information campaign to make employers aware of their duties to menopausal workers. "
