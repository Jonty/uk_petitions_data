You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/offences/magistrates-court/item/fail-to-stopreport-road-accident-revised-2017/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, calling for failing to stop to attract a mandatory two year prison sentence, if that's what you want to happen.\r\n"
