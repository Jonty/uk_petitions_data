At best it costs them their self esteem and confidence and at worst in too many cases their lives. \r\nCurrent focus on developing positive and respectful relationships is clearly not working and the impact of this is devastating.",
        "background": "Under current U.K. legislation there is not a specific law making cyber bullying illegal. The system in place is trying to play catch up to a growing problem that is already out there with little regulation or control relying on old laws to bridge the gaps.",
