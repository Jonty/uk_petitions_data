        "action": "Legislation ensuring airlines must seat vulnerable people with their guardians",
        "additional_details": "Airlines are exploiting a human right for vulnerable people to be protected by charging additional for seat allocation on a first come first served basis  and are avoiding responsibility for the safety of ALL passengers. Inevitably a vulnerable person will be abused, assaulted , bullied on an airline and the question asked will be \"why were families or vulnerable separated\". With modern booking systems there is no reason why seat allocation can't be made within the price in the first instance",
        "background": "When booking a flight it should be guaranteed within the price that vulnerable people and young children are seated with their parent/guardian/carer and not exposed to risk of harm by separation on the plane. Protection of children is a right & not a privilege that can be purchased as an \"add on\"",
