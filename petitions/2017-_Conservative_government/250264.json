        "additional_details": "In Great Britain there is great pride that our Country is approachable by all from around the world due to both our belief in democracy and our willingness to compromise, but also accept when our side of an issue is defeated.\r\nOur Armed Services have fought bravely and many paid the ultimate price to defend that belief in democracy; it would bring shame on this Great Country to dishonour that sacrifice by permitting our parliamentary system to turn its back on what they were sent to fight for.",
        "background": "The principle of democracy is that when  a decision is made based on a majority vote, regardless of how large or small, that decision stands.\r\nTo permit those who's preferred outcome did not succeed, to then call for a second vote because they do not accept the outcome of the first is undemocratic.",
