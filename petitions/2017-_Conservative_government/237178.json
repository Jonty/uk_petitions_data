        "additional_details": "Nowadays it is easy, fast and cheap to make a DNA paternity test. If the paternity test results with a negative result, the man should have a choice to avoid any legal/financial responsibility and owe no alimonies whatsoever, unless he consciously chooses to accept the child as his own (whilst being fully aware that it was conceived by someone else). ",
        "background": "Approximately 20% of the men in the UK who get a paternity test turn out not to be fathers of their alleged children. A paternity DNA check should be offered for free at birth. It should also be offered if a mother claims that someone is the father after some time passes since the birth.",
