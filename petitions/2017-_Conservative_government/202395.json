        "additional_details": "Why does the Health Insurance Industry provide cover for your body but not for your mind? \r\n\r\nWhy can you get cover or claim money back when you see an Acupuncturist/Osteopath/Chiropractor but you can't get the same cover to see a Therapist?\r\n\r\nHypnotherapy is quick & effective treatment for a range of mental health issues, including; anxiety, depression, fears, phobias & addictions - ultimately helping reduce the burden on the NHS. So why is Hypnotherapy not covered under health insurance schemes?",
        "background": "1 in 4 people are affected by mental health disorders & urgently need access to affordable therapies. The NHS simply cannot cope & our mental health services are in crisis. Astonishingly, the Health Insurance Industry does not consider 'health' to include mental well being & fails to provide cover.",
