        "additional_details": "We are tired of seeing cyclists continue to ride two or more abreast, spilling into traffic and impeding traffic flow.\r\n\r\nWe are tired of the safety hazards such cyclists present. We believe no other safety initiative will deliver better results than compelling cyclists to ride Single File.  indeed, every text book on the subject of Risk Management says that \u201cisolating a hazard\u201d is a superior solution to changing the way people operate. A bike lane is an example of \u201cIsolating the Hazard\u201d.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, respectfully call on the Transport Minister to implement Compulsory Single File for all cyclists who ride in groups,  regardless of whether a bike lane exists or not..",
