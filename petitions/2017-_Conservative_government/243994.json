        "action": "Restrict food imports produced below UK welfare and environmental standards.",
        "additional_details": "The British public cares where its food comes from and the impact that it's production has on the environment as well as welfare standards.  Food produced outside of the UK imported without restriction to lower standards would be a deception to the consumer and would export the impact of our consumption overseas.  There must be trade protection to prevent the import of food products produced using methods not permitted in the UK.",
        "background": "UK food and agricultural products are produced to some of the highest environmental and welfare standards across the world. Outside of the EU, international trade deals could incorporate provision for the importing of food which has not been produced to these standards.",
