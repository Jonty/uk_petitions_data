        "action": "Make it law for alcohol producers to put all ingredients used on packaging",
        "additional_details": "Often when emailing companies to enquire about the brewing/fermenting process or even just ingredients they will not give you a straight answer, or will tell you something whilst telling other people conflicting information. To avoid this I believe it would be simpler for companies to put ingredients and manufacturing methods on packaging or have the information freely available on websites. This would avoid any health complications due to hidden ingredients/manufacturing processes.",
        "background": "A lot of alcohol contains hidden ingredients people wouldn't think of: such as lactose and isinglass. These ingredients/processing methods may go against peoples' religious beliefs or they may be allergic to these ingredients.",
