At the height of the blaze, it covered more than 25,000sq. metres.\r\n\r\nWe need to take better care of our moorland and national parks. Banning the sale of disposable barbecues will not completely erase the problem, but it will offer a huge step in the correct direction. And this will relieve unnecessary pressure on our emergency services. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/marsden-moor-fire-bbq-live-16162334",
