Having different packaging may provoke more thought.\r\n\r\nSince having damaging photos on cigarette packets, people who smoke have declined by thousands.  Whilst it will be argued meat isn\u2019t a similar health issue, I\u2019d like to say it is, not just for high red meat intake contributing to obesity and heart disease. But dairy can be extremely bad for our bodies, especially from lactating animals we have not evolved from. Secondly, our government is trying to reduce our carbon footprint. If people think twice about what they consume, this could help the environment.",
