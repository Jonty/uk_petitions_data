        "additional_details": "At time of writing, there is no deal for joint EU-UK research funding after Brexit. The UK will not have access to the same amount of funding and hundreds of top level research jobs will be lost due to the shortfall, unless the UK government increases domestic research budgets. https://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/news/uk-institutions-and-researchers-top-recipients-eu-innovation-funding_en\r\n\r\nUK HE institutes received ~\u20ac1.2 billion in 2015 http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm",
        "background": "We rely heavily on EU research funding ~\u20ac1.2 billion p.a. from Horizon 2020, there is no clear plan on how this will be replaced after Brexit. I ask that the future funding is guaranteed and extra UK grants are made that at least match or better the input from Horizon 2020 to UK HE institutions.",
