In our area we have to wait 6 months for an appointment with a councillor or therapist through the NHS. Someone with a physical illness wouldn\u2019t have to wait 6 months so why should someone with mental illness have to wait 6 months. Too many young lives are being lost due to lack of funding and support, this needs to stop!",
