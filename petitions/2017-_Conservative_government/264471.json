        "additional_details": "I have studied A-Level law , English language and geography for 2 years and have worked very hard for a good result to come in summer 2019. Based upon different topics from different colleges being in my exam paper , it has seriously affected the outcome of my grades. Teachers 'warn' students to not answer the 'wrong' question in the paper as at least one student will due to the confusion of the exam paper layout. Exam boards need only to include questions specific to that institution.",
        "background": "A levels are studied for 2 years , the result based upon 1 exam. UK exam boards have 2 years to compose 3 papers that are used across the nation. However , an individual institutions exam paper does not have questions based on the required content studied at the college specifically.",
