        "additional_details": "The system is utterly unfair. Entry Clearance Officers' decisions are  poor yet can not be challenged. British citizens & UK residents in the UK are denied spending time with their family members. Refusal letters start: \"I recognise that family visits are important\" followed by poor arguments & decisions, overlooking facts & evidence in front of ECOs. \r\n\r\nBringing Back the Right of Appeal to Family Visit Visa Applicants would be the best course of action to avoid this appalling abuse.",
        "background": "The current system of Family Visit Visas is utterly unfair. \r\n\r\na) When one applies for a Family visit Visa & Visa is refused no right of appeal is given. \r\nb) Decisions are no longer made at the respective Embassies in the country which avoids the face to face interview.",
