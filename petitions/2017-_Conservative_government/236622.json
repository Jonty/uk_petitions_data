        "additional_details": "Why is it an issue? Potatoes contain carbohydrate levels but each variety of potatoes or growing methods can alter the carbohydrate meaning two bags can have big difference in carb values which could lead to the wrong insulin being given.\r\n\r\nOne popular supermarket routinely does not provide any nutrientional information on their fruit and vegetables.",
        "background": "Type 1 diabetics require insulin to survive. The dose to be given must be calculated by the carbohydrate amount in food. \r\n\r\nIt is currently not a legal requirement to provide this information on unprocessed fruit and vegetables leading to potentially dangerous under/over dosing of insulin.",
