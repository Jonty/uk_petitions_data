        "additional_details": "Less than 12% of dogs come from licenced breeders according to PETA. The other 88% come from establishments such as \u201cpuppy mills\u201d. These are organisations that breed puppies for sale often on an intensive scale which borders on inhuman conditions. The dogs are kept in small cages made of wood or wire mesh. Female dogs are forced to bred over and over again until they can\u2019t produce anymore puppies at which point they are either autioned off or killed. The dogs produced can have genetic defects.",
        "background": "There were 85,000 case of abuse to dogs in 2016. This is a small proportion of the number of animals that are being harmed by people. How many more animals are we going to allow to be harmed before we do something? We have to be the voice for the animals as they are unable to express their feelings.",
