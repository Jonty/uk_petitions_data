        "background": "At the recent Conservative Party Conference, Theresa May announced a policy which would see recent Plan 2 graduates not have to start repaying their student loans until they earn more than \u00a325,000, while plan 1 graduates will still be expected to make repayments thousands of pounds earlier.",
