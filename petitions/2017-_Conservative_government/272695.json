        "additional_details": "As an example Anna Soubry MP crossed the floor from the Conservative party to the Independent group where she has consistantly worked against the government and the departure from the EU. Her constituency overwhelmingly voted to leave the EU so she is now working against her electorates wishes. She has unfairly used crossing the floor (as have others) as a means to retain her position as an MP where she would have likely been deselected by local party members.",
        "background": "The electorate would like a means of replacing MP's who are no longer represntative of the party, manifesto and policies for which they were elected. An MP who crosses the floor to oppose thier electorate is abusing the electorates trust which should not be allowed to continue unhindered.",
