        "action": "Teach schools about emotional & physical wellbeing, mental health & illnesses",
        "additional_details": "As a sufferer of mental illness from a very early age due to family problems & bullying, I think its vital that children should have the opportunity to be more educated on the affects of mental illness as it has such an impact on them in the future. Introducing wellbeing & complementary therapy classes to the curriculum I believe would help a lot of children understand how mental illness works and how to tackle it positively. I strongly believe that emotional and physical wellbeing is crucial.",
        "background": "I think it is very important that from a young age our children should be taught more about the effects of mental illness and show them a positive outlook on life through physical and emotional wellbeing. This can be yoga, meditation, holistic studies etc. Our children are our future!",
