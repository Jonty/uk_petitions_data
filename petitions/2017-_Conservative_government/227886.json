For those with pets that comply with cabin regulations, it is simply unnecessary to either not be able to fly into Britain or have to leave a pet behind for an extended period of time.\r\nWhy are we able to fly out with pets in cabin and not back into the UK?\r\nThe British are among the biggest animal-lovers in the world. Let's make it easier to enjoy family holidays together!",
        "background": "Ever tried going on holiday with your best friend? \r\nUnfortunately for pet owners that live in the UK the options are limited: 1. leave your dog in a kennel (if family/friends is not an option) 2. take your pet with you and return via ferry or car 3. ship your pet as cargo in the hold.",
