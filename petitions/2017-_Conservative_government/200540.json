        "additional_details": "I live in DA1 and it once took 45 minutes to get to Asda Greenhithe because of this level of inconsiderate driving. Yesterday it accounted for nearly 20 minutes of delay because of HGV drivers blocking the A225 Princes Road junction with the roundabout. Local residents have the right to go about their daily business without the fear of being delayed by such inconsiderate drivers, who are only interested in themselves. Plus there are frequent law infringements on this roundabout.",
        "background": "Drivers bypass the A282 by using the A2 junction roundabout and then the A225 junction when the traffic is bad. This causes severe delays to Dartford residents going about their daily business. Drivers doing this show no consideration to other drivers and they should be fined for using this dodge.",
