        "action": "Leave EU with or without a deal and call a referendum in 90 days to re-join EU",
        "additional_details": "A section of the voters argue that consequences of leaving the EU were not debated accurately prior to the last referendum. The outcome of the referendum could be different otherwise. Yet another section is convinced that the result was final and is not likely to change even after another referendum. While leaving the EU shall be a clear recognition of the will of the people, calling another referendum within 90 days of leaving the EU is practical and shall settle the debate decisively.",
        "background": "On 23/06/16 the UK decided to leave the EU. The will of the people must be implemented. However, the narrow margin of the result led to uncertainties and these increased further due to the Parliament's handling of the withdrawal. The public must now take control of the process and act decisively.",
