        "additional_details": "Recently several Labour MPs have quit the Labour Party to become Independent Members of parliament without having to call a by-election to ask voters what they think \r\n\r\nThat is undemocratic \r\n\r\nWhether i vote for a Labour candidate Conservative or Liberal Democrat i expect that if they are elected they should stay loyal . If they are unable to remain within that political party than an automatic by-election should be held ASAP so voters get to choose between the incumbent or a new MP",
