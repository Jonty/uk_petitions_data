        "additional_details": "It's been 52 long, hard and arduous years since our great nation has won the Fifa World Cup. Every competition since, we've trained hard, played hard, and fought harder, but still, over half a century later, we've yet to claim the trophy again.\r\n\r\nHowever, this tide of misfortune may well be due to turn. Our skill, intelligence, and youthful exuberance, coupled with a slice of overdue luck, could well have put us on our way to victory.\r\n\r\nLets be united as one, and get them their bank holiday!",
        "background": "This is an urge, a rallying call, and a test of allegiance. Let's all stand behind our boys in Russia. Lets show our gratitude and pride in our brothers, by getting one day, each year, for the next four years, dedicated to celebrating their remarkable, but well deserved success.",
