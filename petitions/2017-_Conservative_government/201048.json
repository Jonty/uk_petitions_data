        "additional_details": "They are already banned in Wales, so why not the rest of the UK? \r\n\r\nThey are used by many who call themselves trainers but don't actually hold any training or behavioural qualifications. Seen as a 'quick fix' many are eager to rush into using one then to work on their dogs issues in a more positive way. \r\n\r\nOut walking i have personally seen many dogs who are on E-collars and due to their 'trainers' advice their owners would never leave home without them. This needs Changing. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/our-resources/kennel-club-campaigns/electric-shock-collars/\r\n\r\nhttp://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=15332",
        "background": "Electric Shock Collars are worn around a dogs neck and deliver a Electric Shock when the dog does not perform what is asked. These devices are unnecessary and cruel. Besides causing the dogs fear and discomfort they don't teach the dog what is actually desired.",
