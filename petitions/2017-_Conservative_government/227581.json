        "action": "Remove legal privilege from the PHSO so police can investigate misconduct",
        "additional_details": "The PSHO should not appear to be above the law. During the investigation into the death of my son, I believe that staff didn\u2019t do their jobs correctly which led to a flawed report and decision. I\u2019ll never be able to know for sure however because the police are not able to investigate. This means I will  never know the truth behind my son\u2019s death. This is unacceptable.",
        "background": "The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman has legal privilege which means that the police cannot look at their case files to investigate allegations of staff misconduct in public office. The PHSO investigates the death of our loved ones but the police have never been able to intervene.",
