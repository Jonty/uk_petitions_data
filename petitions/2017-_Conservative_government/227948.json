All it took was for me to google their name and gather information as to why they were in prison, how long their sentence was and their address. People\u2019s identities should be protected in GP and hospital waiting rooms.",

However they don\u2019t seem to apply when in a waiting room, the professional will call you through by using your full name in front of other people.",
