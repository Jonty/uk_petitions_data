        "additional_details": "I am starting this petition after a prisoner attached to their guard in a waiting room was called through for his appointment. All it took was for me to google their name and gather information as to why they were in prison, how long their sentence was and their address. People\u2019s identities should be protected in GP and hospital waiting rooms.",
        "background": "Confidentiality is up most important in settings such as GP surgeries and hospitals. Data protection laws are tougher now than ever. However they don\u2019t seem to apply when in a waiting room, the professional will call you through by using your full name in front of other people.",
