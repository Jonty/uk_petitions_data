        "background": "Certain (very limited) electric scooters, power-boards e.t.c can be allowed on public roads. Provided that the rider has passed a CBT license & that fee of roughly \u00a350 is charged for tax.\r\nObviously scooters have zero emissions & their use should be encouraged as a non fossil fuel alternative.",
