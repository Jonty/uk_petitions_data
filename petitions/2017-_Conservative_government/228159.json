Motorway service areas charge up to \u00a330.00 often for poor food and cold and dirty showers, and not all companies will pay for this. So the driver has to park in lay-bys and Industrial estates risking their lives/loads/diesel etc... Let us urge the government to sort out somewhere for our truckers to park safely and freely in this country. Places like Germany/France/Spain etc have free parking for trucks, Why can't we?",
