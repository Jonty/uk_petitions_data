        "additional_details": "The Government has had over two years to come to an agreement concerning the transition arrangements for leaving the UK. Yet, we are now faced with the likely prospect of leaving the European Union without a deal in less than a month. We cannot sit by and let incompetence dominate the future of our country. This hung parliament is not fit for purpose for making such a huge decision. We owe it to future generations to intervene and call upon Government and Parliament to ask the people to decide.",
        "background": "Despite the will of Parliament it is increasingly looking likely that the UK could leave Europe without a deal. This is not a result of deliberate thinking but chaos that lies at the heart of the current hung government. The Fixed Term Parliament Act 2011 provides for early elections to be held.",
