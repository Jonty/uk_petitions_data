        "additional_details": "In the face of news that Britain is preparing for the possibility of war with North Korea, we the undersigned call on our democratically elected representatives to adopt a stance of military neutrality. With the allegiances of various international military powers clearly polarized, North Korea could easily prove a flashpoint for a third world war, and this is nobody's interest.",
        "background": "The \u2018special relationship\u2019 between the USA and the UK should not extend to putting British lives at risk in order to support the belligerent whims of a dangerously blinkered, thin-skinned narcissist, and our military should not be used as an extension of his unstable mind and impulsive rhetoric.",
