        "action": "Formally apologise for the Amritsar massacre after 100 years of failing to do so",
        "additional_details": "The entire issue has been mired in controversy through Royal visits which perhaps fanned the flames of dismissiveness and injustice more than aiding any sense of responsibility. There is a clear climate where a formal state-issued apology would be not only the minimal expectation, but something readily welcomed by communities in India, particularly those whose relatives were criminally murdered by British forces, simply to \"punish disobedience\" in a population under occupation.",
        "background": "The Amritar massacre, also known as The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, was a horrific offence committed whilst India was under British rule in 1919. This offence, which would be considered a crime against humanity by any modern standard, has been condemned by the British government, but no apology given",
