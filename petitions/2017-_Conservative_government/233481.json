        "additional_details": "The conclusion of the report states that permissiveness of poverty in the UK, especially since 2010, has been a choice. Austerity was opted for with knowledge or ignorance of the fact it would disproportionately affect working class communities, women, disabled and chronically ill people, children and BAME people.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion lays out simple solutions, such as improving public services, social inclusion and reviewing Universal Credit.\r\n\r\nWe demand the Government adopt these recommendations.",
        "background": "Britain is the 5th largest economy in the world and it houses one of the world's key global economic centres.\r\nDespite this, the UN say \u2155th of the population are in poverty, and 1.5 million are destitute.\r\nThe government must immediately adopt recommendations made, and rectify the immense harm done.",
