        "additional_details": "The primary duty of our elected representatives is to do always what they judge best for the nation. Their special duty to constituents is, sometimes, to tell them what voters amongst them want is not in the best interest of the whole UK. Their third consideration should always be the interest of their party and only a free vote allows them truly to fulfil their primary duty. As only 37.4% of the eligible electorate and 26% of UK citizens voted Leave in 2016, democracy is not threatened.",
        "background": "MPs represent all people of the UK, not just voters. They have never been offered a 'free' (of party Whipping) vote to establish what the House of Commons, collectively, judges to be in the best interest of the whole UK. Our democracy requires that MPs, not voters, can be held to account.",
