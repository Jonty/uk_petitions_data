        "additional_details": "The decisions that are made constantly in Parliament affect us just as much, if not more, as those above the age of 18. Lowering the voting age, even by a couple years, will install confidence in our generation that we are equal members of society and that our voices will be heard. Teenagers are more than capable of making educated judgements and we should be allowed to exercise that.",
        "background": "As a teenager, I believe that younger members of society should have the right to contribute to elections and referendums as our voices should be just as respected and recognised as those of older citizens.",
