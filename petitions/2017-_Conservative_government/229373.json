        "additional_details": "During the year 2016/17 the NMC reported \u00a386.155 million in revenue.In 2015/16 revenue totalled \u00a380.265 million. During 2016/17 expenditure totalled \u00a386.646 million. 2015/16 expenditure was \u00a376.344 million. The regulator is generating more revenue and has become more expensive to run. These increases are set within a context of executive resignations, investigations by the Professional Standards Authority and failure in one of the key performance criteria set out by the PSA in 2016/17.",
        "background": "It is unclear from NMC annual reports and PSA performance reviews whether the regulator is operating effectively and efficiently from a financial perspective. The public impact and benefits of spending, including capital expenditure and remuneration are unclear using current measures.",
