            "details": "We are focussed on securing the best possible deal for the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. \r\n\r\nAs was said in the Article 50 letter, the settlement should be in accordance with the law and in the spirit of the UK\u2019s continuing partnership with the EU. The Commission has set out its position on the financial settlement and the Government has undertaken a detailed examination of the technicalities. We are approaching discussions constructively and respectfully, and are confident that we can achieve an outcome that works in the interests of both sides.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has said that we can only resolve the financial implications of the UK's withdrawal as part of the settlement of all the issues addressed in her Florence speech. The Government recognises that the UK has obligations to the EU, and the EU obligations to the UK, that will survive the UK\u2019s withdrawal, and that these need to be resolved.\r\n\r\nIn her Florence Speech, the Prime Minister reassured EU member states that they will not need to pay more or receive less money over the remainder of the current budget plan as a result of our decision to leave. The Prime Minister also made clear that the UK will honour its commitments made during the period of our membership. \r\n\r\nThe UK continues to play a full part in EU business, including on EU budget negotiations. While the UK remains a member of the EU, we remain committed to budgetary restraint and ensuring that we live within the 2013 deal on the Multiannual Financial Framework.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister also acknowledged in her Florence Speech that we will want to continue working with the EU in ways that promote the long-term economic development of our continent. This includes continuing to take part in those specific policies and programmes which are to both the UK and the EU\u2019s joint advantage, such as those that promote science, education and culture \u2013 and those that promote our mutual security.  Should this participation be agreed upon, we would expect to make an ongoing contribution to cover our fair share of the costs involved.  \r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nWe are focussed on securing the best possible deal for the United Kingdom as we leave the European Union. Once we have left, decisions on how taxpayers\u2019 money is spent will be made in the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union",
