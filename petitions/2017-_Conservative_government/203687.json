        "action": "Make performing a cosmetic surgical procedure without relevant insurance illegal",
        "additional_details": "The past 10 years has seen a significant increase in cosmetic procedures carried out in the UK within an industry which remains largely unregulated.  Consequently, there has also been an alarming increase in patients using NHS services to correct failed cosmetic procedures as a result of under-insured /uninsured practitioners. Due to a long existing  data vacuum, the true cost to the NHS is unknown, potentially running to tens of thousands per patient.",
        "background": "Practitioners who choose to operate without relevant insurance and who make mistakes are ruining lives and costing the NHS millions of pounds for putting right botched operations.  Rogue practitioners currently do not face the threat of criminal action if they don't have relevant insurance in place.",
