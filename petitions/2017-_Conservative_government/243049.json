        "additional_details": "Current powers effectively give a politician(s) too much power to revoke someone's British Citizenship. These need to amended so that there are more \"checks and balances\" to these powers.\r\n \r\nThese powers should also be curtailed so that even dual nationals (who wouldn't be left Stateless if Citizenship was revoked), can only have their citizenship revoked for convictions related to  \"War Crimes\" or \"Serious Terrorist acts\".",
        "background": "Home Secretary has recently revoked someone's British Citizenship, by using details of the person's parent's ethnic heritage, to claim they could claim citizenship elsewhere (claim is they would therefore not be left Stateless). This was even though the person is not a dual national.",
