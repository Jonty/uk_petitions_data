These need to amended so that there are more \"checks and balances\" to these powers.\r\n \r\nThese powers should also be curtailed so that even dual nationals (who wouldn't be left Stateless if Citizenship was revoked), can only have their citizenship revoked for convictions related to  \"War Crimes\" or \"Serious Terrorist acts\".",
