        "additional_details": "We have royal mail deliver to our homes,Parcel force do not deliver past Aberdeen as they do not have a depot any further north. They pass the delivery on to royal mail this is done with no extra cost involved. Local centres are dotted around the area for all major courier companies for drop off and collections. The issue is when we want a delivery made using one of the major companies we get charged extra as we are seen as not part of the UK mainland. This is clearly a money making exercise.",
        "background": "I live in Aberdeenshire Scotland having moved from Surrey Engand and companies charge extra to deliver to my home address. This is UK mainland there are no sea crossings to access Scotland from England. This is a huge concern for the people of Scotland as it means costs are unfair.",
