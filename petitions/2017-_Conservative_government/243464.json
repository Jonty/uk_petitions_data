        "action": "Give self-employed people the right to access statutory adoption/maternity pay",
        "additional_details": "Having recently gone through the adoption process, the inequalities between PAYE and self-employed people is vast. As PAYE I still got paid, but my husband, who is self-employed lost \u00a35600 in potential earnings. The day after our daughter moved home he went back to work because if he doesn't work he doesn't get paid.\r\nThe government should offer support to self-employed people by giving statutory pay for adoption, maternity and paternity leave, removing some financial pressure from them.",
        "background": "Self-employed people have to choose to loose earnings in the pursuit of becoming 'mum & dad' as currently they are not entitled to statutory pay for adoption/maternity or paternity leave. A self-employed person is entitled to no support in spite of paying taxes and national insurance contributions.",
