        "additional_details": "This problem often relates to SEN support, mental or physical illness provision, bullying, or disability discrimination. The lack of accountability in the system creates severe difficulties for families & denies many children the support & education they need. \u2018Not Fine in School\u2019 call for a new independent, transparent & objective body to enable a fair complaints process, which is NOT investigated by the complained of services. This body must be empowered to monitor practices & instigate consequences when schools or local authorities use local (invalid) policies, or act in an ultra vires way.",
        "background": "Legislation and DfE guidance state how schools and local authorities must comply with the law. If statutory guidance or duties are not followed, enforcement is left to solo families using ineffective complaint procedures, or the LGO service, which won\u2019t act in the face of ultra vires local policies.",
