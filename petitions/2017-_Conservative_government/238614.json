        "additional_details": "Sign this petition if you wish for the future generation to sustain a healthy government and economy. Slight changes to the school timetables could reduce the irritation of children and allow them to fulfil their full potential. Overall, school should start at 10:00 in the morning so children come to school prepared and ready to learn.",
        "background": "It is scientifically proven that children are more alert at 10am. We believe that children should come to school fully awake and ready for the day of learning ahead of them. Children find it difficult to wake up and get ready and that is one of the reasons that they dislike attending school.",
