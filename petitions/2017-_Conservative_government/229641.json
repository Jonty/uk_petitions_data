        "additional_details": "A single earner of \u00a360k will be on a 40% tax bracket with no child benefit yet 2 parents can earn \u00a343k each at 20% and get full child benefit. Families work extremely hard to enable one of the parents to look after their children during their youngest years rather than a stranger but the government seems to want to make this extremely difficult. There is also very little public Information to inform you that you lose this when you hit \u00a360k meaning you end up in debt to the inland revenue.",
        "background": "The rules introduced in 2012 that child benefit should be capped at \u00a360,000 are fundementally flawed. A single income of \u00a360,000 means that you are not entitled to any child benefit yet 2 parents working can earn \u00a398,000 and get the full entitlement.",
