        "action": "No one can become an MP without having worked 15 years in the workplace.",
        "additional_details": "Too many current politicians take PPE at university, join lobby or other political organisations, then seek a parliamentary seat.  Ambition, rather than vocation, is their motivation; this is not in the national interest.  Parliament lacks expertise in industrial, engineering, and practical areas.  Academics are needed too, but most decisions require life experiences that the majority of MPs do not have.  We need you to work for us, not just further your ambitions, and play power games.",
        "background": "'Career' politicians do not have experience of our lives in the UK.  The 'workplace' is defined as any job that is not associated with politics.  EG salaried lobbyists and union representatives would not be able to become MPs unless they had also worked in other professions for 15 years.",
