        "additional_details": "The penalty as it stands for culprits is a lifetime ban from their supported football clubs and this punishment is not enough as more players, even high profile British (black) players are suffering racial abuse on a regular basis so much so that it is being highlighted on the news therefore there must be a law on this to clamp down on racism at football matches. At bear minimum guilty culprits should receive a \u00a31,000 fine along with possible prison sentence and a lifetime ban at supported club.",
        "background": "I want to make racism at football matches subject to tougher penalties because I have suffered racial abuse myself and have attended more than a handful of football matches where I have witnessed racism aimed towards the football players (especially black).",
