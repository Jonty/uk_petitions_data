        "additional_details": "So that we can decided clearly and indecisively who runs The U.K. This last general election failed us. The Conservative party clearly Expected to win and didn\u2019t present their side, and labour fought but didn\u2019t give a clear plan for their brexit, however now that Labour, like the Conservatives, have clarified their brexit strategy we, the British people deserve to make a choice, to benefit is locally and nationally.",
        "background": "At this time of political uncertainty, Britain needs to have a clear leader and a strong party to back them up. At the moment, the country doesn\u2019t have a party with a strong mandate or a certain one. I believe that we need a chance for all political parties to present to us their arguments.",
