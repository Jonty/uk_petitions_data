        "action": "Stop pharmacies from being able to withhold medicines on the grounds of beliefs",
        "additional_details": "Through these experiences, many women are going home and worrying about possible pregnancy. In the health and social care industry, care and treatment cannot be withheld due to the personal beliefs of staff as it would be a violation of human rights. It shouldn\u2019t be okay for pharmacists to withhold medicines from women on this basis - providing medicine and treatment for contraceptive purposes is a large role of a Pharmacist and failing to provide these is a failure in a first world country.",
        "background": "I\u2019ve recently heard several women\u2019s experiences of being withheld contraceptive medicines like the morning after pill because of pharmacists' personal beliefs.",
