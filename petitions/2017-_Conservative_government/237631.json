Well it\u2019s simple, we want to control the numbers of migrants into our country. \r\n\r\nWithout controls on immigration, things like infrastructure and housing are easily overwhelmed, and resentment can build up in communities. You experience the same concerns in your own country.\r\n\r\nSo, convince your friends to allow controlled migration. Then we can go back to squabbling about who gets the last potato at Christmas.",
        "background": "To our sometimes dysfunctional, other times tolerated, and occasionally welcomed-with-open-arms family in Germany.\r\n\r\nWe are very grateful to receive your letter telling us that you love us and our stereo-typical British mannerisms. We too are sad to be leaving your club.",
