        "additional_details": "Voyeurism is an offence under the Sexual Offences Act 2003.\r\n\r\nThis offence consists of somebody watching/filming victims doing a private act without their consent. This can then be distributed over fake porn sites, social media and across the internet for others sexual needs. 2 years is not justice!\r\n\r\nA private act can be from bathing, using a toilet, anything you would deem as private and personal, and people do not deserve to have their privacy taken and publicly distributed without knowing.",
        "background": "Victims who are put through this vile offence are life changing, physically and mentally. Their ability to trust is taken away & yet the offender will only receive a maximum of 2 years imprisonment - with a 3rd off if they plead guilty. This is not in anyway justice for victims.",
