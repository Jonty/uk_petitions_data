        "additional_details": "As an activist I write frequently to MP's and in the main, I do so by email. For those who are able to generate an email inquiry it demonstrates access to the internet and in such a case, an email response is perfectly acceptable.\r\nWe are now at a stage in history where consumerism threatens to destroy us - it seems a perfect time in history to at least reduce the cost of mailing out replies on paper when it is no longer necessary.\r\nFor those who write beautiful letters - long may it continue.",
        "background": "Letters from politicians (in response to email queries or complaints), are often replied to by post, on quality paper. \r\nIt seems apropos for parliament to enter the digital age, reducing the impact upon the environment and the cost to the taxpayer. \r\nExpense claims falling as a result.",
