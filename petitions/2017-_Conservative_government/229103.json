        "additional_details": "From the nhs website proves 3 adults a day loose their life to asthma. These people aren't those who can't control asthma they also include people who can not afford the prescription price! This includes myself. I believe if we open up free prescriptions to asthmatics that our emergency services and hospital staff will be able to focus on more pressing situations. When a person is able to freely get medication and has help to control their asthma there will be alot less strain on the NHS !",
        "background": "I suffer and have suffered all my life (29 years) with asthma! I no longer revive free prescriptions as my partner 'earns too much! But when 3 adults a day loose their life to asthma! Something needs to be done to allow people free inhalers to save their lives!",
