        "additional_details": "Where to start! Brexit is a fine example, the public has been blatantly lied to and yet no-one it seems is accountable. Worse, we are now making one of the most important decisions in our modern political history on the basis of continued lies and misinformation. If a company makes false claims this can result in criminal prosecution. Its called fraud. Let's treat politicians the same way as company executives and clean up our frankly shabby and increasingly corrupt system.",
        "background": "I am no longer prepared to allow politicians to keep lying to the public without any recourse. We are fed propaganda daily which is concocted and massaged by spin doctors to present desired messages in a favourable light and frequently flies in the face of clear facts. We must hold them to account.",
