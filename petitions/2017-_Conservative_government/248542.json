        "additional_details": "A typical English GCSE involves learning, a number of poems, multiple texts and plays. Many of which were written over 50 years ago. They do not prepare the children for their future. Instead they should be replaced with pieces that have relevance for the child's future. Possible texts could include: news articles, parliament reports, laws and understanding contracts. Writing, should include pieces such as CV cover letters, formal letters and reports not fictional writing. \r\nMaths should include topics such as taxation, mortgages and loans. These help the child understand and learn skills that are relevant to the childs future.",
        "background": "Maths and English GCSEs haven't changed with the modern world. Vital skills that the next generation should have are neglected from the maths and english specifications. Skills such as, mortgages, tax payments, writing and inturprating letters and reports.",
