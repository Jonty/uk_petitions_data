Government Ministers or even all MPs paying the full cost of their meals would not save \u00a33.7 million, so we're not sure what specific action you'd like the Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking Parliament or Government to stop subsidising catering in the Houses of Parliament, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
