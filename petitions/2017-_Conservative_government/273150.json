        "additional_details": "If a Member of Parliament finds that they can no longer support or fulfil their election manifesto or pledges and changes their political allegiance, they should be legally compelled to automatically resign their seat and cause a by-election. They may then (provided there are no legal or procedural impediments to their candidacy)  present their new principles to their parliamentary constituency and re-contest the seat under their new allegiance.",
