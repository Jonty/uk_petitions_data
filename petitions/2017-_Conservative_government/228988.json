        "action": "Make trespass a criminal offence to reduce escalation to serious crime and harm.",
        "additional_details": "In my locality initial trespass has been followed by return visits which has led to theft on a number of properties. A more recent incident included a group later identified subsequently by the police in a vacant property stated the damage to gain access to the property was carried out by others so faced no charges. Unfortunately this property has been subject to an arson attack recently. Unresearched mapping should also be attached to this offence as an incitement to trespass.",
        "background": "Fences and the risk of civil prosecution are not sufficient to stop unauthorised access to public, commercial and domestic property. The invisible barrier of criminality to trespass would deter swimmers in reservoirs/minors playing on railways/a deterant to burglary. All have led to fatalities.",
