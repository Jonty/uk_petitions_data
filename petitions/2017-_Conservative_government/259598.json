However palm oil is often disguised, hidden behind many different ingredient names you probably don\u2019t recognise.",
        "background": "The industry is linked to major issues such as deforestation, habitat degradation, climate change, animal cruelty and indigenous rights abuses in the countries where it is produced, as the land and forests must be cleared for the development of the oil palm plantations.",
