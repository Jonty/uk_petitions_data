        "additional_details": "According to stillbirth charity 'Tommy's Organisation', one in every 225 births ends in stillbirth in the UK - making that nine babies every day. It's also estimated that 4.2 million are living with depression associated with previous stillbirth - a number which cannot go ignored.\r\n\r\nIt's imperative to change the future of these bereaved mothers by creating the best environment possible for one to give birth to a dead child, and to ensure we provide the tools to be able to cope with such a loss.",
        "background": "I gave birth to my dead baby boy on a maternity ward 17 years ago surrounded by crying babies. It was soul destroying knowing others were celebrating new life, when a life had been taken from me. Future mothers should never experience this tragedy and is why I am calling for legislative change.",
