        "additional_details": "The Muslim ban. Separating families at the border. Pulling out of the Paris agreement and the Iran deal. Starting trade wars. His approach to the media. Saying there were 'fine people on both sides' following the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville. His response to NFL protests against police violence. These are just a handful of the President's political choices that many people in the UK find troubling. \r\n\r\nWe call on our representatives to make clear that we do not support these views.",
        "background": "We call on Parliament to use the opportunity of President Trump's visit to the UK to condemn in the strongest terms his policy choices. We ask that Parliament pass a motion which makes clear our opposition to his regressive policies.",
