        "action": "Change laws surrounding prostitution to protect sex workers",
        "additional_details": "Legalising it would allow workers to operate safely- they could report abuse they suffer from clients, reducing sex & violence crimes, police would be able to monitor workers & stop child exploitation. Changing laws could generate money through taxes which leads on to the fact that sex workers don\u2019t have employment rights like any other worker in the country despite being one of the oldest professions. Prostitution isn\u2019t going to go away & sending it underground makes it dangerous.",
        "background": "Prostitution has been around since before 1161, it\u2019s one of the oldest professions in the UK- it\u2019s now 2018 and workers still aren\u2019t protected by the law. It\u2019s a harmless act, in fact it provides pleasure for those who may not be able to get it elsewhere so why is it a crime?",

In particular, we\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019d like standard employment protections to apply to prostitution, whether you\u2019d like the UK Government or Parliament to act to prevent the abuse of sex workers, including sex and violent crime, or something else.\r\n \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
