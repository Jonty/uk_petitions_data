        "action": "All schools, by law, should have a Puffin Crossing outside the school gates.",
        "additional_details": "Too many students have sadly passed away after being hit by a car not far from their schools. Sometimes schools campaign to get a Puffin Crossing outside of the gates to prevent injuries from taking place, however they shouldn\u2019t need to. It should be law that a Puffin Crossing is outside the school gates. Myself and two of my peers are starting this petition to not only raise awareness to road safety; we want to make a difference for students in the future.",
        "background": "Too many drivers and pedestrians in the UK have either had fatal injuries or died due to road safety. By having Puffin Crossings outside of schools, we can prevent accidents from happening outside of schools. Help us make a difference to driver's and student's experiences when using the roads.",
