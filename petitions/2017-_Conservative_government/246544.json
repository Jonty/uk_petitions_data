        "action": "Re-implement LGBT+ school programmes, shelved on the basis of parental opinion",
        "additional_details": "By withdrawing LGBT+ inclusivity programmes from school,  we are potentially allowing ourselves to regress as a nation, to a pre-section 28 state of affairs in how inclusivity is taught, thereby encouraging censorship for worry of promoting homosexuality. By teaching students about different types of relationships it fosters acceptance. Such education should be universal, not opt-in or opt-out in nature.",
        "background": "Four more Birmingham schools have dropped a programme of LGBT+ inclusive lessons, as it is revealed that parents have complained to seven primary schools in the Manchester area over sex education classes. The four schools are suspending the No Outsiders programme following complaints from parents.",
