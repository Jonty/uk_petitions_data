        "additional_details": "A lack of understanding and fear of the unknown is causing people with Mental Health and Learning Disabilities to become increasingly vulnerable and separated from society. To integrate everyone, including the Mental health and Learning Disability population, creating awareness and understand should decrease behaviours, such as bullying and mate crime, which is significantly higher for vulnerable people. Educating people from a young age should make these stigmatized groups more accepted.",
        "background": "1 in 4 people will have a mental health illness. 1 in 50 people have a learning disability. These figures are increasing and everyone will come into contact with people with mental health issues and learning disabilities on a regular basis. So it is important to know and understand these disorders.",
