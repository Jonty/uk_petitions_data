        "additional_details": "Plain and simple, if you cannot use your arms then you NEED a straw. The evidence so far regarding the alternatives to plastic straws is, the biodegradable ones start degrading when you put them in a hot drink as to the wheat ones, glass ones are dangerous for those who may accidentally bite them, bamboo and other wooden types are not flexible enough, some of the alternatives also change the flavour of the drink.",
        "background": "People with no arms or extremely short arms, people paralysed from the neck down, people with severe arthritis,muscle wasting diseases,cerebral palsy, these are just some disabled people who NEED straws to stay hydrated, my list by no means covers every type of impairment where straws are necessary.",
