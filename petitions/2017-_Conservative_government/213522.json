        "additional_details": "The former Spy\u2019s claims have been proven to be false.\r\n\r\n1. He claimed to have met Corbyn in Parliament on a Saturday, when Parliament was shut.\r\n\r\n2. The date he claimed to meet him there, Jeremy Corbyn was in Derbyshire at socialist conference.\r\n\r\n3. The Czech archivists have said they have no file suggesting Corbyn was an informant.\r\n\r\n4. The German archivists say there is no Corbyn Stasi file, which some people appear to be demanding.",
        "background": "The Sun story claiming Jeremy Corbyn was a Czech informant has led to Conservative MPs including Ben Bradley & Gavin Williamson make disgusting claims about Jeremy Corbyn.\r\nThe PM then distastefully joked at PMQs about it.\r\nWe demand Theresa May apologise on national TV & debunk the story as false.",
