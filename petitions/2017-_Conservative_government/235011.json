        "action": "Revoke Article 50 immediately.",
        "additional_details": "On 10th December 2018 the ECJ ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU on its current terms without requiring permission from the other member countries. Every poll conducted recently shows that the majority of people now wish to remain in the EU. Theresa May is ignoring the change that is clearly apparent amongst the nation and is pursuing this 'will of the people' that doesn't exist. To protect the interests of the nation we must remain in the EU.",
        "background": "It is clear that since the June 2016 referendum that the leave vote was illegally influenced by overspending and outright lies. In the 2 years since there has been no clear direction on where Brexit is going. No one can decide what Brexit is. Remaining in the EU is the only way to protect our nation",
