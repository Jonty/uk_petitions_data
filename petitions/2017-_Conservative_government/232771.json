        "action": "Make weddings more affordable by legalising outdoor & marquee ceremonies",
        "additional_details": "The Victorian law, dating back to 1836, which governs marriage in England & Wales is outdated and pushing up the cost of weddings. Licensed ceremonial venues are becoming more and more expensive and putting people off getting married, especially those looking for weddings to be cheap and personal. Many couples would like to save money by marrying outdoors; in their garden, by the sea or in their wedding marquee. Like the Scottish, we should have the freedom to choose where we legally marry.",
        "background": "In response to the average wedding costing more than \u00a330,000, we need to legalise outdoor & marquee ceremonies as an alternative option to expensive wedding venues. This is legal in Scotland & has saved thousands of couples money. Why is England & Wales still abiding by a 180-year-old Victorian law?",
