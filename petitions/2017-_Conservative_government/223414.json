        "action": "Create charter & new body for complaints about Local Authority Chief Executives",
        "additional_details": "This new body should have all the powers necessary to investigate complaints itself, including being able to call Chief Executives/witnesses to appear, summon documents & records. Most importantly, it must include the complainants to ensure it has the confidence of the public. Currently those in our public services are able to misuse public money to defend themselves by using legal departments to cover up whilst the public face cutbacks to services. The public should have the right to challenge",
        "background": "We need a new tribunal that would carry out hearings against Chief Executives in local authorities/councils who misuse their powers/cover up complaints/are awarded excessive salaries. The new body should recommend that individuals be prosecuted/sacked & recommend ways to reform the local authority.",
