        "additional_details": "I have seen first hand how cyclists can use the road and their vehicles wrongly, and as there are no registration plates there is pretty much nothing that can be done to report the instances. I also feel they should  help foot the bill for all the cycle lanes and adaptions that are being made to the highways to make they journeys they take safer.  Also if there were a way that incidences can be reported then this may make cyclists think more about the way they use the road and also consider other road uses as they are always asking for other road users to consider them.",
        "background": "Cyclists should be made to have an mot test ,a registration plate ,insurance and an appropriate licence to use the cycle on the roads. They should also pay a road fund licence to help with the upkeep of our roads. This is to help their safety and ALL other road users and pedestrians.",
