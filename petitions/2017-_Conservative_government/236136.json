        "action": "Review how sexual assault victims are treated in court",
        "additional_details": "80% of sexual assaults are not reported, I believe this is due to the scary court process and being taken through something so horrific. The defence call these victims liars, sluts and retraumatise them all over again. Something needs to change as damaging and destroying a victim of such crime where there is enough evidence to suggest the suspect is guilty to get them off a charge is not the way forward.",
        "background": "Sexual assault victims often get ripped apart whilst giving evidence and trying to convict their rapist/the person who sexually assaulted them. This can often damage the victim\u2019s mental health and force them not to come forward and report such things or drop out prior to court.",
