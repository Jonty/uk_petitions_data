        "additional_details": "Tyler has changed as seen in his new music and album released in 2017, which is appealing to at least many thousands of fans in the United Kingdom and does not promote violence as he does not ever promote or perform those songs. His punishment has been too extreme for someone who has used ill lyrics at a poor time which many other celebrities have used worse. The people of the United Kingdom want to see him perform again.",
        "background": "In 2015, Tyler, the Creator (an American rapper) was banned from the United Kingdom on \u201cbehaviours unacceptable in the UK.\u201d People make mistakes especially at a young age. What Tyler promotes is music which people adore and has matured as most people do. He's been banned from lyrics he wrote in 2009",
