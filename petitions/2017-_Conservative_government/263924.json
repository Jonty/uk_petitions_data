        "additional_details": "When William and Kate got married a few years back, an extra bank holiday was given. I believe that if the government truly want to honour the hero\u2019s of WW2 and VE Day, then an additional bank holiday should be made and not \u2018moved\u2019 from a previously agreed date.",
        "background": "The government have announced that the early May bank holiday, which was to be Monday May 4th 2020, has now been moved to Friday 8th May 2020 instead. This change will have impacts on events already arranged for the original date as well as cause issues for school with exams.",
