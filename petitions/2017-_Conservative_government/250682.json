        "additional_details": "The current statutory weekly rate of Paternity Pay is \u00a3140.98, or 90% of your average weekly earnings (whichever is lower). For example if you have a moderately paid job of \u00a3300 a week, when the baby is born you will only receive \u00a3140.98 for two weeks, how is this supposed to pay for the welfare of your newborn baby and pay for everything else.",
        "background": "Many father's lose out caring for their newborn babies because they are forced back into work so they don't lose any money and can pay bills, welfare, taxes, etc. If this ruling comes into effect then a father can spend time with their newborn and share the duties equally between mother and father.",
