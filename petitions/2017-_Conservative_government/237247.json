        "action": "Exempt bows of stringed instruments from the Ivory Act registration requirement.",
        "additional_details": "We fully support the ethics behind this act - endangered species and ecosystems must be protected. But these legitimate goals cannot be achieved by clamping down on antique instruments & bows. Musicians now face prosecution if they buy or sell a bow that doesn't conform to the expected registration. Many professional instrument bows will be left worthless and untradeable. This petition applauds the Ivory Act principles, but just asks for this one practicality to be changed for it to be workable.",
        "background": "Musicians, music shops & auction houses are going to be severely affected by a new requirement to register bows of stringed instruments under the Ivory Act. The practicalities of doing so, along with the cost will make it very difficult \u2013 and in some cases impossible - to buy and sell antique bows.",
