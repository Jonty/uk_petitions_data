        "additional_details": "There is no mandate for no deal. There is little time left for Parliament to act. That is why we need to delay an election until an extension is obtained. The opposition has indicated today that they would agree to an election once legislation has been passed. The polls currently indicate that the government would win. This is an 'elephant trap'.",
        "background": "We are facing a suspension of parliament. An election could frustrate parliament's ability to act and pass legislation to prevent us leaving without a deal by default unless we obtain an extension. We need time to include all the options including a referendum if necessary.",
