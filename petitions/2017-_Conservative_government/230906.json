        "action": "Government to ban the production and use of all non-recyclable plastic by 2020.",
        "additional_details": "A Roadmap for Sustainability report found more than 60 countries have introduced bans which are one of the most effective ways to reduce the use of disposable plastic.\r\nPlastic items can take up to\u00a01000 years\u00a0to decompose in landfills. But plastic bags we use in our everyday life take 10-1000 years\u00a0to decompose, burning it is not an option as well as it releases toxic fumes into the air.\r\nUN warned at current levels the earth could be awash with 12 billion tonnes of\u00a0plastic trash by the middle of the century.",
        "background": "Plastic is choking each and every one of us.  It has filled the land, sea and air. We may not want to accept it but it is in our face. We would like the government to take the initiative to stop the production so it is not available for use in UK and other countries will follow.",
