        "additional_details": "All the information on the public health, government and centre for disease control and prevention all state that if you are trying to conceive or your partner is pregnant, you should not travel to zika destinations regardless of the risk level. If you are male it states that you can pass this on to your partner whether pregnant or not. The laws must also apply to partners. Airlines are forcing crew and pilots to continue flying risking the lives and health of their unborn.",

We need a specific law to protect to people trying to conceive.",
