I have seen people offering to pay for nights in a hotel. Why is it the general public standing up against something that is the governments wrong doing? Over a million houses empty and hundreds of thousands of people without homes. So many buildings that could just accommodate a few homeless, rather than harshly turning your nose and letting them die alone. Make your move",

The police would rather arrest a squatting homeless man, than see to his proper needs of accommodation. They deserve shelter. They deserve to right to be alive.",
