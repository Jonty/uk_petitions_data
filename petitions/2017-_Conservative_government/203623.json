However, the British Embassy is taking payment and refusing the majority of visas without any factual reasons, \u00a0and our families who have spent money on the application have no right of appeal! We believe Donald Trump stopped Iranian borns to enter the US, UK government is implying the same rule but not publicly by issuing refusals for unjust reasons that have no basis in fact to many Iranians.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking for a specific change in the rules for visit visas, if that's what you want to happen. "
