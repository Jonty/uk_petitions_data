In particular, we're not sure if you're concerned about hotels using fireworks or private use of fireworks more broadly.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could call for a ban on private firework displays and a restriction to public displays only, if that's what you'd like to happen."
