        "additional_details": "My dog had two claws ripped out from the root due to the local authorities neglect by not maintaining public footbridges correctly. The bridge had been covered by metal sheeting on top of rotten boards, over time and use the metal sheeting has come loose and moved resulting in my dogs claws becoming traped between levels resulting in two claws being ripped out. The local authority failed to compensate/pay vet fees even tho they carried out urgent repair work. Why should we and our pets suffer.",
