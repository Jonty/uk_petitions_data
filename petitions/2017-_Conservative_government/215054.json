        "additional_details": "People need contraceptives. Women and men - regardless of sexuality - need them to stop STIs and unplanned pregnancies. Transgender men who aren't on HRT can use them to stop their periods, and they may have a judgmental family who would treat them harshly if they found out this was why they were getting contraception - especially 13-to-16-year-olds. Making contraceptives over-the-counter will benefit so many people in terms of health and confidentiality, so what are we waiting for?",
        "background": "Contraceptives are currently not sold over-the-counter, you have to get a prescription for one. I believe that this should change. Many people require contraceptive pills and other forms of contraception for different reasons, and they have to go through too much hassle. Make pills over the counter!",
