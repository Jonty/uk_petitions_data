        "additional_details": "Subway, for example, sell a vegetarian option for the same price as the others on their offers menu. However, it is only the salad, so they are just not adding the meat. Their veggie patty is \u00a32 extra. If you went to a bar and asked for a vegetarian burger, they wouldn\u2019t just give you the bun, lettuce and tomato would they? It is one of the only forms of discrimination that is not unacceptable in this country and I firmly believe it should not be allowed. However, Subway is not alone in this.",
        "background": "Since becoming a vegan, I have noticed that many restaurants and chains charge extra for a vegan/ vegetarian option. This is simply not acceptable as it is discrimination and if a restaurant charge extra for a different varient of a meal for religious beliefs, they would be frowned upon.",
