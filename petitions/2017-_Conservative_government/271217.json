        "action": "Hold an emergency referendum to withdraw from the EU.",
        "additional_details": "Polls have shown people are enraged and would now vote differently given the mockery that has been made by the government to leave the EU. \r\n\r\nThis event has been published firmly now for a few years and a no deal brexit is completely worrying to our nation. \r\n\r\nA final vote should be made to remain and or leave as people have seen the effects of the previous referendum.",
        "background": "This has strongly been debated and publicised since 2016. With the population now having a greater understanding and tiredness waiting for a result and in light of this and recent actions by the government an emergency referendum result would be final for a no deal/ remain brexit.",
