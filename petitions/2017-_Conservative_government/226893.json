        "action": "Allow curry houses to bring in migrant staff for minimum UK wage",
        "additional_details": "It is not possible to train someone local in a short time to cook at a commercial standard. Imposing an affordable salary to recruit overseas trained staff helps curry business to stay in the market. To protect from illegal workers, govt. can introduce laws requiring compulsory full-time work, limited stay, and fixed amount deposit to ensure that illegal workers return before the end of their stay. Reducing illegal workers will make a large contribution to UK HM Revenue and tax.",
        "background": "Curry business are penalised in the UK by an unrealistic salary threshold policy of \u00a329750.00. Staff shortages in the industry means many business are closing down. UK should allow curry business bring knowledgeable staff from abroad for practical salaries to protect small businesses.",
