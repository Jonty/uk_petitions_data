        "additional_details": "A lot of student nurses get depressed, anxiety and are over tired because they put so much hard work into their nursing degrees especially from all the placements including night shifts. A lot more get stressed because they physically can\u2019t afford to live due to overpriced student housing and then money to live off for the whole year. There is also transport to think about for nurses going to placement. Student nurses feel like they\u2019re \u2018cheap labour\u2019 for the NHS which is awful and upsetting.",
        "background": "Nursing students whilst in University work full time with the NHS. For some people, the money that they get from the NHS and their loan isn\u2019t even enough to cover their rent and living costs. ",
