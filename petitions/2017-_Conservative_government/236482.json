        "additional_details": "The Government states that it has received a firm mandate from the UK electorate to take steps to leave the EU. However, that mandate does not bind it to a \u2018divorce\u2019 on 29 March of this year. \r\n\f\r\nThe ECJ has confirmed that the Article 50 notice can be revoked by the UK Government, without a parliamentary vote. (Case C/621/18 Wightman & ors v SoS for Exiting the EU)\r\n\r\nArt. 50 could be triggered again in the future, once current obstacles have been overcome.",
        "background": "The terms of the UK's departure from the EU have not been fully negotiated. \r\n\r\nThere's the risk of severe delays at seaports; no technical solution available to manage a customs border, or control the movement of people across the Irish border that doesn't offend the terms of the Belfast Agreement.",
