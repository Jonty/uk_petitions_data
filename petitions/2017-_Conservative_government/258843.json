        "additional_details": "Adding a NOTA option would prevent unpopular candidates and causes claiming to have greater support than they actually do and mean that spoilt ballots can genuinely be treated as voter error. The NOTA option would be a clear, cheap and easy way for the general public to indicate a dissatisfaction with their representation that could otherwise alienate them from their politicians.",
        "background": "Protest votes are cast when voters spoil their ballot or vote for an option that's unlikely to win. For democracy to work, the results of a vote must show exactly how the voters feels. If there are people who can't face voting for any of the available options then the results should show this.",
