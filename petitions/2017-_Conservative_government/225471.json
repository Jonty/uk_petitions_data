        "action": "Increase the lowest maintenance loans from student finance.",
        "additional_details": "The lowest loan you can get whilst living on your own is around \u00a34000 a year, for me, this was not even enough to cover just my rent let alone food. Many people find themselves in the same situation where they struggle to get by and are forced to basically live on the breadline by the government. The minimum loan should be upped to \u00a35500 to avoid students getting into their overdraft and debt before even leaving university to enter the working world.",
        "background": "This petition sets out to up the lowest maintenance loan but keep the highest loan where it is. Many students struggle with what they receive.",
