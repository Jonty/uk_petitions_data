        "action": "Make Mobility allowance available from birth on need, remove age discrimination.",
        "additional_details": "The government wants children under three to go to a charity to get funding for a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle, this is discriminating against them on the grounds of age, and goes against the governments own policy published on 1 October 2012 that outlaws discrimination based on age, the requirement for a Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle should be base wholly on the need of the child and age should not be a qualifying factor, these children can effectively become housebound because of this policy.",
        "background": "Mobility allowance is only available to people over the age of 3, over  two thousand children under the age of 3 are required to have bulky medical equipment or specialised support wheelchairs, and as such are at risk when travelling in unsuitable or potentially unsafe vehicles  for their needs.",
