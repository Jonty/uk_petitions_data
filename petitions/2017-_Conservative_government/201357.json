        "additional_details": "Change the rules of compulsory purchases to ensure displaced residents get replacement values (not market value) plus 10%\r\n \r\nRequire homes built on communal land or compulsory purchased homes to be no more than 110% of the market value for older homes.\r\n \r\nBan shared ownership schemes if the price is more than 110% of the market value of older properties. New build homes are escalating housing inflation with their pricing which is underpinned by shared ownership schemes.",
        "background": "Current law allows developers to build unaffordable homes (\u00a3175-\u00a3200k more for an area) on communal lands and on homes taken by compulsory purchases. Displaced residents are given less money than needed to relocate locally. Developers are still able to own sold homes via shared ownership schemes.",
