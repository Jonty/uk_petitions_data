        "action": "Halve Tuition Fees, & bring back Maintenance Grants for all University students.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, if a UK student wishes to study at ANY university, for ANY course, they must pay \u00a39,250 a YEAR, over their course length. Additionally, all students have a maintenance loan, which again, needs to be repaid. This eventually leaves many students with a debt of around \u00a351,000 at the age of 21. This means that as soon as they enter work, that debt needs repaying. This petition would decrease student debt from around \u00a351,000 over a lifetime to around \u00a313,800, which is a vast improvement.",
        "background": "Universities are institutions of education, where students across the UK develop knowledge and skills. Yet, over recent years, the fees have been dramatically increased for reasons no Minister can explain. Each year, thousands of students fail to apply due to the cost. These fees must be reduced.",
