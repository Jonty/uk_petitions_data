In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"grant Gibraltar special designated status\". \r\n\r\nIn any case, the status of Gibraltar after the UK leaves the EU would be a decision for the EU and not solely for the UK Government. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the Government to negotiate specific arrangements for Gibraltar after the UK leaves the EU, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
