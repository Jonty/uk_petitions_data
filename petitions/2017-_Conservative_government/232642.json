        "action": "Parliament to take back UK Sovereignty from the EU and to leave on our own terms",
        "additional_details": "Under UK Constitutional Law one Parliament cannot bind future Parliaments and Sovereignty cannot be given away unless it is by the express will of the People. In 1961 negotiations were commenced to join the EEC that lasted 18 months and only failed when vetoed in 1963 by President de Gaulle. After this a relentless campaign of lies and deception by politicians resulted in membership in 1972, never was this officially sanctioned by the People. A biased Referendum in 1975 did not right this wrong.",
        "background": "The People of the UK were denied their vote in a Referendum or General Election on the issue of joining the EEC despite repeated requests in Parliament from 1961 onwards. They were also not informed of the political and Sovereignty implications. This is Unconstitutional and restitution is overdue.",
