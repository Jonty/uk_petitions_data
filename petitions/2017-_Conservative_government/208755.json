        "additional_details": "The referendum in 2016 did not allow many British people living abroad to vote and did not allow EU residents in Britain to vote. The government refuses to give people the option of turning down the exit deal they negotiate and remaining in the EU. Therefore we must assume the government will continue to ignore public opinion and will exit the EU on 31st March 2019. We must therefore ask the government to apply to join the EU on 1st April 2019.",
        "background": "The government is ignoring the current majority who wish to remain in the EU. The government is intent on pushing through Brexit The government bases its opinion on a referendum in which a whole section of the electorate was not allowed to vote.  We must save our citizenship by rejoining the EU.",
