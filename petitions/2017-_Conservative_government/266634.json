        "action": "Any deal agreed with the E.U. should not be an option on any future Referendum.",
        "additional_details": "Their favourite option for the last three years has been to try to persuade us that a \"confirmatory\" referendum of any agreement with the E.U. is completely reasonable and wholly democratic. The Electoral Commission website suggests any questions posed to the British public as part of a Referendum must be easily understood by the people. I suspect a complicated treaty between two trading blocks should never be an option asked of the people via a referendum. It is a vehicle to force a remain vote",
        "background": "Parliament voted by a huge majority to invoke article 50 and they promised they would honour the results of the 2016 Referendum. Since then almost all of the M.P.s we voted for have been determined to refuse our democratic decision and have used the most ridiculous reasons to defend their betrayal.",
