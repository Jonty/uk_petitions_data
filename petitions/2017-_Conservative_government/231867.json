        "additional_details": "Our labelling of meat sold in supermarkets is awful. We have the red tractor and we have RSPCA assured. I am very annoyed that we still sell caged chicken eggs, why? To save the consumer a matter of pence, at the detriment to the animal, then you have \u201cfree range\u201d which doesn\u2019t always mean that their welfare is higher than that of a caged chicken.",
        "background": "Displaying shocking pictures like that on smoking packets of the welfare standards for the worse welfare foods and a rated system on all animal produce/meat foods. Legal labelling for all foods and restaurants including foods incorporating meat or produce.",
