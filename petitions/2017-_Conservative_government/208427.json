        "additional_details": "As Deputy PM he reneged on tuition fees, and his promise to back democratic changes to constituency boundaries. As leader of the Lib-Dems he has overseen a loss of 38 seats in the House of Commons.\r\nHis anti-democratic behaviour is now also being manifested by his attempts to thwart the EU referendum result.",
        "background": "Knighthoods are traditionally reserved for people who have made an exceptional contribution to the nation. Nick Clegg has not fulfilled this criteria, either to nation or his political party. Such an award would bring the honours system into even further disrepute.",
