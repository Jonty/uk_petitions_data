        "action": "Reduce the salary of MPs so the money can be better spent in the community.",
        "additional_details": "In many areas around the country youth sleep on the street with local councils unable to provide accommodation. The mental health sector fails to meet the needs of all people in the country and some families still struggle between eating or heating. \r\n\r\nWhy then do MPs take inflated salaries? If they can't look after the people then they are not doing your job. It is the responsibility of our leaders to work for us and not for their own agenda",
        "background": "The government takes a large amount of tax payers money for their own salary while other services lack.\r\nWhen the country is desperate need to combat homelessness, mental health services, police on the street, poverty and many other issues our money is being mis-spent.\r\nParliament needs to change.",
