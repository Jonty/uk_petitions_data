        "additional_details": "Having suffered with mental illness myself over the years, I have seen first hand the woeful inadequacy of the current system. Access to care for mental health falls way below physical health. According to the World Health Organisation,depression is now the leading cause of ill health and disability in the world, and by 2030 it will also be the biggest killer.\nThe government can no longer ignore the mounting evidence about the severity of mental illness, please sign and let's make a difference.",
        "background": "With the creation of the Health and Social Bill in 2012, the Conservative government included a demand for parity of esteem, meaning mental and physical health services should be treated equally. \nThe government has since failed to deliver on its pledge and it is time for them to take action.",
