Elephants too. Dogs indeed cry and I\u2019m sure any dog or cat owner wouldn\u2019t like it if anyone inflicted pain on their pets. Another example is the documentary blackfish; Harrowing stories about a killer whales in captivity developing psychosis. All scientifically proven! The vote passes an absolute lie and I am more than disgusted by it.",
        "background": "MP\u2019s are in no way qualified to make such a decision. Scientific evidence proves animals can indeed feel emotion and pain. This vote could allow all sorts of barbaric actions to take place and, perhaps even scarier, become legal. Fox hunting springs to mind.",
