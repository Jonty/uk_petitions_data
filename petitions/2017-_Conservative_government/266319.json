        "additional_details": "If a motor vehicle is to have an RTC invoking a cyclist and it is not the fault of the motor vehicle, the insurance of the motor vehicle has to pay for the damages to both parties; unless a lengthy court case is pursued and the payment will be taken from the person directly. Unlike if two or more motor vehicles are involved in an RTC the insurance companies will discuss who is at fault and the costs are recovered from the insurance companies",
        "background": "As it currently stands cyclists do not require any form of training or insurance in order to use the public highway. What I am proposing that under law they will be required to have valid insurance like the rest of the vehicles that use the roads",
