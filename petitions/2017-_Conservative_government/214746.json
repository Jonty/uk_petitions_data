        "additional_details": "Crisps have excessive air..Chocolate fingers are regularly maximum 50% full. A customer finds it difficult to understand the quantity of a product is they cannot see it. Suppliers hide behind the weight of a product to compensate as adequate information but in regards to savoury items to see the amount of the product or ensure the product fills the packaging adequately would be fairer. Benefits are less packaging..more shelf space in supermarkets to extend choice..better value for consumer.",
        "background": "Packaging uses its size to make the product more enticing to the customer. Airspace is required to protect products but suppliers are abusing the products size to falsely claim the contents is bigger than it actually is. Less packaging will benefit the environment and better show the item quantity.",
