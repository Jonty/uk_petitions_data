When we asked the restaurant why they\u2019ve done this they responded with \u2018it\u2019s the way the chef likes to do the fries.\u2019\r\n\r\nToday we went out and the sauce on my child's pasta dish was really salty. When we complained about it we was told it\u2019s just how it comes.  \r\n\r\nThese are examples just from the last couple of weeks but we find it happens a lot. Children shouldn\u2019t have added salt.",
