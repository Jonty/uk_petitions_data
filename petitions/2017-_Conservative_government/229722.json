        "action": "Reverse the illegal triggering of Article 50",
        "additional_details": "Had the EU Referendum Act 2015 made the vote binding and the result of the vote was to leave, the Government would have been obliged to give Article 50 notification. In passing the Act, Parliament would have delegated the decision to the people and the people\u2019s decision would by law be carried out. But that is not the Act that was passed by Parliament. The Act only made provision for a consultative referendum. Therefore, Parliament could not trigger Article 50 on the basis of a decision made.",
        "background": "Article 50 (1) permits any EU Member State to decide to withdraw from the EU \u201cin accordance with its own constitutional requirements.\u201d Yet, the Government triggered Article 50 based on the Referendum decision, which in the UK, is classified as 'advisory' - not binding like an Act of Parliament.",
