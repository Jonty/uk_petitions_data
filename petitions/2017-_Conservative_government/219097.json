        "additional_details": "For instance a band 'K' car, which covers most cars manufactured before 2006, will cost \u00a3315 per year / \u00a326.25 per month to tax.  If you sell and buy in the middle of a month you will lose half of the \u00a326.25 you have paid and have to pay a further \u00a326.25 for only 2 weeks tax of your new car, as will the purchaser of your old car and so on.  This is double taxation and we propose the tax should be collected & refunded on a pro-rata daily basis which is fair to the tax payer.",
        "background": "If you sell and buy car privately you will lose any car tax you have paid in advance and will have to pay a whole months car tax for your new car irrespective of how many days of the month remain.  This means you are paying double tax.",
