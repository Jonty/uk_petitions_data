        "action": "Make the Early Years Teacher Status on par with the Qualified Teacher Status",
        "additional_details": "In order to gain Early Years Teacher Status, an individual must complete a teaching portfolio which covers all 8 teaching standards alongside completing 120 days on placement in a variety of settings and 12 days in Key Stage 1 and 2. To complete all of the above and not be regarded as a teacher is demoralising to the hard graft that is put into our early years education system. The pay gap between an EYT and a QT is also shameful, emphasising the lack of respect for early years workers.",
        "background": "The EYFS (0-5 years) is a crucial part of a child's life which requires careful and considered teaching. Early Years Teacher Status is not recognised as a teaching qualification in state schools but rather an unqualified teacher and therefore impacts on both pay and job opportunities in schools.",
