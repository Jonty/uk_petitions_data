        "additional_details": "This is an unacceptable double standard. MPs as leaders of the country have a responsibility as role models to all, but particularly to young adults and children who see this behaviour in the media. MPs transgressions, and the sanctions imposed upon them should be made public as their voting records are. Then, voters can be reassured of the integrity of the system, and can decide if the person standing for election has the integrity, moral fibre and character worthy of their vote.",
        "background": "The behaviour of some MPs is a national and international disgrace. There appears to be no real consequence for MPs who transgress with illegal, discriminatory, fraudulent, abusive, dishonest or socially unacceptable behaviour, which would result in convictions for ordinary members of the public.",
