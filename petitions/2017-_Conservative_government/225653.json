        "additional_details": "Restricted Sunday opening hours are an outdated principle.  Opening hours have no impact on church attendance or workers rights.  If temporary measures allow it during \"special events\" like the 2012 Olympics then clearly removing them completely should be seriously considered.",
        "background": "Modern shopping habits are moving online where products and services are available 24/7.  Restricting some shops from opening when they wish on a Sunday is an outdated idea and needs reviewing.  Why do I have to pay more from a garage because Tescos closes at 4pm ?",
