        "action": "Stop police and crime commissioners from controlling the fire brigade.",
        "additional_details": "One police and crime commissioner cannot adequately represent an entire county fire service. When a decision of this type is made it is decided on economics alone. This fails to consider factors such as whether firefighters have been consulted on potential changes to their duties. Many such applications are made with a clear desire to merge Police and fire services. This would mean a drastic change in job role without any debate or consultation at the local council.",
        "background": "The Police and Crime Act 2017 gave the police and crime commissioner the ability to apply to the Home Secretary to take democratic control of a county fire service. We the undersigned ask that this power be repealed as undemocratic. Firefighters should be represented by local councillors.",
