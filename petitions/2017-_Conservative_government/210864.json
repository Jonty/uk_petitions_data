        "action": "UK Government must ban the sale of electronic shock collars for dogs.",
        "additional_details": "This petition urges the Government at Westminster to ban the sale and distribution of shock collars across the UK; and to follow the example of Scotland and Wales by banning their use in England.\r\n\r\nThis petition also recognises that some specific devices, such as collars which only vibrate, offer potential benefits in certain circumstances such as when dealing with dogs suffering from hearing loss.",
        "background": "Scotland and Wales have banned the use of electronic shock collars for dogs. But these cruel devices are still lawful in England.\r\n\r\nThe power to ban the sale of shock collars in the UK rests with the Westminster Government, which has also failed to introduce any controls on their use in England.",
