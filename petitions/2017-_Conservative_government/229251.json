        "additional_details": "Road safety expert Professor Richard Allsopp, who set the original limit, states that he would now not choose that limit. He recommends a reduction to 0.05 (the same as Scotland), reducing to 0.02 in a few years (the same as the rest of Europe). He estimated that the reduction to 0.05 would save 25 lives a year. I want the Ministry of Transport to implement this and accept that the limit is currently far too high for safety. Ours is one of the highest blood alcohol limits in the world.",
        "background": "I was watching Trust me I'm a Doctor on the BBC and the drink drive limit has not been altered since inception in 1967, despite science moving on. When it was set at 0.08, it was believed this doubled the risk of a fatal collision, it is now known to be 13 times higher.",
