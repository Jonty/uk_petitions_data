        "additional_details": "The Blue Badge system is not working for a lot of people who are struggling with a disability and this needs to change. There are many reasons why people need to park in a disability bay and the only one should not be how far they can walk. For those struggling with mobility issues getting into and out of a vehicle in a standard parking bay is very difficult, stressful and often distressing and this needs to be taken into account when making a decision on whether or not a Blue Badge is issued.",
        "background": "The blue badge scheme should be less focused on the ability to walk. I run a Parkinson's Support Group and many members have been refused a badge on the grounds that they are able to walk a short distance. The other problems they face are not considered.",
