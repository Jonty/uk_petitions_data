        "additional_details": "It costs people, including me, a lot of money, time and effort to buy and make products to keep cats out of their gardens. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s fair that cat owners do not have to pay for any damage, any products, fines or vet fees due to cat faeces making other animals severely ill. I have also known some cats to be very vicious towards my nephews and my dog. People who have vicious dogs are expected to keep them on leads, yet this doesn\u2019t yet apply to cats. This needs to be changed by law!",
        "background": "I\u2019ve started this petition as my dog has gotten regularly poorly due to eating cat faeces. I do not think it\u2019s fair how dog owners are, by law, expected to pick up dog poo, yet this does not apply to cat owners. Cats who free roam mess up gardens by digging and pooing. I am forever cleaning this up.",
