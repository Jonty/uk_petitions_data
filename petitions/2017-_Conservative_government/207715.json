        "additional_details": "Supermarkets in the UK are responsible for over 1 million tonnes of plastic packaging produced every year, becoming one of the largest contributors in plastic waste. With so much of this non-recyclable waste remaining (especially seen in grocery products), over time is left idol in dumping grounds over a number of years, or dumped elsewhere, having a negative effect on our environment, or for marine life to consume.This plastic contribution has a serious effect on recycling, with large excess amounts being discarded. With micro-plastics being one of the biggest threats to sea life, every year upon thousands of life die each year, continuing will only make things worst.",
        "background": "With 300 million tonnes of plastic being produced globally, as a result a huge number of these plastic products are being dumped into our oceans, drastically damaging the life and sustainability of marine life.",
