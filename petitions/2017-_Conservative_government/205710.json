        "action": "Enshrine in domestic law the recognition of animals as sentient beings.",
        "additional_details": "\"Animal sentience is the founding principle of animal welfare science, and for the way we should treat all animals\" says Gudrun Ravetz, Senior Vice president of the British Veterinary Association. This action undermines the Governments previous promises that the UK will continue to be at the forefront of animal health and welfare standards post-Brexit. It has significant implications on all animal welfare; wild, domestic and farmed animals. Animal sentience must be enshrined in UK domestic law.",
        "background": "On 15 November 2017 MPs held a debate to transfer the EU protocol on animal sentience set out in Article 13 of the Lisbon Treaty into UK Law, so that animals continue to be recognised as sentient beings under domestic law. This central covenant of animal welfare was rejected by a small majority.",
