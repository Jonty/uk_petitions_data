It's a sign that the hard Brexiteers are running this show, and that the will of the people is being ignored. Our democracy is being subverted by a minority government looking to do permanent damage to our nation, and it cannot be allowed to persist any longer.",
        "background": "After failing to secure the increased majority she claimed was vital to negotiate Brexit; having cobbled together an uneasy alliance with the DUP at unsubstantiated cost to the UK taxpayer; and for not having the strength to keep her own party in line during a time of unprecedented uncertainty.",

However, the Petitions Committee can\u2019t schedule votes of no confidence. This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. Petitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want.\r\n"
