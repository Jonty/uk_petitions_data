        "action": "New high speed rail link parkway station for Maidstone",
        "additional_details": "The HS1 high speed rail line runs north of Maidstone, providing faster travel links to Ebbslfeet and Ashford as well as towns further away such as Canterbury and Margate, but the County Town receives no benefit. Investment in Ashford and Ebbsfleet is significantly greater than Maidstone and the town still suffers from a poor and very slow train service to London compared to other towns outside of London. It takes twice as long to reach London from Maidstone than from Ashford which is ridiculous.",
        "background": "The HS1 link bypasses Maidstone and the town is at a disadvantage to other Kent towns in investment and travel provision. A new parkway station could be accessed from the A229 and would serve both Maidstone and the surrounding towns. There should have been a station when it was first developed.",
