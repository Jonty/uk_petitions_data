        "additional_details": "Stafford Borough Council (SBC) are selling a large piece of land at Tilling Drive in Stone Staffs for a lot of money, subject to planning permission. It is therefore in SBC's interest to approve planning consent on this land. It is wrong for a council selling land to also give permission to develop the land. I believe a conflict of interest exists. In such circumstances a government body should manage any planning application to ensure true open and honest government. All ambiguities should be removed from the process and due diligence applied.",
        "background": "Local councils hold and own lots of land. If they choose to sell this land it is in the councils best interests to pass any planning application applied for on the land. Once the planning application is approved the council will benefit from the sale. There is a conflict of interest that must cease.",
