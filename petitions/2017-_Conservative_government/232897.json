        "additional_details": "I am the National Trust Youth Volunteer for 2018 and want to use my award to promote my campaign. I believe that the only way to make a real difference with litter is to start with children.  I hope that they will grow up and teach people around them to also not drop litter. What we learn as a child we never forget.  I want every child to participate in an education programme that will result in a Certificate from the Government and sign a promise to not drop litter and look after their world.",
        "background": "My name is Osian,  I am 17 and have Autism and anxiety.  I have volunteered in the Peak District for 4 years. The peace of the moors has saved my life and I want to do all I can to protect them.   The epidemic of littering and fly tipping is ruining the countryside and is a danger to wildlife.",
