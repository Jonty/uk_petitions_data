The Prevent programme and legislation creates duties to prevent terrorism. You can find out more about these duties here:\r\n\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/445977/3799_Revised_Prevent_Duty_Guidance__England_Wales_V2-Interactive.pdf\r\n\r\nWe're not sure exactly how you want to change this to include anti-transgender ideology.\r\n \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for the Government to fund a programme to prevent attacks on transgender people.\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition calling for a public inquiry into transphobia in the national media.
