        "action": "Give an income tax break for carers and nurses to promote work in healthcare",
        "additional_details": "Lots of local authorities pay rates to care homes that means they struggle to break even, some have to reduce staffing numbers to compensate putting people at extreme risk. Other operators that also support people who pay privately are able to work more effectively but still have to pay the minimum wage.\r\n\r\nWe could make it policy that all carers and nurses that work under a cqc registration for care would benefit. This would have an added impact by encouraging people to leave temp agencies",
        "background": "Raising minimum wage has not been as helpful as hoped, the problem is that when it\u2019s raised so is the competition at local supermarkets etc. Some care homes can not afford to raise further. Giving a tax benefit to carers and nurses would encourage and reward people who work in this industry.",
