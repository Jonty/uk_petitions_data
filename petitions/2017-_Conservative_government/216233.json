        "additional_details": "I propose hour classes once a week in order to keep children engaged and updated. Teach the requirements for voting, the process of voting, current party policies for each party, practice voting etc. Engage in current debates and learn of foreign affairs that affect both the UK and the world. Allow them the advantage of awareness when coming to the voting age for both fair and thoroughly considered decisions. Studying Holocaust Literature in my degree has inspired me to propose this.",
        "background": "Give secondary school children a chance to learn about the different parties in the UK and their policies (etc) from an unbiased perspective. Learn about current affairs both locally and abroad, voting etc. Give everyone the right to unbiased knowledge to make well informed decisions as adults.",
