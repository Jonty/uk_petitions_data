        "additional_details": "The border between the EU & Northern Ireland remains controversial. An EU border between Scotland & the rest of UK will be as difficult to resolve affecting the whole UK. The whole UK should be able to vote. Independence for Scotland means the SNP applying for EU Membership - no guarantee that it would be granted in the short term. They would have to adopt the Euro. More years of chaos with Parliamentary time diverted from issues affecting everyone. The SNP conference endorsed it today.",
        "background": "When the last \u2018once in a lifetime\u2019 vote was held in 2014, only residents of Scotland could vote. Scots resident in the rest of the UK were not eligible, nor were the rest of the population of the UK. Scottish Independence will affect everyone in the UK, I petition the WHOLE UK be allowed a vote.",
