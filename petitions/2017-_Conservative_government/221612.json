        "action": "Introduce an Unemployability Benefit for people unemployed for 5 years or more.",
        "additional_details": "The majority of employers now refuse to employ people who have been out of work for any length of time - and they don't consider Volunteering and Work Placement experience as valuable: only formal, paid employment experience within the previous 6 months will suffice. \r\n\r\nThis is leaving more and more unemployed people out of work for longer periods, claiming benefits for far longer than they want to, and open to harassment from Job Centre staff and the media.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, want the UK Government to introduce an Unemployability Benefit, equivalent to the National Living Wage for a 35 hour week, for people unemployed for 5 years or more.",
