        "action": "Pass a law to prevent landlords refusing people to have pets.",
        "additional_details": "Having pets has been proved to be very beneficial for health, lowering blood pressure, helping with stress etc. For people living alone they are companionship. For children, it educates them about caring and having compassion for other living creatures along with responsibility of such. With so many animal shelters full, the problem is being exhasperated by private landlords denying people a basic right to have a pet. For time immemorial people have kept animals as pets and surely it is within their human rights to do so.",
        "background": "We request you pass a law that forbids landlords to deny tenants a pet as it will prove beneficial for people and animals alike.",
