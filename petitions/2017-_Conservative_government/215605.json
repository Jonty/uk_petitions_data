        "additional_details": "Court orders are implemented directly via courts without the parent proving any risk to a child.   The problem with the family court system is that it presumes one parent guilty.  The parent trying to gain lawful access to his/her child then has to wait months whilst cases are backlogged to social services to assess.  In this period both the parent in question and child suffer unnecessary emotional distress.  The family court does not take into account evidences that proves malicious behaviour.",
