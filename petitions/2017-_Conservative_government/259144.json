        "additional_details": "Recent budget cuts have had a severe effect on our Armed Forces. Thousands of jobs have been lost, and not enough people are joining.\r\n\r\nOur Navy is ever decreasing in size, with barely enough ships to protect the new Queen Elizabeth class carriers, or even men to crew them. \r\nOur Air Force lacks in the modern aircraft we need to defend our great nation, especially with the rising tensions with Russia as it\u2019s back up to Cold War levels.\r\nThe Army is in need of new land-systems all the time.\r\n\r\nOur current Defence Budget just cannot afford it, especially how it's currently decreasing.",
        "background": "Defence is an important subject. \r\nThe Armed Forces require a lot of money to be put towards them, as having one of the most professional military on the planet isn't cheap.",
