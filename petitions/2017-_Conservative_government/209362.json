        "additional_details": "I have seen many social media videos with children/teenagers being punched/kicked by bullies, and people passing by and not getting involved or stopping them. I would like people to intervene and help those who need help until parents or help arrives. Those who ignore it should be fined. It\u2019s not only our (teacher's) duty to help vulnerable children out there. It should be everyone's out there (mum, dad, grandma/dad, aunties and uncles). Everyone should help.",
        "background": "I am a parent to two happy teenagers and a pre-school educator to lovely pre-school children. I would hate it if anything bad happened to them. I would really love it if bullying was something of the past. I would like to help those who are vulnerable out there.",
