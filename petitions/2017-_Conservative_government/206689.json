        "additional_details": "The OBR have revised down our economic growth, they predict a growth in housing costs and even say our deficit as a country will not be cleared until 2031. Our NHS is under increasing pressure and our health secretary Jeremy Hunt is deciding whether or not to cut wages for staff working anti-social hours. For a country that can find \u00a31bn to keep itself afloat, \u00a310bn training foreign troops and a Brexit bill that may reach \u00a350bn you might think they could afford to increase NHS salaries, but no!",

We need to acknowledge the damage they have already done to our country and it\u2019s stability. We are not strong and stable.",

Petitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want.\r\n"
