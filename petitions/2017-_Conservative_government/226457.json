In 2015 my father passed away, everything changed. My mother, now a widowed housewife, relied on my brother for comfort. In May 2018 aged 37 he died of a heart attack. She is now alone with countless visa refusals behind her. Why should she be refused the chance to visit me? Home Office please recognise the right to a family life for all British residents & their families!",
        "background": "The Home Office has made the current criteria for Adult Dependant Relative practically impossible to meet. There should be a middle ground, where parents should be allowed to visit without having to jump through hoops. We are humans and not just boxes that need ticking.",

Please accept our sincere condolences. \r\n\r\nWe can't accept your petition because we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. In particular, we're not sure how you want the immigration rules to be changed. We're also not sure whether you want the rules for UK visit visas for family members to be changed or whether you want the rules for an adult coming to the UK to be cared for by a relative, to be changed. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nYou may wish to contact your local MP about your mother's specific visa refusal. You can find out who your MP is and how to contact them here: https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/\r\n\r\nYou may be interested to know that the Petitions Committee recently scheduled a debate in Parliament on three petitions about family visit visas. \r\n\r\nYou can read the debate here: https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-07-09/debates/276864D0-6324-4C48-AEE6-AA007C9CB666/FamilyVisitorVisas\r\n\r\nYou can watch the debate here: https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/611ecf08-e58d-4b1d-9eae-2ab756560e9f\r\n\r\n\r\n"
