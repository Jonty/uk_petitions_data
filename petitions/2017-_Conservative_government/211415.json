        "additional_details": "Despite promises in introducing the alternative finance by 2016, we now approach the 2018 academic year with yet no action. We feel these delays demonstrate a lack of urgency in addressing the plight of those students currently unable to benefit from university education. With enough support, this can be prioritised and we hope that\r\nthe Shari\u2019a-compliant finance for funding university fees can be introduced by September 2018.\r\nThe alternative fee funding structure can be found here,\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/303423/bis-13-1311-consultation-on-a-sharia-compliant-alternative-finance-product.pdf\r\n\r\nFurther information: http://www.halalstudentloans.co.uk/",
        "background": "Many Muslims are unable to go to university as their faith prohibits interest based finance. In 2014, the government undertook to introduce an alternative loan by 2016 but have not yet done so. With enough support, the Sharia-compliant finance can finally be launched to fund university tuition fees.",
