        "additional_details": "I was told that it was unlikely to be able to due to being a young female (risks of renal failure during future pregnancy). A online registry with sufficient information could therefore save time as the medical professional had to explain the reasoning to me whilst simultaneously ensuring only those eligible come forward. \r\nFrom my perspective, there isn't enough education and awareness surrounding this topic and promoting living donation more may significantly help the many people in need",
        "background": "I recently called my regional transplant centre to donate a kidney and found that the process of ringing and finding information about living donation daunting and difficult. An online living donor registry with a pre-screening process could help encourage others to come forward and also save time.",
