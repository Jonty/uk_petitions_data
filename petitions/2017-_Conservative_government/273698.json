        "additional_details": "It is the obligation of Great Britain to provide a safety net to Hong Kong, by granting right of abode to a city that has been using our Common Law to challenge the world's most powerful autocracy. For this reason, Hong Kong may turn out to be Britain's shiniest and most enduring legacy. \u00a0This petition lends further and vital support to the movement. \u00a0Moreover, a city of such hard working, creative, and fiercely independent people shall improve the quality of life of the UK in unimaginable ways.",
        "background": "Hong Kong, a former British Colony reclaimed by China in 1997, has for 3 months been taking heroic steps in countering China's breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration.  This global whistle blowing effort, being spearheaded by leaderless youths with a common cause, is unparalleled in history.",
