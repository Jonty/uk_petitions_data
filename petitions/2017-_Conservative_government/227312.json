        "background": "I find it incredible that over 60's in England do not qualify for a free/discounted bus/train pass when residents in Scotland, Wales, NI and London enjoy this benefit. This is blatant discrimination  - not a very 'United' Kingdom.\r\nFree/discounted bus/train passes for ALL over 60 UK residents please",
