Babies born today will not live their three score years and ten as global temperature quadruple 23.4 years. I know that I am the only person saying this but that does not mean that I am wrong. We cannot continue burning any more fossil and biomass.  I am willing to gift my invention to planet Earth that will provide all the electricity and desalinated water our planet needs.",
        "background": "It has always been assumed that burning biomass is \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 but it is clearly not. About 1/5th of wood being burned produces nitrogen dioxide which is 300 times more potent than CO2. When 1000 MW windfarm starts generating 5 CCGTs are instructed to ramp down to 80% losing thermal efficiency",
