If a trap is set & it catches a hedgehog, then the person who set the trap can be prosecuted. Anyone setting traps for \u2018vermin\u2019 or non-protected species is obliged to take all reasonable precautions to avoid catching a protected species, since there are no \u2018reasonable precautions\u2019 to avoid catching hedgehogs using this trap, anyone who sets them is at risk of prosecution if they catch a hedgehog.",

            "details": "Before a new spring trap is brought into the market it must first be approved for use via a Spring Trap Approval Order made in England and Wales under the Pests Act 1954, Scotland under the Agriculture (Scotland) Act 1948 and Northern Ireland under the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. \r\n\r\nThe humaneness of the trap is assessed before it is approved for use. Trap evaluation is currently carried out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, which then recommends whether a trap should be approved or not and, if so, what conditions of use (placement criteria, permitted target species) should apply. \r\n\r\nUnder the Spring Traps Approval (Variation) (England) Order 2015, the Goodnature A24 Rat and Stoat Trap may only be used for the purpose of killing rats and stoats. The trap must also be placed so that it can only be entered by way of an artificial tunnel which is suitable for that purpose. \r\n\r\nNo spring trap is approved for use against hedgehogs as under section 11 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is an offence, unless under and in accordance with the terms of a licence, to use any trap or snare for the purpose of killing or taking a hedgehog or to set in position any trap or snare in such a way so as to be calculated to cause bodily injury to a hedgehog.\r\n\r\nA condition of use for all approved spring traps is that so far as is practicable without unreasonably compromising its use, the trap must be used in a manner that minimises the likelihood of its killing, taking or injuring non-target species. We are confident that hedgehogs can be effectively excluded from the trap when set according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and an excluder tunnel is used (see https://goodnaturetraps.co.uk/). We do not, therefore, intend to remove this trap\u2019s approval.\r\n\r\nOperators of the trap are required to make sure conditions of use are complied with and offences against protected species are not committed.\r\n\r\nWhere the safety of protected species cannot be reasonably assured, the use of non-lethal methods of capture, such as cage trapping, should be employed so non-target species can be released unharmed if accidently captured.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",
