        "action": "Make the judgement and discrimination of mental illness unlawful.",
        "additional_details": "It should be illegal to discriminate against people whether or not their illness is a disability. Neurophobia must be recognised as unlawful and unacceptable to allow our society to insist upon equality. Our campaign www.notoneurophobia.com is to raise awareness of Neurophobia. Our aim is to recognise Neurophobia in the same way we recognise racism, homophobia and sexism so that the judgement and discrimination many people with poor mental health face can be eradicated from society.",
        "background": "'Neurophobia' describes the judgement and discrimination people show towards mental illness and those suffering with poor mental health. It is only illegal to discriminate against someone if their mental illness affects them enough that it becomes a disability.",
