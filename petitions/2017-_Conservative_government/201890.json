        "action": "Abolish the current gross earnings child maintenance system run by the DWP",
        "additional_details": "CS1 based on net earnings brought in in 1993 and run by the CSA, was a balanced system but seriously lacked teeth when attempting to get feckless parents to pay up.\r\nCS2 based on net earnings was brought in in 2003 and threw out the CS1 calculations that ensured balanced calculations on both sides and caused massive financial worries for NRP's\r\nCS3 came into force in 2012 and is a new version of CS2 based on gross earnings where your pension is allowed for but not the statutory tax and national insurance we all have to pay. Living costs aren't allowed for either which is putting NRP's at risk of losing their homes and jobs.\r\nPAYE NRP's are easy hits here.",
        "background": "The current CS3 system is unbalanced and specifically so against the NRP and does not allow family life to be maintained on both sides. It is based on a gross earnings system that doesn't even allow for Tax, NI or a mortgage/rent and persecutes PAYE NRP's to financial despair.",
