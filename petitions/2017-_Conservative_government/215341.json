The Government is not doing enough about this (and other places throughout the UK) problem and is not what the vast majority of UK citizens expect of them. The grooming and exploitation practice affects those children and young adults for the rest of their lives some reportedly committing suicide because their minds have been destroyed. The Government are failing those children severely.",
        "background": "There is growing evidence of the grooming and exploitation of children and young adults in many of our towns and cities, not a new problem but one that demands strong Government action. It is at epidemic levels and is destroying the very fabric and ethos of our country.",
