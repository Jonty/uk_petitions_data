        "additional_details": "Engine idling damages air quality unnecessarily yet current legislation:\r\n\r\n- is unclear on what counts as idling, stating only that it is illegal to leave engines on \u201cunnecessarily\u201d when stationary\r\n \r\n-  sets no specific time limits and does not punish idling \u201cwhen the vehicle is stationary owing to the necessities of traffic\u201d\r\n \r\n- makes it difficult to stop idling as fines can only be imposed once an \u201cauthorised person\u201d has asked a driver to turn off their engine and the driver has refused",
        "background": "Create a time limit on how long vehicles can legally leave their engines running when stationary (we suggest 3 minutes).\r\n\r\nCreate a clearer definition of vehicle idling. \r\n\r\nLet ordinary people report idling vehicles to an authority, allowing better enforcement of anti-idling laws nationwide.",
