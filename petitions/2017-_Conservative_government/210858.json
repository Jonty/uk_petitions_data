        "background": "The P.R.N. Is a scheme set up by the UK Government, for recycling exporters to make huge profits. Sadly, this scheme allows tonnes of unrecyclable/hazardous plastics to be shipped overseas. Which ends up polluting the environment. We could deal with our plastics in the UK, if the PRN was scrapped.",
