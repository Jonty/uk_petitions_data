Not a replica of a moped but a good old fashioned stand up scooter.\r\n\r\nA motorised scooter is a battery powered stand-up scooter using a small electric motor. These scooters are designed with a deck in the centre on which the rider stands. \r\n\r\n-E-scooters have mechanical breaks and should be allowed in cycle paths.\r\n-E-scooters are better for the environment.\r\n-Why are E-bikes allowed ? Because they have peddles! (that's just silly)\r\n-E-scooters will cut emissions and traffic.",
