        "additional_details": "Many people also falsely believe these vaccinations are unsafe or even more ridiculously think that they cause autism which simply isn\u2019t true.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html\r\n\r\nVaccinations are the result of 100s of years of scientific research and studies. To decline these other than the reason of allergies is borderline child abuse. To risk your own child\u2019s life let alone others which have no choice in the matter is unfair and disgusting.",
        "background": "For many years many misinformed parents/guardians have declined/refused to give their children vaccinations which has to stop.\r\n\r\nIf a child is not vaccinated they are at risk of contracting deadly preventable diseases and also to pass on to children who are unable to receive them due to allergies.",
