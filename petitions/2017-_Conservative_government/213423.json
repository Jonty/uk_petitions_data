Nor should anyone have the right to make a person go into detail about abuse, if it has already been reported and officials have dealt with it.\r\nParents who ask for help should be treated with respect as they are acknowledging their struggle.",
        "background": "Social workers look into family history, and judge a persons parenting skills based on whether they have been abused or not.\r\n This I believe is discrimination at its most cruel form. \r\nParent(s) who seek help should not be judged and backed into corners, when the help is for their children.",
