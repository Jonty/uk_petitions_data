However, this is entirely at their discretion and how this is dealt with varies between forces. Where a dog is only being pursued as a result of how they look, this interim exemption should be automatic (where the restrictions can be put in place and adhered to). Spending long periods in kennels can detrimental to the welfare of a dog and the owner.",
