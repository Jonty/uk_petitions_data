        "additional_details": "Some may argue a RailCard reduces these fares, however if the fare is less than \u00a312 myself and many other RailCard users are unable to use it for discounted travel in before 9AM. \r\n\r\nMy ticket prior to 9AM is \u00a316 return from Brighton to Three Bridges which is a 1/2 hour journey, the same journey up north costs \u00a34.50! I have to be late to lectures in order to not be broke within a week.",
        "background": "Peak and Off-Peak fares are outdated and frankly not needed in the 21st century when many people are struggling for money as it is. \r\n\r\nWe need a change, paying double, sometimes even triple the  fare just for the privilege of arriving into London before 10AM! Or travelling prior to 10AM.",

You could start a new petition calling on the Government to change this rate, or a petition asking for other changes to the way in which train fares are set.\r\n\r\n"
