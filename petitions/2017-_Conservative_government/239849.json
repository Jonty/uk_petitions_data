        "action": "Ban the sale of Shark fin soup in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The process by which shark fins are obtained is often brutal and totally inhumane and is also so wasteful, the shark which is usually still alive after being finned is then thrown back into the ocean to die a cruel painful death. The process of finning is also indiscriminate and organisms such as sea turtles are often also caught in the long lines used to catch the sharks. Sharks cannot keep up with the rate they are being fished and will be wiped out if this industry is allowed to continue.",
        "background": "I ask the UK government to place a ban on selling shark fin soup in the UK, with our country being an example to the world of how high animal welfare standards and consumerism can go hand in hand there is no place in our country for endorsing such a cruel practice.",
