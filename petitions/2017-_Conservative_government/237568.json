Parliament can't change Constitution irrevocably without the assent of all British adults in free, open & fair referendums. Governments don't have Henry VIII powers. Courts recognise Primacy of the People in Referendums. Magna Carta said it was part of Britain's ancient laws.\r\nPeople's assent or denial is their essential Human Right or all Legislation will become unsafe.",
        "background": "Article 50 requires validation of Treaty FIRST. Both parties promised Referendums to ACTIVATE the Lisbon Treaty. Then refused. It is INVALID without one. Governments recognise primacy of People. HMG must either recognise Referendums and have one on the Treaty. Or drop 2016 Referendum as irrelevant!",
