        "action": "Consider extenuating circumstances when determining maximum uni maintenance loan",
        "additional_details": "I want the government to allow for students in such situations to appeal for a greater maintenance loan. It is considered unfair that students wanting to carry on their education should be held back due to their financial backgrounds, and I would argue that this too is affected by the willingness of parents to support their children. Everyone wanting to go to university should be given the opportunity to do so, and this includes maximising support for students who will struggle with living costs!",
        "background": "University maintenance costs are expensive. Whilst loans are allocated according to household income, this policy assumes that parents are willing to help out their child with payments - something not all parents are willing to do, preventing students from doing well in or even attending university.",
