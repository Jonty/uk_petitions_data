        "additional_details": "Many students are forced to pay for things themselves so they don\u2019t fall behind, this can prove a problem for many. A lot of parents/ careers can barely afford the uniform resources like textbooks, school books, stationary its can all amount to a huge sum and if they don't buy them this particular student may fall behind which isn't fair.",
        "background": "Something\u2019s people don\u2019t realise is how difficult it is to learn in a crowded classroom teachers cannot focus on each student, unintentionally leaving some students unnoticed and uneducated. The budget for students is declining this means that we'll miss on key things that will help us and teachers.",
