This can be done by making a school policy for every child at a certain age to be taught the philosophy of morals. i.e The one that benefits from charity is not the deprived but the generous. Materialistic love disappears. Focus on the \"why?\"",

Much news emphasis is put on things which are not so important such as celebrity deaths or texts between partners. 2 things for all humans, privacy and justice.",
