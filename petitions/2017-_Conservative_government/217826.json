        "additional_details": "We supposedly live in a democratic state, meaning the people elected are elected to represent the views of the people who elected them, the government has decided to put every single living person in this country at risk by involving us further in another war, without first asking the people if we felt this was in our best interest, which is ironic, because the very \"dictatorship\" they are trying to destabilise works in the exact same way, one person at the top making all of the decisions.",
        "background": "\"Our\" Government have once again followed the USA into another imaginary war, spending millions of pounds of tax payers money, dropping bombs on a country we should have no involvement with, putting millions of innocent lives in danger, pushing us ever closer to the chance of World War 3.",
