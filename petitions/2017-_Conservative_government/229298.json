        "additional_details": "To see the children/teens of this generation being treated like second class citizens when it comes to mental health, is shocking. It\u2019s almost like world has went backwards(in terms of mental health awareness/help), this is happening in 2018 when things like this happened in the 1970s. It\u2019s 2018. 1 in 4 people will experience mental health at one in their life, that includes everyone. There is children out there in the community taking their own lives, this shouldn\u2019t be happening!!",
        "background": "The waiting list for CAHMS is unreal and children shouldn\u2019t have to feel at their breaking point to be able to get seen quicker, they should be seen regardless of how bad their mental health is. Mental health is real, it exists at all ages but why is it not taken so serious in children/adolescents?",
