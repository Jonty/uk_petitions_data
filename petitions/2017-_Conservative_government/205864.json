        "additional_details": "Eighty per cent of current animal welfare legislation comes from the EU, but after March 2019, European law will no longer stand to protect these animals. \r\n\r\nUnder EU law, animals are currently recognised as being capable of feeling pain and emotion. But MPs have this week voted to drop the inclusion of animal sentience into the Withdrawal Bill.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share to protect the animals, these are not just wild creatures but domestic pets too and they DO have feelings and emotions",
        "background": "The government has recently ruled that animals do not fee emotions or feelings and are therefore not going to be protected by the current EU laws that stand pre-brexit. \r\nWhen brexit is complete animals will no longer be protected and covered and will therefore lose any and all rights",
