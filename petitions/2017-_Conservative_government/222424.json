The UK Government Minister said:\r\n\r\n\"The UK Government previously gave \u00a310 million to rebuild the school after the last fire, and we stand ready to help again. There was never a question about the need to rebuild and restore the building when tragedy struck four years ago. The situation is far worse after the weekend\u2019s fire, but I hope we can start with that aim in mind.\"\r\n\r\nYou can read what was said here:\r\n\r\nhttps://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-06-19/debates/43B5B409-ED63-4E1C-AAB2-A7989DF93DAE/GlasgowSchoolOfArt\r\n\r\nYou could a new petition about something the UK Government and Parliament are responsible for. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to meet the costs of restoring the Glasgow School of Art."
