        "action": "Extend the review of PIP claims to all claims & the PIP decision making process",
        "additional_details": "While I applaud the decision that claims will be reviewed following the High Court ruling, the flaws in the PIP system go further than the in-built discrimination against Mental Health Disabilities.\nMy experience is that those with Physical and Learning Disabilities are also discriminated against, & subject to flawed decisions.\nThe fact that over 65% of PIP decisions are overturned at Tribunal in favour of the Claimant demonstrates this clearly.\nPIP needs to be reviewed in its entirety.",
        "background": "This week a review of PIP Claims was announced in response to a High Court ruling that the clause 'for reasons other than psychological distress' into the Mobility Component was 'blatant discrimination'.\nBut, my experience is that the entire system needs review - individual decisions & the process",
