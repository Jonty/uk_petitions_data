        "action": "Abolish Political Parties and create a collective body of independent MPs.",
        "additional_details": "Independent MPs would strengthen the relationship (and possibly form new types of relationships) between MPs and their constituents. An MP who today finds it necessary to follow the Party line, which in many cases is against their constituents beliefs, will find it easier to be more in tune with the people they represent and 100% accountable to the same. We have had enough of adversarial wrangling and it is time to try something new - a collective Parliament as is evident anywhere else in nature",
        "background": "Great ideas can come from anyone. The possibility that a great idea will fall by the wayside due to some in-built bias of the current Party political/adversarial setup is wrong. Our current Parliamentary system encourages and rewards political bullying (from the whips) and loyalty to the Party line.",
