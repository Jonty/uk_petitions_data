        "action": "Introduce retaining 5% of price, until remedial work on new homes is completed.",
        "additional_details": "Realistically homes cannot be perfect.  However a timely redress for repairs is now required. Therefore, retaining 5% of the purchase price of the property should prompt builders to rectify concerns without delays. Subsequently, this would allow customers not to feel unhappy and stressed in their new homes.",
        "background": "Issues reported in the first two years are the responsibility of the house builder, followed by a further eight years of (structural) NHBC insurance cover.  However, from our experience the rectification of problems are being extended beyond the warranty period and some issues are being refused.",
