        "action": "The will of the majority is being silenced by not holding a second Brexit vote",
        "additional_details": "Under a fair democracy, a 2nd referendum should become mandatory if there is a reasonable belief that the will of the majority has changed.  Resisting this is an admission that government know the majority view has changed.\r\nA principle of democracy is that voting is at appropriate frequency, whilst short in time, the amount of change since the vote (including relations with foreign powers, issues with the referendum and understanding of the implications of Brexit) make a 2nd vote mandatory.",
        "background": "For months there has been growing evidence that, if a second referendum were held, the results would be to stop Brexit at this time.  \r\nTherefore, by silencing the voice of the people, is the government breaching the principles of democracy. i.e. \"the people have spoken\" vs \"the people are speaking\"",
