        "additional_details": "The fact this road is also occupied by heavy goods vehicles from Hadfield transport has made this even worse. A Railway station was closed due to the Beeching cuts but the fact the area around Littlemoss has almost doubled justifies the new station. This will help people get to other areas of the country easily and ease congestion on this busy stretch of road.",
        "background": "Droylsden East has an extremely busy road between Littlemoss and Droylsden town centre. This road leads to Ashton under lyne and Manchester city centre the other way. With a new school planned for Littlemoss this road will become worse.",
