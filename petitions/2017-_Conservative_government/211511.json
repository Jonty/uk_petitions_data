        "additional_details": "Last year there were more than 450 acid attacks in London alone. Many have argued to make the sale of acids more regulated and that you should no longer to be able to 'buy it over the counter' however I do not think this is how we should tackle this problem. By further regulating the sale of acids we will not stop the problem directly, however by educating our youth on the effects of these life-changing attacks, we will hopefully see a decrease in the number of attacks in areas such as London.",
        "background": "We have recently seen increasing numbers in the amount of these life-changing acid attacks. For example, in 2012 the attack of Naomi Oni, who had acid chucked on her whilst walking through London. Since, 2012 acid attacks have doubled. It is vital that we educate children about this danger.",
