        "action": "End the IVF postcode lottery and demand equality of provision on the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Infertility is a disease with profound effects on individuals and on families, and private treatment is very expensive. If this flouting of guidance and rationing of treatment had happened with any other aspect of healthcare - treating broken bones, or heart disease, or MS - it would be decried as a major scandal. Not only does everyone deserve fair treatment on the NHS, but allowing CCGs to ignore NICE guidelines diminishes their worth and unjustifiably perpetuates inequality in provision.",
        "background": "Research by NICE shows that 3 rounds of IVF proffers the best chance of success for people who are unable to conceive, yet many local CCGs have chosen to disregard these guidelines. For the sake of equality and fairness we need the government to insist on parity of NHS provision across the UK.",
