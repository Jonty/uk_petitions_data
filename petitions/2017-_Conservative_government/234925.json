        "additional_details": "I have had my own home since the age of 17, i have worked and constantly been in debt because I don't have enough money to cover bills, i don't receive discount on my rent or bills due to me being under 25, but i receive a lower wage, how is this fair? I have to kill myself by working so much over time just to try and get by, this isn't fair for people who work hard to earn a living yet get a lower wage than people doing the same job due to age! Sign if you agree !!",
        "background": "People under the age of 25 dont get discount on bills or shopping due to being under 25 so why should we get our wages reduced? We are all equal so treat us like it. Under 25s go in debt and it's due to the cut back in our salary! I struggle with my bills due to this and so do others under 25!",
