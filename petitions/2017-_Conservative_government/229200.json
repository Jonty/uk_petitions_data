That is a decision for medical professionals. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more about fitness to drive and mental health here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/legal-rights/fitness-to-drive/overview/#.W7JNHjpwYsc\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition about something the UK Parliament and Government are responsible for. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Government and Parliament to review how drivers with mental health issues are treated by the DVLA, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
