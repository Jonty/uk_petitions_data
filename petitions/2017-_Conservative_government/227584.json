        "additional_details": "A growing body of research has begun to highlight the detrimental effects of forced adoption on children, parents and extended family. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/38573/\r\n\r\nConcerns around human rights, healthy development in forcibly adopted children and heightened trauma experienced by vulnerable parents has led to the majority of countries implementing consensual adoption practices.\r\n\r\nThis petition invites the government to end its forced adoption policy and consider consensual adoptions instead.",
        "background": "Forced adoption, or non-consensual adoption, allows the UK government to put children up for adoption without parental consent.\r\n\r\nThe practice is in sharp decline around the world, as governments now understand the devastating impact the policy has on adopted children and family members.",
