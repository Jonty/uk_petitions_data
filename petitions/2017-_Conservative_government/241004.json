        "additional_details": "Many companies just ignore automnatic issuing of credit reinbursment, some expect you to notify them that your owed money. The current process is unclear, unecessary and stacked against the consumer. Many folk are thwarted by companies when requesting their credit payment, with companies just holding people's money in their accounts for as long as they can.",

The companies are retaining the credit for longer than necesary and in some cases not returning it at all. It inconveniences many, and and causes hardship to those who are already suffering from energy high prices.",
