        "additional_details": "With the UK being the largest exporter of \"medical cannabis\" in the world it is shameful that Her Majesty's Government can allow the suffering of hundreds of thousands of British citizens by denying them the use of cannabis for medical needs. We call upon Her Majesty's Government to bring into law the use of cannabis for justifiable needs and to allow anyone with cause to use cannabis for their medical needs without fear of prosecution or confiscation.  Medical cannabis users are not criminals.",
        "background": "With Her Majesty's Government's decision to grant drugs deemed illegal to be used medically for certain cases, can Her Majesty's Government allow anyone caught with cannabis who shows justifiable usage to be made legal so medical cannabis users can avoid a criminal record & prison?",
