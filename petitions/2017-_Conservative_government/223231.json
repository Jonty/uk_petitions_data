        "additional_details": "A new visitor visa category should be introduced  for non-British immediate family members of British citizens with life threatening illnesses such as cancer or conditions requiring full-time care. This is to assist British citizens with family living outside of the UK in receiving the mental and physical support of their families, paramount to coping with their health issues and difficulties arising from their condition.",
        "background": "My friend was diagnosed with cancer recently. Chemo makes her so sick that she struggles to take care of her 2 year daughter. Her mother applied for UK visitor visa to come and look after her and her family. However it was rejected saying she is not a genuine visitor and will not go back to Iran.",
