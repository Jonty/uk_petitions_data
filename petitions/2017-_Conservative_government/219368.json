        "additional_details": "I would like to see this age increased to 18 to accommodate people at this age, as it can only be a benefit to this country.\r\nThis is a particular problem where I live in Cornwall. Many students in remote locations, especially further down in the county, are disadvantaged as either bus routes are problematic, or it is too expensive to do every day.",
        "background": "Currently, free bus passes for school-age children only go up to the age of 16.  This leaves those taking  A-Levels at a sixth form or taking other vocational courses at colleges having to pay for tickets daily for their journey, or buy a council bus pass often at a high price.",
