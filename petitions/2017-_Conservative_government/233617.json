        "additional_details": "The Government stated on 21 August 2018:-\r\n\r\n\"The UK is leaving the EU\u2019s Single Market and Customs Union. The UK will also leave the Common Agricultural and Common Fisheries Policy and bring an end to the jurisdiction of the CJEU in the UK.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving the EU must mean leaving all of the above.\r\n\r\nThere must be a clean break from the EU so Britain can take back control of its laws, borders, trade and money. \r\n\r\nThe Government must deliver the will of the people who did not vote for the draft agreement that Mrs May is trying to pull over our eyes. \r\n\r\nWe voted to take back control of our country, our sovereignty and to retain democracy for the UK. Twice - Referendum and General Election.",
        "background": "The PM has colluded with the establishment and EU to hoodwink the Cabinet, Parliament and the British people into an agreement contrary to what she had promised in her manifesto.
