        "additional_details": "We've known about these risks for a long time, and the NHS have started a Stop Smoking scheme. But, although it is good, it's not good enough. There are still people smoking and affecting not only their own health but those around them. 78,000 people in the UK a year are still dying from smoking.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides, not many people like breathing in the terrible smoke cigarettes produce. So, if you want to make our air cleaner and save 78,000 lives a year, sign this petition.",
        "background": "We all know smoking is bad for us. There are tonnes of scientific evidence proving this. \r\n\r\nBut it doesn't just affect the person smoking. It affects everyone since it pollutes the air and gets into the lungs of a person nearby and, in the long-term, can cause cancer, lung disease etc.",
