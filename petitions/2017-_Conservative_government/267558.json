        "additional_details": "If the expert piercers are telling us they won't do it, then why aren't we listening to them? This is becoming an outdated practice, but it's not enough. We need to make it law. It should never be ok to inflict pain, fear, and risk of infection onto a child for a cosmetic benefit. No baby can consent to piercings or ask for it themselves. Let's make it law to make it their choice and not the choice of parents and cultural norms.",
        "background": "Ear piercing on babies and toddlers inflicts unnecessary pain and permanent scarring for no medical benefit. The baby cannot possibly consent. Dangerous piercing guns are often used as many reputable shops refuse to pierce under 5's. Piercings can also become infected and lead to ear deformities.",
