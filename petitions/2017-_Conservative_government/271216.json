        "action": "Ensure fuel retailers sell only B20 biodiesel, given its environmental benefits",
        "additional_details": "Biodiesel has a positive effect on net emissions as the production of vegetable oil is renewable. A B20 blend achieves a 10-15 per cent CO2 reduction over diesel. Particulate, sulphates, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions are also reduced. \r\n\r\nAt B20 blends, vehicular performance, serviceability or reliability is not impacted negatively. \r\n\r\nFor more details, visit the GLA's report here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/gla_-_biodiesel_operational_note_june_2015_0.pdf",
        "background": "Following the 2015 Greater London Authority's report on Biodiesel, government must act urgently to ensure only B20 biodiesel is retailed, given its several environmental and economic benefits achievable today with zero negative impact to current vehicular technology or existing UK fuel distribution.",
