        "action": "Remove time limits that prevent British citizens living abroad from voting.",
        "additional_details": "The time limit has arbitrarily gone up and down under different governments. The Conservative manifestos in 2015 and 2017 promised to eliminate the time limit, but this hasn't happened. Any British citizen concerned about our country and our future, no matter where we live and work, should have the right to vote. To be stripped of this right through no fault of our own, for no good reason, is discriminatory, divisive, and ultimately relegates British people abroad to being second-class citizens.",
        "background": "Millions of British citizens living abroad are arbitrarily disenfranchised after 15 years, even if they intend to return to the UK. All British citizens should have the right to vote in General Elections and national referendums, and should not lose their right to vote as long as they're  citizens.",
