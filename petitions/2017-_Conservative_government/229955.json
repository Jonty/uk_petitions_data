        "additional_details": "Despite DEFRA's own report (see link) very little is being done to tackle this problem. https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/assets/documents/reports/cat11/1708081027_170807_AQEG_Biomass_report.pdf  This petition is to force DEFRA to take proactive action and ban wood burning before this too becomes a national health risk, as diesel emissions have become. Under the radar the problem with burning solid fuels has re-emerged due to a totally unnecessary fashion accessory and status symbol.",
        "background": "Every year more people have wood burning appliances installed in their homes to the detriment of air quality everywhere. There is a wealth of evidence available from numerous sources to show how damaging PM2.5 particulates are from burning solid fuels and their contribution to air pollution.",
