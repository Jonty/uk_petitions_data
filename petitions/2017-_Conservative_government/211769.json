        "additional_details": "I had my operation Wednesday and due to the surgical team looking after me a lot of my notes: bloods and also the information I should of received  wasn't provided due to gynae expecting surgical to provide it and vice versa.\r\nHaving a gynaecology operation is such an emotional thing and you really need a team of nurses and Drs who are specialised in that area to provide the patients with the care and dignity they need.",
        "background": "Having recently had a hysterectomy I was appalled to find out that there is now no gynaecology ward in singleton hospital and that all gynaecology operations are now being done on a mixed sex ward.  Women are vuneral after having such a personal operation and shouldn't be around male patients.",
