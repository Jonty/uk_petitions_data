        "additional_details": "I am a class one driver and every year I have to sit a CPC course just to keep my class one license. I also have 11 years NCB on one car and 9 years on another car. I drive every day for my job and do more miles in a week than more people do in a month. But this is done in a company vehicle under company insurance.",
        "background": "I had two non fault accidents where the other drivers crashed into me, after which they both admitted fault. However my car insurance company still increased my premiums and called me high risk. I did not claim and at the time of each accident I was driving a company vehicle under company insurance.",
