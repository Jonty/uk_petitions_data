        "additional_details": "Respected charities acknowledge cancer results in an immediate increase in expenses. When it\u2019s cold, there are increased heating costs. Eating a healthy and varied diet is expensive.  Patients suffer from extreme fatigue and many have to swallow their pride by asking for help performing very basic and personal tasks.  There\u2019s also an array of appointments to keep that result in additional transport costs. Having cancer is therefore not only frightening and degrading, it\u2019s also expensive.",
        "background": "Under the 3 month rule, I don't qualify for PIP. I\u2019m therefore living with debilitating stage 4 Cancer whilst trying to get by on SSP and donations. As cancer now affects one in two people, PIP must be made available to all patients receiving chemotherapy, as this is when we need financial support.",
