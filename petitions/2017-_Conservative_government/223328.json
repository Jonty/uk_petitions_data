        "action": "Abolish the 3 types of civil restraining orders.",
        "additional_details": "Civil Restraining Orders (CRO) were created without public consultations or parliamentary debates. CRO effectively bans victims from seeking justice, is easily given by judges and there is no appeal to a different judge. This is profound as such serious \"gagging orders\" and \"bans\" should not be allowed in any civilised democratic society, especially since the UK has the most prominent profile on human rights and equality. It is every citizen's right to sue if she/he has exhausted other avenues.",
        "background": "Many victims who pick up the courage to sue the perpetrators in civil courts often end up with one of the three types of Civil Restraining Orders, which prevents them from seeking justice in the courts. Such orders are unacceptable in a civilised democratic society.",
