That is an internal party matter and nobody else's business, but that question should have been put to the whole opposition.",
        "background": "This country cannot function without an effective opposition and the opposition cannot function without an effective leader.\r\nThe current leader appears to be blinded by personal ideology over Europe and is failing to oppose on the most fundamental issues that the country has faced in decades.",
