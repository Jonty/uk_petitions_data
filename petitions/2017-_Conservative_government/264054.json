        "additional_details": "450,900 British troops died in WW2\r\n60,000 British and commonwealth civilians also gave their lives. As a mark of respect we should honour them with a dedicated national ceremony on a day of their own. \r\n\r\nThe British get the fewest holidays in Europe. Our European neighbours who we helped liberate, celebrate far more public holidays than we do in the UK, with Spain, Italy and Russia leading the way with 12 days each.",
        "background": "The Government is moving next year's early May bank holiday back by 4 days to coincide with the 75th anniversary of VE Day\r\n\r\nIt is right and proper we celebrate this historic day but Friday 8th May should be an extra bank holiday to properly mark the sacrifice our troops made to liberate Europe",
