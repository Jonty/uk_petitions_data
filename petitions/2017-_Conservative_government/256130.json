        "additional_details": "With fatalities almost every year. 84 horses have \u201cdied\u201d since the grand national began, three of them, in the last three days alone. Subjected to exploitation, pain, suffering and fatal injuries. \r\nAnd somehow this is glamorous.\r\nThe raw reality is these horses are killed. Killed by the hands of society, by those of us that tune in to watch, that sit back in silence, we place our hands in our pockets and slide nooses around their necks.\r\nThe Grand National is a disgRACE.\r\nIt is time for change.",
        "background": "Every year, horses are used, exploited and abused. They are dehumanised, their pain, their suffering, their lives destroyed and devalued. They are herded together, racing along a deliberately hazardous track renowned for the world\u2019s most dangerous jumps. All in the name of money and entertainment.",
