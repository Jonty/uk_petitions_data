        "action": "All chewing gum sold in the UK from 2023 must be easy to remove from paths.",
        "additional_details": "The LGA estimates the annual cost of removing pieces trodden into pavements across England has reached \u00a356 million, with around six tons dropped in the West End of London alone each year. It claimed that while the average piece of gum costs about 3p to buy, local authorities have to spend around \u00a31.50 to clean it up. (This estimate: 22 Nov 2014)",
        "background": "Chewing gum defaces public paths, blocks toilets and damages clothes, and cleaning costs a huge amount. This proposal gives manufacturers a realistic time to improve their formula.",
