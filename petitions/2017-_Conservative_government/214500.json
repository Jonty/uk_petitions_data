        "action": "Remove the smoking ban from all NHS Mental Health hospitals",
        "additional_details": "Some patients are at a high risk of absconding from the hospital so the option of supervised smoking breaks outside of the hospital grounds is not an option. My brother was admitted on Sunday, it is now Wednesday and he has not been allowed 1 cigarette during this time. It has been proven that people suffering from mental health use smoking as a way to self-medicate, when someone who is already battling demons is forced to quit so abruptly IT CAN ONLY BE DETRIMENTAL TO THEIR HEALTH & RECOVERY",
        "background": "When in a mental health crisis, quitting smoking is an unnecessary stress to place on a patient and it may lead to people discharging themselves against medical advice or not seeking help in the first place. My brother suffers from schizophrenia so I have seen first-hand that this is true.",
