        "action": "Reduce the foreign aid budget and increase police funding from the savings.",
        "additional_details": "In compliance with UN guidelines, the government spends 0.7% per annum on foreign aid, which equated to approximately \u00a312bn in 2015.  Much of this goes toward slush funds and dubious projects in which we, the taxpayer, currently have no say.   This is our money, thus we demand a say.",
        "background": "The government proposes increases in council tax to raise \u00a3450m extra funding for the police.  Sign this petition if you want the government to reduce foreign aid to cover this cost rather than to further increase our taxes.",
