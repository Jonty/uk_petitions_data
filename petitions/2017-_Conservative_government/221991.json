        "additional_details": "the rules for part time maintenance loans need to be standardised across the board and student who are currently 1 or 2 years into their degree should be treated equally with those who are just applying to start their degree.  additionally only part time distance learners who are disabled are eligible for the maintenance loan, i propose that the rules are brought in line across the board and made available to all students without discrimination to existing students.",
        "background": "the new provision to allow new part time students eligible for a maintenance portion of student finance, is unfair to legacy & distance learners, currently if you are a part time distance learning student you do not qualify for the maintenance loan unless you have a disability & are a new student",
