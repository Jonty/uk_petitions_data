        "additional_details": "I understand some people cannot make it to the gig and need to sell their tickets but in that case, they do not need to sell above face value. Touts should not be able to sell above face value + any transaction fees. \r\n\r\nTo stop this, these reseller sites should be forced by law to only allow tickets to be sold at face value + any transaction fees and then add a small fee so that the site is still profitable. There is no reason for people to be selling tickets above face value even if they cannot attend an event.\r\n\r\nLet's get this to parliament and force them to listen. Let's eliminate ticket touts from the industry and let real fans attend gigs again.",
        "background": "Ticket touting has to stop. Real fans are waiting an hour early to buy tickets only to be disappointed when all tickets are gone almost instantly. \r\n\r\nTicket touts are using bots to buy a number of tickets only to sell them for 5x the amount on reseller sites such as Get Me In and StubHub.",
