        "action": "To ask The Queen to exercise the Royal prerogative and dissolve parliament.",
        "additional_details": "For the Queen to disband parliament, the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the UK, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these matters. It is believed that in certain circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly, on the condition that \"an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors.",
        "background": "A dissolution is allowable, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation. The monarch could force the dissolution of Parliament through a refusal of royal assent; this would lead to a government resigning.",
