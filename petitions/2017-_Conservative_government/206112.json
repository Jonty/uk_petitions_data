        "action": "Stop the setting of homework for children until the age of 14 in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "I do believe that work beyond the classroom becomes relevant and important as children embark on their GCSE and A Levels.  I also believe that there is an argument for determined practice but this needs to be driven from within and a desire to learn and succeed; not a product of relentless persuasion from a parent.   Unfortunately, by the time children reach GCSE, homework has become an arduous task with little meaning or benefit.  It is purely a task which has to be endured; there is no investment or passion.",
        "background": "Homework is killing our children\u2019s love of learning.\r\n\r\nWe need to remove the unnecessary pressure and stress of homework.  We need to liberate our children to enjoy the fun and freedom in life.",
