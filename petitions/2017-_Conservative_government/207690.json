        "additional_details": "The 2016 EU Referendum gave the voter a clear choice to 'leave' or 'remain'. It did not say 'partially leave' or 'leave with a transition period' or 'leave but remain  in the single market' or 'leave but remain under EU law' nor did we agree to have a '2-tier legal system; one for foreigners and one for British citizens'.\r\n\r\nUnless the intended will of the majority of the people is implemented, democracy is dead in this Nation and RIP to all those who died to keep us a free and sovereign Nation.",
        "background": "We are a democratic Nation. Parliament is therefore \"by the people [MPs] for the people\". The EU Referendum gave a clear instruction to Parliament to withdraw from our membership of the EU - not a partial withdrawal;  we voted to cut ALL ties including the single market, ECJ and to control borders.",
