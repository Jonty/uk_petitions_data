        "action": "Install deposit boxes for plastic items across the UK, like those seen in Sweden",
        "additional_details": "Returpack is a non-profit organisation which sets up deposit boxes for plastic materials and Returpack's revenues largely consist of the deposit fee added to the packaging which thus gets returned via the deposit boxes. So far, the recycling of PET bottles and aluminum cans has reached 85%.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, much of the profits gained by Returpack then go towards other projects for renewable energy, providing a sustainable future.",
        "background": "Around 275,000 tonnes of plastic is used annually in the UK, with an average of 15 million bottles per day. Most families throw an average of 40kg of plastic waste away, which could be recycled. \r\n\r\nBy introducing deposit boxes like 'Returpack', the rate of recycling could grow massively.",
