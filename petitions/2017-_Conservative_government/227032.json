        "action": "A compulsory peace army for all 18-25 year olds to rebuild war-torn areas.",
        "additional_details": "We spend an ever-increasing amount of money on social services and health - \u00a3250bn pa - and a large percentage of that goes into supporting unemployed young people and treating health issues they develop like drug abuse, obesity, and depression. Gang warfare, violence and crime are part of the fallout of a society which isn\u2019t working. Rather than continue to plaster over the problem let\u2019s create a special military style body aside from the regular army for a compulsory one year of their lives.",
        "background": "Many countries have been destroyed by war. We have a society in the UK where young people lack identity and direction. This is a golden opportunity to help them to help themselves and others in dire need. It\u2019s a win/win. Introduce the young to discipline and positivity and help countries to recover.",
