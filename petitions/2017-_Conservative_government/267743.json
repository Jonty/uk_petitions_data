        "additional_details": "My mother was involved in a serious RTC on the A38 in December 2017 resulting in horrific life changing, life limiting injuries. In July 2018 the lorry driver responsible received 5 points and a \u00a3300 fine. My mother and our families lives have been completely shattered by his actions and we are left devastated by the complete insult in what he was handed by the court. My mother is one of many lives who has been made to feel worthless by the way our justice system treat those responsible.",
        "background": "Currently there is no law for causing a person a serious injury by careless driving in the UK. This means careless drivers are ruining lives every day on our roads and only receiving points on their licence and a fine at the most. This needs to change.",
