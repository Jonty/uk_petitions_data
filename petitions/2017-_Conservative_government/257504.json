We call on the Home Secretary to launch a public enquiry to ensure this public broadcaster complies fully with the charter to ensure it does not undermine democratic processes in the UK.",
        "background": "The BBC\u2019s reporting of Brexit is biased as evidenced by the disproportionate number of people appearing on it\u2019s programmes who voted remain and the treatment of people who voted to leave. People on both sides of the argument must be given an equal opportunity to make their case.",
