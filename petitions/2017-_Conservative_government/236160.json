        "additional_details": "This will prove very costly to families. \r\n\r\nAlso, EU nationals were excluded from the EU referendum, yet they are being asked to pay for a fee to be able to stay in their homes. \r\n\r\nThe home office has said that this is an admin fee comparable to a British passport, yet this is compulsory in order to not become an illegal immigrant whereas to take out a passport is not.",
        "background": "The newly created settle status requires all EU nationals that would like to stay in the UK after brexit to apply for it. \r\nThe fee for adults is \u00a365 and for holders under 16 is \u00a332.50. \r\nRegardless of time spent in the UK every EU national will be required to pay.",
