        "additional_details": "Under the new bill, divorcing couples will no longer have to blame each other for the breakdown of their marriage.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the bill follows a public consultation where family justice professionals and those with direct experience of divorce voiced their support for reform.\r\n\r\nIt's well known that hostility and conflict between parents leave their mark on children and can damage their life chances.",
        "background": "The divorce, dissolution and separation bill had very strong support amongst legal professionals, MPs and the general public.\r\n\r\nIn July this year, the bill reached report stage in the house of commons. Unfortunately, due to the prorogation of parliament, the bill will be cancelled.",
