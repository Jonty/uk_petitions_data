        "additional_details": "Zoroastrianism enters recorded history in the 5th-century BCE. It served as the state religion of the pre-Islamic Iranian empires for more than a millennium, from around 600 BCE to 650 CE.  Zoroastrianism was suppressed from the 7th century onwards following the Muslim conquest of Persia of 633\u2013654. In 2015, there were reports of up to 100,000 converts in Iraqi Kurdistan. Zoroastrianism has influenced the Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism.",
        "background": "Schools should teach pupils about Zoroastrianism. It is one of the world's oldest active religions. It is the first monotheistic faith centered in a cosmology of good and evil and an eschatology predicting the ultimate destruction of evil. Ascribed by Zarathustra who lived almost 3,500 years ago.
