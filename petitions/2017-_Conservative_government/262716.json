        "additional_details": "The reason for me creating this petition is to help people. I want to put a stop to this once and for all, I don't want others to experience the things I did. Yes I had a supportive family but we shouldn't have to go through it! Being disabled or plus size doesn't mean we deserve to be abused and trolled! We should be able to post what we like and not get thousands of abusive comments. Let's make body shaming a criminal offence! Together we can put a stop to this!",
        "background": "When I was about 6 months old, I was diagnosed with a condition called Optic Nerve Hypoplasia. From an early age I was bullied and trolled. When I was at school, I was discriminated against and I also received death threats. You wouldn't think that being a bit different could cause you so much hurt!",
