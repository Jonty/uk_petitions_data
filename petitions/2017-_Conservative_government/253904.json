E-petitions can be signed by anyone who is a British citizen or UK resident, including people who aren't on the electoral roll.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for only people who are on the electoral roll to be able to sign petitions and for signatories' details to be checked against it if that is something you would like to see happen."
