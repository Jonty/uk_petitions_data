        "action": "A new referendum on whether or not The United Kingdom should leave the EU",
        "additional_details": "I have always been a remainer, but also respectful of democracy. Some of my friends and business colleagues voted for Brexit, while I was keen to remain. My reason for calling for a second referendum is nearly all of those I know now say they wish they had voted to remain. Many felt misled by the leave campaign, others now regret their vote based on the knowledge they have gained through the process.",
        "background": "The original leave campaign was flawed and as a result many people voted to leave the EU without really understanding what they were voting for and certainly based on misinformation. Brexit negotiations are now highlighting the genuine challenges and this has created a change in public opinion.",
