There should be no taxation without representation, and people who have shown their commitment to the UK for 5 years or more are, in my view, entitled to have a say in how the country is governed. Anything else is clearly unfair, undemocratic, and unacceptable.",
        "background": "My Swedish wife has been here for 36 years and is barred from voting in GEs and referenda. This is an affront to any acceptable standard of democracy. She works and pays taxes here, and has had a National Insurance Number for many years. Sign if you can see that this is deeply undemocratic.",
