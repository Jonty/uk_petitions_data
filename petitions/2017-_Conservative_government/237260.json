        "action": "Over turn the proposed ban on log burners and open fires",
        "additional_details": "Many people depend on their wood burners and open fires as their main source of heat. Frankly life would not be worth living in the winter months without a real fire. Many elderly people use open fires, this is their only form of heat.\r\nBurning wood is a natural process whereas burning fossil fuels is an unnatural process. Without burning wood the only source of heat will be through oil, gas or electricity all of which produce pollutions in their own form far more serious than burning wood.",
        "background": "How will the government's anti-pollution strategy affect you?\r\nHeavily-polluting log burners and open-fire fuels will be banned\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition to over try and over turn this ban",
