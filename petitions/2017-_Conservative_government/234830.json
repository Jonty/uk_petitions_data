        "additional_details": "I propose that the law should be adapted to:\r\n(1) A person (A) commits an offence if-\r\n(a) A intentionally penetrates the vagina, anus or mouth of another person (B) with his penis; \r\nor \r\n(b) A intentionally penetrates their own vagina, anus or mouth with another person\u2019s (B) penis: \r\nand: \r\n(c) B does not consent to the penetration, and \r\n(d) A does not reasonably believe that B consents.",
        "background": "The UK law for rape states that only a male can rape a female. This is sexist. In some cases of female on male rape a baby is conceived and the male victim is forced to pay child maintenance. This is simply not good enough. When a male is rapped the female offender is charged less time.",
