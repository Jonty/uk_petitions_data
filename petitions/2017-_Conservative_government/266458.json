Currently paid carers receive between \u00a38.21- \u00a310.phr.This totals between \u00a3287.35 -\u00a3350.00 P/w. Carers are unable to work or cannot sustain any type of employment, often due to unpaid leave to attend appointments or emergencies due to deterioration of health of themselves and those they care for. \r\nThis results in a less equal 'playing field' when applying for and gaining employment.",
        "background": "Carers allowance is a payment paid to unpaid carers, who care 35 hours or more a week. This allowance is subjected to income tax and \u00a3287 is deducted off any legacy benefits. Currently, the hourly rate of carers allowance is \u00a31.89= \u00a366.15. If carers earn over \u00a3123 a week they lose the allowance.",

We're not sure if you want to increase the amount of Carers Allowance people receive, increase the weekly earnings cap or both. We're also not sure if you want action to help unpaid carers in receipt of Carers Allowance gain employment.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
