        "additional_details": "Homes are taken with compulsory purchase schemes, leaving people unable to buy locally. E.g: owners of 2 bedroom flats in Grahame Park Estate London NW9, have homes taken for less than \u00a3251k. Replacement flats priced at \u00a3450k, though 2 bed flats sell for \u00a3275k-\u00a3290k in area. Where once a block of 12 flats stood, there is block of 58, plenty of profit. \r\n\r\nShared ownership and share equity leaves developers owning homes they have already sold, like rogue bank rules. Soon handful will own most of UK",
        "background": "New builds are priced out of the reach of UK residents. The price is not justified by costs. Communal lands are taken and even our homes are being demolished to build new cramped homes which are priced more than an equivalent property in the same area. The market is rigged against UK residents.",
