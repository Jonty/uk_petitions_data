        "additional_details": "The referendum would include the following options:\r\n\r\n1. Leave: No Deal\r\n2. Leave: Deal\r\n3. Remain\r\n\r\nIf options 1 and 2 combined achieve over 50%, then the higher of these will prevail. If Remain achieves over 50% then Britain will remain in the EU.\r\n\r\nBefore the referendum, Boris's final deal must be made public so that voters can make an informed decision on their future, something that they were prevented from doing on 23 June 2016 due to false and wishful campaigns from both camps.",
        "background": "As an answer to the Brexit situation which is currently showing no signs of being solved satisfactorily by anyone's standards, I propose that Boris Johnson is given until 4 October to agree an improved deal with the EU before a final referendum takes place, in time for Britain to leave this month.",
