        "additional_details": "Allowing ratification without thorough parliamentary scrutiny and the final say surely weakens the hand of the UK negotiators. I believe that the only rational motive for Dr Fox being allowed to ratify the deal with the US unchallenged would be to allow him to do something that the British public would not approve of, e.g. to hasten the destruction of the NHS.",
        "background": "An Act of Parliament is required which provides that: \r\na. Ratification is no longer a prerogative power \r\nb. the treaty text must be laid before parliament for 3 months \r\nc. an order to ratify must then be laid under affirmative procedure whereby both houses have to vote yes, or it fails.",
