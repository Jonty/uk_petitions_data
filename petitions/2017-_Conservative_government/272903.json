        "additional_details": "We have watched the House of Commons and House of Lords debate Brexit for years and waste millions, if not billions of tax payers money due to delays. The claims that a no deal is in democratic is deplorable and the MPs need to be held accountable for their actions. We must have a chance to vote as the 361 MPs who are suppose to be representative of 65million people in the UK clearly are not. If this was a company people would be held accountable for their actions and probably made redundant.",
        "background": "The fiasco over Brexit has been a joke and the MP\u2019s have acted against the will of the people but worse there Manifesto. The decision to leave the EU permanently with a deal or no deal must be via the will of the people and the only way to do this is by holding an election immediately.",
