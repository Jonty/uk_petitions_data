        "action": "Create a alternative to pay insurance for drivers who deem interest as forbidden",
        "additional_details": "This has nothing to do with avoiding a fee but rather this is about not being compelled to undermine your beliefs by unfair terms and conditions. Similarly, this is happening to many University students who are placed in a situation where they are forced to pay interest at university and undermine their morals or to not compromise and be forever uneducated. Therefore I fear if something is not done immediately this will continue and Muslims will only be Muslims by name and not by nature.",
        "background": "Islam forbids interest and certainly drivers who deem interest as forbidden should be allowed an option to pay an alternative fee not \"insurance\" as insurance is deemed by many Muslims as a form of gambling. Ultimately, Muslims should be able to drive a car without compromising their way of life.",
