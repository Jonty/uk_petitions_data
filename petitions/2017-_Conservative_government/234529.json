        "additional_details": "The Brexit deal currently being debated in parliament will culminate in a decisive vote due to be taken by parliament on 11th December. Given the discord across the House it is likely that this will fail. The consequences arising from that may require another referendum or a general election; either of these would benefit from the inclusion of the currently disenfranchised ex-pats and from which they are currently debarred.",
        "background": "Voting rights expire currently after 15 years of living outside the UK. Various promises to restore these rights have been made in recent years but nothing has been done towards repealing the current legislation imposing this undemocratic restriction.",
