This must change, how many more precious lives before responsibility is owned? And what for? The bonus packet - for figures of rejected claims. Cherry picking, and choosing holes to gather evidence against the vunerable, disabled and suffering is immoral. Do you agree? Mental handicap is not in association with physical.",
        "background": "Many lives have been ruined and lost due to the scrutinising eye and systematic rejection from DWP fitness for work. Repeatedley stated 'It is the daily effect not the diagnosis' in many cases, with a score judgement system gathering inproper, unfair evidence. Leading to brutally felt rejection.",
