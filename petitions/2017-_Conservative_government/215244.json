        "additional_details": "Every day students are using worksheets and paper in lesson, however, instead of putting used paper in a recycling bin it is put in the normal bins to go to landfill. I find this shocking, I myself believe that recycling is such an easy way to prevent waste going to landfill sites. There is an easy way to combat this problem, by ensuring every classroom in every school across the country has a recycling bin, many more teachers and students could be compelled to recycle their paper.",

I understand that in the current environmental climate, we should be doing all we can to create minimal waste.
