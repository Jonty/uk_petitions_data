        "additional_details": "The changes regarding the standing charge were introduced in 2013.\r\nI am aware of one elderly customer that became confused when the charges were introduced so much so that she stopped using gas. She had no hot running water or central heating for four years. Upon investigation it was discovered that during this time she had accumulated a dept for standing charges of \u00a3265 even though no gas had been used. A representative at one of the utility companies intimated that debts were quite usual especially over the summer months.",
        "background": "Utility companies can separate the standing charge from the cost of supplying gas/electricity when on a prepayment meter.\r\nThis standing charge is applied daily regardless of credit being available on the meter. Where there is no credit available this standing charge starts to accumulate as a dept.",
