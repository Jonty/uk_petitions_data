        "additional_details": "The questions submitted to CQC have been added as supplementary but not mandatory, meaning inspectors can currently choose not to ask them. The questions covered sexuality & relationships polices, sexual health, sexual rights and training for staff and people who use services. Read more about them https://www.choicesupport.org.uk/blog/easy-complacency-or-hard-commitment \r\n\r\nSocial care staff are faced with difficult situations and are often untrained in this area, as it is not seen as a priority.",
        "background": "Social Care inspections do not include specific reference to relationships & sex, making it possible to receive an \u2018outstanding\u2019 rating, whilst ignoring an essential part of people's lives. CQC said they cannot add mandatory questions for inspectors without amending the Health & Social Care Act",
