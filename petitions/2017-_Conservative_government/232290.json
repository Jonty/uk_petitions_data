        "additional_details": "I helped my neighhour rehome his cats due to illness and provided the family who took them with paperwork, advice and medication (regular flea and worming treatment). Only to find out months later they were found under a shed, near starved and miles away from our home. Many facebook posts of injured or dead cats receive less shares than those of dogs. Owners of cats love their pets equally and it's about time that society recognises this despite their preferences of a pet and family member.",
        "background": "To see a dog roaming on its own causes concern, yet a cat on the streets doesn't? Cats are provided freedom by their owners but can, like anyone get lost, so surely we should have greater protection over them as it became a requirement in 2016 for dogs to be chipped. They're family too and loved.",
