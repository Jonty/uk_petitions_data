        "additional_details": "When the temperatures drop in winter, as they do in the UK, pensioners in Spain need to burn wood to keep their homes warm - homes that have been designed to remain cold in summer become very cold in winter. A great many pensioners are not wealthy but just about surviving on their meagre pension income. The seasonal temperature variation can be as much as 50 + centrigade with the temperatures falling below 0 degrees centigrade when the Sun sets in the Winter season.",
        "background": "Expat Pensioners have paid into the system and require parity with Pensioners in the UK. If it is right for UK residents it must be right for Spanish expatriates to receive their allowance.",
