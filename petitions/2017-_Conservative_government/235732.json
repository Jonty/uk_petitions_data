        "additional_details": "Whether your support lies with Mrs May\u2019s negotiated EU deal, or a No-Deal exit from the European Union, few can argue that neither approach will have the required level of support in the HoC.\r\n\r\nBrexit itself is looking, on whatever level if the U.K. don\u2019t retain a form of customs union with the EU, as a precursor to the Good Friday Agreement ending, after all the WTO don\u2019t allow for soft borders, & Brexiteers won\u2019t stomach any continuing EU union/ties.\r\n\r\nPlease add your signature to this petition.",
        "background": "The 2016 vote saw a huge turnout on the subject of our future relationship with the EU, but was managed & campaigned for & against, under clouds of conjecture, false truths, spin & undeliverable promises\r\n\r\nWith more facts & realistic outcomes, plus analysis.. a 2nd, informed vote must be considered",
