We feel that the need to adequately defend ourselves and our families becomes a basic right when the police and judicial system are unable to fulfil that duty as is the case at present.",
        "background": "Request that in light of significant police cuts, a steep the increase in violent crime, and a reduction in detection and convictions for violent crime, that citizens be permitted to defend themselves against attackers without fear of prosecution.",
