It sends a mixed message about what the values of the town really are,and is a depressing sight for people who are already depressed,as it suggests that the prevailing attitude in Southend is Sleazy and Superficial rather than Understanding & Compassionate.\r\nhttp://www.echo-news.co.uk/news/15517776.Lap_dancing_club_is_given_a_new_licence/",
        "background": "Along with existing but disregarded concerns raised at Council about this Club dragging down the reputation of the town by approving unsavoury behaviour, the Club has been built directly next door to \"The Taylor Centre\", which is Southend's Psychiatric Clinic. Where traumatised women will see it.",
