        "action": "Leave the European Union on March 29th 2019, with or without a deal.",
        "additional_details": "Theresa May has repeatedly told the British people that No Deal is better than a bad deal, but parliament has twice rejected her deal as bad for Britain. The same parliament has voted to take no deal off the negotiating table. The Government has failed to make the necessary preparations for leaving the EU without a deal suggesting that the Prime Minister cannot be trusted to honour her promise to deliver Brexit on 29/03/19. The Prime Minister is now seeking a delay and the EU are in control.",
        "background": "On the 23rd June 2016 the people of the UK voted to leave the European Union. After more than 2.5 years there is a very real chance that the democratic will of the people will be prevented from happening by parliamentary infighting and Govt. incompetence. Deal or no deal, it is time to leave.",
