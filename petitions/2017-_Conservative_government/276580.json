        "additional_details": "There has been government guidance that personal finance topics be included in key stages 3 and 4, but it's estimated that less than half of schools teach it.\r\n\r\nThe Office for National Statistics reported in 2018 that for the first time in 30 years, 'each UK household spent or invested around \u00a3900 more than they received in income in 2017.'\r\n\r\nClearly there is still a deficiency in basic concepts of personal finance.\r\n\r\nPersonal finance should be a statutory compulsory subject from Key Stage 1 to 4.",
        "background": "There's a dearth of knowledge of personal finance when children finish school. Fundamental concepts like budgeting, investing, pensions and debt aren't well understood.\r\n\r\nMaking 'personal finance' a compulsory subject across Key Stages 1 to 4 will help bridge that gap for a thriving future society.",
