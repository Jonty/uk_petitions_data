        "additional_details": "We believe that hydraulic fracturing will have a serious adverse impact on the environment, residents and global climate change, now and in the future.\r\n\r\nThere are many scientific references available to support this view and we urge the government to review these reports.\r\n\r\nIt is imperative that the UK is not reliant on fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nGreg Clark MP, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, has the power to make the final decision on fracking and ban it in the UK.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, seek an immediate ban on hydraulic fracturing in Lancashire, and the whole of the UK.  This would bring us in line with other European countries, including France, Germany and Bulgaria, who already have bans on hydraulic fracturing in place.",
