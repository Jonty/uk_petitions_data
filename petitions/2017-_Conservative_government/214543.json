        "additional_details": "No allowances are made by the DWP for mental health conditions. They need to properly differentiate between physical and mental ability when noting our capabilities. An assessment with a stranger is incredibly difficult- it\u2019s hard enough to tell family of our issues. Waiting for a DWP assessment is awful; weeks worrying about what\u2019s to come. Two years now I\u2019ve arrived and been turned away as they\u2019re running behind, meaning I\u2019ve had to suffer the anxiety of waiting all over again. Horrific.",
        "background": "DWP health assessments are a hellish experience for sufferers of mental health disorders. \r\nI suggest:\r\n- Cutting wait time for assessments\r\n- Own doctors do them\r\n- DWP penalised if they cancel on the day\r\n- Contact to be made more sensitively, in a way that won\u2019t aggravate our conditions",
