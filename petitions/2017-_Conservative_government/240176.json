Depression may not present itself until the third month after delivery. \r\nNewborn babies sleep patterns are non existent and vary until the third month when a routine is fully established. \r\nSome mothers require surgery, from episiotomy to c-section, and will find simple tasks like walking, going to the toilet and making meals difficult and straining",

Mothers need this time for emotional and physical support wether they are recovering from minor/major surgery or if postpartum depression develops (and can affect one or both parents)",
