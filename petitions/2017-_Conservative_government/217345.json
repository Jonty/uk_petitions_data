        "action": "Stop the UK government from initiating illegal military action in Syria",
        "additional_details": "The underlying case for taking military action is simply based on mere assertions made by the prime minister herself and not credible indisputable facts resulting from a transparent impartial investigation led by a team of chemical weapons experts. The legal basis for military action doesn't exist. The U.N security council has not sanctioned military intervention by the UK and her allies, the Syrian government has not made a legal invitation, the matter hasn't been debated & voted on by MPS.",
        "background": "The British government is about to embark on a dangerous military operation in Syria that risks escalating an already complicated conflict and driving the UK potentially into an international collision with Russia,Iran and others.\r\nThe government strategy on dealing with Syria is completely flawed.",
