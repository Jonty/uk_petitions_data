        "additional_details": "Military Spouse Appreciation Day in America was created by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, he wanted to raise awareness of how much the commitment of a spouse helps serving military personnel get through tough times! \r\n\r\nThe first one was celebrated on May 23rd 1984 and since then has been held every year on the Friday before Mothering Sunday\r\n\r\nWe already have a day to show how much we appreciate our amazing armed forces (Armed Forces Day) but I think the spouses need some recognition too",
        "background": "Being married to somebody in the military can be pretty tough sometimes yet spouses in the UK prove time after time just how amazing and strong they are.\r\n\r\nI think this should be highlighted just like it is in America, They have a Military Spouse Appreciation Day every year",
