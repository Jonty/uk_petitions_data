Believe the accusations of the mother which at this stage of the dispute have no proof.It actively stops fathers from access short to medium term of the dispute causing untold damage to the bond between the father children. They don't want a section7 fearing that dad gets custody,running against their ethos. As it fails dads through its own prejudices so failing Children. This must be stopped forthwith,",

Supporting mothers position over what is best for the child, which IS their remit.",
