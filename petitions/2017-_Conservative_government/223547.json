        "additional_details": "A lot of people are uneducated about food allergies and the severity of them. A work place should be a safe and comfortable environment but for many people like myself this lack of knowledge means these foods may be brought in, causing a risk of anaphylaxis, a life-threatening condition.\r\n \r\nEmployers should ensure staff are creating a safe environment for their colleagues and this includes not consuming foods that others have severe allergies too, this can be done by educating people on allergies and anaphylaxis. I have been working for a company for 5 years and still have colleagues who eat nuts around me causing me to go in to anaphylactic shock.",
        "background": "The government must make a specific law making it clear that employers have a legal duty to protect employees with serious food allergies.\r\n \r\n",
