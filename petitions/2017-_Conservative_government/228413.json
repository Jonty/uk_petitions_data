The hospital he was transferred to didn't have a specialist in to treat my son's lungs, if it was a multi specialist hospital my son might of survived. Too many patients are in the wrong hospital for their injuries, there needs to be a range of specialists available.",

He was transferred to Walton Neuro who are head and spine specialists, not lungs. My son was in the wrong hospital for his lungs.",
