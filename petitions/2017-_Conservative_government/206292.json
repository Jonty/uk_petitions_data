        "additional_details": "There has been an increase in the number of horse riders injured or killed and horse injury or fatality. Many riders suffer abuse or have experienced bad or inconsiderate driving from other road users, so would avoid using the road if there were alternative routes. Most riders do not have direct access to a bridleway or do not have a local bridleway at all. We would like to effect changes to make it easier to create more accessible and safer riding routes.",
        "background": "The roads are becoming an ever increasingly dangerous place to ride. We are proposing a simplification or change to the laws relating to RoW that will encourage landowners to allow upgrades of footpaths or more willing to create permissive riding routes, nationwide.",
