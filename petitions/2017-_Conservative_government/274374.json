This is what protects our justice system... the ability to have a fair trial being extended to everyone man and woman up and down the country, no matter their background or financial status. \r\n\r\nOver \u00a31bn in cuts to legal aid over the last 5 years has been a disaster. Call on the government to protect our democratic justice system\r\n",
