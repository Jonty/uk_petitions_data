        "additional_details": "I propose we make Bonfire Night a national holiday. The Americans and Canadians have Thanksgiving but it doesn't seem right to copy this. \r\nInstead let's make the quintessentially British Bonfire Night a national holiday. \r\nCommunities can come together and make/share food. Kids doing 'penny for the guy'. We need this. \r\nLet's make it happen!",
        "background": "Between August bank holiday and Christmas there are no national holidays in the UK. This leaves millions of people with nothing to look forward to for months on end and has led to the overhyping of Christmas. \r\nWe need another holiday to look forward to. We DESERVE another day of celebration.",
