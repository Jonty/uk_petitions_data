        "additional_details": "To seek asylum in the UK, one must physically be in the UK but applying for a visa is not practical for people in these situations.  Millions in taxpayer's money is spent on fences to stop people, who are fleeing war zones, from coming to the UK. Those who try risk their lives. We need provisions designed with refugee circumstances in mind that can be applied for remotely from temporary settlements in Europe. These visas would feasibly allow refugees to enter the UK legally and claim asylum.",
        "background": "The refugee crisis is still severe in Europe. Only a small percentage of refugees desire to reach the UK, however they cannot claim asylum in the UK unless they are physically here, which is impossible considering their circumstances. ",
