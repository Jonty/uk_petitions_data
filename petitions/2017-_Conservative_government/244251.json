        "additional_details": "Without them many Jews and their descendants would not be here today. During the Holocaust, in many parts of German-occupied Europe, helping Jews was punishable by death. Despite this many sought to save them. These Righteous individuals helped Jews escape from ghettos, hiding them, forging IDs, providing money, food and medicines. Some were murdered along with those they sheltered. To date, 26,973 Righteous have been recognised by Yad Vashem, but many more remain unknown.",
        "background": "I am a Holocaust survivor rescued by the Righteous. Most people were bystanders during the Holocaust, but thousands of non-Jews risked their lives to help Jewish people. We would like the UK Government to fund a section of the Holocaust Memorial and Learning Centre to honour these heroic people.",
