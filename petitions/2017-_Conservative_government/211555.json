It\u2019s rather frustrating seeing people the same age living fully on benefits and being better off than me getting nails done , hair done and I can barely afford food. \r\nThis petition is for the government to lower the age on working tax credits for those like me who have always lived independently and worked like \u201cthe government want us to\u201d",
        "background": "In order for under 25\u2019s to become satisfied in working and believing they are better off working. \r\nI have lived alone since the age of 17, and have always worked full time.  However because I am under the age of 25 I am not entitled to working tax credits what difference does the age make?",
