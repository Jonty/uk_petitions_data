        "additional_details": "Unable to provide essential opportunities deprives state educated students the ability to gain crucial skills which more advantaged students in private schools and colleges have already developed.

This means we simply cannot aspire to achieve what our more privileged peers will achieve except in exceptional circumstances.",
