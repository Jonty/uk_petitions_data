        "additional_details": "Unable to provide essential opportunities deprives state educated students the ability to gain crucial skills which more advantaged students in private schools and colleges have already developed. As a result, the social mobility which has been a goal of every recent government is undermined from the start. This means we simply cannot aspire to achieve what our more privileged peers will achieve except in exceptional circumstances.",
