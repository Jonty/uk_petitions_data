        "action": "Reform refund process for parents\u2019 costs for SEN appeals and fine councils",
        "additional_details": "Parents are forced to pay out thousands of pounds to have their SEN children properly assessed and cases brought to appeal. Many are put off by high costs and by some councils\u2019 illegal actions. If a refund is sought, a complaint has to be brought against a council and then referred to the LGO, which takes a year on average. Most of the SEN parents are exhausted by the time they appeal. We are hoping to change councils\u2019 behaviour and enable them to get things right first time.",
        "background": "The process of applying for refunds for the costs of parents that go through SEN tribunal must change. Tribunals must be given the power to refund the costs of parents and fine councils found to be acting unlawfully.",
