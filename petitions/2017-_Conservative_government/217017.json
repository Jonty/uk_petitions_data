        "action": "Legalise the availability of Pepper Spray / CS Gas for law-abiding citizens",
        "additional_details": "The UK is one of the few countries where pepper spray / CS gas is illegal. Not only is it illegal, but it's classified as a firearm. Women, lone travellers etc face the reality of being confronted with a knife, acid or a gun in London every day WITH NO DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nThis would stop a huge number of stabbings.\r\n\r\nThis petition is not about legalising pepper spray for everyone, only for people with no criminal history. Law abiders should have the right to carry non-lethal personal protection spray.",
        "background": "London is in a crime crisis. As a father; I worry that I have no means available to protect my children in the event of being approached by an armed assailant, especially someone with a knife. Pepper Spray for law-abiding citizens is a deterrent and a solution for tackling low-level street crime.",
