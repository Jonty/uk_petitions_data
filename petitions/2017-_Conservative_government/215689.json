        "action": "Please give every child in England the opportunity to study Classics.",
        "additional_details": "Classical ideals of wisdom & virtue formed the foundations of our education system. Increasingly however, we have adopted a more utilitarian approach to the education of the majority: where the focus is the creation of individuals whose labours can best serve the economy.The type of education system we create, determines the type of society we create. A stressful, competitive system that focuses on preparing students to be valuable to an economy, does not nurture the healthiest individuals - nor the healthiest societies.",
        "background": "Threatened by govt funding cuts and a reputation of elitism & irrelevance, the study of Classics in state schools is in peril.Yet, it continues to be taught in most private schools-for good reason. Classics explores what is eternal about humanity. It teaches us to think & debate. Skills we all need.",
