        "additional_details": "Since the fee has increased, the dropout rate has increased dramatically. The fee is discouraging people from wanting to go to University including myself, meaning that our futures may be limited due to the worry of the high fees.",
        "background": "In a world that is becoming increasingly harder to find a job in, it seems unfair for students to have to pay such a large amount that seems unreasonable. I am aware that even people who payed \u00a33000 are struggling to pay off their fees still and the fact that it has almost tripled is ridiculous.",
