        "additional_details": "It is unbelievable that the publics rights to freedom of information is In 2018 still being violated by the DVLA and car keeper details are still withheld from the public and kept secret only to be sold to third party companies [clamping and parking firms] (for \u00a32.50 each check) it is absurd that these details should be held private and it shouldnt be any different than The Land Register that is available to the public. I don\u2019t think I need to explain why all the HPI records should be free.",
        "background": "Fight for the freedom of information and the abuse by the current system forcing people to pay \u00a320 to check a car for its records! \r\nAll information should be free to the public including the details of the registered keepers. In many scenarios this free information could avoid a lot of difficulties",
