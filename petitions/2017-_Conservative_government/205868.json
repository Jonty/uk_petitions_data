        "additional_details": "I've just been through the process again, spent hours doing many calculations and making comparisons between, not only one energy supplier's tariffs, but also between multiple suppliers, it was confusing and impossible to make an informed choice. I consulted acquaintances, friends and family, who all agreed. Having just ONE standard daily standing charge would make such choice simpler by removing one variable. Switching may be ideal in principle, but is often a leap in the dark for many people.",
        "background": "Energy suppliers offer multiple tariffs, which are likely to have different combinations of unit price and daily standing charge. Making an informed decision about WHICH tariff and/or supplier to use is made more complex by having these differences. Unit only variables would simplify that choice.",
