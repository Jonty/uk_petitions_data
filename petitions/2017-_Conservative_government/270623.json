Cities emit carbon and are also heating up, with vast swathes of black surfaces and glass magnifying the sun's heat. Changing planning law would mean that every company has to take responsibility for the emissions their building would create and not only reduce them but add extra plant life to absorb C02. Adding photovoltic glass, & other green energy tech should be mandatory. We don't have long!",
        "background": "In many cities worldwide, there are planning laws for developers, they contribute a set sum per square foot they develop & use it to add gardens, parks & even trees on buildings. Green city tech exists & the UK ought to be using it. \u00a31.50 per square foot would ensure investment in healthy cities.",
