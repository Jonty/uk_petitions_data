        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum was overshadowed by misinformation from both sides, scaremongering and possibly foreign interference. \r\n\r\nThe voters did not fully understand what the EU is or the impact on their lives and the UK as a whole. \r\n\r\nThis petition is no attempt to change the fact that the UK is leaving the EU.\r\n\r\nHowever, and in the name of democracy, the voters should enjoy a referendum to decide if the UK should join the EU again after the 29th of March 2019.\r\n\r\nFor Queen & Country,",
        "background": "The UK is leaving the EU on the 29th of March 2019. There will be no second referendum for leaving the EU. The applicant accepts this.\r\n\r\nHowever, the applicant strongly believes that there should be a referendum for joining the EU again on the 30th of March 2019.",
