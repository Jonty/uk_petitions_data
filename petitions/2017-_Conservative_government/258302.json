        "additional_details": "Stop such disturbing situations with licensing for all pets, bringing verification that a new owner considers future costs and care. Including microchipping in the fee enables pets \"found\" to be identified and more, whilst saving costs and time. Licences can register vital details such as behaviour, medical, acts of cruelty and Pet Passports, amongst other important details which often cannot be obtained when an animal is found, sold or given away, whilst also stopping irresponsible ownership.",
        "background": "The sales and methods of obtaining animals have regularly proven misguided, cruel, irresponsible and illegal. Due to lack of appropriate regulations, animals are often acquired with dire outcomes resulting in pets abandoned, used for dog baiting, farmed for breeding, stolen and irresponsible owners.",
