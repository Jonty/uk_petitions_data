        "action": "Make young person\u2019s insurance considerably cheaper now we have black boxes.",
        "additional_details": "In addition, it\u2019s been widely reported in the media recently that young people are learning to drive at 17/18, but then can\u2019t afford the full insurance premium once they\u2019ve passed their test. It may be several years before they can afford full insurance, which is leading to an increase in accidents due to lack of driving practice. Young drivers are being unfairly penalised so I believe the situation needs to change. Please sign and share my petition. Thank you.",
        "background": "Young people nowadays are charged more than ever to drive a car. Now that black boxes are virtually required to insure your car and night-time curfews are being considered, young people should now be statistically safer drivers. So why is insurance for a 17 year old almost always more than \u00a31,500?",
