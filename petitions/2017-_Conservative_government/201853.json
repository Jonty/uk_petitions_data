        "additional_details": "The EU has had made wild demands for money from the UK, clearly intended to bolster its flagging finances rather than to settle any actual liability.  Given that satisfactory accounts have never been delivered the payment of any such sums would be maladministration for which the Civil Servants and Secretaries of State responsible should be held to account and therefore surcharged if adequate safeguards are not in place.  The Lisbon Treaty makes it plain all liabilities end on BREXIT.",
        "background": "The UK has belonged to the EEC/EU for 44 years.  Auditors state there are significant accounting errors since at least 1995.  This means there is no honest mechanism for determining any liability.  In such circumstances it would be misappropriation of public funds to pay anything further to the EU.",
