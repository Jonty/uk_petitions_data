While not all of this would be suitable for seeds, the Bees will take any help they can get.\r\n\r\nThere is no expectation of ongoing maintenance by landowners nor any effort required to prepare the site, before they spread the seeds.\r\n\r\nEach site would have Perennial Wildflower seed spread on open soil once, with the seed being provided by the Government at no cost to landowners.\r\n",
        "background": "Bees have taken beating so far in the 2010's, what I propose is a simple, cheap way to help them out.\r\n\r\nWe should require inactive Brownfield site landowners to sow wildflower seeds on their sites where there is soil available, until development begins.\r\n",
