        "action": "Require any driver with points on their licence to have Black Box Car Insurance",
        "additional_details": "A driving licence is a licence to drive motorised vehicles on our roads after demonstrating competence at driving and knowledge of the Highway Code. \r\n\r\nDrivers with points on their licence have demonstrated they are driving poorly. Black Box technology can educate a bad driver to become a good driver and highlight bad driving. This is shown by the low premiums being offered to young drivers by black box policies. \r\n\r\nBanned drivers should have a lifetime requirement to use Black Box Insurance.",
        "background": "With over 1,700 people dying and over 180,000 injured on our roads every year, and with 80% of drivers breaking the 20mph speed limits, bad driving has created a huge cost to society.\r\n\r\nThe Black Box Car Insurance policy significantly modifies driver behaviour making them into model drivers.",
