        "additional_details": "We believe travel companies, holiday providers, airlines and resorts should not be allowed to hike up their premiums during school holiday time since people with children are not allowed to travel during term time. This is unfair and frankly makes thousands of families unable to take their children away for a much needed break - ours included.",
        "background": "Since the government has made it an offence to take children out of school during term time, it seems drastically unfair that people are forced to pay thousands of pounds more to take their family away during school holidays. This means that the average family now cannot afford to have a holiday.",
