        "additional_details": "In London alone there were 23,000 motorcycle theft related incidents in the last 12 months. It is appalling to think that the police are not being allowed to chase the thieves who regularly do not wear crash helmets, as they know the police will not risk injuring them.\r\nHelp us back the hardworking people of Britain and their motorcycles and bring these criminals to justice.",
        "background": "The theft of motorcycles has massively increased in the last 18 months with the thieves brazenly riding the stolen vehicles around knowing the police can not give chase in case they are injured.\r\n\r\nIf they are prepared to steal they should be prepared to face the consequences.",
