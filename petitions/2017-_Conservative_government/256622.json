        "additional_details": "A recent sentence for the cruelty of a dog was enforced to a man called Martin Morley of Cardiff was no where near good enough he left a dog sufferin outdoors in a cage with a tumour on his leg and screamed in pain for 4 days in excruciating pain until nieghbours called the RSPCA in and the dog was removed but was in such  a mess was put to sleep my cousin was the one who told him to get her to a vet and when approached the owner prior to this all he could reply was she is going to die anyway.",
        "background": "Tougher sentences are needed on animal cruelty and the person to be named and shamed.\r\nPets dont choose us we choose them and they deserve to be treated as a human would expect to be treated jail time minimum time 6 months and fined from a \u00a31.000 upward and never to own an pet ever again.",
