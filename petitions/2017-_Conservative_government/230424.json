        "additional_details": "Statutory maternity pay is currently the lower of 90% of your weekly wage (pre-tax) or \u00a3145.18 per week. \r\nThis is significantly lower than the state pension (\u00a3164.35 p/w)\r\nThis is lower than the benefits cap (\u00a3384.62 p/w).\r\n\r\nAlthough becoming a parent is (for many) a choice, SMP is not sufficient to pay monthly bills and also provide for a child. This means many parents either delay or do not have children (and pregnancies are more high risk with older mothers), or are forced to return to work.",
        "background": "Becoming a parent can result in a significant reduction in income, causing many families to face cash flow problems. \r\n\r\nMany working parents are forced to return to work before a time which is best for their own mental health/the wellbeing of the child due to financial difficulties.",
