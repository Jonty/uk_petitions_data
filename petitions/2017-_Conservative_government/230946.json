        "additional_details": "I strongly agree with the teachings of maths and feel it is one of the most important subjects in life. \r\nHowever as a student myself and from many sources, in future life you do not need to know pie, or how to work out the angle of a triangle.\r\nI have no idea how to handle money and how to spend and save wisely and when needed in life.\r\nI feel it is a waste of education not having social skills and common knowledge on everyday life needs. \r\nThis needs to be added to the curriculum for schools!",
        "background": "Schools need to be teaching and setting up kids for every day life post 18, and not how to find a missing angle in a triangle, or how to calculate pie on a calculator. \r\nIndependence, tax, mortgage, social skills and handling money should be taught to cope in the future.",
