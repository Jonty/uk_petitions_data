        "additional_details": "The work of Edward Bernays shows how media has often been used to 'manipulate the masses' and sway political opinion. Freedom of speech should always be protected, however media outlets should have to declare when they are financially affiliated with the topic they are discussing. This will not completely stop biased reporting, but will allow people to understand the authenticity of their source.",
        "background": "Apply the same logic as social media adverts and create new legislation which requires media to declare when they have a financial affiliation with the topic they are reporting on. Stop hidden biased reporting and ensure tailored stories to support political agendas are transparent",
