        "additional_details": "This will help children to develop a healthy relationship with food and subsequently lower the obesity rate in the future. We believe this is a more effective method than balanced diet lessons which are easily disregarded, and making fruit available at this age increases the potential of them choosing fruit over less healthy options in the future. This will also help less privileged children obtain a better attitude towards fruit which often isn't found in their day-to-day life.",
        "background": "Young children are growing up without crucial influence on how to lead a healthy lifestyle. We want all state-funded and private primary schools to provide fresh, seasonal fruit at break time daily.",
