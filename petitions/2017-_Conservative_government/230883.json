        "action": "Ban all non-recyclable plastic within 5 years",
        "additional_details": "The government has a very complicated 25 year plan to eliminate plastic waste but they could pass a law to ban these products in our shops within 5 years or sooner. Our current government is largely sponsored by big businesses and won\u2019t want to cause them the bother of producing alternatives which won\u2019t destroy our precious world. However, as we elect and pay for these people to represent our wishes it is time we demanded what we want for our children\u2019s future.",
        "background": "Every year in the UK we buy around 3.7 million tonnes of plastic as packaging, with only 842,000 tonnes being recycled. We as the UKs consumers find this to be unacceptable for the environment and the future of the planet.",
