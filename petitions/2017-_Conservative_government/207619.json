        "action": "Increase the age that a puppy can be imported into the UK to six months.",
        "additional_details": "Importing a puppy can cause great harm to the dog through the impacts it will have on its behaviour and health. This also put other dogs at risk as the puppy can be carrying diseases such as rabies and lung worm which are not found natively in the UK. \r\nBy raising the legal age of importing it reduces these risks along with tackling the illegal puppy trade. At six months old dogs are more mature and are less likely to be sold on to unknowing members of the public.",
        "background": "By doing so the risk to the individuals dog's health and behaviour, the risk to healthy dogs within this country will reduced hugely.  \r\nThis will tackle the illegal puppy trade as dogs will be more mature when imported and are less likely to be sold on to unknowing members of the public.",
