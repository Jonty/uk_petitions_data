        "additional_details": "One exam board would stop this.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, revision resources are poor. But, converting to one exam board will create a single/larger market for people to produce educational content for, meaning it can be higher quality.\r\n\r\nE.g. 2 At A-level, I wanted to produce a revision site for A-level STEM subjects, however it is a waste of time because too few students would use it, because there is too much content between the 5 different exam boards.",
        "background": "I'm at my 1st year of university. A lot of time is wasted covering content covered at A level; this was also true for A level regarding GCSEs. Why? Because multiple exam boards mean students don't cover the same content, so it has to be taught again at the next level of education.",
