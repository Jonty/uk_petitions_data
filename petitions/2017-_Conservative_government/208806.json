You\u2019re therefore highly likely to encounter someone who is on the autism spectrum at some point in your policing career. This might include autistic people who aren\u2019t yet diagnosed.\r\n\r\nThis guide provides background information about autism and aims to help all police officers and staff who may come into contact with autistic children or adults meet their responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 (Disability Discrimination Act 1995, Northern Ireland). It\u2019s designed to be used as a regular reference.",
