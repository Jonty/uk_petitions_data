        "additional_details": "This Great Nation claims to be truly democratic.\r\nIf the elected MP's of Great Britain are unwilling to enact the will of the 17.4 million majority vote to leave the EU, it is no longer fulfilling it's constitutional role.\r\nMP's are often quoted as voting with their conscience & their opinion, they are elected to vote according to the electorate. To do otherwise is a breach of trust.\r\nAny attempt to reverse article 50 would set a dangerous precedent, making all voting open to immediate challenge.",
        "background": "The population of Great Britain voted to leave the EU. They did NOT vote for additional delays in the 'Hope of maybe', they voted to leave.\r\nMP's are elected by the people, for the people, and do NOT have the luxury of their own opinion. They should honour thier commitment to the people or resign.",
