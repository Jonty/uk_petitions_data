They also told me that they simply go on people's trust. \r\nA new law and background checks would make it more secure, safer and companies more accountable. The way it is now anyone could make up information because no checks are being done.",
        "background": "The current system of no checks done needs to change and the new law needs be implemented. So please can we stop this loophole, make background checks on company directors and secretaries happen soon?",
