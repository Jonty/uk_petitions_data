They never try stop the dogs, there\u2019s people telling them to stop it but yet the people get off the horses and whip the people trying to stop it all from occurring. So it\u2019s obviously not a trail, it\u2019s obviously deliberate, they are killing wild animals for no reason, claiming that they all need to be extinct so we can save chickens, why don\u2019t people just put their chickens somewhere safe?, it\u2019s nature animals kill for food, we would do the same.",
        "background": "Well as most the public know there are many people killing animals, and 3/4 of the public will agree that it should be stopped. They chase a small animal around a field until it\u2019s tired and collapses so it get ripped to pieces by 12 dogs and they claim it\u2019s a trail and it was an accident\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d.",
