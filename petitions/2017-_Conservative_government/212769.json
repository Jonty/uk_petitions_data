        "additional_details": "There is no longer justification for 43 constabularies with all the expenditure associated with them. We need a major re-think. Budget saved would be used to increase front line officers delivering policingthe through a streamlined, efficient leadership model. Supported financially by the sale of headquarters buildings the service can become more visual as should be the case. The knock on effect would also mean the reduction of Crime Commissioners and their entourage within a refirmed structure.",
        "background": "Policing has moved on. Crime is again predominating. Policing is asked to do more with ever decreasing numbers of officers. Yet the only section of the police family that is suffering is the front line. A fundamental change is needed.",
