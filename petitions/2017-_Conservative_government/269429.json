        "additional_details": "The Police have guidelines regarding what speeds are prosecutable it would be nice for the public to know too. Every Motorway service station and would even go as far as filling stations should have stocks of leaflets explaining the rules clearly. What is occurring right now is the Police theoretically beating drivers with an iron rod to achieve compliance and it is very wrong.",
        "background": "Drivers are being unfairly punished for minuscule breaches of speed by variable speed cameras. People who have maintained clean licences for as long as fifty years and receiving points . Very Unfair. Highways have never educated drivers with regard to these variable speed devices on Smart Motorways",
