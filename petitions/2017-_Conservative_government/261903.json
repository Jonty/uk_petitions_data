Also, by 2050 there will be 12 billion tonnes of plastic waste in natural environments- 800,000 tonnes of this from UK supermarkets alone!\r\nFind more information on the damage caused by plastics and current campaigns at:\r\nhttps://www.greenpeace.org.uk/",
        "background": "Cheap plastics come at a grave cost- the survival of our planet. Plastic survives for over 400 years, far outliving the wildlife we let it destroy, so we need dramatic action. By placing a tax on single use plastic, we can encourage alternatives that don\u2019t risk our only home: Planet Earth.",
