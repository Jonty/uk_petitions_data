        "additional_details": "ECOCIDE is defined as \u201cextensive loss or damage to, or destruction of ecosystem(s) of a given territory(ies), such that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants has been or will be severely diminished.\u201d [Submitted to UN Law Commission, 2010 by UK barrister Polly Higgins.] To establish seriousness, impact(s) must be widespread or long-term or severe. As with other atrocity crimes, those liable to prosecution will be persons of superior responsibility such as CEOs and government ministers.",
        "background": "Climate agreements and civil laws have failed to prevent escalating harm to the Earth. A criminal law of ECOCIDE would criminalise practices known to destroy ecosystems and/or exacerbate climate breakdown. It's the only way to force industry to change direction.",
