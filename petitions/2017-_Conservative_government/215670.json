        "additional_details": "On the 27th August 2017, metro.co.uk released an article outlining how McDonald's offer gluten free buns across 11 countries in Europe. When seeing this article, I jumped for joy, only to realise that the UK was not included in this list (unless you count lettuce as a bun...). \r\nIf McDonald's have the ability to offer gluten free buns in places such as Denmark, Switzerland and even the Spanish islands of Majorca and Tenerife - why can they not bring the option to the UK?",
        "background": "A gluten intolerance/sensitivity is a problem for so many individuals in the UK, yet big fast food restaurant chains fail to recognise it. I believe if McDonald's offer gluten free buns in the UK (which they already do in multiple other countries), other fast food chains would soon follow by example",
