        "additional_details": "Current practice allows social workers to refuse to allow a parent to digitally record or have a witness to what is said or written. This is detrimental to parents as this evidence can\u2019t be used in family courts and this needs to be changed. Having seen first-hand that there are opportunities for corrupt practices, it is my desire to see the law changed to require recording of all meetings pertaining to family court involving social services, parents and all other parties involved.",
