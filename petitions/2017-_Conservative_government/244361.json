        "additional_details": "There were 42,957 offences in the 12 months ending in September 2018, a 31% increase on the previous year and the highest number since 2011. Out of the 44 police forces, 42 recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. With the deaths this week of Jodie Chesney, a 17 year old, and incidents in Manchester and Lancashire, we need to ensure more police are on our streets and more stop and searches are being carried out.",
        "background": "The number of police officers in England and Wales has fallen by over 20,000 between March 2010 and March 2018. These figures refer to the number of full time equivalent officers. The number of police officers in England and Wales is the lowest recorded level since the early 1980s.",
