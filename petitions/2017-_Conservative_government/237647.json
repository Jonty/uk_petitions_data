        "additional_details": "During the 2017 general election, I realized that it was getting difficult for me to find party policies and for me to make up my mind. I propose the Government establish a website that allows users to look at summaries of party policies in a clear, concise, easy to understand, and most importantly, unbiased, way. At the end of these short policy summaries should be a link to that party's full manifesto. I believe that doing this, will allow young people to engage with politics on a much easier level.",
        "background": "Finding out what each party want to do, especially online, is extremely tricky. There is a lot of jargon, and no website that lays out policies in a simple to understand way. I am a young, totally blind, person in my 20's and the system has left me very confused.\r\n",
