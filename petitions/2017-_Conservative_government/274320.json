        "action": "Reject the Hong Kong MTR from building and running Britain's railways",
        "additional_details": "According to reports, the MTR has been collaborating with the Hong Kong SAR authority, by letting the police to intimidate passengers and also providing their trains to transport riot police for cracking down protestors on the street. There are serious concerns that this company, currently operating the TfL Rail and the South Western Railway, is unsuitable to bid and run railways in Britain and overseas.",
        "background": "The government should revoke MTR Corporation from operating any railways in the UK and bidding new projects, because it is not an independent transport company. The Hong Kong SAR government, under international criticism for its handling of protestors, still controls most of the company's shares.",
