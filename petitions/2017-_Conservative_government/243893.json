        "additional_details": "MPs received a pay rise last year and in fact the past 10 years they have had a rise from 65k to this eye watering figure of 79k. It's above inflation and during a time when we are seeing cuts to our services . I propose that this year MPs receive no pay rise and the funds instead are invested into helping our most vulnerable in society such as homeless veterans.",
        "background": "The current salary for an MP is \u00a377,379. MPs also receive expenses to assist them with staff costs, travel food and having somewhere to live in London . In 2019 it has been proposed that their salary should rise to \u00a379,468. Which is a rise of 2.7 percent.",
