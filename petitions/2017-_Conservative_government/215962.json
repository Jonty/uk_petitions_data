        "additional_details": "Has St. Paul\u2019s Carnival been cancelled over the last few years because it celebrates freedom from how bristol viewed black people many many years ago? Does this show that our government doesn\u2019t want to celebrate our freedom? St Paul\u2019s Carnival should be celebrated as if it was any other event,not just because of a gold anniversary? Something needs to be put in place to allow it to happen every year,now that Carnival is happening this year it has to be shut down at 11pm a change needs to happen.",
        "background": "St. Paul\u2019s Carnival is a annual day of the year to celebrate black community and culture, over the last 3 years it hasn\u2019t happened but yet; Harbour Festival,Red Fest,Gay Pride,Tokyo World and more proceeds every year but St. Paul\u2019s Carnival only has it this year because of an 50th anniversary..?",
