        "additional_details": "Currently veterans will meet annually to mix with old comrades and to get the feeling of support that we don\u2019t feel we get from our normal lives. The people missing from these events are the homeless Vets and PTSD suffers who struggle on a daily basis. I see this as an area that other Vets can support struggling veterans with one to one meetings or planned events. This could reduce suicides and reduce strains on the NHS. The number of travel could be set minimum of 3 per year.",
