        "action": "Require smoke masks in high rise buildings to assist evacuation in a fire.",
        "additional_details": "Emergency fire services are provided with breathing apparatus to access buildings on fire. Clearly providing modest masks for residents exiting a building through smoke filled lobbies and staircases would be of benefit. Moreover the masks would provide additional reassurance to residents.\r\n",
        "background": "The safe evacuation of a high rise building would be greatly improved if residents have access to emergency smoke and oxygen masks. The masks would reduce the potentially life threatening effects of smoke inhalation and improve the chances of safe evacuation. The masks cost less than \u00a350 currently.",
