The serious case review reported a failure of individual pharmacists as a direct cause of the avoidable errors in drug dispensation. Only in one case were the owners of the premise held accountable (vicarious liability). Pharmacists must be provided with the minimum time and resources to prevent these errors. Patient safety will improve by holding pharmacy owners to legal account and not scapegoat individual pharmacists.",
