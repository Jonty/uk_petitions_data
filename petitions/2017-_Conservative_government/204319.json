They're a menace in urban areas, they frighten pets, the elderly and the amount of fires and incidents goes up this time if year. They are becoming a nucience with the youth of today. They have no zero sense when handling them and give no hoots to the neighbours. You can say all you like about the sale of them to under aged persons but they just get their older siblings or equally stupid parents to purchase them. Time to ban the sale of fireworks to the public.",
