        "additional_details": "By now, this is what overseas voters get when they try to register for voting: \"You can register as an overseas voter for up to 15 years after leaving the UK, as long as you\u2019re a British or eligible Irish citizen, and   you were registered to vote in the UK within the previous 15 years (or, in some cases, if you were too young to have registered when you left the UK)\".\r\nA vast majority of countries in the world do not remove the right to vote, and neither should we. BREXIT shows clearly this.",
        "background": "Overseas voters should have their voting rights ensured, regardless of when did they leave the UK. Holding British citizenship shouldn't have a \"best before\" date; and in crucial times such as these, we as British expats should have the right to decide our common future too.",
