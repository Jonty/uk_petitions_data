        "additional_details": "Every car we use will pollute the environment. It doesn't matter whether it is an hybrid or electric etc. The level of pollution is affected more based on the annual mileage that a car covers rather than the type of car we drive. For example if you drive a diesel car but you only do about 2000 miles annually than the level of CO2 that your car emits will be less than that of a hybrid that does over 5000 miles.Car charges should focus on creating different annual tax groups based on mileage (MOT)",
        "background": "I find ULEZ and some other air improving policies totally useless as they are purely focused on profit and not environment. For example they promote the use of electric cars saying that they have a zero-emission which is scientifically totally wrong. Car batteries are one of the biggest polluters.",
