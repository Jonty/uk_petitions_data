        "additional_details": "I, as well as thousands of other people in the UK, find it hard to talk out about Mental Health, especially when our Job is concerned. We can\u2019t come to terms with telling our Manager as we fear for our job. People suffering with Depression, Anxiety or any other Mental Health condition should be supported at work. This Petition is to make Employers and Managers carry out the correct training to educate them on what we go through on a daily basis and ways to avoid our conditions spiralling",
        "background": "Mental health problems have a greater impact on people\u2019s ability to work than any other group of disorders. At the moment, we have no mandatory protocol, training or support for people who suffer with Mental Illness and this usually ends in dismissal by a manager or resignation of an employee.",
