In the UK we should revisit Meek Mill's visa application, because not only does he connect with many people here, but he can also help the UK by talking to the youth especially with our alarming knife crime statistics this year alone.",
        "background": "Robert Rihmeek Williams'(aka Meek Mill) first taste of prison came at the age of 18 when he was caught carrying a gun while shopping at a local grocery store. He has spent his adult life on probation and has been treated unfairly by police officers and courts.",
