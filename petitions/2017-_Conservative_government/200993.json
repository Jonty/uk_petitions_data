The delays encountered by ambulances having trawl between Taunton and Bristol are endangering lives.\"It's vital to keep this facility open 24 hours 7 days a week.\"\r\nAnother said..\r\n\"Please sign.. we need our local services. Bristol and Taunton are too far away, for the person having to care for them, for the ambulance service having to trawl back and forth and waiting times for ambulance services are endangering lives.\"",
        "background": "W-S-M, A&E shut on July 4th 2017 due to the fragility of the emergency services due of the lack of senior doctors. At least 27 people use the emergency services each night; from those, 12 are transported by ambulance. Not having their local A&E at their disposal is endangering their lives.",
