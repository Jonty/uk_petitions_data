        "additional_details": "I propose that critical thinking be introduced to the KS 3-4 citizenship curriculum. In addition to understanding the UK\u2019s political structure, it is crucial for students to be educated about the validity of media sources and media bias. These skills will become increasingly important in a digital world. In particular, these skills would help combat the destructive phenomenon of \u2018fake news\u2019. As such, critical analysis should be a compulsory component of the core curriculum.",
        "background": "Politics and the media affect every citizen in the United Kingdom. However, the link between the two is poorly taught. Critical analysis of media sources is not a core component of citizenship studies. For our students to mature into well-informed voters, these critical skills must be introduced.",
