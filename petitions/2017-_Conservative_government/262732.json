        "additional_details": "The government has emphasized the importance of sustainable onshore oil and gas exploration, appraisal and production in the national planning policy framework given the benefits of reducing imports, creating jobs, community benefits and sustainable transition away from coal to cleaner energy. Mineral resources of the country are for the benefit of all and control of these resources by local authorities and residents influenced by vocal unscientific minorities disregards the greater good for the majority.",
        "background": "The local planning authorities seem to be influenced by vocal minorities who scaremonger people inducing delays and unnecessary objections to very scientific and detailed applications made by UKOG. Planning decisions which affect the nation should perhaps be taken by the central government.",
