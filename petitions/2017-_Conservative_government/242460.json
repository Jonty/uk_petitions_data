        "additional_details": "As a nation we need to prevent those from IS and having links to the IS from living in our country and endangering our families. Shamima Begum wanted to come home for her baby\u2019s safety, I want her and all of those with links to the IS like her father out for my baby\u2019s safety to prevent more events such as the Manchester Arena attack and the many other attacks easily accessible via google. We do not deserve to have these threats living among us under the protection of the government.",
        "background": "Post the Shamima Begum disaster, it is clear that we are a soft touch to those betraying this country and therefore we need to tighten the reins. This country has already suffered enough from the likes of British members being radicalised by the IS and therefore we cannot afford greater risk.",
