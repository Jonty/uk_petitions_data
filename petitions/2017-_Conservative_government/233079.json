        "action": "Brexit: Amend or reject the unlawful draft withdrawal agreement.",
        "additional_details": "The backstop cannot be exited by the UK unilaterally. This is to meet the express intent of the EU to make it \u2018election proof\u2019. This aim, and its expression in the draft withdrawal agreement, is incompatible with the UK constitution, which states that no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. It is also incompatible with Article 3 of Protocol 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights which guarantees citizens the right to vote in legislative elections affecting them.",
        "background": "The draft withdrawal agreement proposes a backstop for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland that flouts the UK constitution and EU human rights laws.\r\n\r\nIt must be amended or rejected.\r\n\r\nIt binds future Parliaments and removes a fundamental right of UK citizens.",
