They are then filmed and humiliated all across the internet for doing absolutely nothing wrong. Yet time and time again, these masked gangs are allowed to get away with it. This wouldn\u2019t be allowed in a city so why should it be okay in the countryside.\r\nI propose that all trespassing be made a criminal offence.",
