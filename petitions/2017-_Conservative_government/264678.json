Now after May's resignation the main leader coming up these days are not the person we like to see the Prime Minister of UK. If Boris Jonson was portrayed as prime ministral candidate during 2017 General Election, the outcome of the election could have been different. So the public must have their say and should have full rights to select their leaders rather than only the Tory MPs",
