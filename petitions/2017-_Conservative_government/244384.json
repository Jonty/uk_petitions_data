This is as ridiculous as deciding who gets IVF by their class and it takes most women over 2 cycles of IVF to fall pregnant",
        "background": "There are so many medical conditions that cause fertility problems in men and women, none of these are their fault but we suffer so much trauma and injustice as a result. Enough is enough, we need a fairer system to ensure that everyone who wants a child can have one without being crippled by debt.",
