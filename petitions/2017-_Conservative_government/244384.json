        "additional_details": "It's not just the medical condition the person is dealing with:-  \r\n-The pain\r\n-The feelings of guilt and self loathing\r\n-Depression \r\n-Potential operations \r\n-Time off work and financial problems \r\n-Feeling we are letting our partner down\r\n-Then the ridiculous postcode lottery system to fund IVF allowing some people in Britain 3 cycles of IVF, 2 cycles, 1 cycle or nothing at all. This is as ridiculous as deciding who gets IVF by their class and it takes most women over 2 cycles of IVF to fall pregnant",
        "background": "There are so many medical conditions that cause fertility problems in men and women, none of these are their fault but we suffer so much trauma and injustice as a result. Enough is enough, we need a fairer system to ensure that everyone who wants a child can have one without being crippled by debt.",
