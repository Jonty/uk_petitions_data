This country has already paid financially and with the blood and lives of our many war heroes.\r\nThe Government and Parliament (regardless of their own views) should now respect the country's vote and come together to enable the No Deal exit from the EU.",
        "background": "In 2016 when the country democratically voted - Leave won. There wasn't a discussion on soft/hard Brexit or any deals it was just Leave. OK there will be uncertainty but no-one knows exactly what that will mean. There is too much scaremongering about \"crashing\" out but we as a country will survive.",
