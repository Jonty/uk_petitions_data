        "additional_details": "Many students are already allowed to type exams on request. It seems like the logical next step to allow all students to type. Computer used to type have no access to internet, spellcheck or any advantage above a hand written examination. It is vital to be digitally literate in the modern world.",
        "background": "Students hand write lengthy exams using excessive paper only for it to be scanned in and virtually sent to an examiner to mark. In a digital age facing so many environmental problems, typing exams seems like an easy solution. Children should be taught to type as well as write from a young age.",
