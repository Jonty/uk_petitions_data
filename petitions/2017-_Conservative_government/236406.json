        "action": "Overhaul the universal credit system",
        "additional_details": "The suffering under Universal Credit is well known and reported. The government has been advised time and time again to halt the roll out and fix the problems. Yet it replies with spin and rhetoric that is neither realistic or representative of the experience of claimants. To continue to stick by this system is a clear violation of the governments position and an inhumane way to treat the most vulnerable in society.  It is placing undue pressure on other services and creating widespread poverty.",
        "background": "Restore welfare funding, pay childcare fees upfront, make direct payments to landlords, remove sanctions/ glitches to the system to regulate payments and assess income annually again. Cease with the online system and end over payments. Significantly reduce the taper rate and restore ESA funding.",
