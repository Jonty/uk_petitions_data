        "additional_details": "The public mood seems to be shifting further towards the Leave camp (depending on the polls) and a national holiday to celebrate British legislative independence would further solidify and galvanise the Govt. and the British people. Furthermore as a national holiday it would act as a unifier to bring both Remain and Leavers together after the Brexit vote to ensure we move forwards as 1 independent and sovereign nation.",
        "background": "To mark the historic achievement of the British people exercising their democratic right to claim back future sovereignty and to disentangle from the mechanisms of the EU we propose that March 29th be embedded as a national holiday - as a celebration of our future independence and sovereignty.",
