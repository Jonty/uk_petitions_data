        "additional_details": "We would like the government to have a debate in parliament about how we can solve the problem of period poverty.\r\n- Period poverty leads to women using newspapers, socks or even toilet rolls as an alternative. \r\n- What's more, we find young girls not attending schools insofar as they do not have appropriate sanitary products. \r\n- Most notably, there is an issue with the affordability of tampons and other sanitary products as many can't afford these luxury items.",
        "background": "In 2018, there were about 320,000 homeless people in Britain. Of these homeless people there are women who find themselves having their periods on the streets. This means a lot of the time the little money they receive goes on food or shelter leaving next to nothing for tampons.",
