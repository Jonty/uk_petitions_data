        "additional_details": "In March the progressive Chinese government announced another drop in VAT from 16% to 13% as part of their on-going gradual reduction of VAT to get it back to a sensible level as a sales tax. In the USA sales tax, they don\u2019t kid themselves calling it a \u201cValue add\u201d tax, is between 2.9% and 7.25%. Given all the taxes peoples pay one would think a fair, yet necessary sales tax is around 9% for us in the UK. Let\u2019s look forward with vision and start working VAT down from the ridiculous 20% level in support of a forward-thinking growth mindset \u2026.",
        "background": "UK VAT has reached 20% as a secondary tax. EU legislation requires it is at least 15% driven by a tax and government spend strategy in mainland Europe, primarily a French strategy. While this apparently works for them it does not suit our British market economic mindset.",
