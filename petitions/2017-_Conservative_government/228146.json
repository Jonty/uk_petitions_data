Since young people have to stay in full time education until the end of year 13, they should not be expected to pay adult fair on public transport.",

Many public transport fares are not set by the UK Government or Parliament. Where they are, for example regulated rail fares, they often do not have an under 16 discount.\r\n\r\nWe are also unclear what age you would like the reduced fares to apply until.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition setting out clearly what action you would like the UK Government or Parliament to take."
