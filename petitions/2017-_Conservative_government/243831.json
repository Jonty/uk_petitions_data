        "additional_details": "This is a subjective petition, EU fraud amounts to 5 or 10% of total EU costs, negate this in order to gain value for money for the tax payer. Moving the EU parliament every month costs upwards of \u20ac3M each time, another fraudulent waste of money. Over paid and unelected polititions taking what they can get out of the system with expenses paid, providing family and mates with similar opportunities, are indications of a highly corrupt political system, and is duplicated in 5 governments.",
        "background": "I propose we ban the governments of the United Kingdom, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales and all its assemblies and supporting structures, further to hand UK control to the EU in full and total patronage, thus saving the UK tax payer the costs of 4 governments out of 5.",
