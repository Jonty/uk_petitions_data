        "additional_details": "The people should therefore be asked whether they want the deal that has been negotiated (as it has been made clear that no alternative deal will be made available), no deal, or the revocation of article 50 to remain in the EU.

        "background": "The results of the recent local elections clearly demonstrated that the government's current Brexit strategy is not the will of the people.
