        "additional_details": "An introduction of packaging labels, such as an aeroplane icon on foods that have been transported to the UK by air or a water droplet to indicate the item required a high volume of water to produce, would allow buyers to make more informed decisions about their purchases to reduce their carbon footprint.",
        "background": "Currently, consumers are confronted with a barrage of information from the media about the significant carbon footprint of certain food transportation methods, but it is almost impossible to tell if food has been airfreighted. This would give consumers greater power to choose food more sustainably.",
