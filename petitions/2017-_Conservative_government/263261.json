        "additional_details": "It should be expressly noted that the recent pardon by Donald Trump does not change the fact of his convictions. The US Department of Justice website states that a presidential pardon \"does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction\". It also notes such a pardon is \"granted in recognition of the applicant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for the crime\".",
        "background": "Conrad Moffat Black is a British Lord. He has taken a leave of absence due to convictions for mail fraud and attempted obstruction of justice in the USA. The Government should revoke Conrad Black's title and membership of the House of Lords as he is explicitly a convicted criminal.",
