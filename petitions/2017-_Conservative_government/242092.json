It would be the responsibility of individual MP's to decide what hours they work. \r\n\r\nIn any case, the House of Commons is already scheduled to sit for eight hours each day from Monday to Thursday, and MP's often complete other work outside of these hours. You can find out more about this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-commons-faqs/business-faq-page/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking to change the sitting hours of the House of Commons, if that's something you'd like to see happen.
