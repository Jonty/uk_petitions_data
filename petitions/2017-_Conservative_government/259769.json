Most of the time the item can be repaired easily and then used, either by selling for a small fee or donating. Food items are discarded du to best before dates even though most items are still fit for consumption. The laws surrounding this action I.e trespassing, theft by finding, etc should be wavered/dismissed by laws. Protect the environment for future generations",
