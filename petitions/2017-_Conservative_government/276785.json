        "additional_details": "This could done by teaching young people about politics in schools, they could then undergo a test to make sure they know a certain amount of information about each political party so that it is not a wasted vote.\r\nFor example, the Scottish Referendum, I thought it was a great idea for 16 year olds to participate, but if you were to add up the amount of people that voted and were not sure what it actually meant for Scotland to go independent, means that it was a non-meaningful vote. Which then messes with the informative votes, people saw the opportunity and took it, which is great - if you know what you are talking about.",
