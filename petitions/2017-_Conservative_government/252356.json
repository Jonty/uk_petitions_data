        "additional_details": "Change the Law so it states that men can be raped by women and will be charged if they do so. Right now Rape is defined as a man penetrating a woman without her consent. This needs to be changed so men will be able to press charges of rape if it happens to them. Rape should be defined as sexual intercourse of any kind without consent or without reasonable belief of consent. This will help men speak out more about the trauma they have suffered.",
        "background": "Right now, the law states that woman cannot be charged with rape as it is a solely male crime. They can be charged with lesser crimes that carry a lesser sentence. However, the trauma that a man can experience does not match the sentence.",
