        "additional_details": "Entering the USA illegally was, until recently, a misdemeanor civil offence. The Trump adminstration has changed policy to make it a criminal offence, taking adults into custody. Because children can't be jailed with their parents, they are removed and put in \"detention centres\".\r\n\r\nMost of these adults are asylum seekers, but they are being processed as criminals, in contravention of UDHR.\r\n\r\nTrump is deliberately denying people their human rights and he should not be welcomed in the UK.",
        "background": "Donald Trump has implemented a policy which deliberately separates children from their parents when they enter the USA without papers or do not use a valid entry point. These people are not criminals; the majority are asylum seekers, following the procedure to apply for asylum.",
