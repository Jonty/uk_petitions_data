        "additional_details": "Let the person buying the Ale for over 15 years have some input as to whether the Hobgoblin Label should have protected status and not changed to something cheap and disrespectful to an iconic figure we have grown to love. The labels told a story with every different brew...and collectors and ale lovers worldwide out there will be devastated with the cheap line drawing of our hero now adorning the Wychwood bottle......As they state on the bottle They are Brewers of Character but not now.",
        "background": "These distinctive labels that adorn the bottles with artistry never repeated on any other Ales on the shelf... .Names like Dunkle  Fester..Scarecrow..Dr Thirsty .\r\nKing Goblin.. Pumpking and BlackWych will soon vanish onto obscurity...Shareholders do not care about the look of the bottle..but we do",
