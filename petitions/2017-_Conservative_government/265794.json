        "action": "Inquiry into the influence of lobby groups on policies about sex and gender",
        "additional_details": "How we think about sex and gender effects law and policy. Sex, not gender, is protected by the EA2010, but lobby groups who are influencing equalities polices have disputed that protections on grounds of sex are necessary. Why are only LGBT groups consulted on policies around sex and gender? If a policy affects all women, it is important to consult women. Organisations that have expertise in education must be consulted about the gender education packs currently going in to UK schools.",
        "background": "LGBT lobby groups such as Stonewall steer policy on gender. They have vast power to shape policy in the NHS, police, universities and schools, pushing the importance of gender self-ID over biology. Sex and gender are conflated to push a political ideology that's harmful to groups protected by the EA",
