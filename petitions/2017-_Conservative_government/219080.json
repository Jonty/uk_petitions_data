        "additional_details": "Hundreds of students get the 8:20 train every week, happily walking up the hill with just enough time to get to lesson. The new 8:30 train results in being late for lessons everyday- which negatively impacts our education and future career chances. Not only is it convenient, it brings people together- many friendships have been formed and strengthened on this train. Do not cancel the 8:20.",
        "background": "Recent train timetable changes to the transpennine express services have caused upset and distress to the regular commuters that rely on the 8:20 train to get to work and college. The 8:20 provides a perfect morning that doesn\u2019t require stress or sleep exhaustion due to having to wake up early.",
