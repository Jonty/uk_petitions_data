        "additional_details": "Our country has held referendums in 1975, 2011 and 2016. The first two referendums voted in favour of the government\u2019s position. 2016 was different as the people did not agree with the government. This means the people and parliament are now at odds. The only way to resolve things is to improve our dialogue such that people and parliament can speak with one voice. People\u2019s assemblies have a good track record and, iif we can learn from others, we can achieve a similarly good outcome.",
        "background": "People\u2019s assemblies have helped other countries out of difficult situations, e.g. Ireland and Mongolia. Ireland are our closest neighbours and I believe they could, and would, lend their experience to this process as they have a vested interest in us resolving this.",
