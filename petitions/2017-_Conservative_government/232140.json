        "background": "Mental illnesses do not disappear at the age of 18, yet it seems that in the majority of cases, once they turn 18, vulnerable young people are discharged from CAMHS, regardless of their mental health situation, not knowing whether they'll be considered \"ill enough\" by adult mental health services.",
