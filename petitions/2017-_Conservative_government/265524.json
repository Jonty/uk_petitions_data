        "action": "Change exam system to be less exam-based for more accurate results & less stress",
        "additional_details": "We surveyed 28 year 10 students who have just taken their first GCSE exams. 79% said they would prefer a less exam based course while 85% said they believe it would cause less stress. 79% of students feel there is too much pressure to succeed, and only 4% of students said they feel no stress at school. 36% of students said that they struggle with their mental health and 89% said they feel the NHS/government does not provide enough support for those who struggle with mental health issues.",
        "background": "Exams cause a lot stress which causes performance to be imprecise and grades to be inaccurate. A system based on 60% class-work 20% participation and 15% exams etc; would give a much more accurate overall grade and significantly reduce stress and anxiety in teenagers.",
