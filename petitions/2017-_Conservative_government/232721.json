Approximately 50,000 deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language (BSL) as their first or preferred language.\r\n\r\nDeaf children in the UK aged 0 to 15 is at 23000 so it shows that BSL should be in the National Curriculum so our children can integrate with the deaf community and BSL would be a language they would use lots off time in there life.",
