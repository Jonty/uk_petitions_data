        "additional_details": "We feel that the current government's Hard Brexit is fundamentally un-British: it is unfair, destructive, reckless, extremist, short-sighted and futile. Britain, on the other hand, has been admired throughout the world for its sense of justice, its creativity, its good judgement, its sensible approach to world affairs, its pragmatism and moderation, and its constructive willingness to engage with other nations and other cultures.These values constitute the true sovereignty of the United Kingdom.",
        "background": "Despite having been a supporter of the Remain campaign, the Prime Minister now insists that the UK must leave the EU at 11pm on March 29th 2019. Since the Prime Minister is allowed to change her mind, we the undersigned demand that the nation at large should also be allowed to change its mind.",
