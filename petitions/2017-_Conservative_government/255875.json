        "additional_details": "As an example, I have worked since the age of 16, progressed up the career ladder, spending thousands of pounds on training, to be an effective citizen and make change in education. However, if I want a child now, my pay would drop from around \u00a32500 to a mere \u00a3500 p/month.  With a mortgage of \u00a3650 this means I am no longer independent and would require my partner to cover costs.  How is that fair? It's not. If it was changed, to 50% pay, for example, that makes it fairer for all salaries.",
        "background": "In the current economic climate, more and more companies are not topping up statutory maternity pay the way they used to in the UK.  This then seems a punishment for women and their partners for having children, and makes it unaffordable for the professional woman to take a large pay cut.",
