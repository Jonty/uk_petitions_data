        "additional_details": "This would offer a credible and representative second referendum on Brexit and give the best chance for the results to be respected by all across the political divide.\r\n\r\nGiven the significance of Brexit and the impact it is likely to have for generations to come, I argue it is a civic duty rather than simply a civic right for all UK citizens to vote if there was to be a second referendum.\r\n\r\nAustralia, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg are some examples of counties that have compulsory voting.",
        "background": "If Article 50 is revoked and another Brexit referendum is announced, the government should make it law and compulsory for all eligible citizens to vote at this referendum. \r\n\r\nThose who wish, can choose to spoil their vote but nonetheless should have the duty to turn up.",
