To offer a delay of Brexit, a revocation of Article 50, limit the options for negotiations with the EU or a attempt a rerun of the referendum would be to avoid the simple glaring truth: this Parliament is no longer fit for purpose; the people must speak. We need an election. It is the only legitimate course of action. Demand a General Election now.",
