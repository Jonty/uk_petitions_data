        "additional_details": "Workers from Australia, New Zealand and Canada are very well thought-off within the UK workforce due to their strong work-ethic and can-do attitude. These temporary workers pay UK taxes and NICs as well as re-investing most of their wages into local economies and communities and, of course, UK Tourism. Their overall contribution to the UK economy and culture is great and yet the increased health surcharge will no doubt make working holidays to the UK even less accessible. STOP THE INCREASE!",
        "background": "1000s of young Working Holiday Makers come to the UK each year from countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada. \r\n\r\nVisa costs have already seen a sharp increase in recent years and the UK Government is set to increase them further still making UK working holidays less accessible than ever.",
