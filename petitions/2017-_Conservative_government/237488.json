        "additional_details": "When enquiring of Asda whether their own brand of toilet roll \"Shades\" contain animal gelatin or fatty acids, the response was:\r\n\r\n\"Due to the ever increasing ranges of vegan products we don't have a list of all the many vegan products that we have available\"\r\n\r\nThis could have been for any product and as such makes it difficult to tell if a product is cruelty free. All UK manufacturers (including food) should clearly mark all products at source, stating whether or not they are suitable for vegans.",
        "background": "Most shop bought items, for example cosmetics and toilet roll are not marked as containing animal products or being tested on animals. This makes them inappropriate for Vegans. In many cases, large stores such as Asda carry so many products that they themselves are not aware which ones can be used.",
