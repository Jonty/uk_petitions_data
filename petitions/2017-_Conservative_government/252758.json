        "additional_details": "Membership of the EU is the only rational response to an increasingly globalised world. It is necessary to ensure our continuing peace, stability and economic and cultural well-being. But we cannot be reluctant participants. Either we move forward and deepen our commitment, or we face stagnation and increasing international irrelevance. This petition is an opportunity for those who want much more involvement in the European Project to make their voices heard.",
        "background": "The extreme position for those who want to leave the European Union is a \u2018no-deal Brexit\u2019. It is sometimes said that the extreme position for those who wish to remain is to revoke article 50 and maintain the status quo. This is wrong. Many of us want a closer relationship than that indicates.",
