        "additional_details": "Those who seek to seriously harm and kill those who dedicate themselves to protecting us, show such a disdain for our society and it\u2019s rules that society should no longer have to worry about them being returned to the community in future. \r\n\r\nEmergency Workers should be safe in the knowledge that those who kill their colleagues will never be released. It is time to protect society and it\u2019s protectors from the greatest of evils, for there is no other word to describe those who kill our guardians.",
        "background": "With attacks on Emergency Workers rising in both number and severity (resulting in many serious injuries and the death of a PC) we believe it is time to introduce the harshest possible punishments.\r\n\r\nMurder of an Emergency Worker = Mandatory Whole Life Order. \r\n\r\nAttempted Murder = Mandatory Life.",
