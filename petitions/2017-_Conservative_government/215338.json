        "action": "Change the methods the Government use to record Homelessness",
        "additional_details": "Many people who the average citizen would classify as homeless are neglected from the record as they do not fit Government criteria. We cannot ignore the lives of individuals simply because they are not \"lying down in the street\" and instead are hiding in the crevice of a doorway. If the Government change the way they record homelessness to give a more representative statistic, as a united country we can tackle this issue with full knowledge of what we are facing.",
        "background": "The methods currently used by the Government to record Homelessness portray unrealistic results. Many people are concealed in the 'hidden homelessness' category as they sofa surf or move around on the streets. Current figures are an underestimate, many are not included in the official statistics.",
