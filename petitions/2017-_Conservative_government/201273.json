        "action": "Impose regulations on the use of models whose body mass\r\nindex is below 18.5.",
        "additional_details": "This applies to models used in advertising, media, fashion shows,\r\ncatwalk shows and for any other other promotional purposes, and\r\napplies to both male and female models.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this requirement is to prohibit the normalisation of\r\nlow body weights and the glamorisation of an unhealthy body image.\r\nInstead, using models with a healthy BMI of 18.5 or above would\r\nre-calibrate the public perception of a \u2018normal\u2019 body shape and weight.",
        "background": "This petition is to introduce a law prohibiting the use of models whose BMI is below 18.5 (the lowest healthy BMI considered by medical professionals). \r\nThis requirement would necessitate a medical certificate from a\r\nphysician, to ensure the model is in good health.",
