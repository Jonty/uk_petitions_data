        "action": "Ban any future police usage of brainwave scanners (electroencephalograms).",
        "additional_details": "In a world becoming more and more technological, there is only one true privacy left - the brain. Introduction of EEG's to the police force would bring Britain on a par with George Orwell's 1984, and would take away yet more power from the public - the people the Government are supposed to serve. EEG's should still be available to services such as the NHS, as with some development, people with locked in syndrome could communicate again. Apart from that, they should be illegal or banned.",
        "background": "EEG's read brainwaves and can compute, so far, very simple thoughts - with around 60 - 90% accuracy. Introduction of these, upon further development, voids the point of the majority of the police force and is a gross breach of human rights.",
