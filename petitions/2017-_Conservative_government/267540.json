        "additional_details": "Cycling is a healthier than driving and will increase overall health by tackling obesity which will reduce some of the colossal strain on the NHS.\r\n\r\nIt is shown in research that exercise like cycling also helps with mental health and I believe a factor in this is because it exposes people to nature and soothing birdsong which relaxes people.\r\n\r\nCycling is also a greener option and every new person that takes to the road on a cycle is helping the environment and cutting the UK\u2019s carbon footprint.",
        "background": "As a new cyclist I felt that I did not feel safe cycling on the roads and came to the conclusion that creating more cycle lanes not just in cities but in towns will encourage more people like me to cycle, feel safer on the road and feel healthier.",
