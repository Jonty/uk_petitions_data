This was last reviewed in \u201984 the internet was just for email then!! So this badly needs an update.",
        "background": "Without the Pupillary Distance (PD) it is impossible to create prescription glasses, get the distance wrong and depending on how inaccurate it is, can cause the following symptoms: blurry vision, double vision images, headaches, nausea, and fatigue.",
