        "additional_details": "To ensure applications are genuine, those sponsoring would be open to prosecution themselves, along with financial penalties should their family members not exit the UK before the expiration of the visa.  You only have to look at the diverse culture here in the UK to see we have a history of helping people and supporting their families. All we want is the opportunity for families who are spread around the globe to enjoy quality time together swapping stories and learning their cultures.",
        "background": "I believe non EU family members of British citizens should be free to visit relatives in the UK if the British family sponsor them, and they have no previous criminal convictions, visa violations or pose any threat to national security. VISA should not be refused because of applicant/s finances.",
