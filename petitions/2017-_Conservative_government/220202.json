There's no specific rule that stops families from being together once they're in the UK. We think you might be talking about the rules for refugees in the UK applying for their family members to join them. You can find out more about those current rules here: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/settlement-refugee-or-humanitarian-protection/family-reunion\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n"
