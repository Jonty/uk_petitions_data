        "additional_details": "Bikers must complete a CBT test for a 125. Then another test for the A1 licence, that is for a 125 again. It consists of a theory test, a module 1 and a module 2. Then bikers have to wait to be older anyway to go for the A2 licence that again consists of a module 1 & a module 2 , then for the full A licence they must do another module 1 and module 2 test. To prepare for the tests, training is needed consisting at least 5 lessons costing a bomb and taking up alot your time. It's over kill.",
        "background": "Upgrade the A1 to a A2 after 2 years. \r\nUpgrade the A2 to a full licence after 2 years. \r\nCar drivers can drive a vehicle with any power after one test, why can't us bikers? \r\nAt least with 2 years experience of each licence, surely that is enough experience to be given the privilege to move up.",
