        "additional_details": "In 2017, Battersea dogs home took in 3,373 dogs but only 2,249 rehomed! That leaves over 1,000 dogs without a place to call home. Stop pets being left behind in kennels, catteries and animal shelters. I hope by making people have a licence to breed pets it will reduce the numbers that the animal shelters are crowded by. \r\nI also hope it will stop animals from being left at the side of the road. \r\nThis in turn will make more people buy a rescue animal instead of a home bread animal.",
        "background": "A licence to breed pets will enable Britain to be the real nation of animal lovers it so claims to be! Licensing would show that a person is breeding a pet for the right reasons, not just for money, breeding an animal for good reasons like bringing out the heredity problems in breeds.",
