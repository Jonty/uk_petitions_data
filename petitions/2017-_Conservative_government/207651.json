        "additional_details": "The government should investigate why the franchise has significantly worsensed since it changed hands, & why it changed during the Waterloo upgrade. Why is the service worse after the upgrade?\r\n\r\nNeed to compare the % of delayed trains now with the amount of delayed trains SWT\u2019s had. Also stats for the length of delays, as well as the % of cancelled trains. Not just overal stats either, peak times/rush hour stats need to be anyalsed.\r\n\r\nThe government needs to consider cancelling SWR\u2019s contract.",
        "background": "South Western Railway was awarded the South Western franchise in March 2017, & took over from South West Trains on the 20th August. SWT had managed the franchise for nearly 20 years.\r\n\r\nSince the takeover, the number of delays have increased, delays have got longer, & cancellations have increased.",
