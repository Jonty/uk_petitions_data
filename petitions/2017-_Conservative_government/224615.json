We are not going to allow for this happen and someone must face these consequences. The referres should be fired and a rematch should take place. How can FIFA allow for this occur? The Croatians were playing dirty and kept fouling us illegally and referres did nothing. We are not going to allow for this to just slide. We are not going to allow for no action to take place. We want justice!",

Croatia had been cheating in this game with the help of the referre officials. The Croatians were diving and time wasting and even started fights. The referres allowed for this to occur.",
