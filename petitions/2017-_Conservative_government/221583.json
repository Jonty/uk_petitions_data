And if you 'fail' you lose your money.\r\n\r\nWe're not proposing scrapping the fees, after all the agents do incur costs. But a cap would give clarity for all, and prevent profiteering hitting renters in the pocket.",

It's a free for all, with fees for the same processes widely differing for no apparent reason but to put more money in the pocket of the agent.",
