        "additional_details": "Women still suffer FGM and mysogeny. It is supremacist and not integrative or inclusive, eg non Muslims can't access a preferential Muslim mortgage yet they can access our mortgage facilities. They live in Britain for years, but hold their Muslim services and sharia courts in Arabic not our national English language which is a barrier to us learning about their religion and laws and a barrier to them integrating and communicating properly. Sharia law is a barrier to Muslim women gaining equality, and to furthering their education as all women in UK are entitled to be equal - not some -- all women including Muslim women.",
        "background": "It is against human rights and women's equality and it hinders integration.",

            "details": "There are a number of Sharia councils in England and Wales which help Muslim communities resolve civil and family disputes, by making recommendations, which they hope the parties will abide by. They are not part of the court system in this country and have no means of enforcing their decisions. If any of the decisions or recommendations they make are contrary to national law (including the Equality Act 2010 and human rights law) then national law prevails. This is no different to any other council or tribunal - whether or not based on Sharia principles.\r\n\r\nYou can read the full response here:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/48352\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not clear what action you would like the Government to take, since Sharia councils already operate under British law in the UK.\r\n"
