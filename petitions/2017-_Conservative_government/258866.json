        "additional_details": "Not only will this meat tax save an estimated \u00a3700m on U.K. Health costs (Oxford university) and save almost 6,000 lives a year, it will most importantly help ease the pressure of global warming. With a smaller meat industry we can reclaim farmlands, plant trees and promote ecological and environmental prosperity. We must act now or it will be too late.",
        "background": "Global warming is the most urgent problem we face, our planet is dying and we are doing very little to prevent it. Animal farming has a hugely detrimental impact on the environment and a meat tax is a small step in tackling the terrifying problem that global warming presents.",
