They have lost their way in supporting the population and gone to a very devious place, as where as their only concern is for themselves and not for the people they are meant to represent. It is shameful and degrading, not just for them, but we the people have to carry that burden to. Fools Gold, springs to mind !!!! Maybe time to change the whole system to a fairer and more realistic one.",
        "background": "How can the government be allowed to take 18 days holiday? when this country is in a state of confusion and derision and no real leadership to speak of. People need answers NOW, not soundbites, Get them back to work, they work for us as we the public pay their wages, it is not the other way around",
