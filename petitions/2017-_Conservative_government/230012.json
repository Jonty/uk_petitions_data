Welfare recipients are not 2nd class citizens they deserve access to safe, secure, habitable, and affordable homes as is their Human Right.",
        "background": "Some banks refuse mortgages to buy to let landlords who let to welfare recipients. My bank instructed me to \"seek an alternative tenant\" if I wished to keep my mortgage because my tenant was a welfare recipient.\r\n\r\nThe government must close these loopholes, as they are a breach of basic human rights",
