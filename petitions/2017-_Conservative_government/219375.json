        "additional_details": "EU Citizens without British Citizenship make a large net contribution to the UK in economic terms ( https://eu-rope.ideasoneurope.eu/2017/10/30/eu-migrants-give-take/ ) and so many other ways. The Windrush Crisis has shown that there can be no confidence in the promises made by the UK government when it comes to the protection of their rights. It is therefore critical that a low cost and simple path to citizenship is given to EU Citizens with PERMANENT RESIDENCY status.",
        "background": "The Windrush crisis has shown that it is critical to provide fair protection for any of the 3 million law abiding EU Citizens with PERMANENT RESIDENCY status who contribute so much who consider the UK their home and contribute so much to our communities and Britain as a whole.",
