        "additional_details": "I went to Madrid last year and paid less than \u00a3150 for my return flight with EasyJet, whereas for a return around the weekend of the final, they've been charging between \u00a3800-\u00a31200 for the same flight. They're not alone and hoteliers are just as bad. Football supporters tend to be everyday, working class people and can ill afford this kind of expense. It's immoral and a flagrant act of exploitation.",
        "background": "Liverpool and Spurs have made it to the Champions League final in Madrid and fans are being pushed into debt to support their teams due to wild price hikes in the cost of airline tickets and accommodation prices. As an example a week either side the final would cost 25% of the cost during the final.",

The UK Government isn't responsible for hotel costs in other countries, but you could ask the Government to set a cap on UK hotel prices, if that's what you want to do."
