        "additional_details": "The government is now claiming that a no-deal Brexit is the will of the people on the basis of a very small majority of people voting to leave the EU on unspecified terms, but after a campaign that promised we would leave with a deal. The government has failed to deliver on its promise of leaving the EU with a deal. The people should be able to hold the government to account on this issue before we leave the EU.",
        "background": "The Brexit campaign was fought on the basis that we would leave the EU with a good deal. The government is now proposing to leave the EU without a deal, leading to possible food and medicine shortages. No one voted for this and we must be given the chance to hold them to account.",
