        "action": "Scrap the age pay gap. Living costs don't differ depending on age.",
        "additional_details": "There are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK under 25 years old, who live with dependents. People who care for their children, younger siblings, disabled relatives etc. Their age should not impede their renumeration for the same level of work as someone that is simply older than them. Everyone pays the same for petrol, pays the same level of tax, and buys the same food. Let's stop this segregated, illogical pay gap and give people the pay they deserve. The National Living Wage.",
        "background": "No matter your age, the price of milk costs the same. The difference in hourly wage between those aged under 18 and those aged 25 and over is \u00a33.86. Which, coincidentally, is actually more than the minimum wage for apprenticeships.",
