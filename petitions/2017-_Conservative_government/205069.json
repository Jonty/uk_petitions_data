        "additional_details": "This can also cause animals to run away from owners, or bolt when on walks, and so can leave owners devastated, and can lead to deaths and injuries to these animals. This can cause both emotional, physical and financial damage to the owners and public, along with emotional and physical damage to pets.",
        "background": "I believe it is wrong that fireworks are released for days before and days after both Fireworks night and New Years Eve. This can scare pets and cause them to be unable to move from a position or relieve themselves outside. This is against their rights under the five freedoms, so should be illegal.",
