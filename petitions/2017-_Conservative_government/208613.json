        "action": "Ban working MPs and donors of over \u00a35,000 to a political party from honours.",
        "additional_details": "Working MPs are a special case compared to working musicians, sportsmen etc. \r\n\r\nOnly MPs have the ability to directly affect the government that is in power and the laws within which we all live under and therefore require special rules.\r\n\r\nWealthy people should not use their money to influence a democratically elected government.\r\n",
        "background": "Implementing this ban will reduce the chances of people using their position to get honours, reduce corruption and help those who truly deserve honours receive them.",
