        "additional_details": "School is hard enough to get through and deal with during these stressful times without having disorders and everything holding you down. This can become easier through knowing who has these issues and helping them through the process.",
        "background": "Lots of young adults have mental health issues and don't speak out about it and are scared to. To stop this from developing all students should have a mental health check yearly between years 10 to finishing university. This can then get all students the help that they deserve and should have.",
