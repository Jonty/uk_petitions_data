        "additional_details": "The government can replace the current voting system, with a modernised system - known as a \"Direct Party and Representative Voting\".\r\n\r\nThere would still be an MP representing each constituency, but it would be easier for them to tackle local issues. The results are clear, which makes them easier to analyse. The voting would be proportional, which means that there would be a fairer balance, in Parliament. Most importantly, every vote counts, which is not the case with the current voting system.",
        "background": "The current voting system (First Past the Post / FPTP) leaves voters with a vote that's underrepresented. It also means parties can have a higher total of votes than others, but less seats in Parliament; leading to disproportionality. We need a new voting system for everybody's vote to be included!",
