        "action": "Increase funding for schools with SEN students.",
        "additional_details": "Our school has been greatly effected by the cuts, and we are now having to use other students money to support these SEN students. If this cause was bought before Parliament, we could increase the spending on SEN students and they would not have to suffer any more than they already are. We have lost \u00a3279 per student and we are losing more to help other students.\n\nOur aims are to get as many signatures as possible and hopefully get local MP's behind us.\nPlease help us.",
        "background": "We are a GCSE Citizenship group and we feel that, due to the recent school budget cuts, Special education needs students are not getting the full support that they deserve, because the funding has been cut for them.",
