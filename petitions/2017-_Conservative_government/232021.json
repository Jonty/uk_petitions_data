        "additional_details": "As a first aid trainer, I understand people don\u2019t understand what a defibrillator is and how it works. \r\nIn the past, there has been an advert created for CPR with Vinnie Jones, with staying alive song.  This was a huge hit to get awareness of getting people how it important It is to do something and how to perform cpr correctly. \r\nRunning first aid courses, 80% of learners have no idea how an AED works.",
        "background": "It would be great to spread the awareness of how a Defibrillator is used and how it works. A lot of people are not aware that anyone can use a Defibrillator and that they don\u2019t need to be first aid trained to use one. \r\nWhat a better way in telling the nation how AED\u2019s work than showing them on TV.",
