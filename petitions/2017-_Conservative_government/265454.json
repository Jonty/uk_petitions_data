        "action": "Ban cruel glue traps in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Glue traps are cheap and advertised as 'eco friendly'. Any animal that touches a glue trap, attracted by bait like cheese or seeds, becomes stuck to the glue. There they slowly starve to death, struggling for anything between three and 24 hours. Sometimes a trapped animal escapes by gnawing off a leg glued to the card. This petition is not arguing against all pest control, simply against unnecessary cruelty. There are alternative humane methods: even old-fashioned snap traps are more humane.",
        "background": "Glue traps are sheets of card covered with strong adhesive, designed to catch rodents. These traps can also entangle other small animals. Glue traps are banned as inhumane in Ireland, New Zealand and Victoria. But NOT in the UK, who claims to have the highest animal welfare standards in the world.",
