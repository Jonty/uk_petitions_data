        "action": "Instead of celebrating Brexit with a 50p coin, bring back the Royal Tournament.",
        "additional_details": "The revived Royal Tournament could take place every two years in different venues across the country, not just in Earls Court, to ensure that it was accessible to all members of the UK. It would be a matter of national pride and would be symbolic of our independence and strength but most of all our unity. Additionally, with military recruitment at an all-time low, it would bolster the morale and reach of our Armed Forces during an era of global instability and uncertainty.",
        "background": "From 1880-1999 The Royal Tournament became the first, oldest and largest military tattoo in the world. Unfortunately it was ended on Monday 2nd August 1999 following the 1998 Strategic Defence Review.",
