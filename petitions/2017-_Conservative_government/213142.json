        "additional_details": "The roads are in a terrible state all over the country but councils are getting out of paying for the damage to all modes of transport on the roads due to this section 58 act. If they are unaware of the pot hole they cant fix it so its not their fault, thats great but if we let a payment slip or the likes of car insurance lapse we cant just say I never knew about it and be let off. Ignorance is not an excuse for us and should be the same for them do more thorough checks and sort out the roads.",
        "background": "I dont think local councils should be able to use this act as a get out clause for not maintaining the roads to a higher standard.",
