        "action": "Prevent the cutting of free school lunches for infants in favor of budget cuts",
        "additional_details": "Theresa May has outlined in her Conservative Manifesto that if the Conservative Party are successful in the upcoming General Election, the free school lunches scheme will be scrapped in favor of free school breakfasts. This will cost each family \u00a3440 a year per child, thereby hurting lower-income families even further after taking away a crucial meal for children in their daily academic lives.",
        "background": "Having come from a lower-income background, during my time at primary and secondary school I heavily relied on free school lunches and benefited incredibly from the scheme in place. Without this scheme, there will be over 900,000 children who will be forced to go hungry for the majority of the day.",
