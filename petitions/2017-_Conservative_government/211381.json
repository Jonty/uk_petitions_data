        "additional_details": "The buses are proposed to leave Swiss Cottage at 7:45 in the morning and to leave Muswell Hill Broadway at 3:50 in the afternoon. This would make travel for students at multiple schools in the Highgate area much easier, faster and safer.",
        "background": "Between 2012 and 2014 there was a total of 88 petitions made campaigning for the 603 to run regular buses throughout the day. Contrary to previous petitions we just want the bus to run more frequently at peak times in both directions, in order for pupils to travel to and from school easily.",
