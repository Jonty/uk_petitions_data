        "additional_details": "The armed forces have options for those who need halal or vegetarian options therefore discriminating against those who need gluten free. You can still have a very healthy diet and get all the calories and nutrients you need if you are a coeliac from the many options now available for the people in that bracket. I was more than disappointed when the doctor told me that I was coeliac because I knew then that my dreams of becoming an RAF pilot were over.",
        "background": "I am 15 years old and looking to join the armed forces. I was recently diagnosed with coeliac disease a non deadly autoamune disease that causes the small intestine to become damaged. When correctly dealt with it doesn\u2019t cause any issues other than the inability to eat gluten.",
