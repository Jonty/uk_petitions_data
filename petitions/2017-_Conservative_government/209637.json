        "action": "Produce statutory guidance on how universities should support Dyslexic students.",
        "additional_details": "I am dyslexic. I was lucky enough to receive a lot of support throughout my education. However, when I started university, my dyslexia became more apparent. I found it very difficult to learn from the teaching style. Moreover, the majority of my work was not marked in conjunction with my SPLD cover note. After speaking to my dyslexia help tutor, I learned that many lecturers do not believe in dyslexia. Therefore, the government should introduce statutory guidance to universities on how they can support dyslexic students. For example, by recommending compulsory seminars/training for staff.",
        "background": "Dyslexics learn differently. They are put at a disadvantage in today's educational system. Dyslexics should be given the same opportunity to reach their potential.",
