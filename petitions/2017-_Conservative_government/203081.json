        "additional_details": "University of Warwick Cafe Library runs Monday to Friday serving a plethora of succulent, nutritious (includes a tomato) breakfasts. One of the appeals of the institution was the Ultimate Breakfast and Mag 7 breakfast, these are now at the scandalous levels of \u00a34.95 & \u00a34.25 respectively. Whilst we understand a potential rise due to brexit-led inflation, a rise of nearly 22% certainly hits students in their now famished stomachs. Also, how does the Ultimate Breakfast only have 1 hash brown??",
        "background": "The University of Warwick's Cafe Library has decided to increase the price of their breakfast meals to an absurd level. For example, the once \u00a33.50 Magnificent 7 Breakfast (known to regulars as a 'mag7'), after summer holidays is a whopping \u00a34.25. This above-inflation rise is a scandal to students.",
