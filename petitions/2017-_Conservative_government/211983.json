        "additional_details": "My Husband and I have unfortunately lost two babies. Our first was born 20/09/2016 at 19 weeks; fully formed and born with a heartbeat & lived for a few minutes. Our second child was born 08/08/2017 at 21 weeks and lived for 16 minutes.\r\nI endured hours of labour, the same as any other mother who has delivered a baby. I find it offensive and an insult that my children are labelled as miscarriage- like they didn't exist, when they were born alive, although premature",
        "background": "Speaking from experience, I believe the terminology \"Miscarriage\" should only be adopted for pregnancies lost prior to 16 weeks gestation.\r\nMiscarriage means \"loss or expulsion of an embryo before it's viable\".",
