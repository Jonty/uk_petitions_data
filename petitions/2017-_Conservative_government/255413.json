        "action": "With 'notice to proceed' delayed again, halt all HS2 enabling work immediately.",
        "additional_details": "Whilst supporters of HS2 pretend construction has started, the DfT has confirmed that only the highly destructive enabling works are taking place, years behind schedule. Construction and the release of full funds cannot happen until HS2 Ltd gets notice to proceed, by passing \u201cManagement Capability, Affordability of Contracts & Robustness of Revised Business Case\u201d tests. If it is tested impartially on these bases, I believe it will fail all of them and be cancelled, so they should stop causing damage now.",
        "background": "Because HS2 is an unjustifiable project, with terrible management that has not been subject to enough scrutiny, it will not face 'notice to proceed' tests before December. Consequently, HS2 Ltd must be stopped from trying to make it harder to cancel HS2 by maximising expenditure and destruction now.",
