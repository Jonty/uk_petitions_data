        "additional_details": "Currently, anyone can purchase acid from a hardware shop. No questions are asked and this enables potential criminals to obtain this lethal substance with no questions asked. \r\n\r\nThis has lead to attacks, for example  Resham Khan, who had acid thrown at her through a car window in 2017. \r\n\r\nThis is despicable and we must do more to protect people like Resham.",
        "background": "Acid attacks have become a common occurrence in London and all over the United Kingdom. We need to do more to stop these attacks. Requiring people to have a license to purchase acid would help to prevent acid attacks and ensure only those who have a legitimate reason to purchase it can do so.",
