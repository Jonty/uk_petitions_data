        "action": "To officially recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.",
        "additional_details": "Jerusalem is the eternal undivided capital of Israel. There is a proven history going back over 3,000 years. All efforts to achieve peace since 1948 have failed and will continue to fail, because their enemies will never be satisfied with any solution and will always ask for more. This is the reality. The only way to a lasting peace is for everyone to recognise Israel's right to exist and allow them to dwell within safe borders. This is the only solution.",
        "background": "We urge HM Goverment to declare Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. \r\nIsrael is a nation with the right to determine its own capital. Jerusalem is the seat of the modern Israeli government, the home of the Knesset, the Supreme Court and the Prime Minister. It is simply a recognition of reality.",
