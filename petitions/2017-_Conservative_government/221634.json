        "additional_details": "Young people especially the students are the backbone of every economy in the world. Most of the overstayed students are good at English and are working part-time as well, to support themselves and the UK economy by paying taxes. They are just the victims of unrealistic Home Office targets. Many of them are now working in low paid jobs and the businesses are just abusing and exploiting them. Giving them amnesty will bring them into the taxpayer net, and yield millions of pounds in tax and national insurance and they will contribute to the UK economy.",
