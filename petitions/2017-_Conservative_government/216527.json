        "action": "Make banks directly responsible for contacting those who have been missold PPI",
        "additional_details": "Banks hold the information in their systems and files as to who had PPI.  Those most likely to need the compensation are possibly least able to pursue a claim.  Why should individuals have to possibly employ companies who gain financially from their loss or try to remember historical financial contracts?  Now the government has put a deadline for claiming.  Before that deadline banks should make every reasonable effort to trace those who have had PPI making it easier for them to pursue a claim.",
        "background": "Banks and credit card companies place the onus on individuals to seek out whether they have had PPI, yet they hold this information and it is readily available to them.  The responsibility should rest with the companies who have missold to make all efforts to trace their victims and make recompense.",
