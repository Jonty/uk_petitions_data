        "additional_details": "Back in 2011 the Winterbourne View abuse scandal was brought to our attention,whereby vulnerable adults were abused and tortured under detention in a psychiatric hospital. 7 years on, Panorama uncovered another scandal at Whorlton Hall. This shows that nothing has changed.The Mental Health Act's own code of practice states that hospitals are not the correct setting for Autistic & LD people. Now it's time for action, no more reports, get people back into their communities not hospitals.",
        "background": "Learning Disabled and Autistic people are being detained in hospitals under a section despite this being an inappropriate setting. Autistic & LD people are suffering abuse, neglect and in many cases torture. Parents/carers are refused access to their children and are left out of any decision making.",
