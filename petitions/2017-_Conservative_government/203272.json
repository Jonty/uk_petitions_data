        "additional_details": "Reptiles vary in what type of care they need aren't pets for the amateurs. Some need at least UVA and UVB lighting together whilst some may need alot more specialist equipment. \r\nRecently Pets at Home have stopped selling Reptiles due to complaints. Many Reptiles sold have became ill or mis-sold wrong information. Which had led to an large amount of unexpected vet fees; a bad environment for these reptiles.",
        "background": "I believe Pet Stores should have to have a specialist license to be able to keep and sell reptiles as well as having frequent checks by a specialist team such as the RSPCA. Stores having the correct information will create a better understanding for owners on what is correct for these creatures.",
