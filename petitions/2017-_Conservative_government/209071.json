        "additional_details": "We are asking the Government to increase the budget and the rate of income tax on the 29.3 million UK taxpayers e.g. 22p, 44p and 50p. With the proviso that the additional funds are ringfenced for the NHS and the (2017/18) budget of \u00a3127.4 Billion is not reduced by that ringfenced amount.\r\n \r\nThe King's fund indicates an average year on year increase of funding of 1.2% is forecast to 2020/21.\r\nThe annual growth in health spending is expected to average 4%. The budget needs to increase accordingly.",
        "background": "Our NHS is 70 years old this year. Time to ensure adequate funding is assured to maintain the standard of care we expect. The NHS must be there for our children and grandchildren.\r\n\r\nOur NHS and Social Care services need be secure so that they will be there whenever they are needed.",
