        "additional_details": "I am a Co-Founder of Huddersfield Feral and Strays and we also deal with lost and found sites, and collect dead, injured, stray and abused cats. Many are not chipped and this makes it impossible to reunite with owners as well as trace back abusers of these animals when they are dumped and abused. \r\n\r\nWe are striving to make a difference and let their voices be heard and bring closure to those who have lost a family pet. Please helps us achieve this and make a change.",
        "background": "We are Huddersfield Feral and Strays and feel its vital that cats have the same laws apply as dogs, specifically must be microchipped. They must be scanned when hit or found. Too many are killed with no trace who they are or their owners. Often people just throw them away like trash. this has to end",
