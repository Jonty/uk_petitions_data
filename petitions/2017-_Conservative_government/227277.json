        "additional_details": "There are over 100 essay mills websites currently in operation. The sites claim the essays are provided simply for study purposes, but simultaneously advertise  'guaranteed grades', 'never resold' and 'plagiarism free'.\r\n \r\nThe Irish government has announced a new law that would make  make it illegal to provide or advertise contract cheating services. New Zealand and 17 US states already have such laws. We call for the UK Government to pass a similar law to stamp out this unacceptable practice.",
        "background": "'Essay mills' provide custom written essays for students to cheat with.  Prices range from a couple of hundred pounds for a single essay to over \u00a36,750 for a PhD dissertation. This undermines the high standards of universities and is unfair to honest students - but is currently legal.",
