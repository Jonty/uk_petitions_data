        "additional_details": "Police and NHS funding has been cut to a dangerous level and been forced to work under more stress as work load increases and manpower dwindles. Despite this they have had a pay cut in real terms under the current government as there pay has been frozen under inflation. MP\u2019s performance and current public opinion does not support an MP pay rise and the money could be far better spent.",
        "background": "With the current government having cut emergency services to a record level in their term stating times of austerity how can it be fair to increase there own pay when their emergency service workers have had a pay freeze despite an independent body recommending a 4% pay rise for the past 4 years.",
