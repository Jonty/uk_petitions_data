        "additional_details": "A large number of people didn't vote in the last election because there were no choices other than parties they did not want to support. The option of being able to cast a vote for \"none of the above\" would have allowed those people the option to register their disapproval of the candidates, and, if a majority voted for \"none of the above\" the ballot would have to be run with new candidates. At the moment, if you write \"none of the above\" on your ballot paper it is considered a spoiled paper.",
        "background": "When there is no candidate who you think is worthy of support in a local or national election, you should be able to tick a box at the bottom of the list which says \"none of the above\". When counted if a majority have ticked \"none of the above\" the election should be rerun with new candidates.",
