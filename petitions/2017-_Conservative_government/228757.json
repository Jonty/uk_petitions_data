        "action": "Uphold current Responsible Pharmacist rulings and reject Remote Supervision",
        "additional_details": "The remote supervision of pharmacies will mean that pharmacists will be legally responsible for more than one pharmacy at a time and therefore legally responsible for pharmacies which they have no way of effectively supervising. Also, pharmacy technicians will be allowed to hand out pharmacy only and prescription only medications with no input from a qualified Pharmacist. This will be detrimental to patient healthcare. More information can be found on the PDA website.",
        "background": "The rebalancing board have put forward a proposal named 'Remote Supervision' whereby they want to allow technicians to supervise the sale of pharmacy and prescription only medication and want to allow pharmacists to be signed in as a Responsible Pharmacist for more than one pharmacy at a time.",
