The now 'in thing' to do is have your picture taken with a tiger or lion which is fuelled completely by tourists.\r\n\r\nHowever, the truth behind these 'tiger selfies' is a sad and heart-breaking scene. The animals are drugged to ensure they are 'safe' to have selfies with. Furthermore, the conditions in which they are kept are cramped and filthy.",

The now 'in thing' to do is have your picture taken with a tiger or lion which is fuelled completely by tourists and celebrities.\r\n\r\nHowever, these animals are drugged up and live in vile conditions.",
