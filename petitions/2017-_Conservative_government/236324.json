        "additional_details": "Sudan is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis which has led to a rise in the cost of fuel, electricity, transport, food and medicine provoking countrywide protests. Since 14 December, tens of thousands of people have been taking part in protests in different parts of the country. Security officers use lethal forces at protestors to disperse them killing 37 so far. The government has also shut down the internet since 20 December, in yet another attempt to stop the protests. (Amnesty)",
        "background": "Killing protesters must stop. The Sudanese government is not responding to any call, therefore, an international deplomatic pressure must start immediately. We are asking for the removal of Sudanese embassador from the UK.",
