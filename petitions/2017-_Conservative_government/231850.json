        "additional_details": "For consumers it can be so hard to know how good or bad different products are for the environment, and what can seem like a positive change (e.g. reduced plastic) can sometimes actually be worse in terms of environmental impact (e.g. more water or energy to produce). \r\n \r\nHaving this sort of labelling will provide that insight so purchases can be more informed. It will also encourage manufacturers to do more to improve their practices so their eco scores are better than their competitors.",
        "background": "I believe that businesses should be made to include a carbon footprint/ environmental impact score on their products, in the same way as food products have the traffic light health labels.",
