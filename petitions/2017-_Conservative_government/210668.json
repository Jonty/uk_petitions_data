Her opposition to sanctions against apartheid are now being made known. A country where some make much money while others struggle to survive is not a commendable scenario, and any statue would represent a contentious political viewpoint.",
        "background": "Despite some who profited, the Thatcher government caused untold harm to millions of people, denying them employment, security, education and healthcare. Whatever benefits ensued only applied to some and not others. Such a divisive programme should not be endorsed.",
