        "additional_details": "Some MPs have attempted to call for a second referendum, remove a (legitimate) no deal result, delay or cancel Article 50, crippled a finance bill, as well as tabling other government amendments done soley to frustrate or reverse the process of leaving. These MPs were elected on the basis of their party manifestos in the 2017 GE. The electorate should have the opportunity to reselect or now reject them.",
        "background": "Many MPs from several parties became elected by standing on their manifesto in the 2017 General Election to abide by the result of the EU referendum and take us out of the EU. Since being elected many MPs have now taken a personal view and by various methods have attempted to stop us leaving.",
