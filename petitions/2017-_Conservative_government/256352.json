        "additional_details": "At present it is taking the Police up to 15 minutes to get to a crime on the streets.  In some instances the Police don't bother coming out because they are under staffed.  This is not good enough and needs to change. More and more lives are affected each day by crime. Please sign this petition to bring this to Parliaments attention.",
        "background": "Every day re read about a stabbing and even a gun related crime on the streets of the UK.  This does not include car theft, burglaries, drugs, anti social behaviour.   It is not just confined to London. And it it getting worse.  To stop this we need more Police on the streets.",
