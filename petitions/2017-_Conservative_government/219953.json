        "action": "Make the teaching of sexual consent compulsory in schools and universities",
        "additional_details": "Still in 2018, people do not know what consent is, as a lot of actions come under the umbrella of 'sexual harassment'. People think they know what consent is but we must be reminded about the complexities of it. We must protect the most vulnerable in society and this is the perfect way to start. Students should be taught about these issues in order to prevent something like this happening again.",
        "background": "At a UK university, students were suspended for a group chat containing jokes about rape, racism and violence; it has highlighted how prevalent rape culture is within our society. Students should be taught about these issues in order to make the school and university environment a lot safer.",
