        "additional_details": "Whether it\u2019s a crash Brexit or not, the north of this island will be hit the hardest and the ONLY solution is reunification. A referendum on this is our right as outlined in the GFA. Not only do we risk regressing back to conflict on this island as a result of brexit, but we\u2019ll see long term unemployment, food shortages, risks for our students in third level education, closure of small businesses. \r\n\r\nSinn F\u00e9in have been calling for Irish Unity and it\u2019s time to implement it.",
        "background": "The new British PM Boris Johnson is planning for a no deal Brexit which breaches the Good Friday Agreement. The people of Ireland should be allowed to choose which union they want to be a part of. Partition has failed & the time for Irish Unity is now.",
