        "additional_details": "I am on may forums for myself and my daughter, as we both have disabilities, mental and physical.\r\nI hear too often how people with disabilities have lost their benefits and how they are so worn out with the mandatory reconsideration or appeals. \r\nThis is unfair and causes more problems for the disabled person.\r\nThe system needs to urgently change.",
        "background": "As so many people feel let down by the current process for disability renewals and new claims, I would like to see a fairer system. In my opinion an assessor normally a nurse does the assessment. How is she more qualified than a specialist? In mental and physical disabilities?",
