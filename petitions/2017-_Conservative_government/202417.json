        "additional_details": "A single adult living alone could be up to \u00a3106.65 per week worse under UC compared to being on the legacy benefits of ESA, JSA, Income Support, Working Tax Credit and Housing Benefit. Many of our disabled people - who would love to work if they could - will no longer be able to afford essentials such as food or household bills, let alone the extra expenses that come with being disabled. We call on the Government to add these disability premiums to UC for adults receiving DLA or PIP.",
        "background": "The Government is in the process of rolling out new benefit Universal Credit (UC). Disability premiums are extra amounts of money included in some benefits (ESA/JSA/IS/WTC/HB) for some adults with a disability to help with the extra costs of a disability, from mobility scooters to incontinence pads.",
