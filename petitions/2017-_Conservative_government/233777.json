        "additional_details": "I watched the televised debate on the draft political dec, repeatedly MPs calling for a people's vote to which the Prime minister gave the same answer. What a waste of precious debating time. Now is the time to move on. The real negotiation of any future relationship with the EU, is ahead, we need strength & solidarity behind our PM at this juncture. Have faith in the EU and UK to behave with integrity, and work towards a deal that will be a compromise but which leads to stability.",
        "background": "In the EU ref, I spoiled my vote. I did this because I did not think the referendum was a sensible idea, however, I voted as I hold the right to vote paramount. How dismaying to hear many in Parliament devaluing that first decisive vote by demanding another, whatever question the 2nd ref would ask!",
