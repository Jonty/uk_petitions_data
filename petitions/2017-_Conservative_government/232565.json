        "additional_details": "Asia Bibi has been condemned to death in Pakistan because she is a Christian. Her sentence has been commuted by a Pakistani judge but there are those in Pakistan who are still threatening her execution. She is not safe if she remains in Pakistan and her husband understandably wishes to take her to a country which offers security from such barbaric and outdated attitudes, so alien to what Britain stands for, but such as appear to exist still in her country of birth. UK Home Secretary must review.",
        "background": "It has been announced by the government that the Pakistani Christian woman Asia Bibi would not be allowed into the UK as an asylum seeker. That decision is fundamentally wrong, against the human rights of a Christian who has endured what she has endured, & a denial of everything Britain stands for.",
