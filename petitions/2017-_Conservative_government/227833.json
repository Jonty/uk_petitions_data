        "additional_details": "The problem with an allergy is you never know how serious it is going to be. Sometimes my son may just vomit, or his lips will swell. One day his tongue may swell so much that his airway is blocked so he can\u2019t breath. With an Epipen the adrenaline would act instantly and save my son\u2019s life. If insufficient Epipens (and other AAIs) are being manufactured and stocked my son might not have one to save his life! Please ensure this life saving medicine is readily available in our pharmacies.",
        "background": "When my son tried his first ever peanut within seconds he began vomiting, coughing and broke out into hives. My son could have died. It is only an epipen that could save his life if ever he was to go into anaphylactic shock. Not having an Epipen readily available in pharmacies is endangering lives.",
