        "action": "Amend sections of PoFA  Act 2012 for ANPR controlled parking to ensure fairness",
        "additional_details": "Operators 'legally' win when enforcing prepayment; the motorist pays for parking, frequently pays for unused time, regularly pays the initial amount plus a massive PCN., so the Operator takes unfair excess revenue when ANPR could ensure the motorist pays fairly before departure. Fair examples are Birmingham Dental Hospital paperless and barrier-less, and Solihull John Lewis has entry ticket with car registration printed and automatic exit barriers. Both accept cash/card payment before exit.",
        "background": "At an ANPR controlled car park with prepayment, I chose 4 hours for a theatre visit, but left 23 minutes late, so had to pay \u00a385 PCN. The operator's website allows pre-registration to pay only for time used, not feasible for casual users, but pay before departure would be feasible and fair.",
