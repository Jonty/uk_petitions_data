        "action": "Make sure Staffordshire Bull Terriers & Bull breeds do not get banned in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "You may have recently seen on social media sites that there is supposedly a possibility that Bull breeds will soon be banned in the UK.  We need to make this stop. These breeds are one of the most affectionate if treated properly and with the right owner. So why should the UK population have this taken away from them and have their dogs seized to be put to sleep? It\u2019s unethical. Show your support to these lovely dogs by signing this petition.",
        "background": "Any dog can be aggressive if in the wrong hands. So instead of punishing the dogs make sure they are in the hands of the right owners. Bull breeds are not the only aggressive breed of dogs and therefore banning them would be discriminatory. Why should animals suffer for the sake of brainless humans?",
