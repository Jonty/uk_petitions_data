        "additional_details": "Why does it need updating...? \n\nA wife can claim \u00a312,980 for loss of her husband but nothing if she loses an adult child. If a child loses a parent, the child receives nothing. \n\nHowever celebrities can obtain over \u00a3200,000 for breach of privacy for phone hacking.\n\nA person killed instantly in an accident or murdered is worth NOTHING.  \n\nThe cost of looking after a DOG is more than a bereavement award and more than life itself.\n\nPlease help bereaved families and children who have lost parents.",
        "background": "The loss of a loved one following a fatal injury (accident or murder) drastically needs updating. We need to expand the number of family members who are entitled to a bereavement award and to increase the compensation which currently stands at \u00a312,980. The  Law tells us who is entitled to claim.",
