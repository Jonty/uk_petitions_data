        "action": "Add Iodine to salt to address the silent deficiency and safeguard public health",
        "additional_details": "Iodine deficiency can cause cretinism and higher miscarriage risk during pregnancy. In adults, it can cause a wide range of symptoms. Last year, aged 19, I was diagnosed with an underactive thyroid and prescribed thyroid hormone medication which has since caused many health complications. In fact the real cause was Iodine deficiency, easily prevented by adequate Iodine intake. Iodising salt would ensure adequate public intake, especially for those on vegan diets, which include very few sources.",
        "background": "The World Health Organisation recommends that salt be iodised globally to prevent Iodine deficiency. Over 100 countries adhere to this however the UK does not, despite studies suggesting the UK is deficient. Iodine is vital for both thyroid health and healthy baby development during pregnancy.",
