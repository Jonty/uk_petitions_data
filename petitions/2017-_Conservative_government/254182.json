Another simple In/Out referendum which clearly states we either revoke article 50 and remain in the EU or continue Brexit with clear instuctions to Leave with NO DEAL. These are the only 2 real options and Parliament will not agree to do either without a mandate from the people",
        "background": "The Government and Parliament are obviously unable to bring an end to the Brixit fiasco, and the current deal would be worse than actually staying in. So i suggest we hand the decision back the people. A referendum to Revoke Aricle 50 or Leave EU with No Deal",
