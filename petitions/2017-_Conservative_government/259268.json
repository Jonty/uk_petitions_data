        "additional_details": "Restaurants, shows, leisure facilities etc are charging extra (eg. 15% of the total bill) as a service charge for large groups (eg. 6 or more) which is unfair. Most industries offer discount for buying more service/product, not charge you more per head! \r\n\r\nIf a company is charging a price per head, that should be the total price including VAT. Charging service fees, like a tax, should be illegal as it is an unclear pricing strategy. \r\n\r\nA tip should be earned and should not be expected!!",
        "background": "Restaurants/entertainment facilities should not be allowed to force you to pay what is basically a \u201ctip\u201d for having a larger group of paying customers. No other industry\u2019s workers get paid a tip for doing their job. A tip is a customers choice and is for those who go beyond their role\u2019s duties.",
