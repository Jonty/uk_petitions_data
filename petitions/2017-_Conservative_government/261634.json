        "additional_details": "Colleges are being forced to spend large amounts of money subsidising transport for their students, resources which could be being spent on teaching and learning instead. Furthermore, growing numbers of students are effectively being forced to study at colleges which are close to where they live, limiting the range of qualifications they can study for, because they are being priced out of travelling further afield.",
        "background": "Increasing numbers of youths are struggling to access post-16 education because of high transport costs. When in full-time education you are highly reliant on buses, yet, you often cannot afford them. Annually students can end up paying over \u00a31000 on buses alone. We must make bus travel free.",
