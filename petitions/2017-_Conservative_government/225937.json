        "additional_details": "At present courts are encouraged to consider age, maturity and circumstances of offenders when sentencing & generally, adults convicted of carrying acid in public for a 2nd time will be imprisoned for 6 months. \r\n\r\nClearly, current sentencing guidelines are ineffective in deterring acid attacks as they continue to rise within the UK.\r\n\r\nA standard life sentence of min 25-30 yrs for ALL adult offenders committing these horrific crimes should act as a more effective deterrent.",
        "background": "Victims of acid attacks are faced with the prospect of life long disfigurement, blindness and mental health issues such as: anxiety & depression. It should become the standard for those who plan & commit these crimes to face life imprisonment with the min. of 25- 30 years in every case.",
