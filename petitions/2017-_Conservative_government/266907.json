        "additional_details": "If taught in schools, future generations won't have to go through the same mental health problems as I did. I believe that alongside the Transatlantic Slave Trade and the Holocaust, the Stonewall riots should be compulsorily taught in History lessons and that students should be educated in what it means to be LGBTQ+ and how to treat LGBTQ+ people with respect.",
        "background": "Many people have skewed judgement on LGBTQ+ issues due to a lack of education. Even I, a gay man, don't know as much as I should about these things and this made me scared at first to tell people and badly affected my mental health.",
