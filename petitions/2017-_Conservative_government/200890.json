        "additional_details": "I have requested statistical details of how many complaints are given rulings in favour of the complainant and no information has been provided. The BBC should not be able to self-regulate in this way. It is funded by the TV Licence fee and the tax payer and should therefore be accountable to its audience. The BBC should not be self-regulating and all complaints should be made directly to Ofcom. Ofcom should provide a comprehensive response to the complainant and full statistical transparency.",
        "background": "The BBC is currently in charge of it own complaints procedure. Only after three phases can a complaint be referred to Ofcom. I have, on multiple occasions, complained about BBC content from television and radio and not once has my complaint been upheld.",
