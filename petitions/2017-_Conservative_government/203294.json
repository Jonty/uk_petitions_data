        "action": "Call for all people who mentally cause suicide to be prosecuted for MURDER",
        "additional_details": "Too many people are killing themselves due to other people's evil actions. There is currently no crime that has been committed.\r\nManslaughter is 'the crime of killing a human being without malice aforethought'. That basically means that if you physically kill somebody without intent or the mental capacity to understand your actions.\r\nTo force a person to suicide, a person must have such great intent to harm others. There is malice! Murder could be 'killing a human deliberately or due to bullying'",
        "background": "This petition calls for 'murder' to be redefined so that if it can be proven that one person has committed suicide as a result of another person's/ other people's actions, a murder charge can result.\r\nThe punishment will be a starting point of a minimum of 15 years in prison (12 years for under 18s)",
