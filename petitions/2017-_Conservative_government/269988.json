        "additional_details": "Our civilised society needs both protecting and defending.  We look to brave men and women to come to our aid in our of need.\r\n\r\nTo attack these services is an attack at our core values and beliefs, it is an assault on both us as a nation and as decent human beings in general.\r\n\r\nThey should, , therefore expect over and above the full force of the law and serve a longer prison sentence than the current 16 year standard  Jail and parole system.  We must demand full term sentencing be it 15, 20 or 25.",
        "background": "In recent times there has been a steady increase in the willingness of criminals to attack, maim and kill  members of both the Emergency and Armed forces.  These Uniformed services serve to protect and assist us.  They should therefore be punished more stringently than might otherwise be the case.",
