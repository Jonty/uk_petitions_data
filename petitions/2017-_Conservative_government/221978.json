        "additional_details": "We need new laws on safe staffing. \r\n\r\nDespite the increase in services being brought into the pharmacies, staffing levels are at an all-time low. Often pharmacies are being left to run on just a pharmacist and one member of staff. This can lead to dispensing errors and put patients are risk. At the moment the pharmacists and staff can still be liable for prosecution when an error is made. The law should be changed to have safe staffing levels of at least two workers to safeguard workers and protect patients.",
        "background": "I have personally worked within the pharmacy industry for over 10 years. During this time the NHS has suffered serious crises and GPs are under enormous pressure. In order to try and combat the extra pressure, more and more services are being passed onto pharmacists and other staff.",
