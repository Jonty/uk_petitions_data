        "additional_details": "20 years of Government inaction has meant they need a scapegoat. And the scapegoat in this instance is not only your big money footballers and celebrities but your average Joe contractor. A contractor working for 5 years on a salary of \u00a330,000 could be liable for a sum of around \u00a340,000.\r\n\r\nIt would be unsurprising if Freelancers as a result are pushed into family breakdown, depression and sadly even suicide. Monies that have been saved for years will be wiped out overnight.",
        "background": "The 2019 Loan Charge seeks to historically tax a significant proportion of UK freelance workers for employment arrangements they used over the last twenty years. This is estimated to affect around 100,000 workers across all sectors.",
