You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-history-programmes-of-study\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for a particular aspect of the history of the British Empire to be included in the National Curriculum."
