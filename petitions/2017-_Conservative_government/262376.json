        "additional_details": "As part of the EU, the UK is involved in pricing carbon via the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS).\r\n\r\nBut 58% of emissions are out of scope of the EU ETS. They originate in transport, buildings, waste management and agriculture.\r\n\r\nWith a carbon fee, emitters pay for environmental cost and so manage their carbon output.\r\n\r\nParliament needs to consider a wider comprehensive carbon fee and to distribute that fee in a fair and equitable manner.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.thendobetter.com/investing/carbon-tax",
        "background": "A fee on all carbon is an effective way to reduce GHG emissions. A dividend given back to the people would help distributive justice as the lower paid benefit more. A portion of the dividend could fund innovation.\r\n\r\nLeft & Right wing Economists agree carbon fees are strong incentive to decarbonise.",
