        "action": "Extend gender pay gap reporting rules to cover ethnicity pay gap",
        "additional_details": "Several companies and institutions have voluntarily published ethnicity pay gap data, which suggests ethnicity pay gap is as much of a problem as gender pay gap.\r\n\r\nTackling ethnicity pay gap is a national issue, and by making reporting on them mandatory, will, as with requirements to report gender pay gap, provide focus and momentum to enable positive change.",
        "background": "In April 2017, the government put into law a practice where employers with 250 or more employees must publish and report specific figures about their gender pay gap. We the undersigned call on the government to extend these reporting rules to ethnicity pay gap.",
