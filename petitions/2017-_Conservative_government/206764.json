        "additional_details": "Student maintenance loans are calculated to cover the costs of studying during term time, assuming a level of family support over the holidays. In England And Wales, there are around 9,000 estranged students, who don\u2019t have parental support and who aren\u2019t care leavers. Research shows these students struggle with homelessness over the summer break. The government should lift restrictions, allowing students without parental or local authority support to receive housing benefit over summer.",
        "background": "Students are not permitted to access Housing Benefit. But 'estranged students', whose relationship with their parents has broken down, and who are not leaving care, are not given any financial maintenance for the 10-week summer break. Thousands of students face homelessness over summer as a result.",
