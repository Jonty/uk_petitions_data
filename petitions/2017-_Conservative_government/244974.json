        "additional_details": "The lack of access occurs when a student hasn\u2019t worked in the qualifying period - you can see how that works here (see maternity allowance and statutory maternity pay): \r\nhttps://www.staffsunion.com/advice/money/financeguides/parents/\r\n\r\nWe suggest full time students should automatically have access to maternity allowance or that a special allowance be drawn up to accommodate these cases that provides equivalent support.\r\n\r\nUpdate- UPSU voted to support the campaign so we need to restart the petition",
        "background": "Many full time students who fall pregnant or give birth during their studies, are unable to access statutory maternity pay or allowance. These are one of the few groups of women who are missing out on their maternity rights. Let\u2019s give full time students access to maternity allowance (update below).",
