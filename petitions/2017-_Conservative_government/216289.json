        "additional_details": "Not only is this directly suppressing each of the material areas, but it is now narrowing the amount of pupils going into this field, and not enabling them to gain the breadth of skills they previously would have, which would allow them to move on to higher education. From the clothes on our back, to the modern materials found in protective uniform such as Kevlar, we surrounded by technology, and it is vital that ALL areas are widely available to all pupils in the UK",
        "background": "Last year we saw the Government remove the individualised GCSE in Textiles, instead combining all of the technologies into a generalised technology GCSE.",
