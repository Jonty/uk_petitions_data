        "additional_details": "Whilst it is currently possible to argue a duty of care motive for treating those with a diagnosed mental health condition differently; whether this is the case should be reviewed by a mental health professional. Otherwise, limitations placed on an individual can constitute disability discrimination. This is not currently mandatory, with occupational health doing this job if anyone. This is more true in voluntary organisations where loss of role is not termination of employment.",
        "background": "Studying and working in the the field of mental health, I have seen both loved ones and service users lose out on employment opportunities and even be removed from positions due to misunderstanding and lay person judgement of their condition. This should not happen, and doesn't for other disability.",
