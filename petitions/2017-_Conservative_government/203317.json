        "action": "Introduce a carbon tax on applicable products to help battle climate change.",
        "additional_details": "This kind of tax would be similar to car tax in the way that an engine with lower emission levels is cheaper than one that has a higher level, and cars such as those powered by electricity have zero tax. This would make healthier foods more attainable to people and junk food more expensive, thus improving the publics health reducing the strain on services like the NHS. Another example, electricity provided by companies using renewable technologies would be cheaper than those using fossil fuels.",
        "background": "Introduce a tax on products that are increasing the levels of carbon dioxide in the earths atmosphere. Offset the tax by reducing others on products/services that are better for the environment making it financially beneficial for people to make the right decisions on what they buy.",
