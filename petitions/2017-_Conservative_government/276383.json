The amazing staff can not do their jobs as well and they are able too because it takes ages for the computers to load and give staff access to patients records. I saw first hand the computer taking 30 mins just to open my records, and it\u2019s the same every time I attend and for Millions of other patients too. This needs fixing ASAP. FRUSTRATING",
