The cost of living has gone up, people can\u2019t live off statutory maternity pay. People are on minimum wage and their employers only give maternity leave which is required by law. If I was to have children, I would have no option but to return to work after 6 weeks as I would need to pay my bills, which is impossible on the statutory maternity pay. It needs to be changed!",

People are having to come back to work after 6 weeks as they can\u2019t afford to pay bills etc on statutory maternity pay. PLEASE SIGN!",
