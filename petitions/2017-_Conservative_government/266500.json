However, we aren't sure which of the current laws on cigarettes you'd like extended to cover e-cigarettes.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we aren't sure whether you'd like to make it illegal to make it illegal to use an e-cigarette in all public enclosed areas and workplaces, whether you'd like to introduce health warnings on packages, or whether you'd like other rules to apply to the purchase and use of e-cigarettes. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
