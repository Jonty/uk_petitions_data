        "additional_details": "Students at Ashlyns school recently were asked a few questions about what they thought about policy's regarding:\r\n-Piercings\r\n-hair colour\r\n-hair length\r\n-hair patterns\r\nMost students were unaware and disagreed with the punishments available to pupils who disobeyed uniform standards. \r\nOther students were not suprised and said that they had been unfairly treated for their appearance regarding piercings and hair aperance.\r\nFor those unaware students face exclusion,inclusion and in some cases expulsion.",
        "background": "Students should be free from persecution and punishments for \"excessive piercings\" and \"unnatural hair colours\".\r\nThe mistreatment of students is unfair. \r\nSchool is seen as an analogy for life in the real world \r\nThese rules are dated and only increase discriminative attitudes.",
