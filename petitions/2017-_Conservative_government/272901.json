        "additional_details": "The 17.4 million people who voted Leave have been ignored by self-serving, egotistical public servants - who have forgotten that they are indeed employed by the British people, and also the basic tenets of Democracy. We knew what a vote to Leave entailed, and to have it said that most who voted Leave did not know what they were voting for is abhorrent. We need to choose MP's who will work for the British people, not unaccountable Brussels bureaucrats. The only way to achieve this is an election.",
        "background": "Parliament has shown that it has no desire, or respect, for the outcome of the 2016 EU Referendum, despite a majority standing on manifestos that promised to enact the will of the people. The behaviour of many MP's over the last three years is an embarrassment to Democracy.",
