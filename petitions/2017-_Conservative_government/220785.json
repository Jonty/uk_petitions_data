        "action": "Help release Oleg Sentsov, and other Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia.",
        "additional_details": "Many have called for Sentsov's release, in particular the European Film Academy, as well as Amnesty International- his hunger strike is for the release of all the Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia. The leading witness for the prosecution in the case withdrew his evidence, which he said was obtained under duress, proving how shaky the case against him is. Indeed, at his trial, Sentsov said he had been beaten up by his interrogators, who put a bag over his head and told him to confess.",
        "background": "Detained after the annexation of Crimea, the filmmaker Oleg Sentsov has been sentenced to 20 years hard labour, and is now hunger striking. He is one of 64 Ukrainian political prisoners imprisoned by Russia, in breach of international law. It is the UK's responsibility to help speed his release.",
