        "action": "Force new, unelected Prime Ministers to have a general election within a year.",
        "additional_details": "Gordon Brown, Theresa May and the soon to be elected new Prime Minister, will come to power not by the election of the population of their country but through coronation by their own party membership. These memberships are proven not to reflect the demographic of the UK. This recent trend undermines our long held electoral democracy. Amending the fixed term parliament act to demand a new general election within a year of coming to power, understands but balances stability with democracy.",
        "background": "A governing party electing a new leader and therefore a new Prime Minister by it own internal process, is profoundly undemocratic. This petition seeks an amendment to the fixed term parliament act forcing newly unelected PMs to go to the people through a general election within a year of office.",
