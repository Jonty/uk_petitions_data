Even those under 18?\r\n\r\nAnd the procedure in which the female goes under anesthetic and the fetus gets suctioned from the mothers uterus. That in its self poses a higher risk to the female body, in some cases even death on the table. \r\n\r\nBut you still as a country carry out abortions to women ages between 14+? But cannot provide women tests to check their health?",
