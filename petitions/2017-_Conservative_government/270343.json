        "additional_details": "The North East is being left behind especially in the rail sector, by expanding the network it would serve so much more of our low income areas. HS2, Heathrow\u2019s New runway and Crossrail are prime examples the North East isn\u2019t a big runner compared to the other cities. \r\n \r\nBy proposed plans and the DfT investing \u00a31.259bn in the network, it would allow 44.6m more journeys every year, and as each metro journey adds \u00a38.50 to the northeast economy it would add \u00a3379m to our economy, making it worthwhile in under 4 years.",
        "background": "Expanding the TW Metro to Washington, Northumberland, Seaham, Doxford Park, East Newcastle, Team Valley, Silverlink, and the Metrocentre will skyrocket the North East\u2019s economy. With projects like HS2 and Crossrail the North East is being left behind vs cities like London, Birmingham and Manchester.",
