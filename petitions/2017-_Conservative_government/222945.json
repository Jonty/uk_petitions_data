        "action": "Abolish International Student Fees and Finance Ineligibility for UK Citizens",
        "additional_details": "I moved back to the UK from overseas in June 2017, and wish to apply for university in 2019, once I have completed A Levels. I was born in Kings-Lynn, Norfolk, and have possessed a British passport all my life. Having never lived under another nationality, or been a permanent resident of any foreign country, to find out that I am classed as an international student within my own borders is upsetting, and is a disadvantage for me, as I now cannot afford higher education, or find myself a job.",
        "background": "The prerequisite three year residence in the UK deprives British citizens from the ability to access Student Finance, meaning that families have to attempt to pay the massive fees on their own. This disadvantages domestic students, and is unfair on those who possess British passports and citizenship",
