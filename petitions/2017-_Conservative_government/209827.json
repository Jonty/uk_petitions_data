        "additional_details": "In August 2016 DEFRA did not want to grant hedgehogs protected status as they apparently did not need protection from humans, but they do need protection from our behaviour.  They are constantly being pushed out of their habitats as County Ecologists will only consider protected species when dealing with planning applications.  There were 30 million in the 1970s its now less than 1 million, its time to stop watching the decline and state the obvious \u2013 they are endangered and should be protected.",
        "background": "Often when I am trying to highlight the existence of hedgehogs in planning applications, I am told that they do not count because they are not a protected species.  At present they are at risk of extinction by 2025, we cannot stop this if they are not protected.",
