        "additional_details": "For far too long, an undercurrent of inter-generational strife has been building, with the elderly being targeted to take money from in order to help younger generations. However most young people would not wish to see pensioners deprived of their rights, or left in poverty. We need someone to liaise across Government departments, such as Treasury and Health, to ensure fairness for the wellbeing of older generations.\u00a0\u00a0",
        "background": "This role needs to be established because currently nobody is taking overall responsibility for ensuring society treats older citizens fairly.\r\nPensioners in England, to whom we owe a huge debt of gratitude, should be treated with the dignity, care and respect.",
