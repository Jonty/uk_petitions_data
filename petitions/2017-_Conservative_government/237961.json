        "additional_details": "I have spoken to mothers via pregnancy events who were never told what was going to happen to their placenta. \r\n\r\nThe Government should run a campaign to raise awareness among expectant parents that they have the right to decide what happens to their placenta as part of their birth plan.\r\n \r\nI have spoken to midwifery professionals who agree that expectant mothers should be told of the options. It was only after researching i found that I encapsulated my placenta to aid post birth recovery.",
        "background": "As a mother i was not informed throughout the different stages of my pregnancy that in fact my placenta was my own property & I had a choice on what i could do with it. Instead, without any discussion my placenta was disposed of as waste at the hospital.",
