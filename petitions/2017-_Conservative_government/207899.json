        "additional_details": "The NSPCC reports a surge in the number of young people seeking help through the Childline support service specifically as a result of exam stress. \r\n\r\nWe are concerned that the new style English Literature exam is inaccessible to students where poor language and literary skills prevail; its compulsory nature breeds unprecedented levels of stress.\r\n\r\nMinisters wishing to tackle student mental health issues,  should consider the impact of their English Literature Exam policy; make it optional study .",
        "background": "Year 11 students face the huge task of taking a compulsory exam in GCSE English Literature. This is a closed book exam in which the study and  memorisation of quotes is essential . \r\nSurely this is an unnecessary waste of resources when there is already a compulsory examination in English Langauge.",
