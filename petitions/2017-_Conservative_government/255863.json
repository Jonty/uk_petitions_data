If the 2016 Referendum has taught us anything, no matter which side of the fence you stand, is that our elected members will do anything they can to look after themselves and their ilk.     They asked the public what they wanted.    They have failed us.     They no longer carry any credibility.     We, the voters of the UK, must now be given the opportunity to give the members an election kicking to wake them up",

If you are a \"Brexiteer\", you will be dismayed by the abject failure of parliament to do its job.     If you are a remainer, you'll probably be happy - but the reality is you should be very worried.",
