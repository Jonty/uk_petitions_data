        "additional_details": "The wording of all employment contracts should be absolutely clear as to the expected working hours of the employment. There should be no ambiguity to allow the employer to achieve \"free labour\" from the technical wording of their contract. If an employer requires an employee to work hours in excess of their contract, this should be reimbursed through overtime payments.",
        "background": "In many contracts, (especially in retail), the hours expected for an employee to work are stated as a \"minimum\". This wording, in effect, allows the employer to require you to work above your minimum working hours without having to pay you overtime.",
