        "additional_details": "I am suggesting its changed, so that the starting rate of payment is based on 52-104 nights contact, as the normal is every other weekend and as a min, 4 of the 13 weeks school holidays. The no reduction rate should only be payable if, The Child is a product of Rape, The Non Resident Parent does not want contact or after a Court Order is made where Child Welfare/Proctection Issues, stating no overnight contact.",
        "background": "There has been many cases on the Seperated Dads Forum, where contact has been opposed just as more Child Support is payable if there is no overnight stays. With the need for Medication before Court, the Resident Parent gets the benefit of higher payments until an Order is made, often 9 months.",
