        "additional_details": "Some scientists predict that by 2050, the ocean will contain more plastic than fish; indeed, plastic is also found in the air we breathe. While some plastic is recyclable, not all is - and a straw that lasts for seconds will stay on the planet for centuries. We must do better, and, while it is great for indivuals to avoid unecessary plastic packaging, the supermarkets must stop using it in their products for meaningful change to take place. Parliament must legislate against single-use plastics.",
        "background": "Every minute, a truckload of plastic enters the oceans, where it is swallowed by marine creatures, or borken down into microplastics which work their way up the food chain - and ultimately to us.  When will the government take action and place a meaninfgul ban on single use plastics?",
