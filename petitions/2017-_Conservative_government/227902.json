        "additional_details": "The current process penalises students through no fault of their own and penalises where parents may have more income on paper.\r\n\r\nThe process does not take in consideration the number of siblings, the amount of disposable income, distance from home and is a blocker to University aspiration.\r\n\r\nUniversity drop out rates are also higher for stay at home students as opposed to those staying away. Students may be placed under pressure to stay at home due to family finance.",
        "background": "When applying for student finance the applicant needs to provide parental income. Based on the parental income the amount of maintenance loan available can be reduced to such an extent that it could limit the education opportunities of the student.\r\n\r\nThe current process penalises students.",
