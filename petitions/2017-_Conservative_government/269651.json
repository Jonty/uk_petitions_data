        "additional_details": "Parliament is sovereign in this nation and they represent the people. Thus, parliament needs to be shown that their constituents do not want a no-deal exit from the EU and that MPs must act to stop this. \r\n\r\nBy signing this petition you are doing your bit to ensure the voices of the silent majority of people against a no-deal Brexit have their opinions heard.",
        "background": "When the UK narrowly voted to leave the EU in 2016, many leave voters did not assume that we would ever leave without a deal as now seems to be policy for this government.\r\n\r\nThe people therefore petition that Parliament stops such an exit and allows the people another say on Brexit following this.",
