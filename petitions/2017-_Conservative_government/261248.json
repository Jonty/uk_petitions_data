We aren't sure what you would like to happen as a result of revoking that permission when the building has already been completed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition requiring local authorities to refuse future applications for planning permission from developers who have been successfully taken to court for having provided sub-standard homes if that is something you would like to see happen."
