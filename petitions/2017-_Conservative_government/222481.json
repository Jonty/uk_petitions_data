        "additional_details": "In dire circumstances, it should be available for UK citizens to have the choice or their families to have the choice for an ill individual to die with dignity, to end suffering for the person of ill health. \r\nIn the UK under ASPA (Animals : Scientific Procedures Act) 1986, there is a requirement to euthanise animals in order to prevent undue suffering. If this is legally viewed as a right and a requirement for mice, rats etc. why not for humans?",
