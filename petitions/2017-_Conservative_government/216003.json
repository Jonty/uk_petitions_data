In any case, Government and Parliament aren't responsible for promoting music. \r\n \r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask the Government to set up a public inquiry into knife crime, which could look at whether the music industry needs to make changes, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
