The sums due are way beyond the means of many people affected.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury has failed to properly assess the impact of the Loan Charge on those affected, which will force ordinary working people into bankruptcy and cause families to lose their homes and everything they have worked for, potentially even pension savings.",
        "background": "The loan charge is a retrospective tax charge introduced by HM Government in the 2017 Budget.\r\n\r\nThe charge will apply to all remuneration via loans since 6 April 1999 if they are still outstanding on 5 April 2019.",
