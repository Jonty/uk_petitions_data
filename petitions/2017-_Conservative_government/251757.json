To find MPs going against the will of the people and playing party politics within Westminster is disgraceful.\r\n\r\nWe do not need a people's vote as the June 23rd 2016 was a people's vote and to argue otherwise is undemocratic.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this petition is that hopefully that democracy shall be carried out.",
