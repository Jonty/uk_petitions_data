        "additional_details": "As it was explained in Attenborough's climate change documentary on BBC1 on 18th April, reducing the amount of things we buy that come in by air can reduce individual carbon footprints which in turn will contribute to the fight against climate change. But in shops it is often impossible to tell what comes by air & what comes by sea. I want to give people the chance to make an informed decision as to what to buy.",
