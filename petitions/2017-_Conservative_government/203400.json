Travelling abroad or others travelling to the U.K. accessing emergency services is not so simple. This seems like a global failing, 505 would be so easy to train alongside other safety messages",

This is ridiculous, we have globally recognised symbols for rescue (SOS, V, things in 3s) we should share one global emergency number! 505 looks like SOS so I propose this",
