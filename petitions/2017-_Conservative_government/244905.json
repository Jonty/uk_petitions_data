This statement may seem to contradict the above but being phrased differently can lead to different legal interpretations thus different outcomes.\r\nGiven the sizes of these documents, the 'reader' may inadvertently agree to terms not directly related to their immediate and expected business with the provider.\r\nAs T's & C's are binding the question is: In their current form do they support the common good?",

There's now a need for regulation and a better alternative. Simplicity, clarity, normalisation are required to allow the reader to understand easily, to what it is they're agreeing.",
