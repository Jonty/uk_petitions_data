        "additional_details": "Having industry giants threaten the public is shallow and ludicrous. In the past two years all competent businesses have prepared contingency plans. \r\nEverything Europe supplies can be obtained elsewhere and the UK import tax (currently zero for Europe) can be extended.\r\nJob gains and more cash are the common sense reality. Democracy is being challenged. \r\nBrexit means leaving Europe and cutting all ties. Trade agreements will soon follow and a balance will be restored.",
        "background": "The background is the vote by the UK public on the 23rd of June 2017.\r\nOur vote was democratic and it has not been delivered. Hard Brexit with savings going to the NHS was promoted By MP Boris Johnson. The outcome of this election has been hijacked.\r\nThis is the ONLY peoples vote.",
