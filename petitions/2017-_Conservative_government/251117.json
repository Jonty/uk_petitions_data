For this reason, anyone with mental illnesses should not have to pay due to the fact that it is something that needs medication to become manageable.",
        "background": "I think mental health medication prescriptions should be free because some people with mental health issues may not be able to afford it, what do they do then? It\u2019s not fair that if they cannot afford it they would have to suffer.",
