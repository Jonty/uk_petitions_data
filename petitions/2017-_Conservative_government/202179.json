        "action": "Exempt Radio Amateur aerials from requiring planning permission.",
        "additional_details": "Amateur Radio is a fantastic hobby for those who wish to learn about electronics and radio; and it can provide emergency communications when other systems fail. The experimental nature of the hobby allows people to design and build their own radios and aerial systems. Unfortunately, erect any kind of aerial and there is a chance you will be required to apply for planning permission. Change the aerial for a new design, and you will be back to square one. Planning law needs to change!",
        "background": "Current planning regulations severely restrict the ability of licensed Radio Amateurs to erect experimental aerial systems. We the undersigned require the government to amend the law to exempt all licensed Radio Amateurs (and C.B. radio users) from requiring planning permission for their aerials.",
