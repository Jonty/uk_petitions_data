        "additional_details": "When BR stopped it\u2019s direct London service from Cleethorpes, the town suffered. A poor show on what Grimsby and Cleethorpes was once to the country and to the world. Now, we have new technologies and the towns regeneration scheme but we still have no transport links! We want an extension from Lincoln to GY/Clee as a straight through line from KX to encourage business people to jump on at London\u2019s KX and hop off at GY/Clee. To encourage families back and to allow families to travel easily.",
        "background": "Grimsby and Cleethorpes once had a direct service to London. Creating links with families and businesses. LNER, now in Public ownership, the people want LNER to bring back the service by extending the line from Lincoln straight through. Don\u2019t delay, our North East Lincs is a fantastic place to be.",
