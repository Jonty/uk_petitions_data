        "action": "Make it a specific offence to deliberately kick or harm a hedgehog",
        "additional_details": "The laws on punishing this act are far too lenient. We are in a time now where the push to protect the British Hedgehog is more important than ever. So to dissuade this act from happening anymore, I feel a \u00a310,000 fine needs to be put in place. Those worried and regretful for performing this abhorrent act in the past should have no need to fear this ruling, as punishments will not affect anyone who performed it before the date of this law being put in place.",
        "background": "When Hedgehogs are purposely kicked this usually results in death due to their incredibly brittle bones. As the Hedgehog population falls and future extinction warnings are made, it is important that this cruel and momentary act is given a worthy punishment to provoke abusers to think twice.",
