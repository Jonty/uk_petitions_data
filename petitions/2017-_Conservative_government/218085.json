        "action": "Don't Abolish the House of Lords!",
        "additional_details": "If we had an elected Senate in place of the Lords, it would simply rival the Commons. Fundamentally, in elected office, politicians must make promises that pander to voters to keep them elected. The House of Lords doesn't have to fear electoral defeat because they have lifelong tenure and can focus on getting the job done of checking policy! They don't need to be accountable; that's what we have the Commons for whose power is the greatest of the two houses!",
        "background": "The House of Lords is a great parliamentary asset. Having a body that checks the Commons while being outside of the electoral process prevents rivalry and keeps the system balanced!",
