        "additional_details": "We need a well-rounded childcare infrastructure that helps working families with childcare costs and incentive women to go back to work. We need the government to incentivise companies to offer childcare arrangements as part of their benefits umbrella. We need a Childcare Levy to cover childcare costs of working parents for children up to the age of 5. We need a register of childcarers so that parents can leave their children in safe hands. www.childcarelevy.co.uk",
        "background": "The majority of the existing childcare support options are income based and do not incentivise women to go back to work.  To claim and access childcare support is difficult. Even though the government spends \u00a37.5n in childcare support per year, it only covers a fraction of families\u2019 childcare costs.",
