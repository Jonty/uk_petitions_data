        "additional_details": "The evidence is clear; either Jeremy Hunt or Boris Johnson are about to be granted leadership of the Conservative party and by default, the premiership of this country.\r\n\r\nThis will be decided ONLY by Tory party members, meaning for the second time in three years we will have had an unelected prime minister forced upon us.\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable in a parliamentary democracy and must be immediately put to the people in the form of a general election.",
        "background": "The next PM will be a person for whom the country has not voted. They will have been \u201cinstalled\u201d by a Tory membership of a mere 125,000.\r\n\r\nThis is a minuscule percentage of the population deciding upon a leader for the rest of us.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s an affront to democracy and should be immediately resolved.",
