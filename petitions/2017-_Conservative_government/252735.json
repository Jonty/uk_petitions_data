        "additional_details": "Ireland could be united again and operate within the UK as a country just like Scotland and Wales. Doing so might also solve the violence amongst republicans and loyalist within the country as this option may be a win for both sides.\r\nIn the past Ireland has suffered from British rule, but now in the modern day new laws prevent a return of things such as the troubles.",
        "background": "One of the biggest issues of Brexit is the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Ireland will also suffer issues exporting goods to the EU if they can't use the UK as a bridge to the EU. It's also likely that other countries may wish to leave the EU soon, Ireland should leave now.",
