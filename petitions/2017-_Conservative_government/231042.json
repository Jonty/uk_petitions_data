        "additional_details": "Many lone parent students, indeed any student, can find themselves in a position where they are up to \u00a3300 a month worse off under UC than under tax credits because of the current guidance on student income. We take out student loans out to fund our education to help us get to a position where we no longer require in work benefits and instead of being encouraged we are penalised. They don\u2019t acknowledge bank loans as income so why are student loans deducted so harshly for calculation purposes!",
        "background": "Currently student income is deducted pound for pound as though it\u2019s unpaid income. It should be treated the same as earned income and deducted 63p in the pound. Calculations should also be changed for Scottish students who receive monthly student income payments and can have no payments over summer.",
