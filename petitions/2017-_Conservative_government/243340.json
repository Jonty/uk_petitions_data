        "additional_details": "Palm oil is not always labelled clearly on the packaging, particularly in cosmetic products, therefore making it hard for buyers to check. \r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition  and save the millions of orangutang's who could die if this continues.",
        "background": "Every day twenty orangutang's die from deforestation from palm oil. Also, children are missing out on the right to a good education (Article 28) because they need to help their parents make money in the hazardous working conditions on palm oil plantations. This is unacceptable and should be stopped.",
