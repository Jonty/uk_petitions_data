        "additional_details": "There is no way of knowing whether low voter turnout is due to apathy or dissatisfaction with all of the candidates. Similarly, is a spoiled paper a protest or an error? 'None of the above' will help to engage the electorate and possibly force a by-election if this is the majority vote. Candidates will be able to gauge more accurately their popular mandate if they know the true proportion of the electorate who objected to them.",
        "background": "There is currently no method of registering an objection to the candidates on a UK ballot paper. The addition of the 'None of the above' option allows voters to register their involvement in a democratic election but indicate that none of the candidates are suitable representatives.",
