        "action": "Ban the promotion of cosmetic surgery and aesthetics on social media",
        "additional_details": "Social media users as young as 13 are exposed to images of jawline, cheek and lip fillers, under-eye smoothing and even calf sculpting. Some reality stars are also paid to promote clinics, with the knowledge that their audience is mainly teenage girls, known for taking an interest in their appearance,  a prime target for aestheticians who market towards insecurity.",
        "background": "I want action because I believe the promotion of aesthetics clinics using before/after photos of clients is dangerous to the self-esteem and mental health of many users. It encourages specifically young women to put their money towards regular Botox and fillers for the financial gain of beauticians.",
