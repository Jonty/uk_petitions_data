        "additional_details": "Today an officer is seriously injured in hospital. in 2010 there were over 171,000 officers, today just over 150,000 (decrease of over 12%). 19% of police staff removed.  They have lost local police stations, training establishments, vehicles and countless amounts of rest days. \r\nWe need to protect the people that run into danger when everyone else is fleeing. They need the preventative measure of taser to be standard issue. One voice can change a room, a city and hopefully a country. please sign",
        "background": "We need to protect the protectors.  Police officers on the streets in the UK today leave the station with a friction baton and a CS spay if they are a response officer.  This is woefully inadequate to deal with the rise in knife crime and the level of violence that is apparent in today's society.",
