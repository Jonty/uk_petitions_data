        "additional_details": "By allowing partners just 2 weeks statutory paternity leave, we are forcing them to miss out on learning about their child - which for new parents is difficult territory to navigate - and also forcing mums, who are recovering physically and mentally from pregnancy, labour and some surgery, to recover alone without the needed support of their partners. When post-natal depression effects more than 1 in 10 women, and men too, this lack of time to adjust as a family isn\u2019t acceptable.",
        "background": "My husband was only entitled to 2 weeks statutory paternity pay, like many other men in the UK today. This limited time frame makes it near impossible for partners to support mums recovering from birth and be part of their child\u2019s development in those first few key months.",
