        "additional_details": "A plant-based diet according to research has been shown to reverse the diseases above. NHS money, time, and resources are being wasted as people believe drugs and pills are the way to health.  People resort to taking weight loss pills, statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs), and blood pressure-reducing pills yet have a heavily processed meal several times a day as they have no way out due to education. The NHS spends \u00a314 billion pounds for type 2 diabetes alone! Think of where that money could go!",
        "background": "Nutrition is part of everyone's mind everyday and most having no knowledge of what a nutritionally balanced, delicious meal consists of is absurd. Type 2 Diabetes, Coronary Heart Disease, and Obesity are on the rise. People depend on pills for the rest of their lives when a healthy diet is the cure.",
