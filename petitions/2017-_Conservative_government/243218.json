        "action": "Introduce a minimum required level of qualification for music teachers.",
        "additional_details": "Arguments in favour include that this would:\r\n-Raise the standard of music teaching and musicianship in the UK, ensuring a minimum level of competence.\r\n-Prevent people from wasting their hard-earned money on low-quality services.\r\n-Stop unqualified teachers who charge baseline rates from putting qualified teachers out of business. \r\n-Solve an equity issue, as there are minimum qualification requirements for academic subject teachers.\r\n-Allow for more equal opportunities, as teachers of socially or economically disadvantaged children would be more able to spot and nurture talent.\r\n-Attract more talented individuals to the profession.\r\n\r\nI would suggest a minimum requirement for music teachers of grade 8 or equivalent on their instrument(s) and a qualification in teaching.",
        "background": "There is currently no minimum standard legally required of music teachers.This means that you could end up taking lessons from someone at, say, grade 2 standard who hasn't the faintest idea about musical techniques, let alone teaching ones; the impact on your musical endeavours would be devastating.",
