        "additional_details": "As we are aware, plastic is having a horrendous impact on our beautiful planet.\r\n\r\nPlastic bags should be banned altogether but that will take time. however, in the meanwhile, we need to address the problem immediately and I think this is the best temporary but immediate solution. \r\n\r\nIf you're worried about the inconvenience of remembering to bring your bags every time &  having to pay an extra 20p then please do watch the BBC documentary called 'Drowning in Plastic'.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.",
