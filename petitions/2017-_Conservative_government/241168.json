In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time. We're not sure what else you'd like Parliament and Government to do.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we can't accept your petition because the UK Government and Parliament aren't responsible for the issue you raise. The police and the CPS are responsible for deciding whether to charge people with a crime. \r\n\r\nYou may find this guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service helpful:\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/perverting_the_course_of_justice_-_rape_and_dv_allegations/\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for a specific change to the law."
