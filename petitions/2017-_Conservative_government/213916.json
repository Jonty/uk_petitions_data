        "action": "Amend Equality Act 2010 by adding a provision for \"Other\" characteristics.",
        "additional_details": "Currently, the only characteristics on which it is unlawful to discriminate are age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation and pregnancy/maternity. \r\nHowever, there is no recourse for people discriminated because of their weight, tattoos or sociocultural affiliation. This petition aims to change this by adding an \u201cOther\u201d option and thus not allowing people to be discriminated because of who they are within the rigid boundaries of the law, to be determined by Judges upon hearing and reading the evidence.",
        "background": "Change discrimination legislation, by adding another protected characteristic to the Equality Act 2010, namely \"Other\": a characteristic not included in the act but including traits/features/qualities, which could potentially attract discriminatory behaviour.",
