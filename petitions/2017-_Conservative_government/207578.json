        "action": "Extend to UK citizens the family rights guaranteed for EU citizens in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "We support the family rights of Europeans in the UK.\r\nBut currently UK citizens must earn \u00a318600 to bring a non EEA spouse or partner to the UK. This rises by \u00a33800 to bring a child here + \u00a32600 for each subsequent child.\r\nUK citizens must pay thousands of pounds of visa fees and the Immigration Health Surcharge for our non EEA family members.\r\nIf we make any mistakes on our visa forms our family members must leave the UK and appeal from overseas. \r\nWe demand parity with European citizens in the UK.",
        "background": "In the Brexit negotiations, family rights for EU citizens were guaranteed including the right for non EEA family members to join them in the UK. This should be extended to include UK citizens who must meet income thresholds, huge visa fees + complex rules before non EEA family members can live here",
