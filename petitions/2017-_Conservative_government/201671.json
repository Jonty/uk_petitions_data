This behaviour is unconscionable and demonstrates clearly Sadiq Khan's unsuitability for the role. The Mayor of London is not a national role and yet Mr Khan seeks to strut upon the national stage - again proving his unsuitability.",

This disregard for the result of a public vote undermines his office. Those who voted for the Mayor of London should be given a second vote now.",
