The Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 created some circumstances in which trespass to land can also be a crime. https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/trespass-and-nuisance-land.\r\n\r\nI propose the Government pass a law to make this a specific criminal offence to protect all, as this issue affects many people & results in costly civil disputes, often the offenders are well off.",
