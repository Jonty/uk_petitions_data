        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum appears to have been initiated in order to try and unite the Tory party. The issue of whether we are in the EU or not is so important it must be above party politics. Brexit must only be implemented after a fully informed electorate have been given the opportunity to confirm this is their choice.",
        "background": "When the people voted to leave the EU on 26th June 2016 there was no proper debate or understanding about the implications of a decision to leave, either by the people or the government. Now the issues are clearer it is a moral and political duty to put it to the people again.",
