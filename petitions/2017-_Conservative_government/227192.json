The addict that is actively working on their recovery can find a single advert on the internet or TV extremely triggering.\r\n\r\nThe government has a responsibility to protect it's citizens in the face of corporations that are tactically taking advantage of addicts, particularly where gambling is readily available with a few taps on our mobile devices.",
