Allowing teens to get jobs when they are ready helps them become independent sooner and therefore be ready for the bigger world.",

We're also not sure how to judge when someone is ready. \r\n\r\nIf this is a decision your family have made, the UK Government and Parliament wouldn't be responsible for changing their minds. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask to change the law to make it legal for any child over the age of 11 to work, if that's what you'd like to happen."
