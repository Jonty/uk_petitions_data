They leave families unable to pay for food, rent and bills.  Children become vulnerable to being snatched by the LAs and are then neglected in an uncaring \"care\" system. They are impossible to set aside.  Bankruptcies, Insolvency, Imprisonment, homelessness, even suicide are far too frequent results of this outrageous abuse of power.",

Magistrates rubber stamping Bulk Liability Orders while failing to investigate the LA false \"evidence\". VOA creating false listings. LAs abusing their powers and Courts complicit.",
