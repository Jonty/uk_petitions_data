        "action": "Increase the price of plastic bags from 5p",
        "additional_details": "Charging 5p for plastic bags in a first world, rich country is never going to stop people from purchasing them. The whole point of the 5p scheme was to reduce the amount of plastic that we\u2019re using and purchasing everyday. 5p to the average person in the UK is never going to make much difference. The short uproar of this argument is a price I\u2019m willing to pay for the long term benefit it will have to our environment, planet and well-being of animals.",
        "background": "As a lot of people may disagree with this argument, we need to look at the evidence showing a bigger picture to why this will help us in the long run.",
