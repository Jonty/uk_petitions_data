        "additional_details": "\"Women born in the 1950s have been particularly impacted by an abrupt and poorly phased in change in the state pension age from 60 to 66. The impact of the changes is such as to severely penalize those who happen to be on the cusp of retirement and who had well-founded expectations of entering the next phase of their lives, rather than being plunged back into a workforce for which many of them were ill-prepared and to which they could not reasonably have been expected to adjust with no notice.\"",
        "background": "The UN Special Rapporteur, Prof. Alston reported his findings after investigating poverty in the UK. As a result of austerity policies (a political choice) 20% of the population are living in poverty, the social fabric of British society is being damaged; the hardest hit include 1950s-born women.",
