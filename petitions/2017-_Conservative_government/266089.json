        "additional_details": "Children can\u2019t help having time off school due to accidents, sickness bugs, allergic reactions, operations, treatment etc. Stop punishing them by making them miss out on trips/rewards with friends.  \r\n\r\nI understand that good attendance is important for education.  I fail to see how rewarding good attendance does that.  Children can\u2019t avoid illness through choice.  They should be encouraged to work hard and excel when they are in school not punished for the days they miss through illness.",
        "background": "Schools up and down the Country have introduced reward systems for 100% attendance.  This is punishing sick children and it\u2019s wrong.  It needs to stop.",
