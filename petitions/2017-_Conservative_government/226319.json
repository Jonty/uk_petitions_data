        "action": "Abolish the BBC.",
        "additional_details": "The BBC is a malignancy in our national life.  There is also no longer any need for a public broadcaster in the digital age where there is choice and innovation.  The BBC will reply that it should remain as a guardian of neutrality, but the BBC is hopelessly biased.  The guardian should be the free market. Parliament should revoke the Charter, dissolve the Corporation, then sell-off its assets to the private sector.  Its staff should be expected to seek employment in the commercial world.",
        "background": "Abolishing the TV licence will not be enough.  The BBC itself must be abolished.  Simply abolishing the TV licence and further commercialising the BBC will not solve the real problem, which is that the BBC is outdated in the digital age, and is a stronghold of Leftist and metropolitan biases.",
