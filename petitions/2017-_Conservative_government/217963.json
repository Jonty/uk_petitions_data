        "additional_details": "I believe if ADHD children got accepted for a blue badge it would help a lot of families . Like less melt downs, less late trips or making shopping easier. Nothing is worse than having errands to do and your child is kicking off because you are 10 minutes late home and they have a certain routine.",
        "background": "Autism and physical disabilities are included in the blue badge scheme but people don\u2019t understand how hard it is to catch public transport and make your journey with an ADHD child!! When they have a set routine and you miss your bus ADHD is just a challenge as any other disability.",
