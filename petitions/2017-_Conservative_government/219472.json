        "action": "Don't change how Parliament\u2019s popular and successful guided tours are run",
        "additional_details": "The House authorities plan to replace the current qualified guides with a downsized team. In our view, the case for this change is based on inaccurate information and flawed financial analysis. MPs and Peers have declared their support for our campaign. The proposals also call for substantial investment in a plan to guide in a building facing closure for refurbishment in seven years' time. We believe that this proposal is misguided and does not represent a good use of taxpayers' money.",
        "background": "For 18 years, Parliament tours have been led by professional Blue Badge Guides and experienced in-house guides. The tours have won awards and Parliament is top rated on TripAdvisor. Tours generate income for Parliament. Under new proposals 200+ professionals will stop receiving work from Parliament.",
