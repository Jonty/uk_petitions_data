        "action": "Postpone conference season to allow for Brexit debates in Parliament.",
        "additional_details": "There is no evidence that those who voted to leave the EU voted to do so on a no deal basis. A no deal exit is widely understood to be hugely damaging to the UK economy, resulting in the population becoming poorer. To allow this, or to force this through by default without the will of parliament and therefore the will of the democratically elected representatives of the British people is by definition undemocratic. Postpone conference season and get on with exercising democracy.",
        "background": "Plans for an extended prorogue of parliament amount to 4 days lost as the conference season will eat up so much time in any case. Conference season should be delayed to allow parliament to discuss this once in a life time issue and get it right, rather than allow a no deal Brexit by default.",
