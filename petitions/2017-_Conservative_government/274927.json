        "additional_details": "The Bundesliga boasts low season ticket prices, high attendances and a class quality of football. Also there is more competition between clubs unlike in our top flight. Furthermore, due to this rule no club in Germany has ever went bust in the 21st century as opposed to many clubs in the football pyramid",
        "background": "As clubs like Bury have fell prey to greedy businessmen, maybe this would have not have happened if the club and it\u2019s fans owned a 50+1% of the club. This would benefit the English football league system as it has done in Germany",
