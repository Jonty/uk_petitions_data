        "additional_details": "Fiona Loud, Policy Director at Kidney Care UK, said: \u201cWe are extremely worried that some vulnerable patients may not be able to afford to travel and may simply not attend dialysis which will result in death. We think there are major patient safety and wellbeing concerns and urge NHS Kernow CCG to halt this course of action.\" \r\nPlease sign this petition to stop NHS Kernow putting lives at risk & setting a dangerous precedent that other CCGs could follow.",
        "background": "From 30 September 2017 NHS Kernow CCG will make many dialysis patients pay for travel to/from their life-saving treatment. This will cost \u00a3hundreds each month & almost 100 patients will have to pay. Without treatment they will die so they may have to forgo food/heating to afford it. This is wrong.",
