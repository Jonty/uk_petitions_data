        "additional_details": "The obvious solution is for Eurostar to accept passengers with pets. \r\nAfter much pressure a concession was made for Guide dogs and this was later extended to include all registered Assistance dogs. But there has been no progress on travel for the ordinary passenger with a pet. It is the link across the Channel which is missing and Eurostar has effectively a monopoly on the route and a veto over its use.",
        "background": "Many of you will be aware of a defect in the pet travel scheme \u2013 those who do not drive can still not take their pets with them across the channel by train. The Channel Tunnel Shuttle service is only accessible for car drivers and their passengers.",
