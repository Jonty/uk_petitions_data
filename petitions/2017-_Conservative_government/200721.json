In 2014 accordinging to the Kennel Club 70,000 animals were stolen in England.  Statistics from Direct line for 2016/17 theft is up by 40% and the true number of cat thefts in the UK being as high as 360,000 . Only 10% were found through microchipping. I want all vets by law to scan for chip on all newly registered animals",

Extensive search was made and contact with every organisation. \r\nWhen targetting Veterinary Surgeries it was quite concerning as it did not appear to be routine or consistent that vets scan newly registered cats and dogs.",
