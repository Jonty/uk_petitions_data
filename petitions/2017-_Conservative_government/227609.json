        "additional_details": "The posts may contain unfounded accusations and fake reviews. Pictures of the escorts can be posted without consent. Such sites are dangerous to ALL women, not just sex workers. Appearing on them can lead to women being harassed, outed and having their addresses made public, which could result in criminal damage and burglary. Users can even post pictures of women in the street and give derogatory accounts of what they would like to do to them in locked sections of these forums.",
        "background": "On certain online escort review discussion boards, such as UK Punting, users submit aggressive & potentially defamatory posts about women. These websites ask for reviews to contain a link, contact details or address of the escort, which can put them at risk.",
