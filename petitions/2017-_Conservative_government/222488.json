        "additional_details": "\"A person who promotes or takes part in a race or trial of speed between motor vehicles on a public way is guilty of an offence.\"\r\n\r\nThis should include cyclists. Cycles are faster and more streamlined than they have ever been for general road use, so races/time trials on public ways are faster than they have ever been and therefore more dangerous an should be illegal. A cycle can go faster than a 50cc moped but it is illegal to race a moped, but not a cycle.\r\n\r\nThis needs seriously reviewing.",
        "background": "Cycle racing/time trials on open/public roads need to be reviewed. Cycles are getting faster, meaning more danger to other road users, pedestrians etc and roads are getting busier with more cars than ever.\r\n\r\nCycle races/time trials should now only be held on closed ways/roads.",
