        "additional_details": "The current conditions  for the recording PIP Assessments are preposterous only allowing for the use of cassette/CD recorders that are no longer available. \r\n\r\nA claimant would have to provide 2 copies of a cassette tape.\r\n\r\nThis is totally unacceptable.  \r\n\r\nDigital equipment is inexpensive and widely available but not permitted only Cassette or CD.  \r\n\r\nIn one case when a claimant asked an assessor where they could get hold of a double cassette recorder the assessor said, 'try and buy it on eBay'.",
        "background": "Benefit assessors have been purportedly lying to the DWP regarding claimants health and disability.\r\n\r\nDisabled people want to record their PIP assessments but are only permitted to use archaic & obsolete cassette equipment.",
