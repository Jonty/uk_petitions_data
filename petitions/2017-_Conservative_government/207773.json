        "additional_details": "There needs to be better laws in place to make it the responsibility of BOTH the old and new owners to update the animals microchip details.\r\nBased on figures from the Dogs Trust Up to 12 dogs a day face being Put to Sleep because their owners haven\u2019t updated their dogs microchip details \r\nAnd a further study conducted by Dogs Trust has found a mere 9% of dog owners consider updating their dogs\u2019 microchips post-move a priority, with sorting digital TV coming above this.",
        "background": "If an owner has to rehome their dog or cat it should be partly their responsibility to notify their microchip provider that the pet has been rehomed and send them the new owners details. Similar to V5 for a car where both the new and old owners have to notify the DVLA. If not a fine can be issued",
