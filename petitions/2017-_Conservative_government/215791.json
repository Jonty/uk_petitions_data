        "action": "Increase paternity leave so it is 3 months off on full pay.",
        "additional_details": "The changes would also include kit days.\r\nExtended leave would benefit:\r\n1. Mums recovery. The minimum recovery time for a c section is 6 weeks. If dads were off for the 3 month period they would be able to support. \r\n2. Sleep deprevation - babies sleep is irregular in the first 3 months. There is lots of research on sleep deprevation and its negative impact in the workplace. \r\n3. Dad bonding - research suggests children with good paternal bonds are often better off later in life.",
        "background": "I would like to propose a change to the law regarding paternity leave. I think that the current law is determinal to parents and should be altered to support working families.\r\nI feel that fathers should get 3 months paternity leave at full pay, with an option of a further 3 months at part pay.",
