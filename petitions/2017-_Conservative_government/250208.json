        "additional_details": "Following the death of Kane Walker in February 2019, we are reminded again of the tragic consequences of homelessness. Politicians are currently prioritising matters such as Brexit and not doing enough to prevent this developing into a humanitarian crisis. Attitudes need to change across society and the government can take the lead. Only last year the controversy surrounding the Royal Wedding in Windsor shows that too many in authority still seek to ignore the issue instead of tackling it.",
        "background": "The number of rough sleepers in the UK is on the rise and more needs to be done by the UK government to prevent this getting worse. The current strategies in place are not working. They need to develop a new plan that looks at the causes of homelessness and offers real hope for the future.",

You can read the strategy here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-rough-sleeping-strategy\r\n\r\nWe understand you want more to be done, but we're not sure exactly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. You could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like to happen.\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition about providing permanent housing for homeless people. You might like to sign this petition if it calls for something you'd like to happen. You're more likely to get action on an issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/240072"
