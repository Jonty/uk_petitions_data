        "additional_details": "The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula (England) Regulations 2007 (section 23) prohibits marketing of baby formula. Loyalty card schemes are being caught up in this, barring parents from accruing points and making savings. \r\n\r\nThe purchase is being made regardless, without promotional inducement. The collection of points by parents cannot be called marketing.\r\n\r\nThe legislation can be found here\r\n\r\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/3521/regulation/23/made",
        "background": "The law as it stands prohibits stores from issuing loyalty card points on the sale of baby milk formula. Parents are barred from amassing points to make savings.\r\n\r\nThis is unfair to parents who don't always have a choice in using formula. Also to parents exercising their right to choose not to.",
