        "additional_details": "Since the implementation of motorways, there has always been a hard shoulder which served several purposes. It is a safe zone for a vehicle to use if there's a mechanical problem, if there is a sudden emergency and more so, it was a clear lane for emergency services to use. \r\n\r\nSince the implementation of smart motorways, this lane has become a live lane and if the unforseen happens, you are stranded in what is now a death trap and also delaying emergency vehicles attending an incident.",
        "background": "When your vehicle has issues on a motorway, you look for the safety of the hard shoulder. Smart motorways have removed this and are not smart enough to recognise lane 1 blockages quick enough. As a consequence, lives are put at imminent risk.",
