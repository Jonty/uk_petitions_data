        "action": "Abolish universal credit before it put's a majority of the UK in poverty!",
        "additional_details": "Once fully implemented Universal Credit will mean easier sanctioning forcing people to live off nothing. Housing subsidy will be time limited for some 18-21 year olds forcing more to be homeless. Support for child care drastically cut. Disability elements cut or abolished altogether. Thousands of small businesses will be forced out of business.The new system is failing to deliver anticipated cost savings and employment benefits and has left thousands of vulnerable claimants in debt and hardship.",
        "background": "Universal Credit is about cutting the Social Security bill meaning millions will be worse off! It has been rolled out across hundreds of councils and the cracks are showing. \r\nThe NAO confirms universal credit is running six years behind schedule. Some rates are lower than current benefit rates.",
