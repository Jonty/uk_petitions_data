By following the simple steps in the petition we could see the numbers for the 2nd Referendum but it won\u2019t be official so Parliament couldn\u2019t do anything with it. Except it would show an indication of the number to be able to give Boris Johnson the opportunity of what to do at this difficult time. Like me who supports Leave it would show Boris if this would be a good idea or not, however it would show how many voters vote leave or remain giving him the opportunity to discuss this in Parliament and whether to go ahead with one or not and also to shut Jeremy Corbyn, Lib Dem\u2019s and SNP up.\r\nThank You \r\n\r\nMember of the Conservative and Unionist Party",
