Capital gains if it's an investment - fine, Council tax - fine, Tax preventing people moving house, not fine. Stamp duty prevents people downsizing before retirement, and prevents people moving for any one of a number of reasons.",

A simple fee to cover the administration cost of registering ownership would be perfectly acceptable.",
