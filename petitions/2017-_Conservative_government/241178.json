        "additional_details": "An unmarried father has few legal rights with regard to his children unless he has Parental Responsibility (PR). All married fathers have PR, but unmarried fathers only have PR if they are named as the child's father on the birth certificate, they have a legally binding Parental Responsibility Agreement or a Parental Responsibility Order. An unmarried father who has PR should be treated the same as a father who was married to the mother.",
        "background": "Unmarried fathers need more rights. The only people losing out is the kids. We have to jump through hoops, mediation sometime this can take months. It's unfair and really needs to be looked into. I understand why some fathers walk away. That's not right.",
