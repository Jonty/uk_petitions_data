It can ruin your life. The links/adverts/stories advertised are a way to make money, and unfortunately a lot of people fall to this and get into a vicious circle of gambling/loans/debt and more serious issues like suicidal thoughts or even suicide itself. It needs to be stopped. Now.",

This can causes so many problems for people.",
