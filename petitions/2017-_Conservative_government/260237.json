In particular, we're not sure whether you want to stop all non-UK citizens from campaigning in UK elections or something else.   \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition calling for a ban on non-UK citizens campaigning in UK elections and referenda."
