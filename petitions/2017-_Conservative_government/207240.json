        "action": "Britain should follow the USA and now accept Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital city.",
        "additional_details": "Not only was Jerusalem the capital of biblical Israel, now under modern Israel, full freedom and accessibility is granted to everyone from all faiths to all holy shrines in Jerusalem with freedom of worship for all. This was not the case when Jordan occupied East Jerusalem between 1948 and 1967 when they defiled Judaism\u2019s holiest sites and banned Jews from Jersualem. Accepting Israel\u2019s right to its capital city will be a small step to correct thousands of years of injustice to Jews and Israel.",
        "background": "Ever since King David made the city of Jerusalem the capital of Israel over 3,000 years ago, Jerusalem has been the most important place on planet earth for the nation of Israel. Denying Israel their capital city is akin to denying London as the capital of England.",
