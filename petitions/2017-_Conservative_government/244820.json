We pay so much money to fly around the world and to visit different destinations whether it\u2019s pleasure, social, or business, but we never know if we ever are going to make it or not. By providing these parachutes will increase everyone\u2019s confidence and make flying safe and saving many wasted lives off talented and beautiful people",
