        "additional_details": "The government should re-direct NHS resources to close the 4-year gap. No child should be born to a shorter life simply by being born male. Medical opinion is that there is no basic reason why women should live longer than men - so resources in research, treatment, health education etc. should be focused on men's health until the gap is closed.",
        "background": "End the worst gender inequality of them all - refocus health resources to give men and women equal life expectancy. The ONS states that the average life expectancy is 79 years for men and 83 years for women. This is a shocking discrimination against men, in the most fundamental way - life itself.",
