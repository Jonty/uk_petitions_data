        "additional_details": "If refugees attempt to cross the Channel by dinghy to get to the UK, then they should be intercepted, brought safely to the UK shore and automatically granted the right to live in the UK on humanitarian grounds. Once in the UK, all refugees and asylum seekers must be given the right to settle and be treated with dignity and respect. They must have provision to live in the community. There must be no use of immigration detention centres - fleeing war, genocide and persecution is not a crime.\r\n",
        "background": "The UK has a proud history of tolerance, compassion and respect for human rights. Action must be taken to prevent a potential tragedy in the Channel. If asylum seekers are returned to France or elsewhere, they will simply try again to get to the UK. The problem will escalate unless stopped.\r\n",
