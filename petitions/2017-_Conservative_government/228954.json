        "additional_details": "Dementia research and treatment lags far behind other major disease areas, like cancer.  In 2016-2017, the Government committed \u00a383.1 million of public money to dementia research.  In contrast cancer research received \u00a3269m in 2015-2016.  This inequity in research funding has resulted in slower progress in our ability to treat dementia than we\u2019ve seen in other conditions.  With no way to prevent, cure or even slow down the diseases that cause dementia, government must increase research to find new treatments.",
        "background": "Alzheimer's Research UK calls on the government to put 1% of the total annual cost of dementia towards dementia research each year to urgently find an effective treatment.  Dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK and without an effective treatment death rates will continue to rise.",

            "details": "Dementia remains a key priority for the Government. The UK research community is playing a significant role in the global effort to find a cure or major disease-modifying treatment by 2025.\r\n\r\nIn the Challenge on Dementia 2020, published in 2015, the Government committed to double spending on research in dementia by 2020. This is equivalent to around \u00a360m per annum and we have met and exceeded this to date. Much of the investment is for research to better understand the nature of dementia, to inform development of future treatments and find ways to prevent the onset of the condition. \r\n\r\nWe are currently undertaking a Review of the Challenge on Dementia 2020 implementation plan which has been informed by a call for evidence which also asked stakeholder to consider what any potential next stage of the Challenge beyond 2020 should comprise.  We are considering all evidence submitted by stakeholders and other relevant evidence such as this petition in our Review of the Challenge on Dementia 2020. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Challenge on Dementia 2020 committed to making dementia research a career opportunity of choice, with the UK being the best place to conduct dementia research. The Government has committed to invest \u00a3190m in the ground-breaking UK Dementia Research Institute (UKDRI) which will position the UK as a world leader in research in the biomedical causes of dementia as well as finding the best ways to improve care. In addition, the charities Alzheimer\u2019s Society and Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK have each pledged an additional \u00a350m bringing total funding to \u00a3290 for the UKDRI.\r\n\r\nWe have invested \u00a353 million in the Dementias Platform UK, a public-private partnership led by the Medical Research Council bringing together researchers from universities and industry to accelerate progress in dementia research in early detection, improved treatment and ultimately prevention.\r\n\r\nWe have invested over \u00a340 million in the NIHR Dementias Translational Research Collaboration, which pulls discoveries from basic science into benefits for patients, offering partners in the life science industries a single point of access to research infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care co-founded the international Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF), contributing an initial \u00a315 million. The DDF is the largest venture fund in the world focussed on a single disease area looking at discovering and developing novel pre-clinical therapies for dementia. \r\n\r\nIn June 2018 the DDF met its goal of raising a total of \u00a3250 million from a group of strategic investors committed to developing new medicines for dementia.\r\n\r\nThe Government has committed \u00a398 million to a \u2018Healthy Ageing\u2019 challenge through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. \u00a3210 million has been made available for early diagnosis and \u00a340 million for further research into dementia. This is in addition to the \u00a3300 million already pledged to dementia research by 2025.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",
