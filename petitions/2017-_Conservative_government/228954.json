        "action": "Increase funding for dementia research to find effective treatments.",
        "additional_details": "Dementia research and treatment lags far behind other major disease areas, like cancer.  In 2016-2017, the Government committed \u00a383.1 million of public money to dementia research.  In contrast cancer research received \u00a3269m in 2015-2016.  This inequity in research funding has resulted in slower progress in our ability to treat dementia than we\u2019ve seen in other conditions.  With no way to prevent, cure or even slow down the diseases that cause dementia, government must increase research to find new treatments.",
        "background": "Alzheimer's Research UK calls on the government to put 1% of the total annual cost of dementia towards dementia research each year to urgently find an effective treatment.  Dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK and without an effective treatment death rates will continue to rise.",
