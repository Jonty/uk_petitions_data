        "additional_details": "As an example, take a woman born in 1953. She leaves school in 1970 and starts work full-time expecting to reach SAP in 2013 and retiring. By 2005 she has completed 35 years of work and is eligible for full State Pension. In 2011 she is told she has to work until the age of 66. By 2013 she has paid a total of 43 years of National Insurance contributions. Now she has to work a further 6 years and continue supporting a system that,by now, she thought would be supporting her.",
        "background": "Women born in the 1950's have been grievously impacted by the change in SPA and have to continue working. Many of these women have earned the full state pension entitlement by making 35+ years of National Insurance contributions. Such women should be exempt from making further NI contributions.",
