        "additional_details": "This petition has nothing to do with fines for overstaying or not purchasing a ticket - this is for genuine mistakes.\r\n\r\nTypically people have a single character wrong on their ticket - and still appeals side with the car park owners.\r\n\r\nTo anyone else - it would be clear that the driver had made a genuine mistake, and paid the correct amount for the time allocated.\r\n\r\nThis money making on genuine mistakes should be stopped.\r\n\r\nA typing error should not cost someone \u00a360+",
        "background": "Honest people who have purchased valid parking tickets are being fined because of genuine mistakes - such as accidentally mistyping number plates in car parks that use number plate recognition. \r\n\r\nThe British Parking Association know this - but their appeal system but offers no help.",
