        "additional_details": "There are also concerns around the security of data, particularly as NHS was victim to ransomware earlier this year. Cyber attacks usually come from countries with anti-gay laws, this information could potentially be dangerous in the wrong hands.\r\n\r\nMany teenagers will be questioning their sexuality, by making them make a choice (that is logged) they may feel forced down a particular path.\r\n\r\nThis is an intrusive question that is unnecessary.",
        "background": "From 2019 the NHS will ask patients, aged 16 and over, what their sexual orientation is. This will be logged on personal records, a refusal to answer will also be logged.\r\nThis information is not required for medical treatment. The state is forcing people to come out and to make a recorded choice.",
