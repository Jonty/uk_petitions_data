        "additional_details": "Those who don't fully comply with a request in 1 calendar month must be fined. The impact on those who suffer failure, abuse and hostility is worse if they can't access all their records to pursue a complaint. It affects the most vulnerable, those on low incomes who may not be able to access public services e.g. housing, disabled facilities, innocent children forced out of school, school bullying covered up that may lead to children self-harming or children/individuals targeted by authorities.",
        "background": "Data laws are being used to cover up & block complaints. Organisations and public bodies should have to prove in court that a request is vexatious before they can refuse to give information. The ICO should be given the funds and powers to fully investigate non-compliance with the law.",
