        "additional_details": "If everyone workplace had a Menstruation Station (tampons and pads) for their female workers to take when needed, this would help reduce the discomfort and humiliation, and would also increase work productively, as the effects of having no products can cause women to slow down to compensate the discomfort. Workplaces should encourage their female workers to donate to the Station when they have spare products, but when the Station starts to run out, it should be up to the company to restock it.",
        "background": "Many women often come on their period and do not have sanitary products to use. Whether this is because of their financial situation, general forgetfulness, or because they were unable to get to the shop. When working without products, women can feel extreme discomfort, odour and can develop rashes.",
