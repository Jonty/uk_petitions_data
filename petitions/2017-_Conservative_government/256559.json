The lies that are told just to get elected and then please themselves must stop. It\u2019s time for change and as the referendum vote was a total uk result the general election should also be on how many votes in total over the uk not this old, outdated way which only conservative or labour can win power.",
        "background": "A general election is now required to give the people a chance to listen to the manifestos on the future of this country. 17.4 million people voted to leave the European Union and main party\u2019s a year later said they would honour that result. Both have failed miserably. The people must now decide.",
