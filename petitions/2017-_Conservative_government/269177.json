        "additional_details": "Children's cancers, e.g. DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), are fatal on diagnosis. Others have few options upon relapse, e.g. neuroblastoma. \r\n\r\nGovernment funding through NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) is not transparent about spending on adult and child cancers.\r\n\r\nCampaigns e.g. CCAM (Childhood Cancer Awareness month (September); Sarcoma Awareness week (early July) and DIPG Awareness Day (17 May).\r\n\r\nAs a result, our children and grandchildren will keep suffering and dying.",
        "background": "12 UK kids a day will be diagnosed with cancer; 1 in 5 will die within 5 years. There is little or no funding of research into some kids cancers & the Government fails to prioritise or ringfence funds for kids cancer research. Nor does it fully support awareness campaigns about kids cancers.",
