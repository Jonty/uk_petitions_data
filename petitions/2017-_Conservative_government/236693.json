        "action": "Change legislation so G.P.s can prescribe medical marijuana for fibromyalgia.",
        "additional_details": "A new study out of the Netherlands in December 2018 found that standardised pharmaceutical-grade cannabis with a  tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content was effective in treating the musculoskeletal pain caused by fibromyalgia.\r\nUK Fibromyalgia asks the government to relax the current legislation to allow general practitioners to be able to prescribe medical marijuana to sufferers of fibromyalgia and for all other patients with similar chronic pain conditions.",
        "background": "In the UK we are in the position where medical marijuana has now been legalised but can only be prescribed through hospital consultants and for specific medical ailments, which currently excludes fibromyalgia. UK Fibromyalgia feels now is the time for a change in the law.",
