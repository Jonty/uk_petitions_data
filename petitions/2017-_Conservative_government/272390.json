        "additional_details": "Parliament have used every tool they can to stop Brexit. They say people didn't vote for a no deal. Lots of people just want out of the European Union whether we get a good deal or no deal we just want out. The Country had its say. Parliament should respect that and let Boris get on with it without interfering. A no deal scenario is important to keep as a negotiating tool.",
        "background": "Parliament say the public did not know what they were voting for in the 2016 referendum. They did. We want Brexit to happen deal or no deal. No deal should not be taken off the table. The Prime Minister should be able to use every tool in his arsenal to get a better deal or leave with no deal.",
