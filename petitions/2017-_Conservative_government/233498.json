Enough is enough, its a distressing time anyway if you have to ring that number -don't make it any worse and literally effects metal health and sends people mad.",

Change the waiting music on Universal Credit/Jobseeker phone line to i.e \"Bob Marley- don't worry about a thing\" and vary it. It is literally 'Sound Torture' and torture is illegal. It's time to change the tune.",
