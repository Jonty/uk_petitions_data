        "additional_details": "\u00a3168 per week paid from 60 instead of 66 equates to \u00a352,416 most of us could do with that kind of money because it's over \u00a38k per year.  Most people will pay national insurance their entire working lives (40+ years) and we pay roughly \u00a330 per week for our pensions. This equates then to \u00a362400 for our working lives. Not to mention the amount of taxes we pay that don't contribute to National Insurance but to other funds. We have paid for our pensions and the Govt wants it for themselves",
        "background": "The Government wants to give us less money after paying into our pensions. If we retire at 66 or later we will only have a tiny pension compared to the amount we paid in. They are profiting from people dying and banking on it so they don't have to worry about paying us a decent pension.",
