        "action": "Require 70% of National Park members be directly elected, 30% being appointees.",
        "additional_details": "Members of the National Parks Authorities are each appointed by one of 3 routes: by the SoS; by local authorities overlapping a Park; by amalgams of Park Parishes.  Much as the power devolved to a Park is supposedly limited to Planning and environmental protection, by the control of funds and staff, the Authorities have more all-pervasive impacts on the lives of residents of the Parks than their local authorities that tax them.  The proposed 30%, SoS appointees represent special-interests.",
        "background": "Residents of Parks have no vote on the policies and expenditure that affect much of their daily lives and yet they are taxpayers.  All present members are appointees who have no manifesto and no mandate; further, many appear as sinecures given to loyal foot-soldiers across the political spectrum.",
