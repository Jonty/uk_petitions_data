        "additional_details": "Sepsis kills more than 44,000 people a year in the UK alone. This is more than breast, bowel and prostate cancer combined.\r\n\r\nDespite these alarming statistics many don\u2019t know about the implications and seriousness of the infection, which leads to an increase in blood pressure and multiple organ failure.\r\n\r\nThe amount of people with sepsis has increased by over a third from 2015 to 2017, showing this is an ever increasing problem which needs to be addressed as soon as possible.",
        "background": "The recent surge of sepsis related deaths in the UK, including of my own grandmother, needs to be addressed before more people are lost unnecessarily to the infection. \r\n\r\nMany are dying from sepsis but of these only around 40% of death certificates state sepsis as cause of death.",
