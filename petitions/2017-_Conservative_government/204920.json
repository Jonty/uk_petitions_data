        "additional_details": "Something needs to be done to change the design of this road. It is a danger to the public. Why is there a dual carriageway all along the A34, yet when you arrive to Melrose Way, it is nothing short of a single lane motorway - expect there is nothing to separate cars travelling in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nLet's start something positive, and get this road made safer through having a central barrier.\r\n\r\nPlease sign and share your support.",
        "background": "Melrose Way in Alderley Edge is a new road that has seen many casualties, resulting in numerous fatalities. \r\nThis road has a 60mph speed limit, with one lane in either direction, no central barrier, or anything to separate both lanes.",
