        "additional_details": "By adding cats to the list it could lead to fewer cats dying from road traffic accidents as they could receive veterinary care before it's too late. \r\n\r\nOwners also deserve to know if their feline friend has been caught up in something and is injured, or worst case scenario has passed away. \r\n\r\nPLEASE sign this petition. Even if you don't love Cats, someone will... a family member, friend, neighbour, significant other\r\n\r\nIt's time people understand cats are as important as dogs and deserve more",
        "background": "Currently it is not the law to report if a cat is involved in a car accident even though they are loving pets to many people just as dogs are. \r\nCats are somewhat more likely to be involved in a traffic accident so why do you not have to report them!",
