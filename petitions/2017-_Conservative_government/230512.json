        "additional_details": "These limits and restrictions are known as gubbing. This is when a bookmaker limits a customer to small stakes (often pennies) and bans customers from promotions or closes accounts. No explanation is given for this. They just say it is a trading decision. I believe it should be a condition of being granted a licence that all bookmakers accept bets with a liability of up to \u00a31,000.",
        "background": "Bookmakers are limiting online customers to stakes of under \u00a35 and often less than \u00a31. They are also banning people from promotional offers. If a bookmaker won't accept a bet of \u00a320 or a liability of \u00a31,000 they should not be given a licence.",
