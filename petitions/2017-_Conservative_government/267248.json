        "background": "After talking to several letting companies it\u2019s been stated that \u201cpet fees\u201d are another way of gaining money off tenants, now letting fees are scraped. Excessive noise complaints and damages are covered in contracts and deposits so these large fees are grossly unnecessary and are penalizing renters.",
