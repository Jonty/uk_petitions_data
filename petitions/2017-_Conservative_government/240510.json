        "action": "Change the age of voting in elections and referendums to 16.",
        "additional_details": "The law allows so much freedom and choice to sixteen year olds. They can get married, join the army, have sexual intercourse, invest in the stock market and pay tax. If they can do all of these, why are they still denied the right to vote? Other countries have set the voting age to sixteen for national or regional elections and referendums, including Australia, Brazil and even Scotland. Voting will give them the encouragement to become more aware and active in the future of our lives.",
        "background": "We believe young people deserve more political presence. By allowing sixteen and seventeen year olds to vote, they will have the ability to become increasingly involved in political dialogue and educate themselves about the issues and possible solutions for our country.",
