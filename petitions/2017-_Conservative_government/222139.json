        "additional_details": "I'm a care worker who has worked in different services and supported people with many conditions, lifestyle and backgrounds; who has observed the national health and care crisis and increase in mental health in the the general population, leading to breakdown support networks for many people.\r\nBeing a firm believer that all people on Earth are responsible for each other, I urge Parliament to change the law and make it illegal to make a profit out of the lives of vulnerable individuals.",
        "background": "The way we treat our elder reflects the way that we as a society, are evolving. I have grown to experience the care sector in England in such a way that it is my firm belief that care services should only be run as community services funded by the people for the people.",
