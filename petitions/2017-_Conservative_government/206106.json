There are other places to build than on the Green Belt - keep it untouched for the generations to follow.",
        "background": "We call upon Parliament to fully support measures to stop development on green belt land and to prevent de-designation of green belt land, to halt the coalescence of villages such as Kings Langley into neighbouring towns thus permanently losing their character.",
