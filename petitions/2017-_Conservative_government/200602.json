        "additional_details": "There has been and continues to be multiple media reports on this subject year in and year out.... The current centre reservation crash barrier design (safety fence) is not working and many lives are being lost as a result of this failure. I am one of many former police officers and current police officers who are alarmed and the inadequacy of the current design. Time to act now and protect people from this in my opinion far too often preventable carnage.",
        "background": "Having served as a Motorway Patrol Police Officer with the Central Motorway Police Group from 1993 to 2001 I attended the scene of many Motorway Cross-Over Road Traffic Collisions resulting in multiple loss of life. The current design it breached too easily and is not fit for purpose. Change them.",
