        "additional_details": "The reality is that a major percent of the homeless population will just keep reoffending as prison provides them with a home and a safe place to live unlike the streets.  More then 79% of inmates that reported being homeless before prison were reconvicted within their 1st year of release. If the government funded more and the prisons provided more support offenders would not be made homeless and be forced to reoffend increasing the prison population and the reoffending rates.",
        "background": "More funding and support towards offenders and the homeless will reduce the rate in reoffending. Ministry of justice figures show that 60% of inmates suggested that having a place to live on release would stop them reoffending. This would also mean less people on the streets sleeping rough.",
