        "additional_details": "Many of the properties, 3 bed family homes with average sized families, have been extended so there are 8-10 students in some. They require extra refuse bins, extra demand on health services and extra policing. Landlords are earning a minimum of \u00a3120 per room per week so can afford and should be paying for the extra services the student population uses. The extra revenue would help to pay for local health and social care costs.",
        "background": "In the last 10 years, as the uni near my home has grown, landlords have bought and extended many properties in the area and let them to students, who all use the services provided by the council.   No one is paying for their  use of local council services eg rubbish collection.",
