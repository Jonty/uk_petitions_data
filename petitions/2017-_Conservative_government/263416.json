No child should be deterred from their right to British citizenship simply because of the cost. \r\n\r\nWithout citizenship they lose their entitlement to a student loan, are subject to foreign student university fees and are denied the ability to travel and work freely in later life.\r\n\r\nCall on the government to end the practice of profiteering from citizenship applications and waive the cost of citizenship for all children.",

These  charges are forcing parents into debt because without citizenship,  their children's access to education, travel and work is greatly restricted.",
