        "action": "Amend PIP rules so that mentally disabled adults can get a Blue Parking Badge.",
        "additional_details": "My learning disabled daughter Emily can physically walk but this doesn't mean she can always do so safely. My mum had dementia, she was able to walk but unable to appreciate the dangers around her. A Blue Badge is a passport to understanding and to life. To refuse to allocate a blue badge, unless a person's ability to walk is affected, is morally and factually wrong.This needs to be addressed and urgently amended, so that all disabled people are treated equally by the authorities and by society.",
        "background": "Currently rules on Personal Independence Payments mean that mobility points, which allow people to access a Blue Badge for disability parking, are allocated on physical capacity to walk, only, not a mental impairment. This is demonstrably unrealistic and impacts people with disabilities and carers",
