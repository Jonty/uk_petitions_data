        "additional_details": "It has been argued that the mine will bring much needed jobs to the area. However, with the correct intervention and investment, the UK parliament could instead focus the skills of the proposed jobs on sustainable/renewable energy industries.",
        "background": "A new coal mine was approved in Cumbria earlier this year. However, the govt has committed to reduce carbon emissions from the UK to much lower levels in the fight against global warming. The creation of a new coal mine is contradictory to this goal and should not be allowed to proceed.",
