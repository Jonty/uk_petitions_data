        "action": "Ensure public RBS shares are only sold if they at least cover cost of bailout.",
        "additional_details": "At a time in which our government is cutting public services couldn't these profits be used to fund our ailing health, defence and welfare services? Should the government sell these shares, it would be actively taking steps to harm the UK economy and leave the Taxpayer with a \u00a326bn hole in their pockets. Regardless of political affiliation and beliefs on privatisation, we should hope that any government has the sense to only sell shares at a rate which at the least covers the initial cost, if not turns a profit.",
        "background": "The chancellor and conservative party have said they are looking to sell the publicly owned RBS shares at a loss of \u00a326bn to the taxpayer. This year RBS recorded a profit of \u00a3939mil. This would also allow the bank to move its headquarters offshore following brexit.",
