        "additional_details": "November 5th can turn out to be a weekend celebration. This is fine when at organised displays as they have a specific times to start and finish. The fact that any general public over 18 can buy fireworks and let them off anywhere they choose,causes problems. In the evenings fireworks are being let off,from when the light fades right up to and sometimes past 11pm.Organised displays will help pets and their owners, those with PTSD and nervous children cope at this time of year. They will have a choice in taking part or not. It will take away the worry and bring communities together. Sign this petition to help get the law changed on firework sales.",
        "background": "I am no killjoy and I love fireworks as much as most people, BUT pets, animals and war veterans aren't always so keen. My own dog is scared stiff of them! Ive seen \"Fireworks for sale\" on almost every street and whilst this in itself isn't an issue, it's who buys them and what for, that is.",
