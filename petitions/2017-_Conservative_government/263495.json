        "additional_details": "Here are some qualities of US produce that could haunt our supermarket aisles which are more harmful to us and animals than UK and EU produce: \r\n- US seafood is tested for 16 drugs rather than the EU, who check 50.\r\n- Genetically Engineered crops are widely grown in the US but in the EU there are only 2.\r\n- The US does not label Genetically Engineered crops.\r\n- The US uses Gestation Crates, Antiseptic Washes, rBGH, Atrazine and Neonicotinoids and Hormone injected beef which are all banned in the EU.",
        "background": "Even though we have decided to leave the EU, EU produce is proven better quality than the USA\u2019s.\r\nRecently Donald Trump visited the UK although many marches and petitions against it. While with the current PM talks of trade deals with the USA were held for post Brexit UK. We want EU deals not USA\u2019s.",
