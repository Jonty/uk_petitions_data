Not only do we have a reduction in benefit (due to my student loan) but feel I have been penalised for going in higher education.  Please help me get this debated in parliament because as parents/students/families, we are being shortchanged by the introduction of Universal Credit, a system which was originally set up to make people 'better off'. \r\nThank you",
