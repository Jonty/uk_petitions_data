Without inhalers control is lost and putting any asthma sufferer in danger of having an asthma attack. \r\n\r\nYet the medication used to prevent these attacks we have to pay for. \r\n\r\nThere are numerous proceedures/medication free on the NHS and not all are for life or death situations.",
        "background": "I was diagnosed with asthma at the age of 7. My inhalers were free due to my age however as soon as I turned 18 I had to pay for them. I am now 27 and continue to still buy inhalers. My asthma is pretty controlled however not everyone's is.",
