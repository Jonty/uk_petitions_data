        "action": "Require shops to make all aisles wide enough for wheelchairs, scooters and prams",
        "additional_details": "Small aisle space can be perceived as being off-putting, embarrassing and offensive for those who are unable to move through the space with ease. This not only can have a negative impact on a personal level, but also on the store itself as some may be put off from shopping there again. We do not tend to have this issue with supermarkets due to their traditional layout of wide aisles. This petition hopes to raise awareness, whilst asking for policy to be introduced to tackle the problem.",
        "background": "Stores are packed with as many goods as possible, regardless of the store size. Unfortunately, this means the aisle space between goods can be very small. For those in wheelchairs, using scooters, or pushing a pram, this proves to be a real problem. This is an example of indirect discrimination.",
