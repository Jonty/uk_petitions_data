        "action": "Allow Lauren Southern, Brittany Pettibone and Martin Sellner to enter the UK.",
        "additional_details": "These three are conservative reporters and speakers who have broken no laws. Lauren Southern was held under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act. She is clearly not a terrorist. \r\nTo arrest, detain and deny them entry is an affront to freedom of speech and thought, and an abuse of power and law by the authorities responsible. If they are on a travel blacklist for having conservative opinions they should be removed immediately.",
        "background": "Canadian reporter Lauren Southern was denied entry to the UK at Calais on 11th March 2018.\r\nAmerican journalist Brittany Pettibone and Austrian activist Martin Sellner were detained at Luton on 8th March 2018, held for 3 days and deported.\r\nThey are not a threat to the UK and should be allowed in.",
