        "additional_details": "If parliamentarians believe in democracy and trust democracy. Put their positions of power and influence back to the people. Another referendum will not change the arithmetic. The only way to settle this fairly is by truly going for a peoples vote. One that can change the arithmetic in the house of commons. If parliamentarians believe they are doing an honest job, they will support this, by putting their job on the line.",
        "background": "The current arithmetic in the UK house of commons is not representative of the UK electorate. Democracy in the UK is being damaged. With immediate effect the current parliament is to be dissolved and a full UK general election is to be called. This is the only way to settle the 2016 EU referendum.",
