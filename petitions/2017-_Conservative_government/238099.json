Victims now wish to be able to report this abuse to Police, to be believed and to be taken seriously. Where possible, prosecution should take place.\r\n \r\nLet us allow victims a voice, give justice a chance by investigating historic domestic abuse, preventing abusers from reoffending therefore saving innocent victims from future abuse.",
