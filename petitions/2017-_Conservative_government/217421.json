        "additional_details": "In reality these lanes create long tailbacks as faster/unladen HGV\u2019s have to queue behind other slower/laden vehicles uphill with reduced speeds of sometimes 25-30mph. When the restriction ends all the faster HGV\u2019s accerlerate pull out into lane 2 to overtake. These lanes are a complete false economy and are dangerous.",
        "background": "These stretches of the M11 and A14 where overtaking for HGV\u2019s is prohibited are completely counter productive. They serve to prevent HGV\u2019s overtaking for long periods and inconveniencing other road users.",
