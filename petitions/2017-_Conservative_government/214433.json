        "additional_details": "Companies and government organisations should be concerned with finding the best, regardless of non-relevant issues such as a persons sexuality. Employers should be blind when it comes to who gets through to assessment centres and interviews. It\u2019s not fair that suddenly every white male is considered as having being born with a silver spoon. It\u2019s also not fair to treat minorities and women as though they need an advantage in the recruitment process as they couldn\u2019t get the job on their merit",
        "background": "Positive action is unfair. For example, a wealthy female will have an advantage over a less affluent male when it comes to recruitment. No organisation should ask for race, religion, gender or sexuality. This is not relevant to the job and results in less effective recruitment UK wide.",
