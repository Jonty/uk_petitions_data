        "action": "Relocate UK parliament and government departments somewhere outside London.",
        "additional_details": "Today, Westminster Palace is a far from suitable place from where to run government and, overall, London is over-crowded, costly and detached from much of the country. Considering these points, I propose constructing a modern government campus, in a more central location, with good London transport links, perhaps, somewhere around where the M1 and west-coast main lines converge, in Northamptonshire.\r\nThe campus should include a station and accommodation for MPs staying away from home.",
        "background": "The Palace of Westminster is in poor condition, requiring \u00a34B of refurbishment work, at state expense. It's, also, regularly argued that government is too London-centric.\r\nIt's time to relocate government to a new common site, outside London, and use Westminster Palace as a commercial asset.",
