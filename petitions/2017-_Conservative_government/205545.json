        "action": "Keep the laws to recognise animal sentience",
        "additional_details": "The EU Withdrawal Bill has left out this important protection. It is completely absent and there is also no such definition or recognition in the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Animals welfare is at risk. \r\n\r\nOnce the UK leaves the EU, animals will be unprotected. We must demand that the government keep the laws to recognise animals sentience, as recognised by the EU. \r\n\r\nThis will be a disaster for animal welfare and we cannot let this happen. Please sign this petition. Help us make this happen.",
        "background": "Animals are recognised as sentient beings under current European Law. This acknowledges their ability to feel pain, suffer but also experience joy. Full regard must be given to their welfare at all times, but particularly when creating new legislation or regulations.",
