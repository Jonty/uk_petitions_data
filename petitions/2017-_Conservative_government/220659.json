        "additional_details": "It is important for children to learn about animals but if the way they are taught harms animals then something has gone  very wrong after the project has finished a high amount of the chicks are killed/ disposed of at poultry markets or fed to reptiles the lesson this kind of project teaches children is neither educational or compassionate since they often cause animals to suffer and treat living beings as disposable comodities the next generation deserve better than these misguided lessons",
        "background": "In these projects lots of the chicks become sick/deformed because their needs are not met during incubation or after hatching Their organs can stick to the sides of shells because the eggs are often not rotated properly Once over most of the chicks mainly males end up back in factory farming system",
