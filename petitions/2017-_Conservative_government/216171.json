        "additional_details": "We are people who are being let down by our government. Our children are not safe on this land. Men day in day out that have a clear sexual desire towards children are being let free from court on a daily basis with nothing but a slap on the wrist, which is no justice to a victim that has to cope with it for the rest of their lives. The only way is to give them a sentence that justifies the crime.",
        "background": "Any man or woman that is sexually attracted to kids and decides to act upon that should no longer be allowed to enjoy the gift of life, these evil people cause life long problems to the innocent children that have been abused. The sentences given to pedophiles at the minute is an atrocity.",
