        "action": "Let's have a y/n referendum on whether the UK should have a 2nd EU referendum",
        "additional_details": "The main concern at the moment is the frustration, the rising anger and the divisions in a society which feels caught in a civil war. It's very damaging to the people of this country. \r\nI think a referendum on whether to have a referendum would calm down minds. \r\nWere the \"yes\" to win, It would not feel so insulting to Leavers who would have to acknowledge that a majority of the country wishes for a new referendum. I see this as the only democratic way out of this terribly divisive conundrum.",
        "background": "The UK is divided on Brexit. Asking for another referendum would rightly anger and entrench the side that won in June 2016.\r\nYet if a majority voted to have a 2nd referendum, it would give a national mandate to a coalition to organise a new referendum on the nature of the UK's membership of the EU.",
