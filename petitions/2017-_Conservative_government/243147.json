        "action": "Make it a criminal offence for authorities to detain innocent students at school",
        "additional_details": "Of serious concern is the impact on innocent children, as the government allow this to occur without research into the effects on the students in the short/long term incl. damage to a victim's psyche & emotional well-being. This is abuse of power. Innocent children are forced to be victims. Students should not be detained in isolation, parents must be informed of any problems immediately and students must have the right to see or speak to their parents if they or their parents wish it. There is a case for this both legally & morally.",
        "background": "Too many innocent students are targeted on school premises and detained in isolation and questioned without any wrong doing by them & denied the right to their parents.",
