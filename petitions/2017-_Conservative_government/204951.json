        "additional_details": "Backround:\r\nThe reason for this petition is that my child has multiple mental illnesses and has been hospitalised as a result of this 5 times in 2017, when at the emergency department a lot of the staff was unsure what to do, they just sent the child up to the paediatric ward to be in overnight until CAMHS would arrive. However in all instances the staff was unsure what to do.",
        "background": "The issue is that the paediatric medical staff (NHS) doesn't know how to deal with mental health at all when a child is admitted to the ward for observation, with mental health training the staff  would be able to provide a better duty of care. (See additional details for a personal story)",
