        "additional_details": "The public consultation of 2016 was undebated, poorly advertised, designed simply to yield support for the plan and supported by analysis containing egregious errors.\r\nThe council decision showed a lack of unanimity for the abolision of a centuries-old borough. It was was not supported by any opposition councillors while the ruling group worked unreasonably to prevent any dissent within its own ranks.\r\nThe financial reasons used to justify the merger are erroneous and grossly misleading.",
        "background": "We object to the proposed Future Dorset merger of Poole with adjacent councils. The public consultation was entirely flawed and Poole council's vote approving the merger was too narrowly based for such a sudden, profound and unnecessary reform. The residents of Poole do not want this merger.",
