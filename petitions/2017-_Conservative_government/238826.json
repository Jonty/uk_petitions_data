Not only does it carry an enormous risk of the mother dying but it also carries risk of the baby dying or being born with a disabilty/birth defect. Young girls and boys alike should be educated of this before having unsafe sex. My aim is to educate adolosecent minds from year 7 what dangers teen pregnancies have and how they affect everyone. With just your signature, we can help tackle this problem.",
        "background": "In our day of age, many young girls as young as 13-17 are getting pregant without any knowledge of teen pregnancies. Many of these young women proceed with the pregnancy as they do not know the risks it has.",
