        "additional_details": "I have been fighting this on my own for nearly a year. I have been brushed off by student finance and have been in conversation with the relevant MPs and still have no answer as to why this is happening. \r\nSam Gyimah MP Minister of State for universities told me to apply for a special long course loan, however student finance have said I am not eligible as I receive the bursary. \r\nTogether we can overturn this and get a fair student loan for final year student nurses on the bursary!",
