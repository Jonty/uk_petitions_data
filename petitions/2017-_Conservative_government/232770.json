        "additional_details": "A petition is arguably the modern version of the pitchfork-wielding mob; it's very easy for individuals or groups to whip up strong feelings. Those opposing the motion feel disenfranchised - there is no *simple* and *immediate* way to register their opposition; they can only set up a counter-petition, which is liable to be rejected, or at least involves a delay, thus giving unfair advantage to the first petition.",
        "background": "Frequently, petitions and similar are reported as having collected so many thousand votes. This only represents one side: without knowing how strong the opposing feeling is, the true public opinion can be misreported - and, decision-makers can be pushed into actions the majority don't actually want.",
