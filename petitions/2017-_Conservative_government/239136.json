        "additional_details": "When parents ask about student\u2019s grades they\u2019re always confused and ask for the ABCD equivalent anyway. Why do we have to translate our own grades? If we say we\u2019ve got a grade 7, for example, the response is always \u201cIs that good?\u201d There has been far too much pressure and stress put on students and teachers over these past couple of years and the changing of the grading system is useless! What\u2019s the point in having 9-1 when we are always going to ask what the ABCD equivalent is anyway?",
        "background": "With the changing of the grading systems it has caused a lot of confusion in the education department. We, as students, often ask our teachers to explain the system. Some teachers can\u2019t explain because they have no idea why the grading system changed in the first place and they don\u2019t understand it.",
