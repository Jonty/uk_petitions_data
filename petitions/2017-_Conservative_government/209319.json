        "additional_details": "4 out of 5 rabbits bought as pets near Easter are abandoned or die within a year. (source: The Metro). Rabbits are the most abused domestic pet in England and Wales, with 35,000 abandoned every year. Also 70% of rescued rabbits had been kept hutched 24 hours a day. The RSPCA states that people bought rabbits but then quickly lost interest. On avg, the rabbits it came across had been dumped after just three months. (souce: RSPCA) If they are not in shops, they will not be impulse buys.",
        "background": "Rabbits are the 3rd most popular pet in the UK, yet the most neglected and abandoned. Pet shops and garden centres do not properly educate people on the appropriate care of rabbits and sell them as cheap, easy short-lived pets who live in small cages, which is very incorrect. Rabbits deserve better.",
