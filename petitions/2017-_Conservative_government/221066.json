        "additional_details": "The very basis of the interview process is ableist. The process of answering a series of structured questions, whilst passing a 'neurotypical' is extremely frustrating, overwhelming and often impossible for many mentally disabled people, especially people with Autism and ADHD who often have trouble recalling information and processing such formal answers. Interview culture may as well be a giant fence around employment, reading 'Autistics Keep Out'.",
        "background": "A high number of people with ADHD/Autism are unemployed or have trouble holding work due to measures put in place to prevent them being hired. I propose, instead of interviews, more assessment or trials days are encouraged, where a candidate would have a higher chances to showcase their skills.",
