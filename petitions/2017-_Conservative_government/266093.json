In particular, we're not sure how you want the law to restrict the carbon footprint of individuals or how this would be measured or enforced.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, a petition calling for restrictions on flights or fossil-fuel burning cars or measures to incentivise take up of renewable energy.\r\n\r\nThere are already lots of similar petitions, which you might like to sign and share if they call for something you want to happen. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition, for example:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/245708\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241100\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/240178\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/259383\r\n"
