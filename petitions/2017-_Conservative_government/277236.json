They should also act as a watchdog to the Commissioner/Standards Committee, ensuring incidents are reported, and publicly witnessed poor behaviour is not avoided from action.",

Publicly evidenced incidents that would result in members of the general public losing their jobs are not referred, and are ignored in MPs.",
