They should also act as a watchdog to the Commissioner/Standards Committee, ensuring incidents are reported, and publicly witnessed poor behaviour is not avoided from action.",
        "background": "The behaviour of some MPs is a disgrace. The current process with the Commissioner and Standards Committee is ineffective, with few incidents referred. Publicly evidenced incidents that would result in members of the general public losing their jobs are not referred, and are ignored in MPs.",
