        "additional_details": "There should be stricter rules in place for the marketing of alcohol in shops. Thousands die from alcohol-related diseases every year. The cost and burden it places on the NHS is huge. It is the second biggest preventable killer behind smoking. The negative impact of alcohol is worse than smoking because it takes away a persons dignity, self esteem and ruins the lives of family and loved ones. Banning advertising of cigarettes has reduced smoking-related illness. Alcohol should be no different.",
        "background": "The Tesco 'Drinks Festival' promotion. An aisle at the front of the store displaying alcoholic beverages with many large signs. This encourages people to consume more alcohol. It targets vulnerable & disadvantaged people in society because it's cheap. People are forced to see it doing their shop.",
