        "additional_details": "The UK voted to LEAVE the EU.  SNP and Lib Dems both stated will do everything to stop BREXIT.  Therefore not listening to the people who voted.  The county voted to leave.  Now time for MPs to allow this to happen.  Even with the bill to stop NO DEAL.  The EU could refuse the extension and say no, you leave with NO DEAL on 31 October.  So MPs are just wasting time which could be spent dealing with policing, schools and health.",
        "background": "The MPs need to stop putting their own agenda before what the public voted for.  To LEAVE the EU.  Time MPs shut up, put their own position on the line and let people decide if they want their MP representing them.  Any MP or party that goes against what the people voted is unfit to hold position.",
