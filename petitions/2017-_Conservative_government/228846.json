        "action": "Grant student mothers the same protections as working mothers",
        "additional_details": "Education institutions are required under employment law to make maternity provisions for working mothers, yet there is no legal requirement ensuring that the same rights are extended to students who are mothers.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the Equality Act 2010, the rights of student mothers are primarily determined at their institution's discretion. Student mothers are easily marginalised and often squeezed out of the education system as a result. This must change.",
        "background": "Flexible working, maternity leave and nursing facilities are examples of protected provisions available to workers. Student mothers are just as vulnerable to maternity discrimination, yet these protections are seldom extended to them.This blind-spot has led to avoidable adversity and exclusion.",
