The possibility of a Border Poll is set out in the 1998 Belfast Agreement which was agreed between the UK and Irish Governments, and can only be changed by the agreement of both Governments.  \r\n\r\nYou could start a petition calling on the UK Government to negotiate with the Irish Government to remove provisions for a Border Poll from the Belfast Agreement, if that's what you'd like to see happen.
