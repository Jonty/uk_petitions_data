        "additional_details": "So let me get this straight, we can legally kill ourselves with backy/alcohol yet can\u2019t grow a plant that may have multiple medical benefits for personal use? I\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019m outraged by the Tories approach to cannabis and it\u2019s downright inhumane. If it helps someone, be it just clearing their mind or for a medical reason, they should have the right to grow it and use it in their own home. The current law is unjust! The UK is the largest exporter of cannabis-based medicines in the world. Hypocrisy",
        "background": "The war on drugs is failed, corrupt and generally just stupid, cannabis has been used by humans in written history since at least 3000 BC. Alcohol/tobacco cause millions of deaths and yet they are legal and we can\u2019t grow cannabis for ourselves? .cont below",
