        "action": "Abolish the Sugar Tax",
        "additional_details": "The sugar tax has encouraged drinks manufacturers to change the taste of their once beautiful drinks which the public loved deeply into a dangerous mixture of chemicals, mostly including Artificial Sweeteners. It is NOT the governments job to control what it's citizens eat and drink. This tax is another attempt to cut into the pockets of the poorest citizens and will in no way curb obesity or reduce the sales of sugary drinks. It needs to be abolished.",
        "background": "On the 6th of April 2018, a sugar tax was introduced in the UK. I am calling for the Sugar Tax to be abolished. Drinks manufacturers are now scrambling to change recipes by including artificial sweeteners, which are making a vast amount of people ill. These sweeteners are more dangerous than sugar.",
