        "additional_details": "The idea is either to provide residents with a third non recyclable plastics bin or follow in the footsteps of M&S and drastically increase the number of places people can go to deposit these forms of plastics.\r\n\r\nAlthough we can\u2019t currently do anything with these plastics, stopping them reaching the oceans and landfill is at least a step forward towards the solution.",
        "background": "As we know our oceans are being destroyed every day as more wildlife is discovered with an abundance of plastics within its stomach. \r\n\r\nWe may not be able to recycle all forms of plastic but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t control its journey on our planet and improve how we collect it.",
