        "additional_details": "The Vagrancy Act 1824 represents everything wrong with how homeless and vulnerable people are treated in our society and is particularly inappropriate given the current homelessness crisis in our country which has seen homelessness increase by 70% in the years 2014-2018 with the number of homeless rising daily as the impact of austerity continues to be felt. \r\n\r\nBeing criminalised for having nowhere to live is unacceptable and arrests, prosecution, or threats of such, should never be seen as real solutions to resolve homelessness.",
        "background": "The vagrancy act 1824 makes it an offence to sleep rough or beg.\r\n\r\nIt is a barbaric, archaic law that criminalises the very existence of those homeless forced to take to the streets.",
