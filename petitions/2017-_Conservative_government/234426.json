        "additional_details": "A lion suffered incredible cruelty for at least 10 hours, severely wounded and slowly dying.\r\nClearly, although the wound was severe, the arrow had missed the vital organs or arteries that would have caused rapid blood loss and a relatively quick death.\r\nCertainly, the lion was so incapacitated that in all those hours he'd been able to move only 350 meters from the place where he was shot.\r\nJudging from the events described the injured lion most likely was killed 10/12 hours after being wounded.",

These creatures are being \u2018hunted\u2019 in \u2018the wild\u2019 for pleasure with considerable cruelty. The animals have no chance as the \u2018hunts\u2019 are set up by the land owners pruely for profit and the satisfaction of the most cruel.",
