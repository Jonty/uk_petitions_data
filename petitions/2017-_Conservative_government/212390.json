        "additional_details": "I have attached a YouTube documentary about life in prisons and the way people can smuggle drugs into prisons. It shows that there is corruption inside prisons as there isn't enough prison guards due to lack of Government funding;\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6IoZa19CEw\r\n\r\nI have also attached a news report about the state of prisons which cause people to commit suicide;\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-42737672",
        "background": "Throughout the UK over the last few years the increase of crime has put pressure onto prisons and the justice system. Therefore because there aren't enough spaces in prisons, criminals may get away with crimes they have committed. If more prisons are built, it will create more space for criminals.",
