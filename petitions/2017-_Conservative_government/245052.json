        "action": "Scrap immigration skills charge and immigration health surcharge for nurses",
        "additional_details": "First the student nursing bursary was scrapped dropping the number of home grown nurses & this hardline policy on immigration is not helping. If UK want to attract quality international nurses in the era of staff shortages the govt need to review its policy of charging immigration health surcharge and so called immigration skills charge.  I appeal to govt to abolish these for charges to attract quality overseas nurses to the UK.",
        "background": "UK is struggling to have of nurses and the government is having a policy which is driving away qualified overseas nurses to come to UK. Employers are being charged huge sum to sponsor nurses which leaves our NHS in total disarray. We demand scrapping of immigration skills charge and IHS.",
