        "action": "Smart Brexit:  Apply to rejoin EFTA",
        "additional_details": "The EFTA countries enjoy unparalleled access to EU goods and services markets. EFTA citizens enjoy free movement across EEA/EU states. EFTA States have 27 free trade agreements, covering 38 countries including Canada, and are close to signing an FTA with India. In addition, EFTA is outside the EU foreign, justice, agriculture and fisheries policies. Overall, reductions in net cost to the UK have been estimated at between 17% and 60% of current payments.",
        "background": "A 'hard Brexit' is a nightmare scenario for the UK, in which jobs and trade will suffer catastrophically. However, the U.K. can maintain free trade with the EU by applying to European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Council to rejoin EFTA and regain powers to write trade deals with non EU countries.",
