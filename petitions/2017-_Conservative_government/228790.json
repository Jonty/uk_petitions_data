        "action": "Make charging extortionate amounts for the equivalent gluten free items illegal",
        "additional_details": "A gluten free lifestyle can be tough enough without having to pay extortionate amounts for food and for small amounts. Its been difficult to switch to a gluten free diet not just physically and mentally but also financially. This should not be the case. \r\nSevere abdominal pain, fatigue, indigestion, bloating, vomiting and anaemia are just a few of the symptoms you can experience by eating gluten with such conditions like Celiac and IBS. Now, thousands of people are affected. We can help them.",
        "background": "Gluten free items are typically at least double or triple the cost of standard items which is essentially exploitation against those genetically susceptible and intolerant/reactive to gluten. Is this not indirect discrimination, treating this population differently? This has been so hard for me.",
