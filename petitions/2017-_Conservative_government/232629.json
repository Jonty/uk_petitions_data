        "additional_details": "My 81 year old father made an agreement with his neighbours in 2011 allowing them to park on the rear garden of his property. He was diagnosed with vascular dementia later that year. He told the rest of the family he was renting them the spaces, unfortunately after his death we discovered he had agreed to sell them. This agreement was made without a solicitor or any independent witnesses present.",
        "background": "There needs to be new legislation put into place covering diminished mental capacity in dementia sufferers. At present the system is inadequate. Trying to sort out the legal & financial implications of an agreement entered into pre-diagnosis has caused our family huge stress, and remains unresolved.",
