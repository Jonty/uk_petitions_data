        "additional_details": "Badgers are protected and so are the setts (burrows) they live in. Under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, in England and Wales. The badger cull does not have the support of scientists, the British Veterinary Association (BVA) or the public. There is no research basis to maintain or extend the cull. Badger culling at the licensed sites has produced no measurable change in bovine TB so far. Between 2012 and 2014, the tax payer spent \u00a316.8 million on the culling of 2,476 badgers.  This equates to \u00a36785 per badger. That is not a cost effective way to control them if they were the cause!\r\n\r\nhttps://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-and-wild-places/saving-species/badgers/faqs \r\nhttps://www.rspca.org.uk/adviceandwelfare/wildlife/inthewild/badgers/law",
        "background": "I do not want the UK govt to kill badgers. Badgers are a protected species and there is no research evidence linking their deaths to fewer  cattle getting TB. Stop the cull NOW and protect what little wildlife we have left.",
