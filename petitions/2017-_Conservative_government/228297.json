In rare cases it can even lead to blood clots and strokes.\r\n\r\nI have personally been experiencing symptoms for 3 years, having initially been told by a doctor I was \"imagining\" my symptoms, which is a very common, devastating reaction faced by sufferers. The condition is serious and often requires the removal of a rib to treat.",
