I plead, give judges the tools they need to stop this criminality and prevent more innocent people joining the growing roll call of car crime. If we can change the law and impact just one offender or prevent one more fatality or life changing event then that would be something for all of us who sign this petition",

It\u2019s time for a serious deterrent that would prevent criminals and criminal gangs in any pursuit situation from driving away at speed. Everyone in the car must be responsible for failing to stop.",
