        "additional_details": "An example of this is that Ticketmaster sold tickets for a 1 July 2018 show by rock band Queen + Adam Lambert in advance of the official announcement of the show, even before it was on the venue (SSE Arena, Wembley) website. Currently, two hours after the sale started, there are 96 tickets selling for almost twice the face value: https://www.getmein.com/tickets/queen-adam-lambert-tickets/london-323825.html.",
        "background": "It is increasingly difficult to buy tickets for popular events due to tickets being purchased with the express intention of reselling at a higher price. Ticket agencies endorse this behaviour by establishing companies that allow above face value resale, e.g. Ticketmaster and Getmein.",
