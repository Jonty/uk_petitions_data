        "additional_details": "For any full time employee, we are expected to pay for our own lunch. Under the Commons additional costs allowance, MPs were allowed to claim up to \u00a3400 for food every month. This equates to \u00a34,800 a year per MP. \r\nWhy are we expected to contribute this money to people who don\u2019t need it, instead of using it to benefit more important services such as the NHS? NHS nurses are sometimes not even supplied with tea or milk on their shifts yet well paid MP\u2019s have their meals subsidised by tax payers.",
        "background": "On average, MP\u2019s earn around \u00a379,400 a year. Yet for every \u00a310 an MP pays for lunch, the public contributes \u00a37.60. The average UK salary for those in full time work is \u00a335,400. Why should an MP who earns over double the average UK wage receive these benefits?",
