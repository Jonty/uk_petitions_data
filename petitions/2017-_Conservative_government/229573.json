In such circumstances, students can apply to a GP to be accepted as a temporary resident.  Temporary residence applies where a person intends to be in an area for more than 24 hours but for less than 3 months.  Once registered, patients can receive treatment in the same way as other registered patients.  Details of the patient\u2019s treatment provided, whilst a temporary resident, will be passed to their registered practice. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",
