        "additional_details": "Stress and sick leave have been attributed to the amount of work load being put onto the shoulders of untrained individuals. People have lost faith in the service, both consumers and employees alike have been fobbed off for too long. Many news outlets have commented negatively on the on going changes at the FOS. The only way the general public will see a positive influence by the FOS, is if parliament investigates why the changes have affected people so negatively.",
        "background": "The Ombudsman Service was founded in order to bring fair play to the financial market and to help consumers in need. Under the current leadership the quality of work and training given to investigators is shockingly bad. A new direction needs to be taken by the service to restore faith.",
