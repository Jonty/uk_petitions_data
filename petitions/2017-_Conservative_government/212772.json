        "additional_details": "Betting can be fun, but addiction isn't.\r\n \r\nWhen the fun stops, stop. The fun has stopped - there are over 400,000 problem gamblers, with more than 2 million 'at risk' - so stop the FOBTs.\r\n \r\nA \u00a32 maximum stake (as already is in place on b3 games/ 'slots') would still allow serious, but stable gamblers to  win big, but not on the 'crack-cocaine' of gambling. \r\n\r\nWe call on the Government to take this action to protect vulnerable people and to fix the problem in gambling.",
        "background": "Problem gamblers are often troubled, vulnerable and in self-destruct mode. An addict desires to burn quickly - the 'crack-cocaine' FOBT machines facilitate this\r\n\r\nB2 gaming/roulette can take \u00a3100 in seconds. There should be a legal maximum stake of \u00a32 to protect people who are addicted to gambling.",
