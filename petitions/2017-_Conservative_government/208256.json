        "additional_details": "Where a parent is on PIP they are considered \u201cincapacitated\u201d for childcare purposes in tax credit legislation and for extended hours nursery provision for 3 year olds. This does not extend to pupil premium, 2 year old nursery places or to free school meals - even if the incapacitated parent is unable to prepare a meal for themselves. Where one parent works and the other is considered incapacitated, children should receive these in order for the working parent to remain in work.",
        "background": "Children who have parents with disabilities are only able to access free school meals, the nursery grant for 2 year olds and pupil premium if they are on income related benefits. This means many working parents with a disabled partner are left better off leaving work to care for their families.",
