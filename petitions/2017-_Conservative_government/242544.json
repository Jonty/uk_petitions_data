        "additional_details": "Dental Nurses undergo detailed training in order to comply with the GDC and gain registration in order to work as a dental nurse. We then have to pay a yearly amount over \u00a3100 to remain registered. We undertake CPD yearly to comply as without registration we can't continue to work as a dental nurse. Yet we are NOT recognised as a professional and our pay reflects this. We should get the same professional recognition as nurses on the NMC!!!!",
        "background": "Dental Nurses train in order to comply with the needs of the GDC and become a registered Dental Nurse. However, we as Dental Nurses are not recognised as a professional. I believe we as Dental Nurses should be given professional recognition and allowed the same status as nurses on the NMC.",
