A Volkswagen Polo 1.4 is \u00a35,000 to insure for the year without a black box. This is in my mums name so I will not be ranking up any no claims bonus. This is compete discrimination towards young drivers. It absolutely disgusts me how insurance companies can discriminate people this badly. It become and absolute joke over the past few years. There needs to be something done about this immediately.",
        "background": "I am awfully disgusted by the amount of money that car insurance companies expect young drivers to pay. Many young people do not have jobs eg. 17 years old first time driver that is going to college/in education.",
