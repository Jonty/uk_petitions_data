        "additional_details": "The government provides \u00a34K a year to live off for those with parents who makes over \u00a360k. This is a ridiculous amount, and the government does not look or care about the bills the family may have. Those with parents on less than \u00a330K will receive over \u00a38K in maintenance loan, yet these people are probably already receiving extra support and living in council houses, so don't have the bills that those on higher wages have. The rich are fine, low income people are fine, those in the middle aren't",
        "background": "Many people are struggling to move away from home to attend university, because the government expect parents to substitute the amount the student may not have. Despite the parents not being able to afford it. The government look at the amount the parents earn and assume they can afford to help.",
