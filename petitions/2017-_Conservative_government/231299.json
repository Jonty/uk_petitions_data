        "additional_details": "1 in 4 Children and young people suffer with mental health issues. Though it still seems to be over looked in Childrens social work. They often lack  to correctly identify  a bullied child, a grieving child or child struggling at school because of SEN needs. Families are being split up because of lack of basic training that should be mandatory at University level with a yearly review in the work place.",
        "background": "Children are ending up in care wrongly, as front line social workers are not equipped with mental health awareness training or SEN trained. \r\nReports on emotional harm are written wrongly, resulting children end up in care with complex needs and challenges that are not met until they leave care.",
