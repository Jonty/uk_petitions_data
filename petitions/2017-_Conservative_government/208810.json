        "additional_details": "I feel that miscarriages should be a part of the national curriculum to educate both boys and girls on how and why it happens and the emotional and physical toll it can take on both parents. It is such a taboo subject and yet if so many women experience it why don\u2019t we talk about it so no one feels alone or unsure of their symptoms.",
        "background": "Last year I had two miscarriges (6 & 9 weeks). I felt so alone & was given limited information in the form of a leaflet from NHS staff. Everyone I told said \u2018it happens to lots of women\u2019, \u2018at least you know you can conceive\u2019 No one previously warned me about miscarriges or the signs and symptoms.",
