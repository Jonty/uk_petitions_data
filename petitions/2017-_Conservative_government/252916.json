Today, i politely asked if a man could take his dog away from mine as mine was clearly distressed&he laughed and said \u2018you aint got a clue have you love\u2019 and walked away, LEAVING his dog with me, after asking numerous times he finally got his dog whilst also insulting me.",

I have experienced myself asking owners to put a lead on their dogs as myself and my dog was distressed and they refused. If someone doesn\u2019t want your dog around them, you should show respect.",
