Women over the age of 25 (ie those not immunised as part of the NHS programme) are dying now from cervical cancer and this is not acceptable considering that such deaths could be prevented by making this vaccine available for free to all interested women.",
        "background": "The HPV vaccine can benefit all women of any age even if they've already had sex. It can help to prevent cervical cancer and STDs, so why is it available on the NHS only to girls from the age of 11 to 18? Women born too early have to pay hundreds of pounds to be immunised. What price a woman's life?",
