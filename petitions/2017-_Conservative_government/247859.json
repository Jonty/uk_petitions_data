What will happen if there is a second referendum, will all the losers demand another vote? It\u2019s a farce because the dithering Tories  had NO plan if they lost, took too long in starting the protest, that gave the remainers time to group and start the long process of trying to reverse the WILL OF THE PEOPLE.",
