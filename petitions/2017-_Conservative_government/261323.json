For example, those who work full-time and who have caring responsibilities or need to travel significant distances to vote may not have time to vote, or to queue to vote. \r\n\r\nThe UK is one of the only countries in the world to hold elections mid-week, without a public holiday.  In 1918 the UK voted on a Saturday.\r\n\r\nChanging the day in legislation would make voting more inclusive for more people.",
