It has been shown that the amazon rain-forest has lost 17% of its trees in the past 50 years, due to forest conversion. It is also shown that trees are our carbon sinks, therefore proving that they inhale the carbon we can't. If they can't inhale this carbon it will be let off into the atmosphere. 15% of all greenhouse gases are due to deforestation.",
        "background": "As a result of looking in class at deforestation, we have discovered that trees are declining at a rapid rate.We have decided that the number of trees being cut down for wooden objects such as building materials, need to be decreased.",

We're not sure exactly what else you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to fund a national tree planting programme, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
