        "additional_details": "The Referendum was NOT a final decision: Cameron himself said it was an indicator. The votes taken for Brexit were based on speculation, marketing, and outright lies. Watching the current PM (previous Remain supporter) scrabbling around now makes it clear. Also, not everyone who could vote, did vote: therefore claiming that \u201cthe people spoke\u201d is nonsense.\r\n\r\nThe reality is, for the UK to leave the EU is to take a huge step backwards.\r\n\r\n \u201cEquality and separation cannot exist in the same space\u201d.",
        "background": "If challenged about Brexit, the response by ministers is \u201cthe people have voted!\u201d.. but they repeatedly fail to acknowledge that those votes were by only a quarter of the population, and that they were based on misinformation and unsubstantiated statements, most of which are still unanswered today!",
