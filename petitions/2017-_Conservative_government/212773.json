        "additional_details": "I personally have been in this situation and from speaking to a number of people that have also experienced this, it would seem that once tax credits have received repayments or some form of monthly repayment method then they are no longer interested at looking at any evidence to dispute an overpayment. Therefore people are left with debts that are incorrect and have to pay them all back because they don't think they have any other option.",
        "background": "So many people receive letters from tax credits about overpayments that have to be paid back before it can be disputed. We need to make it compulsory that all evidence and appeals are done before any repayments have to be set up.",
