        "additional_details": "Imagine being a tortoise living in the desert and one day someone comes, puts you in a cage, ships you off to somewhere you don\u2019t know and before you know it you are behind glass, ready to be sold to people -  many of whom don\u2019t treat their pets right . Many animals die in the transportation from their homes to the pet shop . Fish are caught using cyanide, divers spray it on the coral reef to paralyse the fish then catch them and take them to be exported worldwide. This is wrong it needs to end.",
        "background": "Reptiles and fish are the most affected. 100s species of fish have gone extinct over the last 100 years because of the pet trade as they have been taken from their homes. It\u2019s the same with reptiles, invertebrates and mammals.",
