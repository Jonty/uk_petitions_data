The UK parliament has steadfastly ignored this fact and whilst it has paid the DUP to maintain its declining majority it has made no attempts to negotiate or appease the Scots. Since the EU referendum it has come to light how comprehensively lied to and manipulated the Scots have been through both referendum. Scotland now requires independence",
