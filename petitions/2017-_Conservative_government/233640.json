        "additional_details": "My partner has been fighting every day to live with a complex series of mental health conditions and 8 years on she is still waiting for mental health services to offer long term support.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t deserve to be swept under the carpet and forgotten about. The process and communication of the various services available is appalling and needs urgent independent review. What\u2019s more the NHS needs a sizeable increase in funding to make much needed services and waiting times adequately improved.",
        "background": "People are forced to wait up to 2 years to have access to mental health services and often those services are inadequate and do not offer more than a few \u2018talking therapy\u2019 sessions. Long term access to professionals is near impossible. Mental health is taken less seriously than physical health.",
