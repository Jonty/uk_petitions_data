        "additional_details": "The freedom of information responses compiled by the Liberal Democrats from 80 of the 136 NHS acute trusts in England shows that 2,700 EU nurses left the health service in 2016, compared to 1,600 EU nurses in 2014 \u2013 a 68% increase.\r\n\r\nIf leaving the EU means letting go of many of our much-needed professionals, the UK university tuition fees need to either be lowered or student loans need to allow our youth to study where it's cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe average student debt at graduation is \u00a350,800 - source IFS.\r\n\r\nDo we really expect our youngest and brightest to thrive with that much debt on their shoulders?",
        "background": "The conservative government in power should allow UK students to use their student loans to study at universities within the EU after Brexit OR lower our tuition fee's to minimize out debt for an education we surely need if the country is going to function without EU professional workers.",
