The government has failed to agree to an effective deal to leave Europe (Brexit) and has had 3 years to do so. Parliament is now blocking by law a no deal Brexit. With Europe unwilling to reach an effective agreement with the UK that the government may finally agree upon, the UK Government will have no choice but to withdraw it's application to leave Europe. Therefore the Government will have failed to deliver Brexit and the will of the people lawfully voted upon.",
