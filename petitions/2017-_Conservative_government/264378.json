The Foreign Secretary must speak out against the bill & act, via sanctions or other means, to halt its passage.",
        "background": "The UK Government has a responsibility towards the people of Hong Kong to safeguard the autonomy and fundamental freedoms outlined in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which the Extradition Bill threatens to seriously undermine.
