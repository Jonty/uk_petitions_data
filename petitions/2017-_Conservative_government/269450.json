        "additional_details": "1 in 4 people in the UK will experience a mental health issue each year and 1 in 6 people report experiencing a common mental health problem (such as anxiety and depression) in any given week. Mental health issues are affecting our everyday lives, so prevention and early intervention is key to curb this escalating problem. It is clear that this epidemic is not being addressed in the correct fashion. The British people deserve better. They deserve for their mental health to be put first. They deserve a department that is separate from the NHS, that will be effective, sustainable and productive. They deserve to never have to question their mental health again.",
        "background": "Our current system is not working. With the average wait for effective treatment in the UK being 10 years versus 1/4 people having a mental health issue. The facts indicate an underlying problem of inefficiency. This demands change and the solution is to create a separate department from the NHS.",
