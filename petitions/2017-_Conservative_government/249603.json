We use a number of techniques, automated and manual, to identify and block signatures from bots, disposable email addresses or other sources that show signs of fraudulent activity. We also monitor signing patterns. For security reasons, we don\u2019t tell people when their fraudulent activity has been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t comment in detail about the security measures, but all petitions are subject to checks as part of due diligence and any concerns investigated.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition to change the rules to prevent all people with an IP address registered overseas, including British citizens, from signing petitions if that's something you would like to happen."
