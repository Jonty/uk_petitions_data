        "additional_details": "Recently banks have had to advise their customers to visit local branches when their internet based service went down; there are people living with disabilities that make internet banking inaccessible to them; and small to medium enterprises such as local shops have to bank their taking regularly.  The loss of what are the last high street banks in some communities will seriously harm those people and businesses.",
        "background": "The British Government owns the majority of shares in RBS.  The proposed closure of high-street banks across the country will harm local businesses and many people in our communities who are unable to use internet banking.  Parliament should stop these bank closures on behalf of British citizens.",
