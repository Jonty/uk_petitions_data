        "additional_details": "Children are not being given the chance to explore a love of learning, they are being taught to pass tests, and are being given work that was previously set at a much higher level. Staff have no time to cater for childrens needs at an individual level, because they just haven't got enough time, and it's not good enough. We should be encouraging future generations to learn, not putting them off early by giving them more than they can handle. The current system is just not working.",
        "background": "The national curriculum has become cumbersome and over reaching, pushing teachers to leave the field, and children to have heightened stress levels. Learning to pass tests is not going to give children a life long love of learning  nor is it taking in to account childrens individual needs.",
