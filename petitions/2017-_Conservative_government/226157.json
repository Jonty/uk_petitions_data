        "additional_details": "There is no such thing as a bad dog just a bad owner who then makes the dog go nasty but with love and affection you can 9/10 win the dog around again and i for one will stand up with that. I myself will never turn a dog or animal in need away i will rehabilitate it back to a lovable dog again and find him or her the perfect home.",
        "background": "The banned breeds mentioned above are not bad dogs in the right hands so who ever wants to own one should have a background check completed and if they are found doing things with the dog i.e. dog fighting, boar and puma hunting the dog should instantly be removed and the owner banned for life.",
