        "additional_details": "Granting asylum would give Assange protection from extradition and therefore protect his human rights. \r\nKeeping the government in check should not be a prosecutable offence otherwise we are no different from totalitarian regimes. \r\nPlease sign this petition to protect Assange's rights and by extension our own.",
        "background": "Julian Assange has been recently arrested by the UK government after having been under the protection of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. If he were to be extradited to the US he could face life in prison for exposing the murder of civilians in Iraq by US soldiers on the Wikileaks website.",
