        "action": "Scrap the tax on child support for victims of domestic abuse.",
        "additional_details": "The UK Government are taxing victims of domestic abuse every month for using their safest method of receiving Child Maintenance. At present, 4% of what a parent is entitled to is taken by the Government despite no other option being available.\r\nThis year, legislation to tackle domestic violence and abuse will come before the House of Commons. This petition is calling on the Government to use this opportunity to scrap the tax on child support for victims of domestic abuse.",
        "background": "The Child Maintenance Service charges parents for utilising their managed service. The charge is in place to cut costs and encourage ex-partners to engage. Victims of domestic abuse shouldn't be punished financially because of an abusive ex-partner and, for safety, shouldn't be encouraged to engage.",
