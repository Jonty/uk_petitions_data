        "action": "Stop the 4 year back date of repayments for families over child benefit limits",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of families including mine have just received demands of thousands of pounds from HMRC asking for all benefits paid for the past 4 or 5 years. My salary has always been below the relevant child benefit threshold but with private medical, bonus and company car, this all takes me above all thresholds. How was I to know, HMRC did not clearly advertise this. It feels like it is only when the government need to find more funds for something like the NHS do they decide to tell people so they can claim the millions back.",
        "background": "Petition question: \r\n\"is it morally and ethically right for the government to allow HMRC to demand repayments dating 4 / 5 years previous, from families who received child benefit incorrectly when the rules around the thresholds were only made clear to these families from September 2018\".",
