Only 2 have got back to me and they are only acknowledgements they have received my application. It's so tough sitting by my phone and computer hoping a reply comes through.\r\n\r\nIt should be a legal requirement that companies HAVE to contact applicants, even if it is a rejection, purely to settle any doubt and stop this feeling of hoping for a reply.\r\n\r\nPlease support this petition.",
        "background": "There is nothing more disheartening than when you apply for a job and hear nothing back. Even as far as having an actual interview and then hear nothing further. Companies should have a requirement to inform the applicant that they have been unsuccessful to stop any doubt and waiting for a reply.",
