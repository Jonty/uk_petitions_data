Those found guilty face a fixed penalty of \u00a3100 and 3 points on their driver\u2019s licence. The most serious examples will continue to go through court, where offenders may face higher penalties. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-penalties-to-tackle-tailgating-and-middle-lane-hogging\r\n\r\nWe are therefore not sure what else you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
