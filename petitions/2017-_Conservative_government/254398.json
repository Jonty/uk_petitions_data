        "additional_details": "This petition is intended to send a message to the Government that we would like the final say on Brexit. The Prime Minister is right that we, the public, are fed up; however the Prime Minister is not listening to us, who have signed numerous petitions calling for No Deal or Revoking Article 50. She has failed to deliver on what the public have expected on Brexit and we intend to make our voices heard and listened to.\r\n\r\nThis Public Vote would be under the Alternative Vote approach.",
        "background": "MPs have voted in a series of indicative votes on 01/04/19 which did not gain a majority. This petition is to call upon the government to announce a public confirmatory vote so we can vote on our preferred outcome on:\r\nLeave EU without a deal\r\nRevoke Article 50\r\nPM Theresa May's deal\r\nCustoms Union",
