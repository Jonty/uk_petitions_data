        "additional_details": "I have planned this petition for a few months, this petition is not the first of it's sort and if what I ask for is not implemented it will not be the last. As a GCSE Student I know the struggles of memorising 18 poems and 3 books, quite frankly it takes away the pleasure of learning English Literature. \r\nI have taken my sources from:\r\nhttps://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/schoolsweek.co.uk/gcse-results-2017-english-literature/amp/\r\nThey will show you the drop in grades from 2016 to 2017, it's shocking.",
        "background": "As a GCSE Student I am well aware of the struggles of this new syllabus. I opine that these memory oriented exams are not testing our level of English but instead how much knowledge our brain can retain. I would much rather prefer a copy of the book be handed to us than memorising quotes.",
