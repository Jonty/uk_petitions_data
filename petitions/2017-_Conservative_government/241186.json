        "additional_details": "Numerous studies have found patient charges to be among the main barriers to accessing oral healthcare with nearly 1 in 5 patients delaying treatment due to cost. Furthermore, higher charges have not meant extra investment, they have become a substitute for direct funding. We now have the realistic prospect of patient charge revenue overtaking state contributions within a generation, and it raises existential questions about the future of NHS provision.",
        "background": "The NHS was created out of the ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. It was based on 3 core principles:\r\n\r\n\u2022 that it meet the needs of everyone\r\n\r\n\u2022 that it be free at the point of delivery\r\n\r\n\u2022 that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay",
