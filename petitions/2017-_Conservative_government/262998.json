        "additional_details": "The only acceptable exceptions would be in the hospitals and other clinical environments who have their own clinical waste disposal systems, or wipes that have been approved by the water industry as completely biodegradable.\r\n\r\nIt has already been proved that discarded wet wipes make up between 80% and 93% of the contents of blockages in UK sewers which cost \u00a3100 million a year to deal with.\r\n\r\nTo procrastinate is to disrespect our country and planet, of which we are stewards.",
        "background": "The proposed date of 2042 is far too late.  10.8 million wipes per year are used in the UK.  Multiply this by the 23 years till 2042 \u2013 that's a huge amount of damage which will be caused to the environment.",
