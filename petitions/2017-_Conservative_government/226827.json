        "additional_details": "We spend an ever-increasing amount of money on social services and health - \u00a3250bn a year - and a large percentage of that goes into supporting unemployed young people and treating health issues they develop like drug abuse, obesity, and depression. Gang warfare, violence and crime are all part of the fallout of a society which isn\u2019t working. Rather than continue to plaster over the problem let\u2019s create a special military body aside from the regular army for a compulsory one year of their lives.",
        "background": "With social problems amongst young people on the rise and where they are entering the job market with a lack of basic skills like reading and writing it is time we acted as a society on a basic level to bring about a seismic shift in the way our country is organised.",
