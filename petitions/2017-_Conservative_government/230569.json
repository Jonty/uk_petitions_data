        "additional_details": "The annual clean-up bill on the UK\u2019s streets has been estimated at \u00a3150m. Some councils spend \u00a3200,000 a year cleaning up gum from pavements with high-powered hoses. Cash-strapped council's could use this money better elsewhere like Housing, transport, education, police funding AND THE NHS.\r\nOn average it costs \u00a31.00 for an average pack of chewing gum, but it costs \u00a31.50 to remove a single piece of dropped gum. This is a waste of tax payers money!\r\nIt also causes a nuisance in schools.",
        "background": "Chewing gum is pointless. Everywhere you look. There are small white blobs on the pavement - in schools, towns, in public transport, under tables and chairs and even in supermarkets making Britian's town's and cities a unsightly place to live.",
