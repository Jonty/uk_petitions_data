        "additional_details": "People who take benefits and sit at home you give them all priorities however, people on visa work to provide for their families and pay tax to the government as well! This is unacceptable as you do not even allow people with a visa to have those priorities or claim benefits. So everyone should be allowed to have free NHS and people on a visa should not need to pay if they are tax payers.",
        "background": "When extending or applying for a visa paying \u00a3700 NHS fees does not seem fair when we are working legally and paying tax to the government. We have families to provide for and you expect us to pay such a big amount.",
