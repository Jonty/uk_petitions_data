Competence therefore lies at Westminster not Holyrood. \r\nThis petition witnesses public concern at the fairness of postal ballot conduct of a future Scottish Independence referendum and especially that broadcast media are biased. \r\nODIHR send an advance team weeks or months ahead to monitor media balance. \r\nIf there are no problems, why not get ODIHR confirmation?",
        "background": "A Scottish Independence referendum determines the relationship between two potentially separate states. The official body for monitoring democratic procedures within the OSCE is its Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights. Monitoring includes media balance and ballot conduct",
