        "action": "Stop political parties improperly influencing MPs\u2019 votes",
        "additional_details": "It is legitimate for party officials to remind MPs, before a vote, of the relevant manifesto commitments that helped get them elected. But MPs are able to keep themselves informed of recently-developed party policy, if they wish, and pointedly drawing it to individual MPs\u2019 attention in the run-up to a vote might induce them to put party policy above their constituents\u2019 interests. Deliberately trying to influence MPs in this way should be a criminal offence and offenders should be prosecuted.",
        "background": "When parties \u2018whip\u2019 MPs, there's an implicit suggestion that party endorsement at the next election depends on the MPs voting according to the party line. Whether done openly or through coded messages, this undermines MPs\u2019 ability to vote in good conscience, and should be tightly regulated.",
