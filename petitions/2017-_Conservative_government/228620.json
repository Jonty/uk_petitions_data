The Council and the European Parliament are between them negotiating the final version of the text.\r\n\r\nThe Government supports the aims of the Directive, including Article 11 \u2013 a new right for press publishers \u2013 and Article 13 \u2013 new rules to ensure copyright owners can claim payment when their content is uploaded to platforms like YouTube without their permission.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to the Government that these proposals are balanced, take into account the need to protect freedom of expression, and avoid placing unreasonable burdens on businesses and internet users.\r\n\r\nBecause of this the Government has actively sought safeguards for freedom of expression, such as rules which will protect people\u2019s ability to use third party content for the purpose of quotation, parody, and similar purposes which are currently allowed under UK law.\r\n\r\nThe Government\u2019s support for the Directive, and its position on implementing and maintaining these provisions following the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, will depend on the outcome of the negotiations on the Directive.  The Government will continue to engage in these negotiations to ensure the best outcome for the UK. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy",
