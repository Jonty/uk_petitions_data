        "action": "Repeal the Psychoactive Substances Act 2016",
        "additional_details": "This legislation puts people at risk by sending these substances into the hands of criminal gangs. It also criminalises harmless drug users, putting them into contact with more dangerous offenders in prison, and increasing the already dangerously high prison population.\r\nAn evidence-based drugs policy will allow for properly safe, regulated use, and allow people who might have problems with these drugs to feel safe getting help. This law is a waste of police resources and an affront to freedom.",
        "background": "This act made the sale, distribution, and consumption of all psychoactive substances (with the exceptions of food, tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and poppers) illegal.\r\nThis a ridiculous piece of legislation that in no way serves public health or even law and order, and is in effect a ban on fun.",
