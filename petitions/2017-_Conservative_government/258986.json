There is no genetical basis for grouping people under the category \u201cblack race\u201d, only skin colour. By using the eGFR formula, the British government is allowing dark skinned patients to be under-diagnosed with a severe condition, promoting the practice of race-based medicine.",

Consequently, Glomerular Filtration Rates used to assess kidney function are measured according to patients\u2019 skin colour, thus black patients run the risk of being under-diagnosed with CDK.",
