        "additional_details": "Universal credit is too complicated particularly for vulnerable people such as those with mental health issues.\r\nPeople struggling with the online access risk having their money stopped through sanctions.\r\nOver one million low-paid workers will also be drawn into the new system and could face sanctions if they don\u2019t prove they are applying for better paid work.\r\nResidents in Dagenham NEED a jobcentre in order to be able to cope with the chaos caused by the implementation of Universal Credit.",
        "background": "Dagenham Jobcentre is set to close on 19th January 2018, as part of a program of closures of Jobcentres across the country.\r\nDagenham residents will struggle to get to Barking Jobcentre.\r\nResidents will risk having payments stopped through sanctions, being forced into debt and destitution.",
