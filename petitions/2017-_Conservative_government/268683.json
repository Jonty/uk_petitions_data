        "additional_details": "Dairy milk uses more water, creates more carbon emissions and requires more land than all plant-based milks (Poore & Nemecek, 2018). \r\n\r\nFortified soy milk provides children with the same vitamins and nutrients (calcium, B12, protein) in similar amounts to dairy milk, while containing less salt and sugar. \r\n\r\nPlant milks would also provide an option for lactose-intolerant children.\r\n\r\nSince dairy milk is the only free option, there is no economic incentive to supply plant-based milks in nurseries.",
        "background": "Moving towards plant-based milks and dairy-free food choices has the potential to drastically reduce our impact on the climate and ecological crises. However, while many people are adopting plant-based lifestyles, no plant-based milks are subsidised through the 'Nursery Milk Scheme'.",
