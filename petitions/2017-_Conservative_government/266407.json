This is ridiculous. \r\nI want it put in law that all payrises for MPs must be decided by them and then put to the public for their decision. \r\nOn the ballot it should state.\r\nAgree. \r\nReject, to high\r\nReject, no rise\r\nHaving these options gives them an opportunity to come back with another request should it be rejected.",
