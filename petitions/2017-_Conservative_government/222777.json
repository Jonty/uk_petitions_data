        "additional_details": "Amazon and Google both generated \u00a37bn in sales revenue in 2017.  A new OST of 12% (on top of VAT) would generate \u00a31.8bn per annum alone.  Facebook did \u00a3850m in sales, generating another \u00a3100m OST for the pot.\r\n\r\nMiddle and higher income earners are not a limitless well of money for the Government to keep dipping into.  The top 1% of income earners already pay more than 28% of all income tax.  This is unsustainable in the long term and we need to reduce taxes & seek efficiency savings.",
        "background": "The Government has \"gifted\" the NHS an extra \u00a320bn of our money, proposed through raising yet more tax on middle and higher income earners!\r\n\r\nAn Online Sales Tax directed against Google, Amazon, eBay, Twitter etc should be used to offset tax rises for stretched families and save our high street.",
