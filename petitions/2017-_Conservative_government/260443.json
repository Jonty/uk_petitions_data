Monthly costs incurred include razors, razor heads, shaving foam, not to mention the more expensive moisturisers and shaving balms having to be bought for sensitive skin. \r\n\r\nShaving everyday also leads to abrasions and tears in the skin, therefore causing discomfort, despite using the most highly rated brands. Shaving also stops the skin from producing the naturally occurring oils protecting the face.",
