        "additional_details": "MMA is most widely used bone & dental products! It\u2019s used to fix broken bones & create dentures. The reason your natural nail is thinned so much prior to the application is because the product doesn\u2019t adhere very well to the nail unless it\u2019s thinned. This weakens your own natural nail & you would notice MMA nails are extremely tough and very difficult to break. I\u2019ve known of people having to go to A&E because the nail is so badly damaged that they\u2019ve had to have it surgically removed.",
        "background": "MMA can be found in NSS salons. You will see on your local high street, you can walk in, It\u2019s a rushed service, they always hurt your nails with use of the electric file on the natural nail, which gives this tool a bad rep. MMA use had been around for years. products containing MMA sell for less!",
