        "action": "Put the teaching of life-saving skills into the curriculum for schools from 8-11",
        "additional_details": "By placing life-saving skills on the National Curriculum at KS3 we will vastly improve our ability as a nation to save lives outside of hospital. Adults will then have the confidence and skill to be effective.Outside of hospital only 7% survive CPR in the UK whereas in parts of Europe, Scandinavia and USA the figure is up to 56%. The key difference is that those countries train their junior school children and keep training them through their education. I am proposing that we change the national curriculum to improve our ability as a nation. Adults do not feel confident in life saving situations because they have not been trained as children. Train our children, change the future.",
        "background": "To put life-saving skills on the national school curriculum from 8 years old until 11 so it becomes obligatory to train students in CPR, Defibrillation, Recovery Position and Choking.",
