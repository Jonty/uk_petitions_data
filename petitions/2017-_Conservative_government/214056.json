        "action": "Introduce compulsory plastic/glass bottle deposit scheme",
        "additional_details": "As in Germany, Norway and The Netherlands, among others, this deposit would be refunded to the customer upon returning the bottle to an automated recycling machine at the point of purchase. Not only would this reduce unrecycled waste, but it would also reduce the use of fossil fuels for the collection of recycled waste from residential and commercial properties. Beginning to centralise and incentivise recycling, we would be investing in the infrastructure necessary to expand the scheme in future",
        "background": "As stated above, the undersigned call for parliament to debate the possibility of introducing a compulsory 10p charge for the purchase of each recyclable bottle, in an attempt to combat the effects of such recyclable waste on the environment.",
