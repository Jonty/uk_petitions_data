        "additional_details": "- A2 lisence takers (allowed from an age of 19) should be allowed to ride a motorcycle limited to 35KW (45hp) unsupervised but showing Learner plates provided they have obtained their CBT (compulsory bike training). They would have 2 years to complete their practical examinations before having to retake their CBT.\r\n\r\n- The same applies to full licence takers with their respective age and bike size limits. \r\n\r\n-Whether this should be allowed before or after taking the theory test is open to debate.",

This should be allowed after obtaining their cbt (Maybe their theory also.) This would improve riding  experience before taking practical examinations.",
