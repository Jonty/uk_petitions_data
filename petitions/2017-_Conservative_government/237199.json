        "additional_details": "Today UK citizens enjoy Freedom of Movement (FoM) and viceversa with the EU.\r\n\r\nIn 2016 UK people were not properly informed that with Brexit they will lose such right\r\n\r\nThere was lack of information, lots of misinformation or lies running to the referendum, including mixing the topic of FoM with migration influx in the UK\r\n\r\nIf Brexit happens, now or later, Govt/Parliament needs to guarantee that in any future agreement with the EU the FoM is fully retained. If not then have a referendum on FoM",
        "background": "Current Govt presumes that with the Brexit referendum in 2016 people wanted to stop FoM with the EU\r\n\r\nWe believe that this is not the case because people were misinformed, or lied to, or there was lack of information.",
