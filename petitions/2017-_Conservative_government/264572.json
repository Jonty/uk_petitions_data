        "additional_details": "Ethylene glycol toxicity makes a cat appear as though drunk- sleepy, wobbly, inappetant. This is true of many toxicities, but more often than not a confirmed diagnosis is found when it\u2019s too late.\r\nEthylene glycol is used all year round in car radiators- a small, unnoticed leak which attracts a cat is enough to be fatal. We are petitioning in our boy Keo\u2019s honour to make sure this tragic situation never happens to another family.",
        "background": "Recently we went through the devastating and unexpected loss of our beautiful cat Keo. His diagnosis was ethylene glycol toxicity. Ethylene glycol is used in antifreeze- its sweet smell and taste is irresistible to cats but results in their bodies being shut down.",
