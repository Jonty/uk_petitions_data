        "additional_details": "To ensure that schools and colleges can continue to deliver a high quality education, the government should raise the funding rate for 16, 17 and 18 year olds by at least \u00a3760 per student in the 2019 spending review and raise it in line with inflation each year. Recent research from London Economics 'Understanding the funding shortfall in sixth form education' found that \u00a3760 was the minimum level of additional funding required to deliver a high quality education.",
        "background": "Sixth form funding was subject to deep cuts after 2010 and the national funding rate for 16 and 17 year olds has remained frozen at \u00a34,000 per student, per year since 2013/14. The rate for 18 year olds is set even lower at \u00a33,300 per student.",
