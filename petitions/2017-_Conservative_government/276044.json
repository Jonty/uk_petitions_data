        "additional_details": "This petition does not call for an outright ban on Christmas crackers, rather the wasteful content almost always included within. In this age of increased environmental awareness and especially the need to reduce plastic waste, such a ban would be an easily achievable step in the right direction.",
        "background": "Every year, tens of millions of single use and often useless pieces of plastic are opened in Christmas crackers to simply be swept up after Christmas dinner to be thrown away, ending up in landfill or worse.",
