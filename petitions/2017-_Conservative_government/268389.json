        "action": "Bring coursework back to GCSEs",
        "additional_details": "The grade 9-1 system is already stressful enough, making what was before a fair system confusing and difficult to succeed in. Give kids the chance to do well in exams and bring coursework back for the 2020 exams. It allows them to put all of their knowledge and effort into work, with less stress and effect on their mental health. Exams still have a place in the GCSE system, but they should not hold the massive worth that they currently do.",
        "background": "One exam should not decide if you can get a job, it shouldn\u2019t decide your future, it shouldn\u2019t be the culmination of two years work. Bring back coursework to reduce stress on young people and give them the tools to succeed, rather than as difficult as possible to achieve good grades.",
