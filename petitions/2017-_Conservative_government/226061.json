        "action": "Include menstrual cramps as a condition treated by medical marijuana",
        "additional_details": "According to many medical marijuana experts such as Dr Rachna Patel, medical cannabis can be a way to treat menstrual cramps. They are an alternative to painkillers, surgeries, birth control and other forms of suppressing cramps which have horrific side effects. In many states where medical cannabis is legal, these products flooded the market by companies such as Foria or Whoopi&Maya, and have shown great success.",
        "background": "Many people experiencing menstruation are not helped by over-the-counter medicine and home remedies, especially the ones with more serious conditions such as endometriosis. This is why it needs to be added to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana.",
