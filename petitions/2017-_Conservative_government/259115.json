        "additional_details": "Having to pay double (or more) for childcare is prohibitively expensive in the early years before age 3 when the government childcare funding kicks in.\r\nThe detrimental impact of financial strain from not being able to work or earn enough to fund childcare can have a direct impact on mental health. \r\nUnless a family is on low income (under \u00a350k), they do not qualify for full Child Benefit or other benefits. But even income of \u00a350k+ is not enough to support a family living on the outskirts of London. \r\nHaving children staggered in age means there is a staggered charge/period of relief but having twins or more negates that relief period.",
        "background": "There is currently no additional free childcare scheme for parents who are not claiming benefits and have multiples (twins, triplets etc) to help them with childcare before their children are 3 years old.",
