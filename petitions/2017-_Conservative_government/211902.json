        "additional_details": "Statistics shows us that the economy always grows following a dramatic tax cut. In 1971, the Top Rate in income Taxation was cut to 75%. Resulting in almost a 8.00% growth in GDP. The greatest growth between 1949-2011. However, in 1974 this cut was partially reversed and raised to 83%. The U.K. GDP experienced a 1% decrease. The greatest decrease since 1949. Furthermore, in 1988 the Top Rate in Income Tax was cut to 40%. Resulting in close to a 5% GDP growth. The greatest since 1971.",
        "background": "Income Taxation has been subject to controversy since it\u2019s inception. This is greatly due to the fact that people believe they have the right to keep what they had worked for. Reducing income tax rates would do many great things such as incentivise greater work ethic and stimulate economic growth.",
