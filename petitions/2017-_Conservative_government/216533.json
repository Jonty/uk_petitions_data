        "additional_details": "Pot holes in UK roads are increasing due to councils lack of funds for repairs. This causes serious safety issues for drivers and cyclists and can cause major damage to vehicles.",
        "background": "Many countries in Europe make road users pay to use motorways and major roads, either by way of tolls or a vignette system. I propose introducing a Vignette system in the UK for foreign drivers which would raise revenue to be shared amongst the counties and used solely for repairing road surfaces.",
