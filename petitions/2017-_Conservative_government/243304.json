        "background": "If a tenant leaves a rented property with rent arrears, court fees and bailiff fees this leaves the landlord with big debts to cover. Landlords should not be used as a bank. The Government should pay the debts and reclaim the cost from the tenants \u2013 effectively a loan.",
