        "additional_details": "I have been banned or restricted from every betting account I have ever had, to the point that I cannot even have a bet anymore. Some of these accounts have not even made it past 10 bets before they are closed or restricted. One prime example of how they are unwilling to lose, I had a losing paddy power account to the tune of \u00a315,000 I then changed strategies and won \u00a31000 back from them, at this point I was restricted so I could not have a meaningful bet with them anymore.",
        "background": "Myself and many others have had our betting accounts restricted because we have had the cheek to actually win money from bookmakers. The bookmaking industry are happy to take money from the vulnerable but are unwilling to lose to anyone with any savvy. How can this possible be legal.",
