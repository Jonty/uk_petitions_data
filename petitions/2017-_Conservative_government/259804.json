It seems like these islands will literally be a dream if something is not done, as soon as possible. The Paris Climate Agreement helps protect them.\r\n\r\nNow that the UK will stand alone, it may have less sway in international climate negotiations than it did before.\r\n\r\nSign this petition to show the government that being involved in global climate change is still important. Just because we have left the EU doesn\u2019t mean we have left the world or the international community and we should stand by our global commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement.",

The UK signed this under the jurisdiction of the EU- when we leave we'll have less of an obligation to carry it out",
