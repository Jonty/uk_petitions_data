        "additional_details": "The cost of living is rising year on year and the nation needs to be rewarded for our hard work. \u00a310 an hour isn't for holidays and lavish spending, it is to cover basic living costs. The UK economy would benefit from extra tax receipts and increased manufacturing output as people could spend more.\r\nIn a time when MP's earn \u00a374,962 basic pay and claim expenses on top and a worker on Minimum Wage averages \u00a313500 before tax and has to pay for work expenses is it too much to ask for \u00a310 per hour?",
        "background": "The National Minimum wage in the UK needs an immediate increase to \u00a310 per hour to provide an acceptable living standard for hardworking people. The government has re-branded NMW as 'Living Wage' and this is wrong as the Living Wage Foundation states it should be \u00a38.75 for UK and \u00a310.20 for London.",
