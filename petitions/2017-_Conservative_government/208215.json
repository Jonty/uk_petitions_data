        "additional_details": "A review and overhaul of the tax system is required to bring a  fairer balance to road users. \r\n\r\nE.g - a pensioner who makes one trip a week in his car.  Should not pay the same amount in road tax as someone who uses their car for commuting to work everyday.\r\n\r\nThe current system does not reflect road use/wear and tear on the network. This could be easily be rectified by directly linking the VED (Road tax) to the fuel at the pump. \r\n\r\nThe more fuel you use in your car the more tax you pay.",
        "background": "The current road tax system uses a blanket rule type system to cover the taxation of all uk vehicles based solely on emissions. This system does not take into account how much time each of these vehicles is spent on the road causing wear and tear on the road network.",
