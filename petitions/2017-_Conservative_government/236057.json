This is wrong the authorities are forcing people out for economic gain. We are asking you for a law to stop any more building on the land we have left as we have way too much concrete. But instead welcome to build more on brownfield sites whether more costly. We do need to think about the environment and for you to do something right for once and build relationships!",

But we are truly sad that the government hasn\u2019t listened to us. My council wants to build12,800 which will damage community cohesion. As well as not being moral!",
