        "additional_details": "I am Headteacher in a busy primary school and neither I nor my office staff have time for unnecessary work. This requirement to check adds an additional admin burden for people who in goodwill are supporting the work of the school on a casual and irregular basis. Accompanying off site visits does not constitute work and will not lead to employment. Parents of children who attend a state funded school must have the right to work and residence or their children will not get a place in school.",
        "background": "Parents accompanying off site visits with schools are classed as volunteers. All workers voluntary or otherwise must have their right to work checked. This requirement for checks involves schools taking a copy of a passport and signing and dating to say it represents the parent.",
