        "additional_details": "Many local authorities are already committed to supplying minimum waste to existing and future planned incinerators. The result is recyclable wast burned.\r\nNew technological breakthroughs enable better treatment for waste removal. MBT facilities that extract further recyclables from black bin bags waste and better turn of the remaining waste into energy through high tech processes that do not create any toxic residue and have much lower CO2 produced (IE gasification and plasma treatment).",
        "background": "Incinerators/Waste to Energy facilities are an old and inefficient way to deal with our waste. Even with the most advanced filters send toxins into the surrounding areas and have high CO2 emission. Much of the waste could be recycled but there is not enough financial reward.",
