        "additional_details": "A significant proportion of dentists are finding it increasingly difficult to justify paying Annual Retention Fees to an organisation whose primary remit is to protect patients. Therefore the tax-paying public, and not dentists, have to take responsibility for funding the GDC; similar to the Health and Safety Executive, which is not funded by organisations/employers yet are independent and have enforcement powers.",
        "background": "The GDC has been an independent regulatory body which has been funded by dentists paying Annual Retention Fees. However, the main aim of the GDC is to protect patients whilst regulating the practice of dentists, the GDC should be funded by the tax-paying public and not by dentists, like the HSE.",
