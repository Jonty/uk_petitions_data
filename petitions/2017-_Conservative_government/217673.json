        "additional_details": "Think about it this way 2 people walking down the road both drop litter and are given a fixed penalty notice of \u00a380. The first person comes from a household earning \u00a3200 a week and the other \u00a3200 a day. This is not a fair measure, this nearly 7x worse for the person who can afford it the least.\r\n\r\nA proportional system means both parties receive the same impact and that impact can be kept from being up to half the weekly income of people who are potentially facing growing poverty.",
        "background": "We, the signed, call on the government to implement the same policy that is already practiced by  governments in other european countries such as Denmark and Iceland in which Fines are charged to a proportion of the offenders income. This way punishment is same for all, as it is meant to be in law.",
