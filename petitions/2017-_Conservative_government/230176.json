        "background": "The Government must raise awareness among GPs and healthcare professionals to increase the diagnosis of asthma in children under 5. When a child with asthma isn\u2019t diagnosed until they are 5 it is especially hard. I understand it can indicate other conditions but it is a condition that can kill!",
