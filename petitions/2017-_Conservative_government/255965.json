        "additional_details": "HMY (Her Majesty\u2019s Yacht) Britannia was a great asset to the UK, securing an estimated \u00a33 billion of trade between 1991-95, which in today\u2019s money would be nearly \u00a36 billion. With Brexit trade deals hard to establish, I believe that we need a new or refurbished HMY. Onboard The Queen worked tirelessly on state business, the Royal Yacht wasn\u2019t a holiday it was a way of life and allowed the Queen to conduct state business whilst touring the world and establishing trade deals benefiting the UK economy. It is a real shame that in 1997 the yacht was decommissioned and not replaced and this isn\u2019t the kind of UK I want to live in. Bring back the Royal Yacht as a tool for trade deals and international relationship building.",
