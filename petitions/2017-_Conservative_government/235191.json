        "additional_details": "As parents, we should have the right of choice to teach our children about relationships including sexual relationships but seems though the state have decided for us parents. It is a strategic movement taking place to brainwash our children especially those from religious backgrounds.\r\nChildren from the age of 4 onwards do not need to know about pornography, sexual relationships, or LGBT at such young age. Psychologically this will ruin their innocent minds and cause more damage than good.",
        "background": "The DfE have proposed that schools are required to teach relationships education at primary school, relationships and sex education at secondary school and health education at all state-funded schools.",
