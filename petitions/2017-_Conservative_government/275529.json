        "additional_details": "Kashmir and kashmiri people of India have suffered a lot due to terrorism and insurgency. It is time rest of the India and the world to stand with Kashmirs to get the infrastructure and development they deserve. This motion will only help those insurgents and terrorists than strengthening Indian government.\r\n\r\nThis will make Indian community in Britain to alienate Labour Party. We ask all the Indian origin Labour party politicians to resign to show solidarity with Indian community.",
        "background": "Passing a motion on Kashmir Issue is uncalled for from a democratic party like Labour. It has ignored the voice of 1.3 billion people but listened to few anti India voices of its own executive. Labour party is struggling with anti Semitism and now anti Indian attitude is also growing rapidly within.",
