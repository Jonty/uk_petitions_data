        "additional_details": "Drinks with more than 8g per 100ml face a tax rate equivalent to 24p per litre. Those containing 5-8g of sugar per 100ml face 18p per litre. While this may appear as if you just pay more for the product, instead it is becoming very difficult to get a product without artificial additives. With many pubs, bars no longer serving sugar drinks. Aspartame is one of the most popular sweeteners and some studies indicate it could be carcinogenic. We deserve real choice.",
        "background": "This year the Government brought in a sugar tax, which is a tax on any drink with above a certain level of sugar content. The problem is that companies are now replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners and these are argued to be more harmful than sugar. Scrap the tax for choice and for our health.",
