        "additional_details": "All parents are eligible for 15 hours funding for children aged 3 and 4. \r\n\r\nFamilies where both parents are working are eligible for an additional 15 hours funding for children aged 3 and 4. \r\n\r\nThe current gap in childcare funding for children aged 1 and 2, means that childcare costs are one of the greatest barriers for parents returning to work. \r\n\r\nI propose we redistribute this entitlement so that families where both parents are working are eligible for the funding for children aged 1 and 2.",
        "background": "The current childcare funding is not available until a child is three years old. Consequently, there is a funding gap between the end of maternity leave and the start of the 30 hours funding. \r\n\r\nI propose we redistribute the funding to provide 15 hours childcare per week for children aged 1 to 4.",
