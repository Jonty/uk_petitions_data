        "additional_details": "Currently only British Geological Survey use GeoRSS for publishing information about earthquakes in the UK. \r\nThis being said, many public agencies already have data and infrastructure required for GeoRSS streams in place: Highway Agency, MET Office, Environment Agency. Such streams can be easily integrated into home automation software to warn residents about anything happening nearby. This could potentially save them time, save their property and maybe even their lives.",
