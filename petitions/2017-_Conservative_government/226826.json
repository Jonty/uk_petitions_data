        "additional_details": "By talking about abuse of any kind openly and freely we take away the secrecy and make it less of a taboo subject and people may, hopefully, 1. be more aware of how to protect themselves, 2. feel more able to speak up if something does happen to them, 3. make abusers more wary of abusing.",
        "background": "Many people (adults and children alike) who have been abused often say that they didn't realise what was happening was actually abuse for a very long time.  By educating children about what is abuse will empower them to protect themselves.  Abusers rely ignorance and secrecy.",
