        "additional_details": "Although there\u2019s the argument of \u2018well if you don\u2019t want to do the exam don\u2019t go to a catholic school\u2019, this however is not at all a valid point as schools can only capacitate for a certain number of pupils therefore a large majority of catholics that do not have a belief in god have no option but to attend a catholic school and have no option wether or not to face an exam that could potentially be a massive anomaly on your GCSE results sheet and effect your future.",
        "background": "Catholic schools at the minuite do not make the religious studies gcse exam optional to students. The current Religous studies exam is made up of 2 sections, one with 6 topics and the other with 4. However not all topics will show up on the GCSE exam, therefore extra stress is put on the pupils.",
