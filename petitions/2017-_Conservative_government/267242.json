        "background": "We do not believe the new Prime Minister would dare table the required motion '\u201cThat there shall be an early parliamentary general election\u201d'; we call on all other current Members of Parliament to do so.\r\n\r\nAnything less would be to blatantly deny the public our democratic rights.",
