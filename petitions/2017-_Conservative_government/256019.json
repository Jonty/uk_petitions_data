        "additional_details": "It's completely selfish to Opt Out. Your organs are no use to you when you die. To be cremated or buried with your organs still inside is a complete waste when the organ donor list is always growing. So if you Opt-Out from 2020 you should automatically lose the right to receive organs if ever you are in your time of need. Don't give don't receive. Only fair sounds spiteful but why should people deserve someone else's organs if they don't want to donate their own upon their demise.",
        "background": "I fully support the new plans for 2020 to fully opt everyone in for organ donations. But I believe if you are selfish enough to opt out from 2020 then you should rightfully be automatically opted out of receiving organ donations. If you are not willing to give upon death then you shouldn't receive.",
