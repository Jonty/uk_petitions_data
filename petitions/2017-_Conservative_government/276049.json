        "action": "Make denying parental access a crime.",
        "additional_details": "No child deserves to become alienated from their parent - this can and does have devastating effects on both the parent and child's mental health. In some cases the parent is unfit and naturally that speaks for itself but in many cases children all over the uk are being denied the right to have 2 loving parents. We ask that you implement a law to end this justice - the future generations will thank you.",
        "background": "Every year many parents don't get to see their children and many children don't get to see their parent. This is often the father of the child although it can work both ways. We move to have the act of parental alienation without fair and reasonable cause to be recognised as a crime.",
