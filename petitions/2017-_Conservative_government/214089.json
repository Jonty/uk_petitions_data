But it's expert advice they are begging for but are being fobbed off by most of their GPs. This is very important as my wife until Christmas was my carer but now we are both relying on our two daughters having to work part time for us. My wife was a council carer working till she retired so she has had no proper retirement, both of us are 72 this year.",
        "background": "My wife has just been diagnosed with this horrible illness. Going online, I found that a lot of people suffering are begging for help, saying that their GPs cannot help them and relying on people with this illness for help on reading most of their problems.",
