        "additional_details": "The notorious case of Tower Hamlets, and the involvement in the recent Peterborough by-election of persons previously convicted in relation to postal vote fraud, highlight how the current system of postal voting is open to abuse on a scale which is a danger to democracy.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore imperative that the practice of allowing postal voting for all be discontinued. \r\n\r\nIt should, of course, remain available for the disabled, the infirm, and such other persons as may not be able to vote in person.",
        "background": "Currently, anyone can choose to vote in elections by post, without having to give a reason, and with no restrictions.\r\n\r\nGiven the numerous proven instances of postal vote fraud, we propose that postal voting is severely restricted so as to limit the potential for such fraud to take place in future.",
