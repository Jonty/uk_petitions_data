        "additional_details": "We are both parents of children with life-threatening allergies. Throughout our own children\u2019s primary school years it has become apparent that there is a general lack of awareness and education with regards to allergy care in schools. This petition aims to put pressure on Parliament to pass legislation that will make an Allergy Care policy statutory for every school & to establish appropriate standards of medical training, education & care for children with anaphylaxis in our schools.",
        "background": "Currently, there is no statutory legislation to govern school policies in regard to the care of children with life-threatening allergies. As a result, the provision of care in our schools is haphazard and inconsistent. This is shocking and risks the lives of vulnerable children every day.",
