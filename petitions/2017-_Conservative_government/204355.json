Since all the cuts have happened my mum is now on about \u00a360 for every two weeks. Is that really enough to fill our cupboards and fridge freezers? Is it enough to pay off the rent knowing thats 27 a week? Also with other bills gas, electricity? Its completely sick what theresa may and david cameron have yet what ever happened to \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d",
        "background": "As i grew up my mum was on benefits trying hard to find a job whilst on about \u00a3300 every 2 weeks which was just enough for food, bills and even treats (clothes etc.) ever since conservatives have been in charge, its always has been a struggle. I have not had a decent meal since. Poverty is at a rise",
