        "additional_details": "During her tenure, the Victims Commissioner's views have not represented false allegation victims.\r\n\r\nEg. In response to the Henriques report, the VC opposed police neutrality in investigations, and opposed the use of the term 'complainant'. (Jan '18)\r\n\r\nThis can only be remedied by an independent commissioner appointed to advocate on behalf of this special class of victims.",
        "background": "The current Victims Commissioner was appointed to represent the rights of all victims, including victims of criminal false allegations. Unfortunately she has failed to do so.\r\n\r\nI therefore propose the appointment of an independent commissioner who will represent the views of the falsely accused.",
