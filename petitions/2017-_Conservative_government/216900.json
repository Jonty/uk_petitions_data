        "additional_details": "There's a reason for this: https://goo.gl/At9CVb\r\nSadiq Khan blames the government, but that is a complacent attitude: he has responsibility for London's Policing, and can take action NOW. He should spend that half a billion he gets on supporting the Police; he's got ample money, he can reform spot checks; why is he not doing it? If something isn't done NOW, crime in London will just increase even more.  Murder, terrorism, burglary will all rise, and all because of an inept Mayor of London.",
        "background": "As of 1.4.18,  15 people have been murdered in London in 2018, compared to 14 in NYC: both cities have a similarly-sized population. In 1990 in NYC, 6 people were killed every day for a year-do you really want this in London?\r\n\r\nMoreover, yesterday, Melbourne became the 48th murder victim in London.",
