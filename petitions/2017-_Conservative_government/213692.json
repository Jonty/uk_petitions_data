        "action": "Petition Eurostar to allow dogs on the train.",
        "additional_details": "If you have a dog, you have very little option for travelling between the continent and the UK. You are not allowed to take dogs on the Eurostar and cannot take dogs on-board as foot passengers on the Dover-Calais crossing. You can take your dog on the train throughout all of the UK, and then on trains in mainland Europe... but not on the one train that crosses the two. Eurostar say they don't have the facilities to allow this. Sign this petition to make Eurostar implement these facilities!",
        "background": "Eurostar has opened a new direct line to Amsterdam, and is substantially improving it's coverage, but still does not allow dogs (nor does P&O for foot passengers). Please sign this petition to help support dog owners and their dogs. Dogs are a man's best friend - let them on the Eurostar!",
