        "additional_details": "Brexit negotiations are causing instability in Parliament. The chances of a leadership challenge, or a vote of no confidence, are high. This could trigger a General Election.\r\n\r\nIf the British public are to be subjected to yet another General Election before we have formally left the EU, the opportunity should be taken to run a new, better \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum.\r\n\r\nThis will stop campaigning, and the outcome of an election, being misrepresented as a Brexit mandate, when it is in fact a vote for an MP.",
        "background": "In the event that the UK has not yet left the EU by the time that the next General  Election is called, a new referendum on U.K. membership of the European Union (Brexit) should be held. Voting should take place at the same time as choosing a Member of Parliament, but with a separate ballot.",
