        "additional_details": "The Transport Act 2000 says you are eligible if you would be refused a driving licence due to physical fitness, IF you ever applied. The practice of demanding a refusal letter is therefore not correct, as the law does not say you have to have applied for a licence. \r\n\r\nSome authorities now accept a doctor\u2019s letter, but a person has to get this by appointment with a specialist, which can cost up to \u00a3200. Clear and legally binding guidance must be issued to all local authorities so that they understand what the law actually says and stop denying disabled people what they are legally entitled to.\r\n",
        "background": "People applying for a disabled persons pass are being asked for evidence of having had a drivers licence refused on medical grounds, even when they have never applied for a licence. This has happened to many people including myself and others with epilepsy and it\u2019s not acceptable.",
