        "additional_details": "Parliament is acting unconstitutionally and undemocratically in displacing the elected government. The main parties are reneging on their manifesto promises. Resolving Brexit the way it is doing lacks legitimacy and will not be sustainable. A general election would allow for an article 50 extension.",
        "background": "A general election would allow the parties to set out their positions on Brexit, debate them and let the people decide what kind of Brexit they want most if at all. The current situation is overturning the result of the last election by removing the elected government and reneging on clear promises",
