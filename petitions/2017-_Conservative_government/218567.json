        "additional_details": "Some of these cycleways still exist, but they are not today understood to be cycle infrastructure: they should be rededicated. Others are buried under a couple of inches of soil: they could be excavated. \r\n\r\nWith your help we'll be able to demonstrate that the space for cycling is there, and in many cases it has been there for a long time!\r\nThose who sign this petition will be supporting something of potentially national importance.\r\n\r\nSoreen, malt loaf maker support this Lost Cycleways Project.",
        "background": "In the 1930s, Britain's Ministry of Transport commissioned the building of 500-miles of protected cycleways. Between 1934 and 1940 more than 300 miles of these innovative cycleways were actually built, usually both sides of the new \"arterial roads\" springing up all over the country.",
