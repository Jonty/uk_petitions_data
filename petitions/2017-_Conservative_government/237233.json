        "action": "Require cash options for day to day expense not force smartphone or credit card.",
        "additional_details": "This is an issue for services across the UK and is of particular concern for the elderly and poorest in society. Not everyone can afford a smartphone, have a credit/debit card, or wish essential daily expenses to be handled online or remotely. This is about not discriminating against people with reduced circumstances, and dealing with a real fear by some of building debt with day to day expenses.",
        "background": "Our local council is about to remove cash machines from car parks and replace them with machines that take only card or smartphone payments. At the least there should be a cash or prepaid alternative, or a minimum requirement for cash payment facilities to still be available nearby for daily expense",
