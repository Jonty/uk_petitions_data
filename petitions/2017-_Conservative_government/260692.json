It will still take your money knowing that the specific registration you entered did not enter the car park. \r\n\r\nExample 2: Upon entering your registration it gives you an amount to pay, it is up to you to then increase the amount you are due to pay based on the time you have been parked. What if you have difficulties reading the signs? Or you simply do not know what time you entered the car park?",

Their payment machines are not easy to use and honest mistakes led by genuine confusion are causing people to fall victim to their tactics.",
