        "action": "Make it mandatory for there to be CCTV in special and PRU schools",
        "additional_details": "If schools had CCTV there would be no question about these events. Staff and parents could watch the events unfold and staff can be held to account if needed, or shown to be using resonable force if they were. It is important that there is an unbiased view of the events as when a child needs restraining, emotions run high, as often staff can get hurt. CCTV would show what happened and why and mean that it is easy and transparent to investigate.",
        "background": "Special needs schools and PRU settings often need to use restraint procedures on children to ensure the safety of children and staff. During a restraint, my son has sustained 16 injuries on his face, neck, arms, legs, chest, abdomen and back. CCTV would ensure that incidents can be investigated.",
