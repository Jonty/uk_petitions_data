        "action": "Stop Councils being forced to build twice the houses we need",
        "additional_details": "The Government says we have to build 300,000 houses a year to meet England's future needs. But the ONS which monitors our housing need has officially confirmed we only need 163,000 new houses a year until 2040.\r\n\r\nWe do need new houses, but small, affordable developments. This petition calls on the Government to take notice of new ONS data and change the way housing need is assessed across England, to reduce the number of new houses all Councils are being forced to build over the next 20 years.",
        "background": "We need new houses, but we want affordable new developments to fit into local infrastructure, to help build a sense of community and pride.\r\n\r\nThe countryside is being swamped by huge housing developments. Small rural villages turned into suburbs, through ugly big out of town satellite developments.",
