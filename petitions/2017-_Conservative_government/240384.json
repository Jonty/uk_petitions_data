        "additional_details": "Until 2014,UK driving test candidates could take the driving theory test with translating-voiceovers in non-national languages. Following a flawed consultation this facility was withdrawn. All parts of the driving test must now be taken in English or Welsh. The removal of language support for driving tests is impacting on those attempting to settle in the UK and in particular the cohort of 20,000 refugees being brought in by the Government under its \u2018Vulnerable Person\u2019s Resettlement Schemes\u2019.",
        "background": "Ahmed \u2013 a Syrian refugee and skilled carpenter, has been driving to work using his International Permit. Now expired, to continue driving he must take the UK driving test. His English is not yet good enough to tackle the theory test but he could pass it easily with an Arabic voiceover to assist him",
