It is regrettable that a service and model of care which provided such excellent clinical outcomes for women and their babies was not able to continue .\r\n \r\nStaff have contributed to the amazing care of over 17,000 families in this time and in the achievement of safer outcomes for women and their babies, lower stillbirth rates and premature birth rates, but unfortunately this has not been enough to ensure the continuation of the service. The Government needs to ensure that these services are fully funded.",
