The H1 reaches speeds of 760mph making a quicker commute and and could be built in as few as 40 months for so much less. Due to it being in tubes the UK can invest in renewable energy running wires and panels outside the tube. It could also operate using this energy at would cost far less to run. This is far more viable option than HS2 and should be looked at as a strong alternate",
        "background": "Costs to the project of HS2 have risen to more than \u00a380 billion and could be delayed for another seven years heavily impacting the economy and reaches a top speed of 240 mph ripping through our loved countryside. The project has already had major set backs and should be revised or scrapped entirely",
