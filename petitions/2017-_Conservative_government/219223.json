        "action": "Give children under the age 18 the right to 10 days education free a year",
        "additional_details": "It is acceptable for a school to exclude a child for 2 weeks for bad behaviour, however it is not acceptable for parents to take a child on holiday for 7 days. These are our own children we are raising, It is a right of the parents to have the final say with attendance, with input from the educational side -  Not the other way around.  Please sign this petition and change the education system for families to better the lives of their children. Many endless thanks.",
        "background": "I am a mother of a child recently starting the educational cycle, hoping for children's attendance to be the right of the parents, rather than the school having the final say in what our children can and cannot do. Hope I have opened people's eyes and can make a change.",
