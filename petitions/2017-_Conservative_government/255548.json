        "additional_details": "If the Irish backstop is an issue,  strike out out of the agreed deal and present this back to the EU. Put the ball back in their court. \r\nAlso put a limit on the agreement time to hone focus. \r\nBusinesses will know where they are with WTO rules . Business does not like uncertainty. \r\nComing out with no deal will send the EU into recession. I do not want this,  nor do I want to punish anyone,  least of all ourselves but the EU do want to punish the UK.\r\nThey know it, so let us not be walked over.",
        "background": "The bill goes against the house triggering article 50 where all concerned knew the end date. \r\nBoth Labour and Conservative parties fought the election to honour Brexit.\r\nStand up for democracy and stick to your pledges. 52%  voted for Brexit, 70%+ voted for both parties. HoP just get on with it.",
