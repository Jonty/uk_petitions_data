This will mean that by 2023/24 an extra 345,000 children and young people aged 0-25 will receive mental health support via NHS-funded mental health services. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Government has announced further plans to improve early intervention for mild to moderate mental health conditions, through better join up with schools and colleges. \u201cTransforming Children and Young People\u2019s Mental Health Services: a Green Paper\u201d, published in December 2017, sets out how we are creating a new workforce of Mental Health Support Teams, working in and near schools and colleges, with trained staff to deliver interventions to young people to support their mental health.  \r\n\r\nWe plan to test and evaluate the proposals set out in our Green Paper through trailblazer sites, prior to rolling these out nationally. The first wave of 25 trailblazer sites were announced on 20 December 2018. We will use 12 of these trailblazers to pilot a four-week waiting time from referral to treatment within specialist NHS children\u2019s mental health services.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care",
