The rehabilitated then volunteer at the centre - cleaning, laundry, cooking, outreach - in return for shelter until homed\r\nOnce homed, they work for the council, doing the jobs the council say they have no resources for - such as helping to refurbish further empty homes and buildings and community service in return for ongoing welfare.",

Shelter should be available 24 hours a day to prevent returning to street. If there is space enough in freezing weather, there should be space all of the time.",
