        "additional_details": "These days it\u2019s easy to speed in modern cars & the police know it so when traveling to work one day in a safe manner they\u2019ll be waiting for you tucked in on some layby.\r\n\r\nLaw abiding citizens caught by these mobile speed traps feel they\u2019ve been deliberately targeted & criminalised by the organisation set out to protect is in for gain. Millions of drivers fined for speeding over the years have seen nothing in return and whilst this continues what improvements have we seen from all these fines?",
        "background": "The use of mobile speed cameras is increasing generating masses of revenue for local authorities.
