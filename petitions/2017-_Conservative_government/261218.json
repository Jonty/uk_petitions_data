We're not sure what you mean by making punishments for animal cruelty and abuse equal to those for cruelty and abuse in relation to a child because we're not sure which offences against children you're referring to.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions about animal cruelty and abuse, which you might like to sign if they call for things you want the UK Government or Parliament to do. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.
