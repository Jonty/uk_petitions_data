        "action": "Make the use of Smoke Bombs legal in UK Football Grounds to improve atmosphere",
        "additional_details": "Although it is understood that smoke bombs are seen as pyrotechnics they are much less dangerous than the use of flares and fireworks which may cause a fire. On the other hand smoke bombs have very rarely caused a fire. If this was to become legal there should only be a specific place as to where the smoke grenades can be set off, this should be in the most open area of the ground should then be sign posted to make other supporters aware, if they do not wish to come into contact with the smoke.",
        "background": "Whilst the use of smoke bombs in football grounds tend to be legal in many parts of Europe they are not in the UK. Making the use of smoke bombs in football grounds in the Uk will vastly help to improve the atmosphere of games and attendances will see a rise as a result.",
