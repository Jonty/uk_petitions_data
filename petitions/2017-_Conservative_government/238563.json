        "background": "In small towns there should be more for the local youth to do, somewhere to temporarily let go of stress. Towns such as Bedale, NYCC  have a limited amount of activities for teenagers to do (one night a week youth centre-usually overcrowded) leaving them no where to go making them feel isolated.",
