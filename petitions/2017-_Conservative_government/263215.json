Transparency would be fantastic. I know many organisations do offer feedback, and that's the kind of forward-thinking we need nowadays, but to offer nothing to those who are qualified and took time to apply, it seems only fair.",

Without wishing to sound self-entitled, to be turned down for a job with a salary of \u00a318,000 - \u00a320,000, whilst fulfilling all criteria, is bizarre.",

You could start a new petition asking for that to happen, if that is what you would like the Government and Parliament to do."
