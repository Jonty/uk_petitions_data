        "additional_details": "It's no wonder the government cannot agree on Brexit. Yes the referendum results were in favour of Leave but only marginally. You're elected to represent ALL British people. It's like saying you would only govern in the interest of women, not men. The least you can do is appoint 2 experts from every department, a Brexiteer & a Remainer, to assess & report on their findings. Only then can you truly act responsibly & propose a solution that unites us again. Brits deserve better than this circus.",
        "background": "Regardless of vote, we're all fed up with the uncertainty of Brexit. Instead of squabbling, the government should make INFORMED decisions. Take time to carefully consider the impact of leaving the EU on EVERY single department. THEN put forward what is in the best interest of this wonderful nation.",
