        "additional_details": "Between now (28-March-2019) and 1st January 2020, MPs have 85 days of holiday. If I were an MP, I would want to use this time on important issues which have been postponed because of Brexit. If we, the voters, fall behind on our work, we are expected to give up holiday and work overtime. Why shouldn't MPs do the same?\r\n\r\nLets see how much our MPs really do care; is representing their voters important enough to them to give up their holiday so that they can end austerity and sort out the NHS?",
        "background": "MPs wasted hundreds of hours of parliamentary time on Brexit for their own ends; instead of focusing on negotiating a deal, they have been grandstanding to boost their careers. MPs have 85 more days of recess during 2019; they should lose this recess so that this time can be used on important issues",
