        "additional_details": "I have been sectioned under the mental health act since the smoking ban came into effect. It now enforces severely unwell people to quit smoking suddenly, with no choice but to comply. Whilst under section you are not permitted to leave the ward and there is not a designated smoking area in any ward.\r\nThis wasn't always the case, in fact there are still designated smoking areas In all mental health units that are now disused. It's cruel to force a person to quit smoking at such a difficult point in their lives.",
        "background": "Remove the smoking ban in mental health units in hospitals across the country and allow mental health patients a very basic freedom of choice. \r\nA designated smoking area for psychiatric patients isn't much to ask for, especially when the old smoking areas are still there.",
