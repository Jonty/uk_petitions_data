It is quite literally eroding our society to the point where no one will trust anyone else and division and hatred will rule. \r\n\r\nWith the advent of the internet, false accusations can be enshrined against a victim online forever. The media should not be able to name people who have not been charged or sentenced. The police should properly verify their sources.",

In other cases, people who are accused of making false accusations may be prosecuted for wasting police time.\r\n\t\r\nWe're therefore not sure how you would like the law to be changed.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
