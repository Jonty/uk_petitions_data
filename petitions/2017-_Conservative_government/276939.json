        "additional_details": "School uniforms are designed to give a sense of belonging. While school uniforms are not a problem they should be restricted to items that are clearly visible such as sweatshirts or ties Items such as trousers and skirts are designed to profit academies and add nothing to the appearance or function of the uniform. \r\n\r\nIf such items are to be insisted on then schools should not be allowed a monopoly on supply and alternative suppliers must be offered to prevent low income families suffering.",
        "background": "Schools, particularly academies, are enforcing stricter school uniforms lately with many insisting on logos on items such as trousers and skirts that are barely noticeable. These items are often expensive and don\u2019t have suppliers outside of the school themselves which capitalise on the profits.",
