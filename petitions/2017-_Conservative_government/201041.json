        "additional_details": "1. It is not enough time to make somebody feel comfortable in their own home\r\n2. It is rushed\r\n3. Half hour is much better and realistic\r\n4. Carers are in such a rush during that call to get to the next call, leading them to be stressed, late to their next. Accident prone\r\n5. Elderly especially find this confusing if they are living with Alzheimer's or Dementia.\r\n6. Mistakes are made. There is no time to double check everything is complete and the individual is happy.",
        "background": "Majority of care companies advertise '15 MINUTE CALLS' like it's a good thing? This needs to change. I have witnessed rushed calls, unhappy clients and mistakes made all with these 15 minute calls. This is not enough time to make the individual feel comfortable. Let alone fill out their paperwork.",
