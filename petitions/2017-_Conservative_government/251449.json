While it might have been preferable not to hold a referendum, we cannot turn the clock back. Attempts to cancel Brexit will result in massive disillusionment and damage.\r\nOptions at present include -\r\n- A no-deal BREXIT which would be destructive and economically harmful \r\n- A long delay to BREXIT which would be pointless \r\n- The deal!",

It allows: \r\n- Trade deals elsewhere in the world, \r\n- Restricts free movement of people (important to Brexit voters)\r\n- Respects the referendum result,  \r\n- No hard border in Ireland.",
