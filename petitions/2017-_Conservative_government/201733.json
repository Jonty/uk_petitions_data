        "additional_details": "Previously the Home Office said:\r\n\"A passport is a document for travel. Its fundamental purpose would change if it were to be used to identify a parental relationship.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, everybody: person, company & institution, accepts the passport as a form of identity to prove who they are. \r\n\r\nIn today's globalised world where parents don't share surnames, displaying the parents' names on children's passports would make it safer, more secure & easier for border control reducing hold ups & red tape.",
        "background": "From 2009 to 2014, an estimated 600,000 women were stopped and questioned when travelling causing panic, stress and even missed flights because their surname was not the same as their child's. It could all be solved with a small change to children's passport design; display both parents' surnames.",
