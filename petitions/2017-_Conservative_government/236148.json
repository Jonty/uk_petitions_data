        "additional_details": "As a constituent of his, I can attest that John Redwood MP is undeserving of this nomination. He has failed to represent his constituents by respecting their collective views, has lied to the media, and has advised investors with Charles Stanley (his employer to the tune of \u00a3180k/annum) that actions he actively condones and promotes make the UK an unattractive investment.",
        "background": "Honours should be reserved for those who dedicate their lives towards helping people, yet career politicians with second jobs paying 6-7 figure salaries plus bonuses (and therefore extraordinary conflicts of interest) are regularly queued up for honours.",
