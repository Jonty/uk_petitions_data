        "additional_details": "EU citizens in the UK who wanted to vote in the EU elections, had to fill in the UC1 form and return it by 7 May. However, even a week before 7 May, many had not yet received this form. Others returned the form in time, but councils did not process them before the deadline. Many UK citizens living abroad were sent voting forms too late by UK authorities. There is evidence that voters were disenfranchised as a result. We therefore call for a public, independent inquiry into why the relevant information was not provided in a timely manner and on the remedies that should be provided in this situation.",
