        "action": "Adopt a stance of permanent military neutrality, as a nation state.",
        "additional_details": "Since the time of the Peace of Westphalia, the military has lost two of its three purposes. Internal revolt and crime being dealt with by local police forces, the right of conquest being outlawed per jus cogens, only self defense remains. Neutrality is a natural and rational position when self defense is the only legal use of arms. \r\n\r\nLargely, neutral countries such as Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, Finland spend 0.5-1% of GDP on their militaries. That equates to \u00a320-30bn in savings per year.",
        "background": "Military intervention has been largely unpopular and entirely ineffective at ending the issues it claims plague the world. Conquest is forbidden as a peremptory norm, aggression is mostly too. Self defense implies neutrality, saving 1-1.5% of GDP each year to spend on other sectors of the economy.",
