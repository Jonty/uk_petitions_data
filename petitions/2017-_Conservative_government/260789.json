        "action": "Ban and fine the import and sale of palm oil to the United Kingdom",
        "additional_details": "Demand for palm oil increases pressure to destroy rainforests and wetlands for plantations.\r\n\r\nRainforest and wetland destruction releases greenhouse gases and reduces carbon capture capacity.\r\n\r\nSlash and burn deforesting increases local air pollution and related health risks to locals.\r\n\r\nRainforest and wetland destruction puts endangered plant and animal species at risk of extinction.\r\n\r\nDeforesting denies indigenous people right to their home. \r\n\r\nWhy is it legal for the UK to contribute to this?",
        "background": "Import reinforces and increases dependence on harmful palm oil production. Ban of import and fine of ban evasion allows greater independence from palm oil. Independence supports choice of sustainable alternatives instead of contributing to pollution, species endangering, and indigenous rights abuse.",
