        "additional_details": "It is an absolute scandal that this Tory government is forcing younger across the UK to live on poverty pay by refusing to give under 25s the basic protection of the National Living Wage.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue of fairness and equality. If you do the same job you should be paid at the same rate regardless of your age, and everyone should be paid at least the living wage so that they have enough money to feed themselves and cover the basics, like their rent and bills.",
        "background": "The Government's National Living Wage does not apply to those under the age of 25, who can be paid as little as \u00a33.50 per hour if they are an apprentice or \u00a34.05 otherwise.",
