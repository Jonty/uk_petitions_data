        "additional_details": "There are organisations such as CAMHS, however it is becoming increasingly common that when you reach mid 16-18 years of age you are lost in a net, where the referral will take too long and you have to wait until you're 18 to receive more resources and help. 20% of adolescents will experience a mental health problem, this is constantly increasing with more and more pressures of today's society. Young people need the support of trained professionals, mental health should not be pushed aside and they have a right to appropriate resources and should not have to wait until being 18.",
        "background": "In today's society there's an increasing rise in mental health issues in young people, 70% of young people do not receive appropriate resources. Many of these young people will not be able to receive appropriate help and resources as they are lost in the net of being mid 16-18.",
