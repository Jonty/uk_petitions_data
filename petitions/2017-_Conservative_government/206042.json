        "additional_details": "People with mental health conditions often have a pet be that a cat or dog. This pet is in almost all cases the one thing which gets them through each day. \r\nI want this petition to pass as at present emotional support animals are not seen as assistance animals but seem largely ignored by proffesionals as they are not trained in specific tasks but in reality the animals does need to be trained. It needs to me trained to enjoy hugs and affection and to spot emotional shifts and the proper responses",
        "background": "It has been proven many times over through various studies that animals help the mental wellbeing of people. \r\nFor those of us with mental health conditions this is even more true. An animal, and this is all animals not just dogs, are sometimes the only reason a person may get up in the morning.",
