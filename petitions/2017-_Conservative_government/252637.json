        "additional_details": "The ballot paper could be like a standard GE paper. But at the bottom of the sheet it could have sensible options on Brexit. Either a binary Leave or Remain, or a preferential choice with several options. \r\n\r\nThe General Election PR system should be a system which ensures every vote counts. For example the Party List PR system, where electoral seats are allocated according to vote share. Thresholds should be set to rule out extremist parties.\r\n\r\nThis would break the deadlock and make voting fairer.",
        "background": "Brexit has wasted two years of political energy while splitting parties and the nation. The two party system has failed. Solve both issues with a simultaneous 'Proportional Representation' General Election and a 2nd Referendum on the same ballot paper.",
