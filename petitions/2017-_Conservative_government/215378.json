        "additional_details": "Some of the things C2C customers have suffered from of late include:\r\n\r\n- Being ejected at stations like Barking or Upminster with no explanation.\r\n- Being lied to that delay repay covers your total journey when the online system ONLY takes into account train time.\r\n- Broken trains on a regular basis.\r\n- Cancelled trains on a regular basis.\r\n- Shortened trains every day since last summer.\r\n- Delays on a weekly basis that do not 'qualify' for a refund.",
        "background": "Since Trentalia took over the C2C contract the service has become so bad it is directly affecting customers lives. Frequent train malfunctions, delays and staff on the social media channels lying to the customers about being able to claim delay repay are rendering the service unusable.",
