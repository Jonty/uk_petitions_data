        "additional_details": "Companies have been doing this for ages to try to maximise profits, but it is wrong! My research has shown that some packets can be up to 72% full of AIR. As the customer, we pay for produce, not air, and expect to get more than 28% of a packet of crisps. Producers place additives in the bags, such as nitrogen which make the snacks go out of date much slower than usual, the average \"life-span\" of a packet of crisps is 55 days, enough time to be packaged, bought, and eaten.",
        "background": "when buying a packet of crisps you expect the packet to be at least 3/4 full, but no. The packet is mostly full of air. This is annoying for all of us, as we pay for food, not air.",
