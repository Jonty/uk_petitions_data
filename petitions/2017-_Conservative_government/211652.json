        "additional_details": "I believe that lowering the age and giving woman the knowledge about cervical cancer will enable all woman the right to live. There is little to no awareness about cervical cancer.\r\nby reducing the age of smear tests and cervical screening today we can save lives, we can tackle cell changes early and prevent cervical cancer. \r\nIf I can do anything with my life I want to make this change happen, it's too late for me but it's not too late for the next generation of young ladies.",

I believe that the age of screening should be lowered to age 16 to enable all woman to detect cell changes and prevent cancer.\r\n.",
