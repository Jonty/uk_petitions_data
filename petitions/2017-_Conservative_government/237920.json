        "action": "On departure from the EU, join the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]",
        "additional_details": "EFTA is made up of four countries: Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein (which are also members of the EEA) and Switzerland, enjoying near-frictionless trade with the EU.\r\n\r\nThis petition seeks parliament to consider the benefits of EFTA membership and how membership will deliver on the referendum result of 2016 by allowing the UK to strike new trade deals with external markets whilst protecting jobs and continuing current trade with European partners through continued access to the common market.",
        "background": "The UK parliament is in deadlock over on what terms the United Kingdom should leave the European Union, both government and opposition failing to make a compromise in the national interest.\r\n\r\nThe European Free Trade Association [EFTA] acts as an alternative way forward to break the Brexit impasse.",
