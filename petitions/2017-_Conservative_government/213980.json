        "action": "Privatise the NHS.",
        "additional_details": "The NHS costs the average person \u00a35,000 per year in taxes; the average person goes to the doctor's 4 times per year. If this was privatised then you would pay roughly \u00a350 per visit, which is \u00a3200 per year. (This is based off American prices converted to pounds.) That is a lot of money to be saved per person. This extra money could grant lower taxes or more money going to other areas.",
        "background": "The privatisation of the NHS would mean taxes could be cut immensely or go to other areas. The privatisation would save money for the people as it will create more competition in the private market forcing lower prices for the competitive advantage of having cheaper care for the people.",
