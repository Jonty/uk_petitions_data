        "additional_details": "Government funding of Arts has fallen by 30% over the last 6 years, to just \u00a39.8m revenue funding. Lottery funding fallen by 25% in that time. While all neighbours have increased arts budgets, citizens of NI endure cuts, risking 5,500 jobs, our economy, our tourist offering and crucially opportunities for every aspect of our society.\r\n\r\nWe reject these cuts and instead demand re-investment and parity of funding with our neighbouring jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.artsmatterni.co.uk/the-news",
        "background": "Public funding of the Arts in Northern Ireland currently lags well behind all its neighbours in the UK (and indeed the Republic of Ireland) by 31%, on average per person. With NO NI GOVERNMENT, civil servants have proposed further cuts, widening this gap and threatening the survival of the arts.",
