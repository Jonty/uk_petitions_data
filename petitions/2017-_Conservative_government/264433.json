        "action": "abolish the television licence for all over 75",
        "additional_details": "To recently spend over \u00a348million to provide security for a USA president and take licences off over 75's is a monumental disgrace. It appears money can always be found for outlandish use but not for TV Licences .All pensioners relay on their television for company and at the present rates per year will not be able to afford them.It should not be a means tested facility these people deserve a small token for the work and taxes they have put into the country.Its time for the government to act now",
        "background": "As publicised in the conservative manifesto the free television licence aged 75 arrangement should have been maintained until the end of this parliament. Instead they gave the decision to the BBC and washed their hands of it claiming it still covered poor pensioners on Pension credit.",
