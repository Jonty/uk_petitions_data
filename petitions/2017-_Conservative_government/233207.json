        "additional_details": "We really need to train youngsters and adults in the dangers of cold water shock, this can be triggered by jumping into the water which holds its temperature between 10 degrees - 15 degrees, \r\n\r\nThe biggest danger is inhaling water and drowning, even if the water is flat, calm and you know how to swim. Cold Water Shock causes an immediate loss of breathing control. You take one or more huge gasps, followed by hyperventilation \u2013 very rapid breathing that is hard or impossible for you to control.",
        "background": "In 2018 we have seen a increase in the amount of deaths in water from cold water shock and drowning, This increase is due to the hot weather we have had. This makes it more worrying that none really trains members of the community or school children on the dangers of open water and how to stay safe.",
