        "additional_details": "People in the military should not have to pay UK taxes or national insurance when abroad or be taxed on any bonus payments they receive such as the commitment bonus for staying in military service or receiving extra money when being sent away from home as they aren\u2019t even in the country at that time So why should they pay towards it especially since they deploy for months at a time where they don\u2019t get to see family or friends and it isn\u2019t pleasant when they do go away.",
        "background": "Military personnel pay taxes on bonuses they receive for staying in service and any extra money they receive when leaving their loved ones behind to go and serve abroad, yet they get taxed when not even in the country so I want to abolish this and have them only pay when in the country.",
