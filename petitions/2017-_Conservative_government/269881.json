The maximum penalty for an adult carrying a knife is 4 years in prison and an unlimited fine. We aren't sure how you'd like the law to change. You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/buying-carrying-knives\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n"
