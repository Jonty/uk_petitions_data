        "additional_details": "The 1971 Immigration Act gave people already settled in Britain Indefinite leave to Remain. These children are now adults and most are struggling to gather enough documents to convince the Home Office that they arrived before the cut off point. Some are being taken to Immigration Removal Centres, refused cancer treatment, becoming homeless and dismissed from their place of work as well as being refused any recourse to public funds which they have paid into for the past 50 plus years.",
        "background": "Commonwealth citizens who were invited to relocate during the UK's recruitment drive are now in their retirement years facing deportation. They entered the UK legally to help build post war Britain & have paid taxes in the UK. They are now discovering naturalisation was necessary but never happened.",
