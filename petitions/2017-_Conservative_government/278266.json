To do so now will be enormously damaging and would reduce the UK to a vassal state of the USA. We need to stop the whole thing, rethink the situation, and revisit it once the febrile heat has cooled. There may be a case to go ahead with Brexit, but it has not yet been made, demonstrating the intellectual weakness of this current adventure..",

If we are to do this thing, we must be sure of the will of the people, and must have a proper plan in place. Time needed for that.",
