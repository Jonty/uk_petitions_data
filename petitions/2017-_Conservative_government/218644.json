We need to try and combat that corruption, especially when there are serious accusations, of a patients well being, or cause of death, or mistreatment in any way. Hospitals can very easily get away with anything, with how the current justice system is set up. That needs to change",
        "background": "Two staff members at alderhay hospital had their careers ruined, not only at their workplace in alderhay, but in the UK. Staff are therefore terrified to speak out now. There should be anonymity for staff, who raise serious concerns, to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again, and to remove that fear",
