        "additional_details": "As a national broadcaster, the BBC is expected to be fearless, objective and impartial in its reporting of news and current affairs programming.\r\nThe BBC often avoids or downplays politically sensitive news items, allows statements to go unchallenged and uses false equivalence to counter balance expert opinion.\r\nThese are not the attributes expected of a national broadcaster in a leading democratic nation.",
        "background": "BBC news and current affairs programmes are no longer of high quality.\r\nIn an age of austerity where ordinary people are struggling to make ends meet, a licence fee of \u00a3150 is no longer justified for substandard broadcasting.",
