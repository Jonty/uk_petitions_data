If the parent with custody neglected to feed or clothe a child it wouldnt go unnoticed. I speak for all single parents who break their backs to provide for their children without support from the estranged parent who has as much parental rights but far less parental responsibility. Its simply unfair. Take away their p.rights",

Estranged fathers and mothers should be forced by law regardless of employment status to pay a minimum financial contribution towards their offsprings upbringing and prison should be a consequence of non compliance",
