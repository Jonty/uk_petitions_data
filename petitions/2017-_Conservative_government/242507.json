        "additional_details": "MPs are elected on many accounts which includes them as 1) them as an individual 2) the party they represent and 3) the manifesto the campaign under. \r\n\r\nIf they quit as a sitting MP because they disagree with the party and their manifesto then they break their campaign promises. It is not what the electorate voted for. As a result, if they quit the party as a sitting MP then a By-Election should automatically be triggered.",

When they quit the party while they are a sitting MP, they are no longer in line with their constituents vote and therefore a By-Election should be triggered.",
