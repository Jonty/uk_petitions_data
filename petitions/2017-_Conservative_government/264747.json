The suicide rate among that group, 3.5 per 100,000 people, was also the highest on record, and well up on the rate of 2.1 per 100,000 in 2010.\u201d",

Some of these young people abuse drugs and alcohol as a way of coping with mental health as they suffer in silence without anyone knowing unless they speak up about it. This needs to change!",
