        "action": "Charge a plastic tax to companies who sell plastic packaged products/produce",
        "additional_details": "The sugar tax acts as encouragement to choose low sugar options when shopping and so similarly, companies can be encouraged to change their packaging with a plastic tax being added to their costs. In turn, the ocean and planet will benefit greatly. It's difficult for the general public to reduce their plastic use when everything is sold in plastic, so this tax would serve to get companies to provide more options in terms of packaging.",
        "background": "So many companies use plastic for packaging, whether selling food, cleaning products, drinks or other items. The climate is at a critical point where plastic production needs to be lowered and recycling encouraged and promoted. Introducing a plastic tax, much like the sugar tax, can help this.",
