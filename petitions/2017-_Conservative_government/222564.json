        "additional_details": "Many of these migrant families are fleeing persecution in their home countries and the children are the innocent victims. \r\n\r\nThere is no US law requiring migrant families to be treated in this way. The UN has called the practice 'unconscionable', equating it to 'government-sanctioned child abuse'. \r\n\r\nIn the light of this barbaric and inhumane treatment of children, we petition the UK Government not to allow Donald Trump to visit the UK.",
        "background": "The policies of Donald Trump's administration are cruelly separating migrant children, some as young as two, from their parents and placing them in cages at detention centres.",
