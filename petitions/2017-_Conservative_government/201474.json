        "action": "Continue to recognise and allow the Inbound European Au Pair program post Brexit",
        "additional_details": "Thousands of hard-working parents rely on European Au pairs to enable them to juggle their work life balance.  Au Pairs receive pocket money and live as part of a family to experience British culture and family life and to learn English. This affordable program provides UK families with flexible childcare and enables young Europeans to study English and be introduced to British values at no cost to our government.  Brexit must ensure the continuation of this valuable cultural exchange programme.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned and BAPAA, are greatly concerned that the UK government has not prioritised the importance of Au Pairs to the British economy during the Brexit negotiations.  Our formal representations to government ministers have been ignored and yet Au Pairs are vital to the British economy.",
