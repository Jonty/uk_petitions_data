        "additional_details": "Closing the Custody leaves not only residents vulnerable to crime as there will be instances where all the officers are off the division transporting Prisoners, but also officers single crewing having to transport potentially violent prisoners. \r\nThe P.C.C is proposing to build a new super police station in Derby at a cost of 9.5 million pounds, which H.P residents will not benefit from, yet refuses to refurbish Buxton Custody suite which would be a fraction of that cost.",
        "background": "Derbyshire P.C.C is closing Buxton Custody, this will take much needed police officers away from the High Peak area especially at night, officers will be driving hour or more taking prisoners to Chesterfield and Greater Manchester Police Stations.",
