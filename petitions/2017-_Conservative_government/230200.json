        "additional_details": "Lack of treatment results in more detrimental social issues, and more than half of young people are embarrassed about mental health. The introduction of anonymous services would help students feel less isolated and lonely about their problems. As we are young people from ethnic minotities, we understand that there is still a stigma around mental health, therefore our proposition will help anyone combat these issues.",
        "background": "We believe that support for mental health sufferers under the age of 18 should be one of the most important aspects of support offered during years of compulsory education. Shockingly, we have found that 75% of young people in the UK with a mental health issue are not recieving treatment.",
