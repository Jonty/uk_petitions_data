        "additional_details": "The YPG is already a struggling fighting force, backed by several NATO countries in the fight against the international terrorist organisation Daesh. Unlike the YPG whose policies preach equality, peace and democracy, Daesh present an international danger to any country that supports western ideals of freedom and rights for all. The military might of turkey greatly outweighs that of the YPG, which already faces a difficult and long battle against Daesh, one which is greatly hindered by the targeted smart bombs dropped by Turkish jets, constant artillery barrages and mechanized troops on the Turkish border.\r\nmassacres and repression:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey\r\nOperation 'Olive Branch'\r\nhttp://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/200120181",
        "background": "The Turkish government has insisted for many years that the YPG, a group based mainly of the Kurdish people, a race historically oppressed by the Turkish government, is a terrorist organisation, going as far to blame them for domestic terrorist events in Turkey without any prior evidence or backing.",
