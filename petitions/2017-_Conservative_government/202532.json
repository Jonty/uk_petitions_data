        "additional_details": "In the second most recent, the 2015 General Election, Conservatives received 36.9% of the popular vote, however, received 51% of the seats in parliament (which translates to 100% of the power as they received a majority).\r\nAlthough receiving a majority in parliament, the Conservatives did not receive a majority of UK citizens wanting them in power.\r\nAn even more extreme example, UKIP, who received 12.6% of the popular vote, only received one seat (0.15% of the total seats) in parliament. (Source: http://www.ukpolitical.info/2015.htm)",
        "background": "FPTP is the current voting system the UK uses in its General Elections. FPTP is very 2-party orientation and is ideal in a country with no minor parties. With MMP, parliament can be much more representative of what UK citizens actually want and not restricted to tactical voting.",
