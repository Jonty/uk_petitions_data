        "additional_details": "Early in the last century in Glasgow, Razor Gangs were rife, cutting and slashing each other with cut throat razors. In the 1950's this behaviour had started to raise its ugly head yet again. The Judge Lord Carmont at that time saw it fit to issue 10 year sentences to those caught carrying. The impact on this crime was almost instantaneous and the Razor Gangs soon phased out.\r\n\r\nIt is also well documented that by carrying a knife that person is more likely to be a victim of a stabbing.",
        "background": "Too often we hear of the devastating effects knife crime is having on peoples lives. Families losing loved ones to cowardly attacks by malicious gangs and individuals who use knives to kill or harm others. There does not appear to be enough of a deterrent to stop this behaviour.",
