For the rest, in times of real desperation, when confronted with serious family matters and other  life changing issues, turning to the law is out of the question.\r\nStraightforward divorces and child arrangement legal fees can typically cost in excess of \u00a320,000! Complicated ones much more.\r\nWith so many MPs in the legal profession it won't be easy!\r\nSign this petition and give everybody affordable law \u2013 a basic human right.",
        "background": "Make the law affordable to everyday people. Most Solicitors charge a minimum of \u00a3250 + vat per hour. Barristers will cost you even more. Abusing their monopolistic position to extort vast sums. \r\nSCANDALOUS EXPLOITATION!!  Meaning only the rich can afford to go to court and be represented.",
