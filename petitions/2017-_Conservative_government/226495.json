You can\u2019t talk, eat, and  struggle to drink. It can also lead to liver failure and Vitamin D and iron deficiencies. \r\n \r\nThere is a treatment that works and other countries are using it but NICE has said no, because it\u2019s too expensive. We are pleading for the government to fund this treatment and give EPP sufferers a chance of a normal life\r\n",

You can't go out without covering head to toe, just to be able to leave the house. Inside all blinds must be closed, also lights to be checked. No prevention or cure.",
