        "additional_details": "When a child is born 1 parent claims the Child Benefit. At the direct time of separation in a 50/50% contact scenario only the \"resident parent\" can claim the Child Tax Credit benefit due to being in receipt of the Child Benefit. End the inequality! Non-resident parents and children deserve a fairer system.",
        "background": "After a separation a \"non-resident\" parent with shared 50/50 caring is not entitled to claim Child Tax Credits easily and fairly under the current system. This is causing children to live half their lives in poverty. ",
