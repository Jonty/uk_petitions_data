Following this he was diagnosed with psychosis but was in denial about his health. I was told we cannot help you unless your son wants help, but he was too ill to realise this. I was blocked time and again. The MCA test must be amended to include: a patient's lack of insight into their own condition and inability to process information while they are acutely or chronically mentally unwell.",

We need to amend the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) to empower parents/carers/advocates to get their adult children the help they need.",
