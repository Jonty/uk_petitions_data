        "additional_details": "Furthermore, UK citizens can obtain student finance to fund their expenses, however this is not the same for international students. The UK institutions and government generates a lot of revenue from international students, evidenced in the international student fees being doubled the amount for Home students. Therefore it is only fair that a student who has spent his life savings in millions to acquire education abroad, be allowed to obtain at-least 1 year work experience.",

Given the fact that their country is underdeveloped, especially the African countries, it leaves no hope for the implementation of the knowledge they have gained. work after studies can help them kick start their futures.",
