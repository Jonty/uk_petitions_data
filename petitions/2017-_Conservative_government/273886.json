In turn, this will reduce the amount of people parking in bays without children.\r\n\r\nThe badges could be provided with a child\u2019s red book at birth expecting on the child\u2019s 12 birthday (or appropriate age where Parent & Child parking is no longer necessary)",

I am calling on the government to create a badge, similar to disabled parking, for parents to apply for.",
