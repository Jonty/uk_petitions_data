        "additional_details": "As a food teacher we have limited time to teach the basic skills to cook & why some foods aren't good for health. I am a diabetic who didn't understand the health implications of diet until it was too late as an adult. Families now have more than one adult at work, making time for cooking limited. The ease of ready meals & take aways mean people don\u2019t get healthy nutritious meals or understand the risks of eating too much fat, sugar and salt & the quantities they are eating in their food.",
