        "additional_details": "Their is no legislation currently with motorcycles, mopeds & trikes. Requiring this small adaptation would cost very little to the manufacturers but would be a massive help to both bikers & the communities we all live in. Humberside police launched opyellowfin because of the sheer number of thefts in our region alone. opyellowfin was created because myself & my wife made such a loud noise about it with the local media. It is now time we all started shouting.",

In the 80\u2019s & 90\u2019s the problem was joyriders & stolen cars, cars have multilayered security systems helping to cut down the number of thefts.",
