        "additional_details": "There is a massive surge of dog attacks involving horses in public places. It is a well known fact that this is an issue. I am a dog owner with 2 beautiful dogs and I agree that dogs should be kept on leads in public places. Too many dogs are not trained and allowed to attack other animals. I could have ended up in hospital on the 7th January. I was very lucky. \r\n\r\nThe owner blamed me and my partner for the incident. We have the same right to be on that beach. \r\n\r\nKeep dogs on leads in public places",
        "background": "On the 7th January 2018, I was riding on Redcar beach with my partner. We were quietly trotting through the deep water when an English bull terrier started to attack my horse. The owner did nothing. My horse ran for its life and I fell off. The owner was aggressive and unapologetic.",
