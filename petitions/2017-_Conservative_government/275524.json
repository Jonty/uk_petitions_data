        "action": "Debate as to whether the United Kingdom should have a Written Constitution",
        "additional_details": "One recent incidence is where the Speaker has \"bent\" the constitution to a very large degree for his own ends, i.e. to ensure that motions are tabled by those who would not normally be allowed to do so.  This has led to decisions by the electorate and the government to be overturned.  This is NOT democracy.\r\n\r\nWith a written constitution, there would be no misunderstanding, interpretations or \"behind the scenes\" skulduggery that has made our Parliament the \"laughing stock\" of the civilised world.",
        "background": "After the recent debacle in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, it is apparent that our unwritten constitution is open to \"interpretation\".  This has meant that a Member of Parliament is able to use the current precedent and interpret it as he/she wishes. This is not democracy.",
