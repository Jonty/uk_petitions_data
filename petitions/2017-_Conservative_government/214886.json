        "additional_details": "Lauren Southern is a Canadian born journalist who rose to fame online when she held up a sign explaining why she does not identify as a feminist. \r\nSince that photograph, she went on to work for the right-wing media outlet 'Rebel Media', which she has since left to pursue a career as an independent journalist/YouTube personality.",
        "background": "Lauren Southern is a right-wing Canadian journalist who has been banned from entering the UK by the UK Home Office. \r\nWhilst she does hold views that are deemed controversial, the decision to ban her is unprincipled, immoral, and an anti-productive way to go about dismantling racism.",
