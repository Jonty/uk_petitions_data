It reported that, whilst we have met/are due to meet our short terms targets, we are not going to meet our target for the period of 2023-27 and that it will require existing progress to be supplemented by more challenging measures.\r\nThe current proposal for the Committee to consult widely, with citizens, industry, business and academia and to deliver advice, expected within six months, to the government on how to respond to the IPCC report SR15 does not meet the urgency of the crisis.",
