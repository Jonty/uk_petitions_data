Without this in place, government bodies need not show 'Due Regard' to the effects that these policies could cause the poorest people in society.\r\n\r\nPolicies such as 'UC' , 'PIP' and other capped or newly implemented benefits might not have existed!\r\n\r\n'Positive Action' in recruitment could have helped get more working class into university or careers with severe underrepresentation. Unfortunately, this list goes on.\r\n\r\nSo let's put this right, to be a truly inclusive society, and implement the Equality Act 2010 in its entirity. Only then will everyone be treated fairly.\r\n\r\nSHARE AND SIGN FOR OUR FUTURES \ud83d\udc4d\r\n",
