        "additional_details": "Over the past few years terror attacks on Britain & other parts of the world have became more frequent and the attacks are becoming more catastrophic and affecting families around the world. 2001 was the beginning and now it should be brought to an end. Letting these people back into the UK would lead to more attacks which shouldn\u2019t be allowed. I am all for people getting second chances but in this circumstance feel strongly against it.",
        "background": "There has been a few British citizens that have left the UK voluntarily to join ISIS in Syria & now due to changes in thier circumstances want to return to the UK & have British passports & be a British citizen. I strongly feel that this is a mistake & there is a hidden agenda involved.",
