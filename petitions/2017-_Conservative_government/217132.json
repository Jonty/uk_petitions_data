        "additional_details": "As evidence, we can note that the EU commission has begun proceedings against both countries due to Hungary\u2019s violations of citizens\u2019 rights under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and Poland\u2019s violation of the rule of law under Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. The UK Government remains silent on the issue, when it should act to protect democracy in Europe for the sake of peace, prosperity, and justice.",
        "background": "The Polish and Hungarian governments have undermined democracy in their respective countries. Poland has compromised the independence of the judiciary, while Hungary has restricted freedom of the press and the funding of pro-democracy NGOs. The UK Government should speak out against this.",
