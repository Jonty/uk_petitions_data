        "action": "Change the law on same sex parental registrations to child birth certificates",
        "additional_details": "Government states same sex relationships would have the same rights as straight people. However, when a same sex couple choose to have a child privately, outside of a registered clinic, then only the biological mother can be named on the birth certificate unless they were married before conception. This is not fair. A straight couple do not have to be married to have both names on the birth certificate. Both parents regardless of sexual orientation or marriage should be on the birth certificate.",
        "background": "Me and my now wife were not married prior to the conception of our son, who was conceived privately outside of a clinical environment. This meant that she was unable to be named on the birth certificate which means that she holds no parental responsibility legally.",
