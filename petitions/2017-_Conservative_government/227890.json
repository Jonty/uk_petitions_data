        "additional_details": "There is no significant effort being put in acknowledging and recognition, all the effort, sacrifice of service men and women who fought in WWII under B.H.C. These people are almost gone and are still feeling betrayed and forgotten, unappreciated. It's one of the last chances for the British Government to change the mistake of the historical decisions and make it good for the future and for the post Brexit relations between Poles living in the UK and Britons.",
        "background": "During the war, more than 200,000 members of the Polish Armed Forces in the West had fought under British High Command. The British government did not specifically invite representatives of the Polish forces that had fought under British High Command for the London Victory Celebrations of 1946",
