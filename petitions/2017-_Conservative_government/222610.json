        "additional_details": "This \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 policy has seen over 1995 children separated from their parents.  This is no different when Jews were housed in camps and this practice must be stopped.\r\n\r\nThe UK is due to host Trump on July 13th.  He will meet with the Queen and the PM.  \r\n\r\nWith such deep unhumanitarian policies being enforced by Trump, hosting him makes the UK complicit of these practices.",
        "background": "Since April the US has criminally prosecuted adult migrants for entering the country illegally.  When those immigrants were accompanied by children they have been separated and held in separated detention facilities.",
