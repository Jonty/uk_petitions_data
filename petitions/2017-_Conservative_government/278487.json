        "additional_details": "We need to live sustainably within our world as it is, not try to recreate the tropics in northern Europe. Heaters do not effectively create warmth in a localised area because heat energy flows from hot areas to cooler. It is not clear that heaters at commercial premises make a material difference to customers' decision to sit outside, or to stay longer. Cutting heater usage will not impact revenues, but will bring down utility costs. They are pointless evidentially and unjustifiable morally.",
        "background": "On a warming planet, it is no longer acceptable to burn fossil fuels to heat the outdoors. Generating heat is a highly inefficient use of energy. Once created, that heat disperses constantly to cooler areas.  Outdoor heaters are a wasteful exercise in futility: unnecessary and unconscionable.",
