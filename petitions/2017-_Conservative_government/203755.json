        "action": "Negotiate with the EU the right to retain individual EU citizenship after Brexit",
        "additional_details": "All Brexit debate about citizens' rights so far as revolved around expatriates. Yet the loss of EU citizenship for UK citizens is in many cases equally significant, resulting in loss of livelihood for people whose access to markets (e.g. EU contracts) depends upon being EU citizens. UK citizens living in the UK are no less EU citizens than EU27 citizens living in the UK. The Foreign Secretary has promised to protect our rights (The Guardian, Thursday 26 October 2017 12.06 BST).",
        "background": "On 26 October 2017 the Foreign Secretary announced that \"EU citizens' rights will be protected 'whatever happens'\". All UK citizens are presently EU citizens. We call upon the UK Government to protect our rights by negotiating with the EU a basis on which we can retain individual EU citizenship.",
