        "additional_details": "There should be an independent body that checks whether the PHSO has done a proper investigation and considered all the evidence. This should be overseen by the Secretary of State for Health, so that there is democratic accountability. An independent investigation would give people reassurance and could help them get to the truth about what happened to their loved ones.",
        "background": "The Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman investigates serious complaints against the NHS. I made a complaint about my son Cody's death, which I believe was caused by failures in his care in hospital. But they didn't uphold my complaint, and there's no way for me to appeal their decision.",
