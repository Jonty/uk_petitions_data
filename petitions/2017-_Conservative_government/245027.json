Yet, the people of the UK were misinformed and miseducated by the campaigns false claims, some of which have now been disproved. This false influence has misconstrued the opinions of millions and ultimately led to an inaccurate vote. \r\n\r\nDue to this corrupt influence, the vote result should be discredited and retaken.",
