        "action": "Completely legalise the use of medical and recreational cannabis.",
        "additional_details": "Points to be discussed:\r\n\r\n1. The Financial Gain: Studies have shown there is a potential to earn the tax man billions every year, which could be used to fund the NHS or departments for Brexit.\r\n\r\n2. Potential export: Could legal cannabis not only improve the budget deficit but also reduce the trade deficit? As one of the first countries to legalise cannabis, the UK can be one of the main contributors to the upcoming global cannabis market.\r\n\r\n3. Medical benefits and risk: Is the new law enough?",
        "background": "It is time to follow Canada's lead, they are quickly on their way to becoming the global lead on cannabis research and medical use. It is time the UK revised the laws on cannabis use and accepted both the potential medical benefits as well as the potential financial gains from recreational use.",
