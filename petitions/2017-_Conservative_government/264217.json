        "additional_details": "I believe both men and women would agree that the law is harsh on men, the law needs to change. If we had the same summer as 2018, it will eventually become a health risk due to becoming to hot. We do not have the luxury of women and being able to chose from skirts, dresses etc. When I mention it to my managers, they laugh at the idea. This needs to change. Even if the law changes for men to wear shorts during certain months, I think thousands of men working in office environments would be happy.",
        "background": "I currently work in an office with no air-con and one window, we have to shut the window as the sun comes round and hits the back of my desk. I came in one morning at 09:00 and it was 33 degrees. Women can wear dresses/skirts etc, if I came into work wearing a skirt, I would get sent home to change.",
