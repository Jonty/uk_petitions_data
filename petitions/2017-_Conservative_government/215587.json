        "action": "Abolish university fees",
        "additional_details": "Tuition fees at public university are at the highest on average. This means that 17772 people can't afford to go to university. \r\n\r\nSince 1998 university fees have been drastically rising, starting at \u00a31000 and then in 2006 they rose to \u00a33000 and recently have been raised to \u00a39000 a year on average.\r\n",
        "background": "We want to abolish university fees as they are causing people to miss out on education and potentially life changing careers. The fact that people cant get the proper education to become a doctor or lawyer etc. isn't fair as it means that only the wealthy can achieve the careers they want.",
