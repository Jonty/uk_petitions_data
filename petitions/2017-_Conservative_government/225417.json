        "additional_details": "I propose two things: 1) that all tests are graded out of 100% and 2) that individual targets are scrapped. By giving us parents a simple percentage, you will be able to easily see how much of the subject your child actually knows. If they get a result of 65%, you can then decide if that's good enough for their ability or if you want them to work toward a higher grade.",
        "background": "Every year we get exam and test results for our children that are seemingly meaningless. The results don't tell us how much of the subject material they have actually learnt. If your child achieves a level 4C in Science, how much of the curriculum do they really know? Half? Three quarters? Who knows",
