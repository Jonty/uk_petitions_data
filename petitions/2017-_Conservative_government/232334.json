        "action": "Prevent government from including gagging clauses in contracts with charities.",
        "additional_details": "This type of gagging clause has been reported to have been used with Brexit consultants, Grenfell Tower investigators and charities working with Universal Credit claimants, amongst others. \r\n \r\nThe government is systematically silencing dissent, putting self interest above the welfare of its citizens. This, ultimately, represents a threat to democracy.\r\n \r\nSign the petition so this can be discussed in Parliament.",
        "background": "The government has reportedly included clauses in their contracts with NGOs, charities and businesses, barring the organisations in question from creating 'adverse publicity'. This prevents organisations speaking up for the people they are trying to help. Sign the petition to have this debated.",
