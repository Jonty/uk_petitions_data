This could rise even higher with temperatures set to reach 39\u00b0C in the current heatwave. The government should set up a select conmittee to tackle this issue, taking into account the environment.",
        "background": "Between the months of May to September, the temperatures on most TFL services are unacceptable and dangerous. More should be done to ensure the safety of london commuters, such as air conditioning and free cold water refill points on platforms. Climate change will only increase this problem.",
