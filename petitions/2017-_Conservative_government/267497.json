Atos hasn't held the government contract to carry out WCAs since 2015.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, that the Government require all healthcare professionals contracted to carry out WCAs be qualified in a medical field relevant to the claimant.\r\n\r\nThere's already a petition calling for independent doctors to carry out WCAs, which you might like to sign if it calls for something you'd like to happen. You're more likely to get action on this issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/263788"
