        "additional_details": "With brexit uncertainty, still not proper recovery from credit crunch and rising inflation many citizens in the UK are struggling with making ends meet. \r\n\r\nIf a driver has been convicted of a speeding offence they don\u2019t only pay for the course, penalty and court fees but also higher insurance premiums for 5 years. It\u2019s the insurance companies that benefit from the 5 years premiums. \r\n\r\nPlease change the law so that penalty points do not need to be declared to car insurance companies.",
        "background": "When a driver in the UK has got speeding points on his driving licence then they have to pay the relevant penalty. Some of these fines can be over \u00a3250 after legal fees are taken into consideration. After the penalty fee the driver needs to keep paying hire car insurance premium for 5 years.",
