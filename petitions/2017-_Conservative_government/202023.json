        "additional_details": "Maintenance loans are currently calculated by household income rather than disposable income per person, meaning that some students may get the same maintenance loan despite their parents being able to assist them more financially, as parents are expected to make up what we don\u2019t get of the loan. This means an only child will have more support than someone with 3 younger siblings because their parents earn the same amount which isn\u2019t fair as one family is more able to provide support",
        "background": "Student maintenance loans are calculated on a household income basis. This method is not Fair as parents are expected to make up the rest but can\u2019t with a bigger family. The aim of this is to have the loans be calculated by disposable income per person in the household rather than the overall income",
