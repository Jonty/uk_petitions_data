        "additional_details": "Do we want this on our ecological conscience while doing so well with single use carrier bags and talking about other plastics? Let's not let electronics slip under the radar, if they want to market tiny portable batteries for a bit of emergency juice they should have to be that little more expensive to include the recharge socket and charge protection circuitry for reuse. Demo/Testing videos of such disposable products: https://youtu.be/5korWqCcsHE https://youtu.be/6lflk6iY56w",
        "background": "It is actually cheaper to source rechargeable batteries as they're mass produced to match demand. This means that \"single use\" products contain lithium cells that could be recharged multitudes of times with some added circuitry but are being thrown away after a single use.",
