        "action": "Ban or heavily tax all non-recyclable/non-compostable packaging in the UK",
        "additional_details": "The UK fails to recycle over 1.5 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste each year and now with China not accepting our recycled waste this will increase. \r\n\r\nCreating packaging that our society cannot deal with is unsustainable. We urgently need 100% recyclable/ compostable packaging on all products and  in particular items like fruit and vegetables in the supermarkets.\r\n\r\nTaxing non recyclable plastics at the same rate as alcohol, tobacco or petrol will drive ethical sourcing behaviours.",
        "background": "Major retailers are using non recyclable plastics despite low cost alternatives being available.  Only a complete ban or heavy tax of 50%+ will make the supermarket and industry take action and use many of the available sustainabile alternatives.",
