        "additional_details": "Since 2012, The Listed Property Owners\u2019 Club has noticed a distinct fall in certain types of applications for listed building consent. The reduction of VAT to 5% on repairs and approved alterations would be a real incentive for owners to maintain their homes and safely conserve our historic and heritage buildings. The Listed Property Owners\u2019 Club is the only organisation representing owners of private listed buildings.  \r\nMore information can be found at www.lpoc.co.uk",
        "background": "Private listed property owners are preserving much of Britain\u2019s built heritage for future generations, yet many are struggling to maintain and repair their homes. In 2012, the Government removed the zero rate of VAT for pre-authorised alterations to listed buildings. This was a major blow to owners.",
