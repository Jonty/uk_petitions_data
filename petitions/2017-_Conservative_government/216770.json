        "additional_details": "The Battle of Britain, as fought between the 10th of July and the 31st of October, 1940, was summed up by Winston Churchill with the words \"Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few\". \r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September, 1940, the Luftwaffe embarked on its largest bombing attack yet, which required the engagement of the entirety of the RAF in defence of London and the South East, resulting in a decisive British victory that marked the turning point in Britain's favour.",
        "background": "Let the 15th of September as \"Battle of Britain Day\" be made a public holiday to celebrate that one day in the field of human conflict that represents that grand singularity of the unity of purpose of the diverse peoples of this great nation that says 'together we are'.",
