        "additional_details": "It is wrong authorities can continue to issue unenforceable PCNs in this way and without resolve.\r\nIt inappropriately raises funds from unchallenged or weak challenges to the PCNs, and uses legislation for monetary gain without following legislation for issuing an prescribed order.\r\n\r\nMoney gained through unenforceable PCNs should be repaid to people, who can circulate it back into the British economy.",
        "background": "The City of London has received, in the region of \u00a310 million for PCNs issued in the Bank Junction area in London.\r\nThe authority uses contravention code 52M on the PCN, whilst displaying contravention 33C road signs.\r\nThe correct lawful sign must be displayed for a prescribed order to be enforced.",
