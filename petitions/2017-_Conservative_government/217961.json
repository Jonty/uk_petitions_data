        "additional_details": "The Windrush generation like millions of immigrants from around the world brought their families here, settled and made a massive contribution to British life. \r\n \r\nThis government appears to have set out to strip them of their rights by changing the law without debate and disposing of the records. \r\n \r\nShredding historical records that effectively remove rights from British citizens is an appalling abuse of power. \r\n \r\nIt must be investigated!\r\n",
        "background": "The Home office said that these documents were disposed of under the Data Protection Act. The result has been thousands of people effectively being made stateless and some being deported. \r\nThere are reports of what happened and of staff raising concerns at the time and being overruled.\r\n",
