This is despite the difficulties for many getting to WGH, the sharp gradient of the site, being next-door to a PL football club and the disruption for patients, visitors and staff until it is completed in 2030.A brand new and central West Herts A&E Hospital could be delivered earlier, be less disruptive to hospital services, cost less and provide a better long-term acute care solution for the whole of West Herts.",
