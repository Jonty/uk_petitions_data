        "additional_details": "Video game companies that offer loot crate microtransactions (usually aimed at children) should be required by law to show the percentile chances of getting each category of items, there are many games which exploit it's users (usually children) into thinking they can spend some of there pocket money and in return get a chance at getting a good item, the chances of this in many games is actually extremely low and i'm petitioning for a law so game companies have to make these chances public.",
        "background": "Over the past few years the video game industry has seen a huge influx of a rather unethical practice whereby the game offers \"loot crates\" in exchange for real life cash, lootcrates contain multiple in game items usually categorized into common, rare, epic and legendary, the chances are not shown.",
