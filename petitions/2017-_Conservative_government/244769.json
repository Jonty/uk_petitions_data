And now things seem to have been left too late to sort out properly. Possibly even with a chance that we may not leave the EU later this month, I feel that this is unacceptable as we as a country unanimously voted to LEAVE the EU! The Leave vote was one of the biggest votes since 1975.\r\nLeave means leave and not postpone, or lets have another referendum!",
