        "additional_details": "Vets are an expensive thing and many animals are neglected due to people not being able to afford vet fees! Pet ownership shouldn\u2019t be just for people who can afford to pay sometimes extremely expensive vet bills when something goes wrong. So I have thought long and hard about some sort of solution that would help people and animals nationwide. We are a country known for caring about animals and I believe this is something that is definitely needed. It will create more jobs as you will still have your private sector but also a National nhs for animals so no animal suffers needlessly because of money.",
        "background": "Animals suffer needlessly because of expensive vet bills. This petition is to get an animal nhs set up to help ALL animals regardless of financial situation, by everyone paying \u00a31 a week out of their pay or benefits",
