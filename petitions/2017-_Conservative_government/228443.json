        "action": "Require free water bottle refilling stations across UK service stations",
        "additional_details": "Water bottle refilling stations would help cut down our plastic waste, promote a healthier lifestyle, and cut out the unnecessarily high price for bottled water in service stations, all at a low cost to the tax payer. This could be paired with cardboard cups and recycling bins for those wishing to have a quick drink on the go.",
        "background": "The price of bottled water is extortionate in service stations across the UK (in some places beer is cheaper). This means people are penalised for needing an essential fuel of life, and adds to the plastic waste issue epidemic.",
