        "additional_details": "It's high time then for a new approach! With the introduction of a universal basic income we can provide a safety net to all UK citizens. This reduces the risk of enduring the physical/mental torment of being homeless, indebted and destitute by ensuring a basic income is always provided no matter what calamity has incapacitated them at that time. UBI has enormous potential in transforming peoples lives by allowing them to start business/educational ventures whilst promoting life satisfaction.",
        "background": "Austerity has created a country where its citizens die on hospital waiting lists or are forced onto the streets because of welfare reforms and housing shortages. Mental health, schools, policing, security, care, the young/old, poor/sick, employed/self-employed are all victims to name but a few.",
