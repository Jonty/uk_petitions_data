Well, Government action has been insufficient, and our laws are inadequate for addressing the scope of this challenge. This must change.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, Greta Thunberg should be invited to speak in Parliament. On this issue she speaks for all of us. Listen.\r\n",

Every citizen has the responsibility to fight for the future of our children and planet, but as individuals we cannot do this alone. We must act together, as a movement.\r\n\r\nGreta Thunberg is the voice of this movement.",
