        "additional_details": "Homework is is a burden on the students personal life, they already spend a lot of their week in school and it should be then that they learn.\r\n\r\nTime outside of school should be left to the pupils to rest and take part in social activities so that they can make the most of their time in school without feeling tired and stressed and learn to have social skills outside of school.\r\n\r\nIf a working adult was asked to take work home each night they would not be happy with this and would not complete it.",
        "background": "Child mental health is in the spotlight all the time - however pressures being placed on children under 11 is at an all time high.\r\n\r\nThe pressure placed on children under 11 from primary schools could be taken as being one of the root causes as well as lack of social skills.",
