        "additional_details": "The Town and Country Planning Regulations 2007 and amendment 2012, allows certain flags can be flown without consent, as set out within Schedule 1, Class H. \r\nOne of these flags, the EU flag,  can be flown because it is a flag of an international organisation of which the UK is a member. From 29th March 2019 this will no longer be the case. Therefore, in future consent must be required.\r\nThe government\u2019s guidance in \u201cFlying flags: a plain English guide\u201d must also be updated to reflect this change.",
        "background": "Under the 2007/2012 Planning Regulations flags can be flown without consent. Schedule 1 Class H allows: The flag of the Commonwealth, EU, UN, or any other international organisation of which the UK is a member. On 29/3/2019 the UK will leave the EU, hence flying the EU flag without consent must end.",
