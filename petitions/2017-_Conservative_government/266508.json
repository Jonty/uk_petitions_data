It simply does not make sense for us to use them for a few weeks/months and then throw them away, when we could reuse and recycle them from within our homes before getting rid of them.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/10/stark-truth-long-plastic-footprint-will-last-planet/\r\n\"Hugh and Anita's War on Plastic\"on BBC iPlayer",

There isn't a single plastic-free refill available for any products in most supermarkets or drugstores, though they'd be an easy & convenient way for everyone to reduce single-use plastic waste.",
