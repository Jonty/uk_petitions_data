        "additional_details": "Evidence of the extreme use of mobile phones by MPs is to be seen every day at every sitting on publicly recorded videos, which are transmitted live to the nation.  To see MPs on their mobile phones when matters of state are being debated is not only indicative of a lack of concious attention, it is disrespectful of the people the MPs represent and the place itself.",
        "background": "Elected officials are paid to listen and debate on behalf of 'the electorate', not sit tweeting etc.  Under their terms of employment most people are not allowed to use phones in the workplace; this condition should equally apply to MPs, to restore due diligence to the work of Parliament.",
