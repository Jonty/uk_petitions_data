        "additional_details": "According to Parliament we do not vote for a party in a General Election, we vote for candidates who just happen to belong to a particular party.  So, theoretcally, if every voter in a constituency voted for a candidate who represented the Conservatives and, once elected, that MP crossed to the Labour Benches, that would be acceptable? According to the rules of Parliament, there is nothing wrong with that. That is just one of the reforms of Parliament which we need. If I vote for a candidate, I am doing so because I want him/ her to be a member of the party of which I approve. When MPs \"cross the House\" it is an affront and an insult  to those who voted for them and for all those who have given of their time to get that person elected. It is a breach of trust and an affront to democracy.",
