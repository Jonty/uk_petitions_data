There are 7 of us in our household and the bin collections aren\u2019t regular enough so this site staying open 7 days a week helps with that ,everytime I go there it is busy so on the days it is opened only going to bring on environmental problems .Falkirk council budget cuts that\u2019s all it is. From using this place regular I know there are about 7 to 10  supervisors the council wonder why they struggle for a budget.",
