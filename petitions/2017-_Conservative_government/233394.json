        "action": "Make payment from net income for residential care tax deductible for over 70's",
        "additional_details": "It would be a positive gesture from Government to recognise those who have made honest declarations and are subsequently burdened further by the tax system. The Government should also recognise that payments on account for current tax years are also onerous on meeting care costs and should be addressed. The Government should recognise that most people over the age of 70 are not on PAYE and the tax coding system is unreasonable for that population when in care.",
        "background": "The cost of residential and social care is extremely high. My Mother is 90 years old and has been in a residential home for three years. Her total income does not fully meet her monthly care charges. To alleviate the problem introduce a tax concession on bona fide care costs for those who pay.",
