        "additional_details": "It would be a positive gesture from Government to recognise those who have made honest declarations and are subsequently burdened further by the tax system. The Government should also recognise that payments on account for current tax years are also onerous on meeting care costs and should be addressed. The Government should recognise that most people over the age of 70 are not on PAYE and the tax coding system is unreasonable for that population when in care.",

Her total income does not fully meet her monthly care charges. To alleviate the problem introduce a tax concession on bona fide care costs for those who pay.",
