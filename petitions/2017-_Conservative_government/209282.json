        "additional_details": "The group could analyse other successful health care schemes, their procedures, expenditure measured against results. Do hospital and GP procedures need to change?\r\n\r\nIs the British health care system working so well that it only needs more funds? If so, how can further funds be raised without increasing the national debt? All of these questions will be more credible to all political parties if answered by a cross party group of MP\u2019s.",
        "background": "Suggest political parties stop using the problems the NHS faces for political gain and to work together to improve it for patients and employees of the service. To co-operate with each other to find the best solutions to maintaining a sustainable high level of health care for everyone.",
