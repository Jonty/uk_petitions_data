        "action": "Scrap school league tables to reduce pressures on young people and teachers",
        "additional_details": "The government recognises the need to transform the mental health provision for children and young people (Green paper, Dec 2017). Whilst the proposals are welcomed, it would make sense to address the underlying causes. \r\nThe Guardian stated that exclusions are increasing partly because schools are under pressure to compete in league tables and exam results. Disruptive,vulnerable pupils who are likely to lower overall GCSE performance are weeded out before their national tests (Oct 2017).",
        "background": "At the root cause of mental health difficulties in young people are league tables. There is pressure on students and staff to succeed as they are judged on exam performance data. Students with special educational needs flounder or move from mainstream schools which are struggling to be inclusive.",
