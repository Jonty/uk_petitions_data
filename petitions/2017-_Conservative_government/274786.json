        "action": "Introduce an on line sales tax of  5% and subsidise local busines rates",
        "additional_details": "With the increasing competition and presure on prices it is inevitable that customers will search for a bargain. Searching for certain items will find it cheaper on line by a wide margin, and the imposition of an additional sales tax,say 5%, would diminish the edge on line retailers have. Increasingly aged individuals find it difficult to purchase on line since the technology is leaving them behind , and they find that the shops that they used for years simply are not there.",
        "background": "On line retailers without naming them operate with little high street presence , and other than seeing their name in the press or social media no one would have heard of them . They are able to operate on line and pay little if any business rates compared to  their high street counterparts.",
