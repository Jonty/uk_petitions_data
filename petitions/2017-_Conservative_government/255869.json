That\u2019s why the condition that any single option needs at least 50% to win is crucial. \r\nIf the result was for example 35% for no deal, 17% for May\u2019s deal (the former 52%) and 48% for remain a follow up referendum would be held with the strongest 2 options only. \r\nThis is a FAIR compromise out of the current impasse and will leave us with an option that can be implemented immediately",
        "background": "Hold a referendum with the following 3 questions\r\n1. Leave EU without a deal and fall back to WTO terms\r\n2. Leave EU on deal negotiated by Theresa May\r\n3. Remain in EU\r\nAny option needs at least 50% to win. \r\nIf not achieved first time hold a follow up referendum with strongest 2 options only",
