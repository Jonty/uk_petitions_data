        "additional_details": "Ryanair are an example of a low cost airline that totally lacks scruples,  treating customers without respect or dignity.  The recent shameful behaviour of Ryanair is a disgrace.  How Michael O'Leary thinks he can cancel flights at a whim and get away with it, is horrendous. If  budget airlines take a complete hold in our airline market, then the shameful business practices of Ryanair will become common place and we the Public will never be treated fairly again.  Bring back dignity and Monarch.",
        "background": "Monarch are a British Aviation Institution. Charter airlines are becoming less and less, as a result, the travelling public are getting less choice as to whom they should fly with. Very soon, we'll be left with just low cost airlines, once they've got a monopoly their prices will rocket sky high.",
