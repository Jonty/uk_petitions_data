        "action": "Reduce the income requirement for a spouse visa",
        "additional_details": "It's been argued that the rule interferes with Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. The High Court recommended the income requirement be lowered to \u00a313,000: tinyurl.com/yc9jkffh\r\n41% of Brits earn less than \u00a318,600: tinyurl.com/ycr3swqb\r\nA full time worker (40 hrs) on the National Living Wage earns \u00a315,472.08. A full time worker on the National Minimum Wage earns less. Citizens who work full time should be able to sponsor and live with their foreign spouse, and not be punished for falling in love.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, request the UK government to reduce the income requirement for a spouse visa.\r\nWhen the husband/wife isn't from the European Economic Area, the British citizen's income requirement is \u00a318,600 - considerably higher than working full time on the national minimum/living wage.",
