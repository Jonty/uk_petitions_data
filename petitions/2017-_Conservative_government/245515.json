        "additional_details": "Britain prides itself on being a nation of animal lovers, we should no longer tolerate animal abuse. Countries all over the world have updated or passed effective animal cruelty laws, the UK is lagging behind. A change in animals\u2019 status from property to sentient being will make it easier to prosecute cases of animal cruelty & make penalties tougher.\r\nWe support a #BetterDealForAnimals: a law that creates a duty for all Ministers in the UK to fully regard animal welfare in policy making.",
        "background": "We ask the UK Government to recognise animals as sentient beings. EU law recognises animals as living beings, animals in the UK are at risk of losing legal protection post Brexit. There are many studies providing evidence of animals\u2019 intelligence & emotions. Policies & laws need to be updated.",
