        "action": "Make all companies share their maternity and paternity leave policies publically",
        "additional_details": "Making these policies publically available would help working parents make an informed choice about which companies they want to work for and help to celebrate the companies which are the most family friendly. It would also start to bring some parity to an area of benefits which at the moment varys widely from a couple of weeks full pay to a whole year. \r\n\r\nHaving a child is one of life's most expensive adventures and choosing an employer who supports this shouldn't be left to chance or hearsay.",
        "background": "Many companies provide maternity leave pay above the statutory minimum and increasing numbers also offer enhanced paternity pay. These can be invaluable for employees thinking about starting or growing their family but it's often a benefit you can't find out about when you sign up for a new job.",
