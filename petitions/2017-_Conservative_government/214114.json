        "additional_details": "It is known that humans are at risk of death and ill health if sanitation, warmth, and shelter are denied to them. \r\n\r\nIt is proposed that members of parliament, irrespective of political ideology, enshrine in law that all humans will be provided with the rights to shelter, warmth, and sanitation. \r\n\r\nThis means that persons within local or national government will be held to account, and subject to prosecution if they fail to provide these facilities.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous  \"homeless\" schemes that are successfully operated throughout different parts of the country. Whilst these are often effective, the current crisis requires the power and resources of Government to resolve.",
