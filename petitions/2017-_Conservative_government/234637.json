        "additional_details": "After the result of the 2016 Referendum was announced, both the Conservative and Labour parliamentary parties undertook to uphold the result and with that as part of their manifesto commitments, 80% of the voting electorate supported parties with that pledge. To betray that trust will destroy the confidence of the public in our parliament. We will become the laughing stock of the World if we pull out now.",
        "background": "The EU Referendum of 2016 revealed a clear result with 52% of 46 million people in favour of leaving. The concept of calling the Referendum had overwhelming Parliamentary support with the Government promising to implement the result.",
