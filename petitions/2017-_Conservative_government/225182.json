        "background": "The public have had access from the A303 & Larkhill to park up and walk around the landscape of our acient Stonehenge free of charge, 24/7. It's the only safe place to visitors can stay free.\r\nWe object the refusal of motorized vehicals on the byways that have been used freely for various reasons.",
