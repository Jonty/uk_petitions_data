Parents have taken to social media on the difficulty, some meals consist of tinned beans and chicken nuggets it's definitely not democratic to force our lifestyle to this \"Ideal citizen\" image.",
        "background": "Instead of increasing the prices of more 'Unhealthy' products, reducing the prices of 'Healthy' products will be more beneficial as seeing lower prices for food will help those wanting to lose weight actually afford it, Raising the price of 'Unhealthy' products i.e cocacola, chocolate, what's next?",
