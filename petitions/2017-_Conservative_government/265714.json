        "additional_details": "In my local town, a large Greenfield site is being considered for development. It is filled with ancient oak trees which are home to hawks, woodpeckers, owls, bats and other wild birds. The field is home to frogs, pheasants, foxes and a family of Roe Deer. It also provides protection from flooding to nearby homes. However this is all to be destroyed while numerous substantial Brownfield sites are left derelict, dilapidated, crumbling and of no natural value.",
        "background": "Greenfield Sites continue to be considered for development when large brownfield sites sit derelict nearby. This is irresponsible planning which is harmful to the local environment. Greenfield sites should be protected from large developments until all local Brownfield sites have been redeveloped.",
