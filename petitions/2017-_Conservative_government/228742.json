        "additional_details": "Local libraries are a vital resource for the promotion of reading, literature and culture.  They are a necessity for the digitally excluded who need to go online to access benefits, health, education and employment resources.\r\n\r\nWhile the commitment of volunteers is welcomed, volunteer-run library services are unsustainable long-term.  The government must ringfence funding to ensure councils can fulfil their statutory duty to keep libraries services available to the general public.",
        "background": "Libraries across the country are being closed, cut back and/or outsourced to volunteers as a result of government cuts to local authority budgets.  Councils are unable to keep staffed library services open when faced with the competing demands of social care, child protection etc.",
