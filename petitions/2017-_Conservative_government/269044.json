        "additional_details": "Despite being treated on a specialist adolescent unit for 16 to 25-year-olds, no counsellor is available for people in this age group. I and others would benefit from a counsellor being on wards and instantly available. The counsellor could then deal with any worries as they arise, and people would not need to wait for appointments in the community.\r\nThis was a petition made by my best-friend and I want to carry it on for him as he lost his battle and isn\u2019t able to continue it himself.",
        "background": "Counsellors should be available for young people receiving cancer treatment. When I was diagnosed with cancer, it was a complete shock for me and my family. I found it harder to deal with mentally than the actual treatment itself.",
