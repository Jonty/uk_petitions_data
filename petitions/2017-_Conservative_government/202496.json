        "action": "The government must act to defend Jobs & Skills at Bombardier, Northern Ireland",
        "additional_details": "More than 4,000 aerospace workers are employed by Bombardier in Northern Ireland; sustaining a further 20,000 in the local economy. \r\nThese jobs are threatened by the 300% import tariffs on Bombardiers C Series proposed by President Trump's administration on behalf of Boeing. \r\nThere is no basis for these punitive tariffs, as Boeing does not even produce an aircraft in the same class; they are intended to close the US market, preventing the superior C Series aircraft from getting a foothold.",
        "background": "The UK is the second biggest Boeing client globally. We call on the government to follow-through on their words and use their leverage to defend UK jobs from US protectionism; to compel Boeing to withdraw their meritless case and lift the threat hanging over thousands of Northern Ireland workers.",
