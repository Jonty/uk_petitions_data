        "additional_details": "I witness the mood of staff when we hold national nurses day, or midwives day and other days too. Non-clinical staff and AHPs are not included and so feel left out. Is it that NHS @70 was their inclusive day? We are all the NHS and so we should have one day every year that we all celebrate as our day, from the cook, the cleaner, the nurse, the midwife, the CEO, the chief nurse and so on. A day for all. 5th July, every year",
        "background": "During any calendar year, staff in the NHS have days of celebration. For e.g. Nurses Day, Midwives Day. The list is endless and all of them are worthwhile. But, there is no one single day that unites all the mircronisms that collectively make us the NHS. I propose a NHS day for ALL staff, 5th July",
