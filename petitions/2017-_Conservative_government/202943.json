        "additional_details": "This treatment has been proven to work with a positive, visual outcome in all babies that go through Helmet Therapy around the world!  It's currently not available on the NHS forcing parents to pay over \u00a32,000 for the treatment on their own.\r\nI have a 7 month old son going through Helmet Therapy and the results already are dramatic! Most parents can not afford this and really don't understand why it is not available on the NHS? Helmet therapy does work and needs more awareness raised!",
        "background": "Helmet therapy is for babies who suffer from Plagiocephaly or Bracheycephaly (flat head syndrome).\r\nThis can be developed in the first few months of the baby being born due to favouring sleeping on the one side or one way causing the skull to loose shape, and also causing facial deformities.",
