Therefore the person getting into the seat only represents less than 50% of the voters. This is not a fair vote",
        "background": "The results for the last general election in a lot of constituencies were not conclusion, e.g. South Belfast won with 30.4% of the vote. Changing to the Single Transferable Vote would be a much fairer way in determining who is the ideal candidate for parliament in a constituency.",
