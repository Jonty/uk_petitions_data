As this has not been done with any expertise we are left with a mess and we should just leave, forward fixing any issues. Scaremongers are only raising risks and that is all they are. No one actually knows if any of the issues will surface... The EU needs the UK more than the other way around in terms of trade!",

Their only job was to get a deal or we leave without one!",
