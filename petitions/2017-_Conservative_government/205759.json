        "action": "Reinstate the law that regards animals as sentient beings",
        "additional_details": "There has long been controversy over the sentience of animals, of which humans are the most superior species of all, right?\r\nWrong. \r\nIncreasingly anthropocentric views have placed humans atop the ecological hierarchy, based on the false belief that our cognition is 'more evolved' than other organisms. If we condone the abolishment of the animal sentience law, we are further divorcing ourselves from nature.",
        "background": "Animal sentience was written into the EU law in 1997, but subsequent to Brexit the UK parliament decided that animals can no longer 'feel pain for emotions', in a vote of 295 to 313.",
