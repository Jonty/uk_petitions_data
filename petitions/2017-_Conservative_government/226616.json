        "action": "Scrap QTS professional skills test for those with learning disabilities.",
        "additional_details": "For many people this may not cause any issues. However,  for the prospective teachers who have a learning disability struggle to the point where passing the test is out of their reach. I and many others believe this to be discrimination against those with a disability, as they are being turned away from pursuing their teaching career through no fault of their own. Therefore, I would like to propose that those with a learning disability, be exempt from QTS Professional Skills Tests.",
        "background": "Every year thousands of prospective teachers wanting to teach in various subjects apply for teacher training in the U.K. As a requirement set by the government, they are required  to undertake the Numeracy and Literacy QTS Professional Skills Test.",
