        "additional_details": "Govt recently altered NHS nursing pay grades...giving much deserved pay rise and reducing grade scales so nurses and others move through pay scales quicker. Hospices can't compete with these levels of pay and they are losing nurses and having to cut back on services and support, some even closing because of it. Don't the children and adults who are so well looked after and their families deserved to be put first before anyone else? \r\nWhat sort of a country have we become?",
        "background": "Govt contributes 14% of children's Hospice funding and 33% of all hospice funding. To fully fund all English Hospices would be \u00a31.4 Billion yet we send \u00a313.9 Bill abroad in International Aid (0.7% of GDP). Terminally ill children and adults deserved to be put first without exception.",
