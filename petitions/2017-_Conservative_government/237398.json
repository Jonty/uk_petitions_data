        "action": "Mandatory training on self -harm for all those working with young people.",
        "additional_details": "According to The Mental Health Foundation (2018) the UK has the highest self-harm rate of any country in Europe with estimates of 400 in 100,000 people self-harming. Additionally it is noted that the numbers may be higher due to people who do self-harm but do not tell anyone about it. Self-harm can affect anybody but according to NICE (2003) the majority of people who report self-harm are aged between 11 and 25.",
        "background": "Training can be either online or from visiting experts booked in to deliver a training session. Our hope is that a greater understanding of self-harm will stop it being a taboo subject, which will result in sufferers asking for and getting the appropriate support they need.",
