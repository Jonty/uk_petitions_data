        "additional_details": "Loss of greenbelt & greenfield sites for housing negatively affects the environment, releasing carbon from the land & losing that land's ability to capture new carbon. Wildlife and plant life already under stress, are displaced & loss of green spaces has a negative effect on communities.  Our green and pleasant land will soon be no more.\r\nIf you value your environment, the health of your children, our green spaces & associated flora & fauna, you must sign this petition to  Preserve Our Country.",
        "background": "Government housing policy is forcing councils to meet aggressive house building targets. This directly causes new developments on Greenbelt & Greenfield. Many councils believe the targets are unrealistic. According to CPRE 460,000 homes are currently planned for greenbelt & greenfield sites.",
