        "additional_details": "If lung function tests and sleep studies were carried out on these patients annually, the signs of respiratory failure would be picked up earlier, and they would be able to receive other forms of treatment such as pulmonary rehab and inhalers, rather than going straight on to oxygen and ventilators.",
        "background": "Severe scoliosis can cause breathing problems and respiratory failure. Some scoliosis patients have been unexpectedly told they need oxygen and ventilators and may be in respiratory failure before they are treated.",
