        "action": "Remove British Airways as the UK flag carrier and its transatlantic slots",
        "additional_details": "With BA seeking Madrids help in confirming its status as a Spanish company therefore bypassing the EU regulations on airline ownership, if it does confirm its a Spanish company surely it can no longer be the UK flag carrier? Also if not the flag carrier it should have its very lucrative transatlantic slots at Heathrow looked at with reality UK Airlines getting at least 50% of BAs current allocation. We cannot have a foreign company as flag carrier and majority slot owner.",
        "background": "BA is seeking to become a Spanish registered company after brexit rather than a British company in an effort to bypass eu regulations on airline ownership. Thus would mean delisting the parent company IAG from the London stock market and forcing funds to sell their stocks.",
