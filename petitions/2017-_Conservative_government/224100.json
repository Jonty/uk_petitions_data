        "action": "Ensure British food standards are met in any free trade agreement with USA",
        "additional_details": "We want all food in Britain to adhere to our standards. We do not want chicken that has been washed in chlorine, we do not want beef which has been injected with hormones, we do not want pigs who have suffered horrendous conditions to be allowed to arrive in the UK. Raising and management of animal products in this way goes against the values that the British public hold. We hold our government accountable for protecting these values.",
        "background": "Once 'Brexit' is complete the government will be able to seek its own Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with other countries, most notably the USA. The USA use hormones in the rearing of their meat, Genetically Modified vegetables, and have low animal welfare requirements.",
