        "action": "Stop the teachers from having the right to seize students\u2019 property/belongings",
        "additional_details": "In the petition I want a change in the law so that schools can\u2019t confiscate belongings like phones and coats and instead teachers can take phones for whole lessons and if the phone isn't handed over approaite sanctions are taken. Schools having no punishment for breaking or loosing students\u2019 phones is what I like to call legalised theft",
        "background": "Obviously teachers/members of staff should be able to comfiscate stuff like knives, alcohol, drugs etc but when a teacher/member of staff confiscated something like a phone and then doesn\u2019t have legal responsibility if it gets lost or broken is obviously outrageous and bias towards the teacher.",
