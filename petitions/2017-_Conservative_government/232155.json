        "additional_details": "In 2018, the number of trains through the existing corridor (through platforms 13/14) was increased, despite the lack of available capacity, causing constant disruption. Despite this, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has \"postponed\" the project indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe rail passengers of Manchester and the North deserve better. These new platforms are urgently needed, as the current situation is unacceptable.",
        "background": "In 2009, as part of the Northern Hub project, the Manchester Piccadilly - Manchester Oxford Road Rail Corridor was set to be quadrupled, with two new platforms (15/16) built at Manchester Piccadilly, yet this project has now been \"postponed\" indefinitely.",
