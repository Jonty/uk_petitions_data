        "additional_details": "In Scotland, the laws protect raptors much better than in England and Wales.The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in Scotland includes the \"Vicarious Liability Law\" which means that landowners should be held responsible, charged and prosecuted if a dead bird of prey is found on their land.This law needs to be expanded to England and Wales,to act as a deterrent to the illegal persecution of birds of prey,to enable successful prosecutions,revoke firearms and general licence of those responsible.",
        "background": "Birds of prey such as hen harriers are persecuted illegally in the grouse shooting industry across the UK.Gamekeepers want the grouse to be shot by people who pay to do it for \"sport\" and don't want birds of prey to eat them.It's very difficult to prove who killed the bird,with few prosecutions.",
