        "additional_details": "On daily basis I observe countless examples of reckless behaviour presented by cyclists on London roads. Often the tragedy is avoided only thanks to car driver's reflexes. Cyclists in London feel lawless and do not follow any rules. Imposing highway code test, registration plates for bikes and buying insurance will provide more consideration, sense of responsibility and safety for all road user.",
        "background": "Intense traffic in London creates high risk. Many situations of danger result from poor knowledge of highway code. Before joining traffic cyclists should learn the rules and, being part of traffic, they should be lawfully forced to take responsibility for accidents that may be caused by them.",
