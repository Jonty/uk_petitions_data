        "additional_details": "A study performed by the University of Arizona in 2006 found that magic mushrooms are very affective in alleviating the symptoms of people suffering from OCD. You can look up Professor David Nut and see the focus of his studies are on Psilocybin (magic mushrooms) and LSD could function as treatment for depression and addiction. Consider this petition and educate yourself on this topic. I didn\u2019t have space to fit everything.",
        "background": "The drug war is a failure. Despite the laws that are put in place, people still consume intoxicating substances, and the proceeds go to black market. Like Cannabis some studies have shown psychedelics to have a medical value. It is time to rethink how we categorise psychedelics.",
