        "additional_details": "Our borough is affected by knife crime and we want every young person to feel that they can be safe in society. Gangs can force children to bring in items that can cause harm to others. Having heat sensors would help to deter those thinking of carrying a knife and would make children feel more secure in their environment.",
        "background": "Within our citizenship class we highlighted knife crime and the damage it causes. We decided that having heat sensors in schools would minimise the ravaging effects of knife crime. Everyday at least one parent is robbed of their child. No one wants their child to become a statistic.",
