        "additional_details": "The young drivers that have cars that exceed a 1.2 displacement tend to look after and care more about their vehicles as typically they have spent more money on insuring and caring for the vehicles. \r\nI believe that the reason that young people have accidents is more often down to intoxication of drugs and/or alcohol and using mobile devices, responsible other people should not have to suffer  with their work lives because of a minority",
        "background": "As part of Teresa May\u2019s new driving regulations, restrictions are imposed on when young drivers are able to drive and engine displacement has also become a factor.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the majority of accidents in young drivers tend to be in the 1.2L cars, typically Corsa\u2019s and 1L Fiestas.",
