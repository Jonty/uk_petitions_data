        "additional_details": "It is estimated that 1 in 5 children will be abused before they are 18. With 1 in 20 children being sexually abused. Stats from NSPCC website.\r\nWe have an estimated 12 million children in the UK. None of them are safe from predators, especially because we don\u2019t know who they are or where they live.\r\nWhen children who have been abused speak out, this is only the beginning of their mental torture. They will continue to have nightmares, flashbacks, guilt etc for the rest of their lives.",
        "background": "Over the last few years, sexual abuse has been on the news every day. Some abusers are walking away with very light punishment.\r\nIn my opinion, the abuser should be punished more than the victim. \r\nOur government needs to do something and do it quickly!",
