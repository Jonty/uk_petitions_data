        "additional_details": "The antivax movement is largely based upon the mistaken belief that vaccines cause autism; a fact which has been scientifically disproven not once, but twice. Those at particular risk from unvaccinated children are immuno-compromised people undergoing medical treatment, those unable to be vaccinated due to allergies or medical issues and babies under 1. \r\n\r\nThere needs to be more done to protect these people from the risk posed by unvaccinated children. We would ask the Government to take action.",
        "background": "Cases of measles have skyrocketed because of the rise of the \u2018antivax\u2019 movement and the UK has now lost it\u2019s measles-free status. Measles kills and by failing to vaccinate their children; antivaxxers are putting not only their own children at risk, but other vulnerable members of society too.",
