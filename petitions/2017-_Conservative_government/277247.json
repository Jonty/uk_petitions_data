        "additional_details": "The current maximum fine for breaking electoral rules is only \u00a320,000. It's is a fraction of what political campaigns spend, so it is no deterrent. You can be fined more for touting tickets at a football match\r\n\r\nRules don't ban foreign organisations & individuals spending money on election or referendum campaigns, especially digital ads. There must be better rules on spending on digital ads, with spending declared during or just after a campaign not months later so campaigns are accountable",
        "background": "The current election rules are so weak they don't deter cheating\r\n\r\nThe Government must\r\nIncrease the fine for breaching rules,\r\nBan foreign organisations & individuals from spending money in political campaigns; \r\nMake political campaigns declare spending during or soon after the election",
