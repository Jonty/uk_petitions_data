        "additional_details": "Although the cost of studying internationally is lower with no access to any finance loans how can one be expected to pay outright their tuition fees and all living expenses without a loan. If British students were able to experience university in another country they would be able to bring their cultural knowledge and developed skills back to England to then pay back the student loan they borrowed from the English Government whilst in employment in the country.",
        "background": "I have personally been offered an incredible opportunity to study at the prestigious Design Academy Eindhoven, however I have no access to the English student loan system. So although I will be representing England as an international student I can not receive any financial support.",
