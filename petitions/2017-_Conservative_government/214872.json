        "additional_details": "The title Ms. began to be used as early as the 17th century, as a title which like Mister that did not originally indicate marital status. It fell into disuse until the 20th century. What is needed today is a more comprehensive term which does homage to the sex without expressing any views as to their domestic situation. The abbreviation Ms. is simple, and easy to write. It is more logical that the retention of what the two doubtful terms [Miss and Mrs.] have in common.",
        "background": "In the early 1972 the use of Ms. was adopted by the women's movement, the reasoning being that since a man's marital status is not revealed by the title Mr. while women must reveal it. Ask the UK government publicising Ms. functions as the only title both for married and for unmarried women.",
