        "additional_details": "We know and understand that MPs are workers like the majority of the population and have the right to time off with their families. \r\n\r\nHowever, the House of Commons is scheduled to have four recesses between now and the new Brexit deadline.  The longest recess will be the Summer Recess, which normally lasts six weeks.  Less than two weeks after that, there will be a further recess for party conferences. \r\n\r\nIn the short time left to find a way forward this situation is absurd.",
        "background": "Parliament hasn't yet agreed on the terms of Brexit.  \r\n\r\nThe EU has extended UK membership until 31st October but it's important for Parliament to use this extra time wisely. \r\n\r\nWe urge the House of Commons to suspend the Summer Recess and have a shorter one.",
