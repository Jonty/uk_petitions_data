        "action": "Justice for EU nationals with settled status.",
        "additional_details": "My own Swedish wife has been here in the UK continuously for 37 years, far longer than she spent in Sweden. She has worked and paid taxes here over a long period but has not been able to vote in any GE and was denied a vote in the 2016 referendum. This is clearly unfair, unjust, and an abuse of her rights to representation, along with those of many others in a similar situation. This petition seeks to provide a remedy, and to remove that clear injustice.",
        "background": "Many EU nationals resident in the UK could not vote in the 2016 referendum, or in UK General Elections. This is clearly against all notions of fairness and justice. If people have settled status, that should be sufficient to allow them full voting rights.",
