I believe THAT position is an affront to democracy and makes a mockery of any notion of basic fairness. \r\n\r\nIt is an intolerable stain on the reputation of the UK for decency and fairness that this situation exists in 2018.. It must be rectified, and as soon as possible.",

My Swedish wife, here for 36 years, having brought up 3 children here, working and paying taxes here, still cannot vote in GEs.",
