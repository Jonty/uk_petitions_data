        "additional_details": "Democracy voted that not one single party should lead Government. To solve issues, and to conclude  Brexit well, Great Britain needs a group of people standing for the best principles from major parties.

We do not need a dictator; we need a group of passionate people who want to resolve the problems of Great Britain from every aspect-the environment; financially; socially... the list goes on.",
