To solve issues, and to conclude  Brexit well, Great Britain needs a group of people standing for the best principles from major parties. The needs of Great Britain are large and complex, and can not be resolved by the ideas of one single party. We do not need a dictator; we need a group of passionate people who want to resolve the problems of Great Britain from every aspect-the environment; financially; socially... the list goes on.",
