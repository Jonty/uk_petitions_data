        "additional_details": "Over 5.4 million payday loans were taken in the year to June 2018, according to financial regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  These loans can have interest rates of up to 1,500% which could potentially be impossible for an 18 year old to pay back when in education and not in employment.\r\nI want to see kids being taught about bills, mortgages, credit scores, rent and all other lines of credit to ensure their future is thought trough and to prevent future ongoing debt.",
        "background": "An 18 year old can get any form of credit out whilst still in college education with no knowledge of credit scores, interest rates, and mortgage applications.\r\nWe need to teach 16-18 year olds about these subjects so they can prepare for life after education and understand the ways of handling money",
