        "action": "Close the financial support gap for students taking a leave of absence",
        "additional_details": "Students on a leave of absence are not considered to be full-time students by SFE, so their loan and maintenance payments stop. The DWP class these students as full-time and thus not eligible for state benefits. \r\n\r\nStudents require leave for many reasons, such as illness, disability, bereavement, care duties, pregnancy and parental leave. Current rules place these students in a vulnerable position whereby they may have access to no support at all, pressuring them to drop out of their degrees.",
        "background": "We call for the Department of Work and Pensions, in line with the policy of Student Finance England, to recognise students taking a leave of absence as no longer full-time students, and thus eligible to claim benefits including Housing Benefit, Income Support, JSA, and ESA and Universal Credit.",
