        "additional_details": "How is it fair that any loan you could get should be deducted from your benefits.  This loan needs to be repaid when you are earning enough.  Surely your entitlement to this loan says you need to spend more for your studies too on essential things such as books.   Please help abolish this practice.",
        "background": "Currently if you are entitled to have a student loan for the current year you will have this total deducted from any universal credit you are entitled to.  This is even if you don't apply for the loan.   Please remember too this is a loan not a grant, it will need to be paid back.",
