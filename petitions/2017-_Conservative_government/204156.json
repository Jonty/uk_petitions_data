        "additional_details": "This funding could save UK charities millions. If only 100,000 tonnes of surplus was redistributed it could save them between \u00a3150-200m - at least a tenfold return. \r\nAt current levels of redistribution it would only cost \u00a32.6m per year.\r\nIf we are wrong and this doesn't increase, the cost doesn't go up. If we are right, every pound will result in exponential benefit to charity.\r\nThis is great value, potentially hugely effective and risk free.\r\nTo read more go to thegrocer.co.uk/wastenotwantnot",
        "background": "It can cost up to \u00a3150 per tonne to separate, store and transport edible surplus food to charity. If this cost were reimbursed far more of the 270,000 tonnes of edible surplus in the system would go to people who need it. For only \u00a310-15m per year, 100,000 tonnes of food could be donated to charity.",
