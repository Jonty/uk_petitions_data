Nuclear weapons are the most destructive, inhumane and indiscriminate weapopns ever created. A single nuclear warhead, could kill millions of people. In the age of cyber warfare, the global 15,000 warheads pose a threat to human survival. The UK must lead the way to a nuclear-free and safer world by joining the UN Treaty.",
