        "additional_details": "Badger farms, predominantly in Asia, have been filmed keeping badgers in horrific conditions in order to produce hair for items like shaving brushes and paint brushes. When other options, like horse-hair, and artificial hair, is freely available, there is no reason to support this cruel industry in any way whatsoever, and the UK should take a lead in banning the use of this commodity.",
        "background": "Badger hair is often used in Britain because of certain water-retaining properties it has; however, the evidence is that animals suffer, at best, appalling living conditions, and at worst, terrible abuse and neglect, in order to produce this hair.",
