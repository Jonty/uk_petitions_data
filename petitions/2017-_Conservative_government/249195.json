        "additional_details": "It is no secret that the majority of MPs were against Brexit. However, most MPs feel they need to be seen to be upholding the will of the people by honouring the leave vote. The solution for them, support a deal that is Brexit in name only. Remaining in either the single market or customs union does not reflect what was promised by the leave campaign and is a hollow attempt by MPs to preserve their own positions of being able to say they have supported the democratic vote.",
        "background": "People voted for Brexit for different reasons but common to the majority was either control of EU immigration or the ability to strike independent trade deals which May\u2019s deal delivers. Other (softer) deals are a betrayal of this concept and leave us bound by EU rules but with no say.",
