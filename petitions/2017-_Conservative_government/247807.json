        "additional_details": "We will despite what our politians say be better off in the long term to revert back to an independent country and trade within the WTO. Remember Germany will still want to sell us BMWs etc. No EU country will turn it\u2019s back on our trade as it\u2019s not in there best interest. We will take control once again of our Laws, our Borders etc as we were prior to joining the Common Market ( pre membership of the EU)",
        "background": "It was democratically decided with a referendum that we should leave the EU so why should the majority be ignored. It would be a disgrace if our politicians whom are voted in by the us the majority. So leave should mean leave even without a deal. So let\u2019s prevent article 50 been revoked.",
