        "action": "Change and restrict the dates for sale of fireworks around bonfire night.",
        "additional_details": "There are members of the public who are not sensible and continuously break the law, setting off fireworks in proximity to peoples homes and even terrorising and subjecting abuse to other members of the public for up to the whole 4 weeks of sale. Unfortunately animals are also very easily abused with fireworks too, many incidents include tieing them to animals and setting them off.\r\nI call to get the sale dates changed and restricted to less than 14 days around the time of bonfire night.",
        "background": "We all know that bans do not work, we all know that bonfire night isn't going anywhere, but did you know that the sale of fireworks around bonfire night starts from the 15th of October to the 8th of November that's 25 days of sale. Potentially 4 weeks of fireworks going off in any one area.",
