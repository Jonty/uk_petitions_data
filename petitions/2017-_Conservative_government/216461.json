        "additional_details": "When we were in the specialist heart hospital, there were many children coming in, with a late diagnosis. This can be very fatal and stressful. We didn\u2019t know anything about the heart so we had to learn about this too. Having a heart scan like an echo would detect any problems or issues. The faster it\u2019s picked up, the better. Specialists can be involved straight away with the correct care needed. An echo will take 15 mins. I would rather spend 15 mins extra knowing my child\u2019s heart was healthy.",
        "background": "Lots of new born babies are sent home from hospital with serious heart problems, which, are not known about until it\u2019s too late. My youngest son was sent home with heart defects which were not picked up until he was two weeks old & required surgery almost immediately. This could\u2019ve been prevented.",
