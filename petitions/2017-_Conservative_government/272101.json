        "additional_details": "Over the last couple of years arguments about Brexit have taken over politics. At the same time the whole country is uncertain of what is happening. We need a strong and trustworthy government who can get on with the true issues in the world. A government who act like one not behave like immature children. At the same time, the people need an opportunity to vote on what they really want. Many discussions in the run up to the 2016 referendum were misguided. The time has come for everyone to vote.",
        "background": "If there is another election, a vote for conservatives may not mean a vote for Brexit. Therefore why not arrange another EU referendum with options A: Remain B: Leave with a deal C: Leave with no deal. This will give certainty to everyone and establish a strong goverment to enable the UK to prosper.",
