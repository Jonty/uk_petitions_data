        "action": "Create a new democracy where the people decide on topics using a software tool.",
        "additional_details": "This removes the onus from MPs and can allow them to just advise instead of lying to the nation to further their personal agendas using the media and propaganda to insult our intelligence as a society. Anything less than this is not democratic at all. It will stop businesses controlling political issues with money and allows the people, rich and poor to have their say. As of now most get no say at all. For the people of the UK, let them decide their future not their Dictatorship.",
        "background": "For centuries we have used a very old voting system which is considerably outdated. Take advantage of our technological prowess and allow the people to vote using software in which every eligible voter has a voting key so votes cannot be rigged and decisions are made by the people for the people.",
