        "additional_details": "As a campaigner for European Movement and People\u2019s Vote, I have met many leave and remain voters who think that the Leave campaign was disingenuous and should either be annulled or overturned by a People\u2019s Vote. The 2016 referendum result was advisory. Our government have not been able to negotiate a successful exit route, and there are no signs of a positive outcome. We have a responsibility as a great nation to look after and work with our neighbours, close and far.",
        "background": "The Leave Campaign are under investigation for dubious funding. Many of their campaign platforms, statements and promises have been debunked. The 2016 vote was not legitimate. We call for the revocation of Article 50 in respect of illegal campaign spending.",
