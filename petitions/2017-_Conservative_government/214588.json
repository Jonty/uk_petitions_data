        "additional_details": "You could be potentially breaking the law without even realising it.\r\nI am one of those many law abiding citizens who have to work away from home due to lack of suitable work in my home area. I own a TV licence at home. During the week I rent a cottage off my employer. I have no utility bills, do not have the right to vote in this constituency and I am not registered with a GP here and yet I am required, by law, to have a TV licence - Why?\r\nIf you think that this should be changed please vote.",
        "background": "If you have a licence and travel on a bus whilst watching iPlayer you are covered. If you live or holiday in a caravan you are covered. \r\nIf you stay in a hotel, B&B or holiday home you ARE NOT and require the owner of that establishment to have a licence.",
