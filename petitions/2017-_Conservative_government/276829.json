        "additional_details": "Instead we would like a form of letter or contract to sign to say we do not wish to resit the subject after sitting the basic GCSE level of Maths and English. Reasoning for this is that some courses for college are very full on and some students have to work on the side, as-well as their normal college course. We think it\u2019s unfair to force students to sit an exam they don\u2019t wish to sit after already receiving the basic GCSE level. Especially if there future career doesn\u2019t need it.",
        "background": "We want to scrap the current education rules that means 16-18 year old in full time education must resit Maths and/or English if they do not pass at grade 4.",
