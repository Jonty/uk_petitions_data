If a total ban was introduced, I am sure it would push the sale of fireworks underground, into a black market. \r\n\r\nACC Prophet: \u201cIf a black market became available, it would be even more difficult to police than the situation we currently have, which would be a really unhelpful unintended consequence.",
        "background": "Banning the sale of fireworks to the public has been debated in Parliament (2018) but concluded that it would be difficult to police.\r\n\r\nRather than ban fireworks, firework safety should be make compulsory in schools to teach children about the potential dangers and educate them on how to stay safe.",
