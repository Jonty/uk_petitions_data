        "additional_details": "Motorcyclists make up approx 5% of UK road users but are involved in approx 70% of serious road accidents. It is hard to believe that all of these accidents are caused by rider error. Car drivers must become more aware of motorcyclists and their vulnerability. This has been recognised previously by the 'think bike' slogan but more can still be done to increase road safety for bikers. Having an understanding by all as to the road position and potential actions of bikes will save lives.",
