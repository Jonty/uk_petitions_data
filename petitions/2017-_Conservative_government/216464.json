        "additional_details": "If you are involved in a road traffic accident that was not a fault of your own, usually the third party\u2019s insurance would cover the damage to your vehicle and your insurance excess. If however, the third party is an uninsured driver, this then falls on you to recover your costs. \r\n\r\nMillions of motorists are uninsured because the penalty for doing so is not severe enough. A \u00a3300 fine is cheaper than most annual insurance quotes!\r\n\r\nThe fine should be more severe to prevent this from happening.",
        "background": "Currently the penalty for driving a motor vehicle with no insurance is \u00a3300 and 6 points on your license. With this being the case, millions of motorists take the gamble!",
