For example, you could start a petition asking to ban exams and replace them with coursework, if that's something you'd like to see happen.\r\n\r\nYou might like to sign one of these petitions:\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/242410\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/259667"
