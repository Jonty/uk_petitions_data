In any other branch of public service, when there is a high workload, all leave is cancelled. \r\nThe time for procrastination is over, and the House must deliver the will of the people.\r\nIf this petition receives enough signatures to be debated in the House, it will be very obvious to the electorate that any Member voting against it without good reason will be putting their own interests before those of the country.",
        "background": "After three years of prevarication there is now some concern that arrangements for Brexit may not be concluded before the summer recess 2019.\r\nWe demand that the House of Commons postpone its summer recess until EITHER Brexit has been achieved, OR we have voted to  remain in the EU.",
