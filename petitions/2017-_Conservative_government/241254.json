When diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s Disease your C1 / C1E entitlements to drive a motorhome should remain, unless a GP / Consultant says otherwise, and be reviewed on a 3-yearly basis, as per B / BE.\r\n2.           Medium-sized vehicles C1 / C1E, such as motorhomes, should be treated the same as Cars B / BE, with a possible weight restriction on 6-7 tonnes. (Create a separate category under Class 1 \u2013 Leisure vehicles).\r\n3.           At 70 you should retain your C1 / C1E to drive a motorhome unless a GP / Consultant says otherwise.   ",
