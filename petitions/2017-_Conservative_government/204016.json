        "additional_details": "Making this a subject in TNC, an option for languages, will not only help bring more deaf awareness, but also it will teach young students how to sign, this will give them an added skill so they can interact with deaf people, go on to work within the deaf world or know it for future use incase themselves or someone they know becomes deaf.\r\nI believe learning BSL would benefit more than learning French or German. \r\nNot everyone will go to France or Germany, but they will meet a deaf person.",
        "background": "Approximately 1 in every 1000 children is born with a severe or profound hearing loss. 90% of all deaf children are born to hearing parents. Approximately 50,000 deaf people in the UK use British Sign Language (BSL) as their first or preferred language.",
