        "additional_details": "Prior to 1989 we had not had unelected leaders except for at times of ill health or national emergency. Since then we have had Major, Brown and May all put into a job without the public say (in 2 cases with NO public consultation).\r\nThe leaders of parties stand at elections as potential Prime Ministers and any change to this (especially as it leads to changes in policy direction) should be put to the British people.",
        "background": "We are about to have our third unelected prime minister in 10 years, bringing sweeping changes to what was voted on at manifesto in general elections and with no say to the British People. If the government wish to change leader it should automatically trigger a general election.",
