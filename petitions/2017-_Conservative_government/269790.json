        "additional_details": "China gave concessions as to the autonomy of Hong Kong, and on the basis of these concessions the UK Government at the time agreed to the Joint Declaration, without consultation with Hongkongers generally, to hand Hong Kong back to China in 1997. There are concerns that the concessions promised by China are now being eroded.\r\n\r\nThe UK should urgently act to protect her overseas nationals from the erosion of promised rights, and the unwillingness of the HK Gov't to address ongoing police brutality.",
        "background": "Sovereignty of Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997 following the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which guaranteed \"one country, two systems\", as well as keeping Hong Kong unchanged for 50 years. Many observers now feel that one side is no longer keeping its side of the bargain.",
