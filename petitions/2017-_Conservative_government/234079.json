        "additional_details": "However, every 5-7 years some landlords charge for 53 weeks! So UC Claimants lose out 1 whole week of rent! This is unfair to Claimants and Landlords!\r\n \r\nI quote from UC website: \"Universal Credit will always be calculated based on a 52 week year, unless rent is charged over fewer than 52 weeks\".\r\n \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/universal-credit-and-rented-housing--2/universal-credit-and-rented-housing-guide-for-landlords\r\n \r\nThis issue has been raised a few times directly with Universal Credit, but they are adamant they will only pay for 52 weeks! This needs to be raised for a discussion by the Parliament. Help me reach 100,000 signs!",
        "background": "Universal Credit (UC) is paid monthly to Landlords. If rent is paid weekly, the monthly rate is worked out by multiplying the weekly rent by 52, then dividing by 12.",
