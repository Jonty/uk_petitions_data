        "action": "Amend s.76 Serious Crime Act 2015 (Parental Alienation amendment)",
        "additional_details": "The Courts, CAFCASS, Social Services and the Police treat domestic violence as a crime against women, yet up to 1200 men take their lives each year because the system blocks them from their children. Whilst this may seem like a crime against an adult, it is actually child abuse. Reports in numerous countries demonstrate how damaging this is to children and yet the UK Government ignores the issue. One suicide is too many, but over 1000 annually is a national disgrace.",
        "background": "Parental Alienation is a psychological crime against former partners and children, yet is largely ignored by the Police and Courts. Amend s.76 SCA 2015 to specifically make Parental Alienation a \"domestic Abuse\" crime. This is child abuse as well as parent abuse and it must stop.",
