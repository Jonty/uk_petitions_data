        "additional_details": "Theresa may has orchestrated a remainer coupe at the Chequers. \r\nShe has abondoned her \u201cred lines\u201d and bowed to the EU, proposing a new Brexit deal that is merely a new membership of the EU. This will render any benefit of leaving the EU that was campaigned during the referendum impossible to deliver and will make the UK a vassal state belonging to Brussels. Thus to conclude the vote is not being upheld by the Goverment and actions must be taken to force them to deliver the Brexit we voted for.",
        "background": "This petitions seeks the introduction of legislative material into Parliament to force the Goverment to deliver the decision taken by the people of the UK to leave the European Union entirely and in all forms. Current proposals are merely a new form of EU membership and constitute a clear betrayal.",
