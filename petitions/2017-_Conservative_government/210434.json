Why should people who are unable to hear not have the same opportunities as those who can? The opportunity to take part in interesting debate, order a round of drinks or strike up conversation with someone new? It is simply astonishing how in such an amazing and diverse nation, people who cannot hear are denied the same opportunities as those who can.",

As one of the most progressive & inclusive countries on the planet, why are we not embracing this as part of daily life? We have the opportunity to talk with 87,000 more people...imagine the difference that would make to the world.",
