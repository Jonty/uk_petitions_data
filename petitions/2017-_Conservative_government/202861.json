        "additional_details": "With domestic abuse on the rise we need to educate our children that this is wrong and not to put up with it. This is the only way to stop this moving on to the next generation. \r\n\r\nWe also need to start making parents responsible for the actions of their abusive children. We are fined if our child misses too much school",
        "background": "As a single mother of 4 daughters, I have gone through domestic abuse and I am trying to bring my daughters up to know this is wrong, and as they spend a lot of time at school I think all children, girls and boys, would benefit from this being taught at school.",
