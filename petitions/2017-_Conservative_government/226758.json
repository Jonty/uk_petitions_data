        "additional_details": "Stan Kroenke owns various American sports teams, these teams were doing well until kroenke took ownership, he eventually took them into debt, including a law suit against him when he moved from the team from st.louis to Los Angeles! He makes no attempt to invest into our team, and we don\u2019t want to see our team decline into ruin by this selfish man. Should he take full ownership then there will be no openness of accounts, we have the highest ticket prices and we don\u2019t compete in Europe!",
        "background": "Stan Kroenke has made an offer of \u00a3602m to Purchase Alisher Usmanov\u2019s shares plus the shares the fans own of Arsenal fc, we are a very close fan base, some even classing it as a family, if this happens then the fans will never be listened to, he\u2019ll use any profit he makes to fund his debts.",
