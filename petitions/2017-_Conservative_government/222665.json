        "additional_details": "An elected chamber, drawn from all walks of life and being fully representative of the electorate should replace the current system. There should not be allowed to be overwhelming numbers from one particular political party or persuasion. Elected members should not need to be past MPs and could be experts in their field - elected to scrutinise in particular areas. People need to be able to trust that the powers given to scrutinise are not abused, nor guided by personal agenda or preference.",
        "background": "Abolition of the House of Lords has been debated. No clear way forward to address people\u2019s concerns was forthcoming; though their was some acknowledgement of it overstepping it\u2019s remit, particularly to thwart the people\u2019s decision for Brexit. The chamber needs to better reflect people\u2019s wishes.",
