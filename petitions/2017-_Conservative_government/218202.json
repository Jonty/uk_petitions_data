I have seen on the \u201cMoving Here\u201d website, shipping landing lists in the 1950s to 1960s. The records are stated to be at the National Archives. I note apologies of Home Secretary Amber Rudd and Prime Minister Theresa May, with the announcement on 20th April 2018 that compensation would be paid to those members of the \u201cWindrush\u201d generation who have been unfairly threatened with deportation.",
