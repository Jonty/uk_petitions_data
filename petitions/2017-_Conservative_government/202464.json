        "additional_details": "We recognise that the UK and its allies honourably sought a different path, which was seriously considered until the last possible moment by Kurdistani leaders, who judged they should proceed with the referendum to seek their self-determination. We urge the UK and all other countries to urgently encourage calm dialogue between Baghdad and Erbil so that the Kurdistan Region can continue to be a vital participant in the continuing battle against extremism and a good economic, political and security partner with all its neighbours as well as maintaining its highly commendable record of religious pluralism, protection for religious and ethnic minorities and the pursuit of democratic values.",
        "background": "The free and fair referendum in the Kurdistan Region on 25 September gave an overwhelming mandate of 93% on a high turnout to its leaders to negotiate a path to independence with the authorities in Baghdad but sadly their reaction so far has been a blockade of a vital ally in the fight against ISIS.",
