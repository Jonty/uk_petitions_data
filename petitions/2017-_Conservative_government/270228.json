        "additional_details": "Referendum so flawed that no JUSTIFYING MANDATE FOR ANY BREXIT. Chosen franchise let COMMONWEALTH citizens vote but NOT UK citizens in EU for over 15 years. Manifesto commitment \"Votes for Life\" not enacted first! Let Irish/Malta/Cyprus citizens vote (EU countries all 3) but NOT other EU countries. NOT let 16-17 yrs vote when their long-term future at stake. WHY? All those excluded from Right to Vote are also likely much affected by result.\r\nINFORMATION also meagre for proper assessment of issues",
        "background": "Govt. says franchise is on case by case basis, so Parliamentary franchise was right starting point. Wrong! Right start is The Issue: UK MEMBERSHIP OF EU. Referendum held as Party split on that Issue -so FIASCO. Special franchise needed. Not about legalities but relevance, principle and common sense",
