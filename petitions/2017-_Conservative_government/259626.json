        "additional_details": "It is vital that the Act be immediately suspended and then repealed. Clause 2 of the act enables the Secretary of State to amend the 2050 target, which could have the immediate effect of suspending it.\r\n\r\nThe 2050 target commits us to decarbonising our electricity, and could lead to the Government abolishing gas as a fuel for cooking and heating our homes, and \r\nconverting two thirds of our cars to electric. These aims would come at an astronomical cost. Since wind cannot significantly reduce emissions year-round (because of the need for back-up when no wind) and because solar power is useless at night and in winter, it would mean a vast investment in nuclear power.",
