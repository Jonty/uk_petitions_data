        "additional_details": "Every year, Salford City Council invests \u00a31.5m into its five nurseries. The nurseries are open to all, but specialise in supporting children and families with additional needs. They are all rated outstanding by Ofsted and score better than the city's private sector provision in school-readiness. They have a low turnover of highly dedicated and well-trained staff.\r\n\r\nChanges to the Direct Schools Grant mean those nurseries are threatened with closure. \r\n\r\nThe problem is replicated across the country.",
        "background": "Changes to the Direct Schools Grant mean that local authorities are required to \"pass through\" 93-95% of funding to external providers. \r\nThe Government set aside \u00a355m in transitional funding, but councils cannot access this for their nurseries.\r\nPublic sector nurseries nationwide now face closure.",
