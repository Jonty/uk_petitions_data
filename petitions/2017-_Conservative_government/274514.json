        "action": "Allow parents to spend time with their children by allowing holidays during term",
        "additional_details": "There is already a strain put on parents to ensure a healthy work & family life balance. This is made almost impossible by the state education system at the moment who do not allow families to spend quality time with each other within term. We must understand that education is immensely important for our childrens future but so is a happy home. This would allow more families the opportunity to afford holidays which in turn takes a lot of stress off the parents and provides a happier household.",
        "background": "Currently there is a very unjust ruling in place that prevents many families from being able to bond & spend essential time together. The ruling is if you take your child out of school for a family holiday during term time you are at risk of a fine or even in some circumstances a criminal record.",
