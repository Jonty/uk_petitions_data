        "action": "Broadband a must before Planning Permission to be granted for New Development",
        "additional_details": "Ideally, had the council ensured that broadband and other relevant communication infrastructure is in place before letting the builders to build new homes, as broadband can be and should be considered as almost the 4th basic human necessity in the recent times. Also Government taking measures to ensure everybody will have 2Mbps as a minimum, how can they ensure this if it is not built into the clauses which allow planning permissions to be granted. I have heard of stories where people are waiting for more than 2 years to get broadband connection. This is a shame for us to be calling ourselves as a developed nation.",
        "background": "Recently I moved to a new home which is part of massive 126 new builts being developed by Bellway Homes. Wokingham Council has given Planning Permission without communication infrastructure in place. BT Openreach have taken more than 6+ months and still none of us in the development have Broadband.",
