        "additional_details": "Theresa May has a 25 year plan for cutting out plastics. I do not think this is acceptable. \r\nMy solution is to force manufacturers to use colour coding for their produce. Possibly red for items which cannot be recycled.  \r\n1) The customer is less likely to walk to a check out with a bright red package, knowing they are harming the environment.\r\n2) Supermarket chains would be less inclined to stock \"red\" rated \u00edtems as the public would disaprove.\r\n3) Manufacturers would have to find alternatives.",
        "background": "We are all conscious of the damage made to our environment by using plastics which cannot be recycled. \r\nCurrent \"recycle\" signs on products are difficult to find.\r\nBy providing a colour code of how environmentally damaging each product is, customers are more likely to chose the less damaging ones.",
