        "additional_details": "Some of the homework they receive is sometimes difficult to understand, and not always relevant to their learning. Not only do the students feel pressurised at such a young age, but it can also cause conflict at home between the student and their parents. This is due to the parents also feeling stressed.",
        "background": "Being a student myself, I know the struggle. Children in primary education receive an unnecessary amount of homework each week, and need to be enjoying their childhood, and being more active. The only important homework is reading and spellings.",
