        "additional_details": "As an animal lover I think that if we chose to share our lives with animals then we have a duty to take care of them properly and never intentionally put them in danger just like we would with our children.  Dogs are very vulnerable and the are trusting of their owners, they love us unconditionally and we owe it to them not to leave them to die a long slow and painful death by locking them in an oven.",
        "background": "Too many people still leave their dogs to cook in cars even with the education and information that we have nowadays.  This show a lack of respect for an animal that is loyal and loving and relies on us humans to take good care of them.  We need to make this an offence to make people think twice.",
