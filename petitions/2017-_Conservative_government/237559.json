        "action": "Increase the minimum annual leave entitlement from 5.6 weeks to 7.6 weeks.",
        "additional_details": "Retirement age is increasing (currently 67). Estimates are that when today's teenagers retire, the retirement age will be 75. People currently look forward to retirement but with increasing age there are fewer possibilities for those years.\r\n\r\nGive us extra leave during our working years so that we can feel that we have lives and interests beyond work. It will reduce stress and exhaustion as well as increase happiness.\r\n\r\nWe will benefit, our children will benefit, our employers will benefit.",
        "background": "The increasing retirement age leaves far less to look forward to at the end of our working lives. We are asking for increased minimum annual leave entitlements during our working lives to compensate for this loss.\r\n\r\nThis will give us more time with our families and to follow our own interests.",
