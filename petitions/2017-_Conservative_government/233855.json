        "additional_details": "Research conducted by the YMCA found that overall spending on youth services in England has fallen by \u00a3737m (62%) since 2010. Between 2012 and 2016, 600 youth centres closed, 3,500 youth workers lost their jobs and 140,000 places for young people went. \r\n\r\nUnison (the union) asked youth workers about the impact of youth service cuts; 83% said they were having an effect on crime and antisocial behaviour, and 71% said it was now harder for young people to stay in formal education.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, demand the reversal of funding cuts to youth services since 2010 (62%). Youth work plays an integral role in the development of young people but is being jeopardised by the lack of support currently available. We must work to prevent youth violence and support mental health.",
