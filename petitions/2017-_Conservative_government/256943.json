        "action": "Create legislation to allow constituents to sack their MPs for gross misconduct",
        "additional_details": "It appears many MPs are willing to readily accept the democratic process when they are getting elected, but then unilaterally choose to ignore that same democratic process when they are asked to do something, they do not want to do. Too many MPs have now been found to have been openly lying on their CVs when they were campaigning and have failed to carry out the pledges they made to their constituents.  Gross misconduct is a sackable offence; their employment should be terminated asap.",
        "background": "Politicians need to understand, unequivocally, they are the servants of the people and cannot just decide to unilaterally ignore their constituents and citizens.  Mistruths and lies on your job application is a sackable offence in the workplace for ordinary people.",
