        "additional_details": "Northern citizens suffer from lower life expectancy, lack of investment in education, health, skilled training, quality employment opportunities, lack of political influence and economic growth. The neglect in the aforementioned areas are at such an extent that the North and South could be viewed as separate countries already, devolution of powers from London to a Northern Parliament would better serve the interests of citizens living and working within Northern England. Evidence is everywhere!",
        "background": "The divide gives sovereign autonomy to Northern England so it can best serve the needs & interests of its citizens with both nations N&S coexisting harmoniously within one territory. The divide is required to address unfair political preference, cultural and economic differences between the two.",
