        "additional_details": "Our academic year runs from September to September, including 12+ hour shifts, nights, holidays and full time study, without the 4 month summer of a normal student. Despite our final year not reducing in length, our student finance allowance decreases by \u00a3500 - imperative to funding our living costs.The UK has a massive shortage of Nurses and Midwives, however many students are having to drop out of their course only months before qualifying due to the current legislation. Help us fight this!",
        "background": "Currently, all third year university students receive a reduced maintenance loan due to finishing their degree in May. However, student Nurses and Midwives also fall under this category, despite their course not finishing until September. Help us get this debated in Parliament!",
