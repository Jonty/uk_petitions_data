        "additional_details": "At first hand I\u2019ve experienced dealing with the physical and mental problems wrought by cannabis. I\u2019ve seen an intelligent,sociable boy turn into a recluse with psychosis.To escape the demons in his head he went onto heroin. I sought specialist advice to support my son and family. This experience has been harrowing as I have learnt of deaths from overdoses and suicides within my counselling groups. Fight for the future generations now.",
        "background": "Most people are fine after smoking cannabis but a proportion are badly affected,with lifelong health problems,including mental illness.The huge strain on the family impacts greatly on relationships,health,finances and friendships. The expense to society is huge.",
