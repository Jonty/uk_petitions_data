        "additional_details": "My 9 month old cat Pixie was left for dead just outside my front door after she had been hit by a car. She had collar with her name and our number on. But was still just left for dead. Luckily I found her soon after - some cat owners aren't so lucky and will never know where their cat has gone. We could change this by amending the 1988 road traffic act so they get the similar/same protection as dogs do.  \r\n\r\nOriginal legislation \r\nhttps://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/170",
        "background": "Under the 1988 Road hitting a dog requires you too stop and/or report it. This however sadly does not apply to cats. We need to up date the  1988 Road Traffic Act so it now includes and protects cats. Many of our feline friends are being left dead on the road with the drivers just driving off.",
