        "action": "Scrap the make taxation digital regulations for all business below \u00a3100k profit",
        "additional_details": "The making tax digital regulations are fundamentally flawed and failed to take note of the consultation warnings of the impact they would have on in particular small business's, so instead of running a parallel trial where the uptake would be voluntary they have instead opted for closure of business and damage to the economy. Therefore the only safe solution is to scrap these for low profit business and make it voluntary instead so that those who see benefits can & others continue to file online",
        "background": "The make tax digital regulations deliver no benefits to either HMRC or small business, especially those on cash accounting or low profit business. The additional burden will inevitably close or damage many business', &  the economy so the best solution would be to scrap it before it is too late",
