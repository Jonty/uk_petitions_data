        "additional_details": "A citizens Assembly of people randomly drawn from the UK population would actually give voice to the people so that WE can express our will. How else can the will of the people be carried out when we are unable to speak and no-one in parliament is listening to us?\r\n\r\nWe could consult with all parties concerned - EU, Ireland, workers, employers, farmers, environmental groups etc.\r\n\r\nA citizens assembly would be a true cross party colloboration.\r\n\r\nWe need to look at the causes of Brexit and address.",
        "background": "Neither a GE nor Referendum is capable of exploring all options for Brexit and investigating the underlying structural problems in the UK and EU that caused Brexit.\r\nPoliticians have wasted two years and achieved no consensus on anything. A referendum would just be more divisive. A CA can do more.",
