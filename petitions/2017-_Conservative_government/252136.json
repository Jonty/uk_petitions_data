        "action": "Stop the development of up to 64 properties on Gooshays green, Harold Hill",
        "additional_details": "The development add strain on already strained local services such as doctors, dentists and schools.\r\nIt will create an overbearing feel to the area as there have been many new developments in the area.\r\nIt will decrease an already diminishing amount of green/recreational space.\r\nIt will cause pressure on surrounding infrastructure with added cars causing added congestion, road safety issues and noise pollution.\r\nOvercrowding may further contribute to the rise in crime, especially knife crime.",
        "background": "This petition has been started to stop the building of these properties as we believe it does not benefit existing residents of Gooshays Gardens/ Harold Hill and will instead diminish the quality of life and wellbeing of these residents.",
