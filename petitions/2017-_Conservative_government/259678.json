(Better and bigger signage).\r\nRoad markings where it is illegal to park should be mandatory. \r\nParking attendants advising motorists of parking restrictions should be mandatory when enforcement is being carried out.\r\nPrivate car parks should accept and fully embrace the blue badge scheme. \r\nPenalties should be capped to the level of local authority parking fines and not seen as a revenue generating exercise.",
        "background": "Control of parking on private land should be more regulated.  In allowing public access to parking on private land, companies should not be allowed to determine their own rules in order to enforce non-negotiable parking penalties.",
