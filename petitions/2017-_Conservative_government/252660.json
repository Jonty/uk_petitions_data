        "additional_details": "The UK voted to leave the EU by a majority of 1.3 million people. The UK is leaving the EU.\r\nParliament voted to invoke Article 50 and begin the Brexit process. \r\nSince general consensus seems to be that Leave voters did not know what they were voting for and that there should be a second referendum, we should put the question to leave voters only and let the people who voted to leave the EU, decide how it should best be done.\r\nLeave with Theresa May\u2019s deal or leave with No Deal.",
        "background": "With British MP\u2019s consistently proving incapable of resolving a Brexit deadlock which they themselves have created, Leave voters from the first referendum should be given the chance to vote on whether to Leave the EU with Theresa May\u2019s deal or No Deal at all.",
