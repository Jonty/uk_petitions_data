        "action": "A petition to action Government to posthumously pardon all Suffragettes",
        "additional_details": "As a relative of Emmeline Pankhurst there has never been a more appropriate time to pursue the notion of having suffragettes that were imprisoned during the Votes for Women campaign posthumously pardoned and their efforts celebrated. Despite the peaceful efforts of Millicent Fawcett, Emmeline and her daughters at the start of the campaign, progress was slow and their voices dampened. Many courageous women pushed the campaign forward in a way that ensured their voices were heard 'Votes for Women'",
        "background": "From 1900 to the beginning of WW1 approximately 1,000 women were imprisoned in the British campaign to gain the votes for women.These women suffered and sacrificed a lifetime for generations today to live an equal life.These women should be posthumously pardoned and celebrated for their bravery.",
