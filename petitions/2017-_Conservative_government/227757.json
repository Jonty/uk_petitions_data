        "additional_details": "Abingdon is one of the only towns to not fly the LGBT flag. The Abingdon council have previously rejecteted the flag to be flown. Many young people have been abused and excluded due to their sexuality and gender, and we strongly believe this is unacceptable. This is very important to us and we would like our LGBT family and friends to be able to live in comfort without feeling threatened or ashamed of who they are. We would like to raise awareness and allow the flag to be up in our home town.",
        "background": "Myself and twelve other young people are on an NCS course, and we believe that the LGBT community do not have the support they need to thrive in safety. We are doing a fundraiser including a colour run and family day in our home town, Abingdon, to raise awareness.",
