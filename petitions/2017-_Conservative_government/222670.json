        "action": "Refuse Donald Trump entry to the UK until the US changes its immigration policy",
        "additional_details": "Trump and Sessions have commented officially many times on the issue.  They and members of their administration are fully supportive of this inhumane treatment, think it is a great thing they are doing and that it will work.  It won't.\r\n\r\nThe psychological trauma faced by children under the age of 18 that are forcibly separated from their parents will leave a legacy of mental health issues for years to come.",
        "background": "It is widely known that the current US immigration policy is callous and inhumane.  It is reminiscent of the worst atrocities society has committed on the vulnerable and young; harking back to Germany in the 1930's.",
