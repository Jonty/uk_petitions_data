        "additional_details": "In Manchester there are currently only 2 schools with the resource to teach deaf children. Both in the same area of Manchester, so the council pay to transport children from all over Manchester to these 2 schools. To clarify 'resource' is a room where a teacher for the deaf can do some quiet work with the deaf children. \r\nThere are new schools being built all the time, surely this is a perfect opportunity to add the resource bases the schools need. The deaf teachers are already here and trained.",
        "background": "Pupils with special needs have a basic right to a mainstream education and the increased opportunity for social interaction with their peers that this brings. Mainstream participation allows everybody the opportunity to learn to understand the diversity of human ability, without prejudice.",
