        "additional_details": "The magazines are great, educational, and kids love them. The toys are merely to encourage favour of one magazine over another. They are also cheaply made and break quickly.  This is creating a significant amount of pollution (something that our children will not thank us for in years to come).  Adding the toys also takes advantage of children's susceptibility to advertising.",
