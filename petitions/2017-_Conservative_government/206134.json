        "action": "Make banks reduce affordability criteria for mortgages for first time buyers.",
        "additional_details": "The current affordability criteria makes it impossible for a single person to afford their own home. \r\n\r\nBanks are still making large profits, yet they seem unwilling to increase their risk in order help hardworking people afford their own place to live. \r\n\r\nUsing mortgage calculators for a required amount, buyers see amounts which they feel they could afford, yet the affordability criteria excludes them from applying. \r\n\r\nThis petition proposes banks meet the 75% regardless of salary for Help-to-Buy.",
        "background": "Affordability criteria with banks is currently around 3-4 times salary with adjustments for expenses. \r\n\r\nEven with Help-to-Buy, a person on the current living wage would have a \u00a330,000 deficit on the 75% mortgage they would need to afford a \u00a3150,000 property.",
