        "action": "Update BE test rules to allow automatic cars to be used and gain manual as well",
        "additional_details": "The rules were changed to allow Cat C and CE candidates to pass a test in an automatic truck and gain manual entitlement if they hold a manual Cat B licence, as more and more trucks were being made in automatic only.\r\nThis is now happening with car manufacturers and proving to be a problem to trainers in our industry.\r\nAutomatic vehicles are now more fuel efficient than manual vehicles so I feel the rules must be changed swiftly to enable us to help with reducing emissions to help our planet",
        "background": "The BE driving licence rules need to be updated to allow people that take the test in an automatic to gain manual entitlement if they hold manual Cat B licence, as this is proving difficult for Trainers to buy suitable test vehicles, as more and more car manufacturers are stopping making manual cars",
