        "action": "Abolish business rates and replace with business rates transaction charge",
        "additional_details": "A 0.5% business rates charge levied on the sales value of each transaction would be a fair arrangement and would be linked directly to the success of a retail business. \r\nSince most sales transactions for online and high street retailers are by credit card, the collection mechanism is already in place.  The credit card holder\u2019s physical location or credit card address is readily available for government\u2019s re-distribution to the local authorities.",
        "background": "Internet based companies have an unfair competitive advantage over traditional bricks and mortar retailers who have to pay business rates.  These disproportionate business rates are contributing towards the demise and failure of the local high street.   Help redress the imbalance for all retailers.",
