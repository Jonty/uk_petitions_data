        "additional_details": "The documentary \u2018Pharmacist under pressure?\u2019 highlighted three fatal cases. The serious case review reported a failure of individual pharmacists as a direct cause of the avoidable errors in drug dispensation. Only in one case were the owners of the premise held accountable (vicarious liability). Pharmacists must be provided with the minimum time and resources to prevent these errors. Order 2016 will improve patient safety by holding pharmacy owners to account and not just scapegoat individuals.",
