        "additional_details": "The government controls our lives, and our generation has now been led into an unknown political shambles.

        "background": "One of my friends, an A-Level student, recently asked me what the difference is between Labour and Conservative; if this simple difference is not made clear, then how could they distinguish between a hard and a soft Brexit? We have sex and drugs education, but where is our political education?",
