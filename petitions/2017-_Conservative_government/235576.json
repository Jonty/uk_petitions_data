        "additional_details": "https://www.gov.uk/overtime-your-rights\r\n\r\nThis is the section of law which needs changed to make it fair for all employees regardless of job title, as it states the employers do not need to pay their employees overtime as long as the total hours worked does not drop their pay to below the national living wage, how can this be seen as a fair and just system.",
        "background": "Too many companies can get away with making their employees work over their contracted hours and not pay them for all the hours they work, this is not fair for the people as everyone should be paid for all hours they work, including all overtime hours they do.",
