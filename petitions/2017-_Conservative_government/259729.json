        "additional_details": "Some schools have a policy where when a parent owes a little bit of dinner money they will happily feed a child bread and butter for dinner until it is paid.. these amounts that are owed can be as little as \u00a38.. it\u2019s vile and in humane, not to mention embarrassing for a child who is forced to eat basically nothing, who is then sat in school for the rest of the day trying to learn whilst being hungry! Children need food full of nutrients to help fuel their brains.",
        "background": "It is absolutely disgusting for a government run school to be allowed to serve a child bread, butter and a apple for dinner. A child needs a healthy meal to fuel their concentration to help their brains to function to excel in school life! Absolutely absurd! Disgusting and not humane in any way!!",
