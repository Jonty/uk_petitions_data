Our consumption of carbon emitting products and energy caused climate change, we must adjust our spending habits to consume carbon, not emit it. A CO2 labelling/display system will help develop more environmentally aware spending patterns and empower the consumer to combat climate change through voting with their pound.",
        "background": "Ask the government to back a voluntary carbon labelling system displayed on all packaging for manufacturers, producers and retailers to follow.\r\nAllowing the consumer to clearly identify net cost/benefit of their consumption will drive demand for a green economy and simplify our spending choices.",
