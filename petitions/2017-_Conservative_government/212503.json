        "additional_details": "Prior to the new legislation ( The Psychoactive Substances Act May 2016)  ' legal high' was the title given to  substances sold that emulated illegal drugs such as cocaine,heroin, speed, cannabis. It could be found sold in shops/festivals/online. Since the Ban was enforced these psychoactive drugs have been forced underground and are now even more dangerous. I suggest that any taxes gathered from the years that the drug was 'legal ' should be redirected in specific rehab and homeless centres.",
        "background": "Formally Legal highs started out as a legal recreational drug, found in many shops in the UK and often seen in use in festivals. \r\nFast forward 10 years and the now illegal  psychoactive substances leave addicts with side effects, paranoia, coma, seizures and death with no specialised support.",
