        "action": "Curb the visible deployment of armed police",
        "additional_details": "Armed police are being routinely and visibly deployed at major events, city centres and transport hubs.  Visible deployment risks 'normalising' the presence of armed police on our streets, and encourages a perception that increased arming of police is both necessary and inevitable.  In doing so, it can undermine the status and primacy of the \u201ccommunity bobby\u201d or other unarmed police.  Our policing depends on retaining community engagement, and unarmed police underpin our tradition of \u2018policing by consent\u2019.",
        "background": "We call on the Home Office to change its guidance to local and specialist police forces, in order to ensure that unarmed neighbourhood policing remains the public face of UK policing, and to curb the visible deployment of armed police.",
