        "additional_details": "Most of our plastic ends up in landfills, our oceans and waterways, and the environment. Plastics do not biodegrade. Instead they slowly break down into smaller pieces of plastic called microplastics. Research shows the effects plastic has on the Earth as well as on humans. - from the Nature Path website",
        "background": "Single use plastic has effected how our planet behaves, from causing pollution to melting ice caps. It\u2019s our fault this is happening because we\u2019re using single use plastic. To stop this, we need to ban single use plastic in the UK and find an alternative to it that doesn\u2019t damage our planet.",
