        "additional_details": "With the ever increasing impact of climate change, it is becoming more important than ever to avoid man-made disasters. Once the floodplain is developed, there is no turning back.\"\r\n The 2007 Pitt report said \"wherever possible, new development should not take place in flood risk areas and that there should be a strong presumption against building on the floodplain.\u201d This is currently not always adhered to where non flood plain options could be made available hence the requirement for legislation",
        "background": "We ask the government to act responsibly regarding safety to new and existing communities and show more environmental foresight. We ask for legislation to be passed that forbids strategic development  allocations from being situated within all flood zones or areas that impact upon them.",
