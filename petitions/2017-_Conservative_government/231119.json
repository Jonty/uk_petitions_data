        "additional_details": "Banks avoid reimbursing the value of stolen funds, or compensating victims of bank fraud, not least because the Police, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) are under-resourced and unable to cope with a growing epidemic of digital crime.\r\n\r\nGovernment should:\r\n\r\n- ask the FCA to conduct an investigation into this issue;\r\n- amend the law to allow the FCA or FOS to issue fines in individual cases; and\r\n- better resource the Ombudsman to conduct further investigations.",
        "background": "Banks are currently allowed to deny card fraud claims without providing evidence for their decision to customers.\r\n\r\nThey are not protecting our money and personal data from card fraud. At a time when large companies suffer mass data breaches this is not acceptable behaviour and should be penalised.",
