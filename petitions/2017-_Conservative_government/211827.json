        "action": "Allow 16 year olds to ride motorcycles with a higher engine size than 50cc.",
        "additional_details": "At the moment the law states that 16 year olds cannot ride any motorcycle with an engine size higher than 50cc, this can be very dangerous as many roads now have speed limits way higher than this not allowing you to keep up with traffic or get out of a situation very quickly, therefore increasing the accidents including motorcycles and young riders. 125cc is a more sensible speed which is more reliable for young riders out on the roads at 16. To make sure it is safe for a young driver an additional test could be added allowing you to progress up rather than just a CBT, this time including a small theory",
        "background": "16 years old are in danger of being taken off their bikes due to them being restricted and other volumes of traffic going at a much higher rate of speed past them, therefore increasing the accidents including young riders. 125cc would possibly be a better replacement as safer in the long term.",
