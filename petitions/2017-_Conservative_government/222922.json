        "additional_details": "I work from home every day and my office faces the main road of Cross Lanes.\r\nEvery hour of every day cars speed down Cross Lanes at all hours of the day and night. It is not safe for humans or pets! Something needs to be done to slow this road down as it\u2019s a very popular road for dog walkers and children going too and from school. Horse riders pass at least once a day and there is a constant flow of traffic. It\u2019s only a matter of time until a human is hurt or a nasty accident on a small road.",
        "background": "Our kitten was killed by a car going too fast on Cross Lanes. Ours is not the only one killed. There have been many near misses of car accidents due to fast cars. People walk their dogs, take children too and from school, ride horses etc. It\u2019s way too dangerous.",
