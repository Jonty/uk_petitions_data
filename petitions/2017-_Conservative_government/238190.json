I watch many members of my group experience all sorts of anxieties before, during and after their PIP assessments. \r\nI have developed the following solutions in consultation with the charity Rethink Mental Illness.\r\nTime and time again, my group members and thousands of others, wait for long periods before receiving their results, often to be told they have been awarded nil points.",
