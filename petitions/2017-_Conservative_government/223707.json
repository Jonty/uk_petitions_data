        "background": "More and more companies force / require employees to use their own funds and/or credit cards to fund company expenditure and to then claim back this expenditure after the fact.\r\n\r\nThe company's liability is then carried by the employee. \r\n\r\nThe employee is responsible to the credit card company.",
