        "action": "Ban the use of single use plastic inside of cereal boxes",
        "additional_details": "By stopping the use of plastic packaging inside cereal boxes, it will save the companies money, help reduce the pollution in our oceans and environment, and lower the amount of trash individuals and families produce. Alternatively, paper bags could be recycled and remade into more bags, creating a closed loop recycling system.",
        "background": "Most cereal comes packaged in plastic. The single use plastic bags not only are disposable and have a negative impact of our environment, but are unnecessary. Paper bags or no bags at all should be enough as the box contains all the contents.",
