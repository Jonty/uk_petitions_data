        "additional_details": "Parliament through its elected MP\u2019s is there to determine the wishes of the people, and a summer break while such an important decision has yet to be ratified is costly and wholly unreasonable. To emphasise the importance the British public place on this matter and to bring home directly to MP\u2019s / Parliament where the priorities should be In times of crisis they should be made to forgo a summer recess until a conclusion is achieved.",
        "background": "It is unreasonable for the British people to be hung out over the decision to leave the EU because of MP\u2019s inability to carry out a decision made almost 3 years ago. MP\u2019s represent the wishes of the British people, MP\u2019s should not be allowed a summer recess while the public have to agonise.",
