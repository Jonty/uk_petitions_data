        "additional_details": "This benefit would have been paid till the children were 18, however because I have tried to rebuild my life the benefit stops.  I now have to rely on my new partner to support my children.  My view is why are bereaved parents penalised for moving on in their life, yet had my husband not have died he would be paying me child maintenance roughly the same period of time.  It is not fair that any bereaved parent should be penalised.",
        "background": "I lost my husband some years ago, I have two children with my late husband who are both under the age of 16.  I was receiving bereavement benefit which went towards the support of my children, very much like child maintenance.  I then lost this benefit when I started a new relationship.",
