        "additional_details": "About two-thirds of sex workers have suffered violence. Most sex workers are mothers supporting families, prevented from leaving prostitution by poverty. \r\n \r\nThe Home Affairs Committee recommended that sex workers be decriminalised. Amnesty International called on governments to decriminalise sex work and address poverty by providing a social safety net. New Zealand successfully decriminalised in 2003, improving sex workers\u2019 safety, health and welfare.\r\n \r\nWe call on the UK government to promote safety by implementing the Home Affairs Committee recommendation to introduce legislation to decriminalise sex workers working on the street and together in premises. \r\n \r\nCommissioned by the English Collective of Prostitutes. \r\n \r\nVisit makeallwomensafe.com",
        "background": "Even though their job is legal, prostitution laws prevent women from working together. Sex workers often have to choose between keeping safe and possible arrest, or avoiding a criminal record and putting themselves in danger. No woman should be put in danger by the law.",
