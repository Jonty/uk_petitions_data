        "action": "Only permit (dependent) university students the right to vote in their home area",
        "additional_details": "This is not driven by anti student sentiment but more through a sense of democracy. For example, if there was a General Election in their first week at uni, the student could choose to vote in the uni town without any knowledge of local issues/the local MP. They will probably spend 27mths over the next 3 yrs in the uni town and yet a parliamentary term is 60 mths, so their vote affects the area long after they have left! The student can also vote in local elections, on local issues from Day 1",
        "background": "Currently university students can either vote in their uni or home town and many choose to vote in the uni town. The huge density of students in certain areas now mean that students control the vote and their issues can dominate the political agenda and effectively disenfranchise the local community",
