        "action": "GMC should recognise Indian PG degrees- MD and DNB",
        "additional_details": "At the moment, despite India churning out the highest number of doctors annually, no Indian PG degree is recognised by the GMC, which is surprising, considering the high quality of education that exists in India and the gruelling syllabus and workload. With the rise in the number of Indian doctors interested in working in the UK, coupled with the shortage of doctors the NHS faces, it could be a win-win scenario for both parties if the GMC recognises MD and DNB as valid post graduate degrees.",
        "background": "Indian medical post graduate degrees exist in various forms: Diploma, CPS, MD, and DNB. The former two degrees last for 2 years, while the latter two last for 3 years. Whereas MD is offered by the university, DNB is offered by the central government (ministry of health and family welfare).",
