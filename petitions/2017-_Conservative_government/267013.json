        "additional_details": "Due to the iron overload it is important the intake of iron is minimal especially if venesection treatment has not yet happened to avoid the body absorbing more iron which can lead to organ failure and cancer. Whilst the body still needs iron to function it's important to understand what foods are high and low in iron to manage it. At a glance I am unable to find foods high and low in iron currently at the supermarkets. Iron is hardly mentioned when it comes to Food Nutrition.",
        "background": "Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition in which iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years. This build-up of iron, known as iron overload, can cause unpleasant symptoms. If it isn't treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart.",
