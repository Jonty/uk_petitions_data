        "additional_details": "most manufacturers use the term \u201cmay contain nuts\u201d for example brands such as Cadbury, Kellogg\u2019s, Peters pies the list goes on. The labelling has been seen on yoghurt, cereals, baked goods and even bread. People with a certain nut allergy should be able to look at the packaging and see what nuts could be present so that they\u2019re not excluded from all nuts that they are able to consume",
        "background": "So many packaging contains the phrase \u201cmay contain nuts\u201d. This needs to be more specific as someone with a peanut allergy may not have an allergy to any other nuts but won\u2019t buy the product because it\u2019s not specific enough even though this particular nut may not be present.",
