        "additional_details": "Personally because of how much my parents earn, I will only be receiving roughly \u00a34,500 a year when I move out, the rest is essentially expected to be paid by my parents. I want to be self sufficient and so do my parents, my parents will not able to afford paying for me as well as themselves. How is it justified that I and others will be given a smaller loan just under the assumption that mine and others parents can afford to cover their children's finances and their own? How can a part time job and a loan this small cover our living costs independently? You can change this and make it fairer.",
        "background": "The maintenance loan is meant to cover expenses such as food, bills, rent, household goods and educational supplies, this however is very hard to cover if you are from a family earning over \u00a340,000. You can be receiving roughly 4,500 a year to live on, this is not enough to run a basic flat with.",
