        "additional_details": "The current situation is very well evidenced and documented by leading professionals, charities, the media and campaigns, including Sir David Attenborough.  Parliament debated a ban on non-recyclable plastics in January 2017 but little action has arisen. \r\nEvery coastline in the UK and the World is affected.\r\nThere is a better way. The time is now.\r\nBan Single-Use Plastic in the UK by 2020.",
        "background": "12 million tonnes of plastic enters the oceans each year, and residues are routinely found in fish, sea birds and marine mammals. \r\nBy 2050 there will be more plastic pollution in the sea than fish.\r\nLess than 1% of single-use plastics are actually recycled.",
