        "additional_details": "We need safer bike lanes and increased accessibility, I rarely see bike lanes and think safer ones would make more people encouraged to cycle to school or work. Increased funding to public transport to make it more enjoyable for the public would help decrease the emissions from millions of people commuting to school and work everyday.",

Motor vehicles are on of the largest pollutants, and contributes greatly to global warming and climate change. With the recently declared climate emergency, it\u2019s time we take action.",
