        "additional_details": "Vegans have similar legal protections as people with religious beliefs. \r\n\r\nSadly, provision for vegans in the public sector is lacking, with hospital patients and school children often going hungry.\r\n \r\nPlant-based food can be enjoyed by all. The British Dietetic Association says that well-planned totally plant-based diets are suitable for every age and life stage. \r\nThe UN has urged a move towards a meat and dairy free diet for the benefit of our planet, and the UK has the opportunity to lead the way.",
        "background": "More people are deciding to live vegan, with the number in the UK doubling twice in 4 years. Plant-based options on every daily menu in government and public services would protect the rights of vegans and recognise the benefits of plant-based food for our health, the environment and animals.",
