        "action": "Introduce compulsory integration & language courses for asylum-seekers.",
        "additional_details": "In 2016, German adopted a new law which language and integration courses are compulsory and asylum-seekers who do not attend will lose access to government benefits which they need to stay in the country. From this, most have integrated into German society and can now speak German fluently. This is also done in Norway and several other countries. Why not have it in the UK, where integration for new asylum seekers is a big problem?",
        "background": "Integration is a big issue due to most asylum seekers entering do not speak English & there are cultural differences between the middle east & the UK. \r\nLessons would mean asylum seekers would have more chance of getting employment meaning benefits claimed would decrease.",
