        "action": "Get paid for clean electricity exported to the grid",
        "additional_details": "Two forms of payment to small-scale systems will be removed:\r\n\r\n1. Feed in Tariff (on all electricity generated)\r\n2. Export Tariff (on electricity sold back to the grid)\r\n\r\nThe first is a subsidy, but the second simply reflects a fair wholesale value for electricity sold to the grid.\r\n\r\nResidential battery storage is not an economically or environmentally efficient solution. It is better to use and store solar generation at a community scale. This requires a fair price for exported clean energy.",
        "background": "Government plans to end payments for clean electricity exported from new small-scale systems from March 2019.\r\n\r\nThey propose that people give free electricity to their energy suppliers. This is unfair and will cause a huge drop in the number of installations, placing the UK solar industry at risk.",
