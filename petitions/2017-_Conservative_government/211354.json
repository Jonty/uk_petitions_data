Here are extracts.\r\n \r\n.....concern had grown over recent years about the failure of [the coroner] ... to give due regard to the deeply held religious beliefs of Jewish and indeed Muslim families ...\r\n \r\n... Where the fastest possible burial is denied ...it can cause a great deal of pain at a time when they are already grieving.\r\n \r\n...there are no other coroners .. who have taken such a stance.\r\n",
        "background": "A vice president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews has said that a North London Coroner shows \u201cno inclination\u201d to address Jewish concerns. Under Jewish & Islamic law, bodies must be buried quickly and invasive postmortems are a desecration. The Board wants this coroner dismissed.",
