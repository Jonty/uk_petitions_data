        "additional_details": "The National Speed Limit of 70mph on motorways was first introduced on a trial basis in 1965 and became permanent in 1967. The current 70mph limit has now been in place for over 50 years.",
        "background": "During the night the motorway network is used less. Vehicles are now much better equipped with safety features to travel faster. Increasing the speed limit at night will encourage more travelling at this time and less congestion during the day. It would promote quicker and safer travelling at night.",
