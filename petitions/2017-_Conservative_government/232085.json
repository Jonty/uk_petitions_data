        "additional_details": "A local Facebook group was set up to gently take the mickey, but it has a very valid point. At certain times of the day, the retail park & Tesco are no-go areas due to the length of time it takes to get in or out. You end up with angry and frustrated drivers, aggressive driving and accidents waiting to happen. \r\n\r\nA 2nd entrance/exit onto the Southam Road would, I feel, go a long way to dramatically reduce this. Allowing everyone to use the facilities as they'd expect, without hassle",
        "background": "As we get closer to the festive season, more and more people are finding they are getting stuck in the car park for Tesco in Banbury - some even abandoning cars to collect children from school. Put in a 2nd entrance/exit to alleviate some of this stress",
