        "additional_details": "If we do not address climate change NOW, there will be no rest of the world to trade with. Vast areas will become uninhabitable - areas Brexiteers claim we can negotiate beneficial trade deals with. People will be forced from their homelands. They have a right to live on this planet, and they will come. Government must act now to enforce policies which will reverse climate trends, reduce emissions and rain forest destruction, promote LOCAL trading, and preserve peoples' lands and livelihoods.",
        "background": "Government has spent nearly 3 years negotiating BREXIT. If it goes ahead it will spend even more years, maybe decades negotiating trades we already have via the EU. \r\nBREXIT is NOT important. Call for the government to concentrate it's political efforts on home affairs and reversing climate change.",
