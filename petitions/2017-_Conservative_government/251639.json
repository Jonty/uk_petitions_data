Although they were fined \u00a370,000 that is a small price to pay for 5 years in power.\r\nDuring the 2016 EU Referendum Vote Leave exceeded the maximum spending by \u00a3500,000 but were fined just \u00a320,000. As well as breaking spending laws they were fined by the ICO for sending nearly 200,000 spam texts.",

This ensures a level playing field.\r\nIf an organisation breaks these laws they will have an unfair advantage.\r\n\r\nOur democracy will die if results won by criminals, liars and cheats are allowed to stand.",
