        "additional_details": "Apprentices, students & the young in work for the most, have to be up early for Uni/Work etc. and are notoriously hard up, at the start of there careers/working bottom end jobs. However while commuting to work as an apprentice, seeing a senior citizen go from there new range rover to the train, then be receiving a vastly discounted fare for the same journey does not seem fair. There are 2 sides as there are less well off elderly, and youth with money, however why give to one and not the other?",
        "background": "The 16-25 Railcard is the same cost and appears to be the same as the Senior Railcard (for over 60's). However, the 16-25 card has a list of restrictions that do not apply to the senior card, including a minimum fare and time restrictions. Why are there not the same allowances?",
