        "additional_details": "Keeping the cash value of benefits the same while costs are rising is pushing people into poverty. The freeze on working age benefits will affect around 750,000 households by the end of the decade.\r\nReversing the freeze could help lift people out of poverty and prevent others from falling into poverty. Research from CPAG shows that reversing the freeze to even just the child element of tax credits and child benefit could keep up to 400,000 children across the UK from falling into poverty.",
        "background": "The freeze of working age benefits will take almost \u00a31 billion from the pockets of people living in Scotland by 2020/21. People across Scotland are affected by the freeze and by ending it we will improve both our society and the economy by putting money in people\u2019s pockets.",
