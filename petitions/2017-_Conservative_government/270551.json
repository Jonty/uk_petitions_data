        "action": "Invest appropriate funding into County Durham Primary and Secondary Schools",
        "additional_details": "The impact on all schools is huge. In County Durham if funding had kept up with inflation primary schools would have received around \u00a3120k more and secondary schools \u00a3600k more. There is growing evidence that financial pressure on school budgets is making teaching harder and improving standards more difficult.\r\nSchools are asked to do more with less resource. Some schools have reached crisis point. Our children deserve better.",
        "background": "Funding going directly into all schools has not kept up with inflation. Schools are faced with additional cuts to essential staff.\r\nSpecial Educational Needs provision is not being funded properly, putting added pressure on schools and students.\r\n\r\nAdequate levels of funding must be reinstated.",
