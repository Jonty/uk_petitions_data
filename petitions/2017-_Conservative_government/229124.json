        "action": "Prevent the downgrade of services to County Hospital, Louth in Lincolnshire.",
        "additional_details": "Louth Hospital patients will now have to access health care from other health authorities over long distances, using more ambulances for longer periods. Saving money from the downgrade of Louth Hospital will increase the costs on other peoples health services and the Ambulance Service. We ask the Health Secretary to find out how much extra money it will cost neighbouring health providers, and if they have budgeted for this increase in patients who would have previously attended Louth Hospital?",
        "background": "Lincolnshire East CCG is proposing to cut beds at Louth Hospital from 50 to either 20 or 16 beds. Other services have also been withdrawn in recent years.\r\nWe ask the Secretary of State for Health to increase funding for Louth Hospital to maintain the services in East Lindsey.",
