        "additional_details": "If you are not in a pre approved group that qualify for a blue badge you MUST meet the walking criteria to be considered.  Many people have permanent disabilities (12 months plus as per DDA) but can walk - therefore they are refused.\r\nWider disabled spaces are  a lifeline getting in and out of vehicles without pain for some people.\r\nI suggest an application based scheme that allows you to park in a disabled bay only - this then includes not excludes people with non walking disabilities.",
        "background": "I have a permanent disability dont meet the walking element of the criteria for a blue badge scheme but need help and extra space when parking...just like families with children.  Narrow spaces for some people can be a physical nightmare trying to do such a basic thing as getting in and out of a car",
