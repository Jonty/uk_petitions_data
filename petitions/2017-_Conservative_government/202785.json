        "additional_details": "The licence fee stems back to the beginning of the 20th Century when the BBC were one of two broadcasters.  This made it easy at the time to produce the TV licence fee.  Times however have changed, and the BBC should move to an encrypted subscription system where you have the CHOICE to pay to watch the BBC.  The BBC from what I can see could potentially support itself through various sales and its worldwide ventures.",
        "background": "The current TV licence fee is very outdated.  The TV licence fee is also misleading in the fact that you do not need a licence (in any other sector, such as radio) to RECEIVE only.  You would however need a licence to broadcast.  We should have the choice to pay to watch the BBC like other providers",
