        "action": "Make it an offence to burn plastic and other harmful waste in populated areas",
        "additional_details": "When plastics are burned, harmful quantities of dioxins are emitted. Dioxins are a persistent and carcinogenic hormone disruptor which accumulate in our body-fat. Dioxins also settle on crops and waterways where they eventually wind up in our food, accumulate in our bodies and are passed on to our children. Surveys show that home burning of waste is widespread across rural areas. Air emissions from home burning are released directly into the atmosphere without being treated or filtered.",
        "background": "We believe that citizens should be able to anonymously alert Environmental Health or the police of any illegal bonfire when discovered. This would include the burning of plastics, painted wood, MDF and other highly toxic substances from being burned in a low temperature outdoor fire.",
