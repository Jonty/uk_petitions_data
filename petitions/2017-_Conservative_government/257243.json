        "additional_details": "As most people who drive, know. Many cyclists refuse to use the cycle lanes that local authorities have provided for their safety, yet for some reason, nothing has been done to combat this, this together with no law needing Cyclists to have even a third party insurance, is a complete lack of foresight. It is time this is put right, and Cyclists were forced to use the lanes that local governments are spending many thousands of pounds to provide.",
        "background": "British Roads are now so busy, especially during rush hours, that it is unreasonable for Cyclists to use many roads, and as there are usually Cycle lanes available now, it is now time to enforce use of these lanes for safety of the cyclists, and avoid road closures after an accident.",
