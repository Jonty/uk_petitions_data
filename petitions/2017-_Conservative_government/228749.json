        "additional_details": "Victims of this heinous crime have to wait due to the lack of facilities to help them because of the NHS budget cut that makes it harder to treat them. Victims have to wait for longer periods of time that could take up to months or even years to book for their own appointments which should not be happening.",
        "background": "Acid Attack victims face not only physical pain but also mental trauma that should be urgently helped. This can happen if the NHS budget increases so that there are more facilities available for this kind of treatment as the budget cuts to the NHS could hinder these emergencies.",
