        "additional_details": "If fake profiles were made illegal there would be more discouragement to make one in the first place as the repercussions would be higher. I have personally been stalked, harassed, body shamed, and received vulgar bullying messages from one individual posing as multiple. There are enough public circumstances that have lead to physical attacks, assaults and self harm. Positive action needs to be made to prevent fake profiles as this should be considered criminal fraudulent activity. Thank You",
        "background": "Fake profiles are used on Facebook, Instagram, dating websites and more. These profiles are currently used to abuse, stalk, harass, shame or harm real people emotionally and in some cases physically. People use these fake identities to disguise their own so they can get away with harmful behaviour.",
