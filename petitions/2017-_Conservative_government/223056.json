        "additional_details": "Small dogs are generally more agressive than any large breed, Chihuahuas are recorded with most bites but they dont do as much damage as a large breed and this is deemed to be acceptable which it is not.\r\n\r\nPitbulls are caring, loving, faithful family dogs where in America they are effectionally known as the \"nanny dog\"\r\n\r\nPitbulls in the uk are a very misunderstood breed and have been stigmatized because of small minded individuals that used these dogs in the wrong setting i.e fighting",
        "background": "The so called dangerous dogs act was created in haste and without much research on the dogs themselves.\r\n\r\nI feel any respectful owner would happily pay a 1 off fee to keep a family dog(s) and hopefully keep them from falling into the wrong hands, please sign this petition to legalise these breeds",
