The savings claimed include Maggie Thatcher\u2019s rebate, not paid for 35 years, subsidies destined for UK Farmers etc which we continue to pay and our share of the costs of Trade Negotiation now replaced in the UK by a New Ministry. Other savings claimed from the \u201cGross Contribution Calculation\u201d give the same result, the promised Brexit savings do not exist. With costs of Brexit administration and borrowing cost on the increased National Debt, nothing is left for the NHS. Brexit costs since the Referendum are put at \u00a3700 million per week by the Bank of England.",
        "background": "The Government claims Brexit to be the will of the people. Remainers deride this claiming the 2% swing margin for Leave was won by \u201clies and wild promises\u201d. With another Referendum in sight, claims made at the 2016 Referendum should be examined to prevent this happening again.",
