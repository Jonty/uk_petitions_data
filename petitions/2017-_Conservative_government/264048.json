        "additional_details": "Post acute withdrawal can be caused by long term use of many drugs. The effects can be long and debilitating. Are we creating another problem for long term users of Cbd products? Another problem is Most Cbd products are not verified to be genuine and free from contamination and are not tested by a central reliable source so how do we know that the results are genuine? Government should ban CBD oil and review safety.",
        "background": "Some people say Cannabis isn't addictive but what if your body comes to rely on it? What are the long term effects on CBD oil use? Is it addictive after many years of use? Are there withdrawal symptoms?",
