        "action": "Introduce a minimum rate of tax on tax avoidance schemes to help fund the NHS",
        "additional_details": "Currently, tax avoiders can legally reduce the tax liability on their income to next to nothing without any restriction or recourse!\r\n\r\nAny individual/company based in the UK that uses a known avoidance scheme or has connected parties/subsidiaries whose effective tax rate is less than 15% should pay the new minimum tax rate. \r\nThe New 15% Minimum Tax Rate will apply to UK income and to all income recorded in low tax jurisdictions whether or not it is remitted back to UK.\r\n",
        "background": "The introduction of a minimum income/corporate tax rate for individuals/companies would immediately raise tens of billions in additional tax receipts each year to help fund the NHS without the need to raise existing tax rates for the middle-classes, cut funding for benefits or borrow more money.",
