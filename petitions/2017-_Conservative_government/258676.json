        "additional_details": "Global warming of 1.5 degrees could happen by 2030 if no action is taken (IPCC). Sea levels will rise to fatal levels around the world impacting the poorest, most vulnerable people first. Much of the general public don\u2019t understand the urgency of this, action is needed now so people need to understand the gravity of the situation. By signing this petition you agree that advertising on TV & billboards should educate and spread awareness of the urgency of climate change, and inspire people to act.",
        "background": "While studying climate change at university, I have seen terrifying statistics about the urgency of climate change. The general public aren\u2019t educated on the real impacts of climate change and are kept in the dark. Advertising on TV & billboards could help educate people on the gravity of the issue.",
