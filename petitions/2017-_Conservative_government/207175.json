        "additional_details": "There is no financial help for people with a mortgage, even if they cant afford to pay the mortgage, have no job and no income. Temporary help would give people that safety net they need to have the courage to leave an abusive relationship without having to worry about becoming homeless. The housing register rejects applicants based on a tick box saying yes i have a mortgaged property - it takes months to sell a house and everyone deserves to have a safe home to live in.",
        "background": "Give them the freedom to escape their situation without having to worry about the financial repercussions. Even if they own their own homes there should be support since often they would have been financially dependent on their abuser.\r\nFreedom to escape without facing potential homelessness",
