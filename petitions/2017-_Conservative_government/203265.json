        "additional_details": "A trip to Roman ruins in Paphos, the soon to be lost islands of the Maldives or Red Square in Moscow would be far more educational than a trip to Disneyland. However requests by parents to take children on holiday during the last week of the summer term are routinely denied yet schools offer our children non-educational elitist \"trips\".\r\n\r\nThe law needs to be changed to allow essential family time for holidays outside of the defined school holiday period. An open debate for a solution is needed.",
        "background": "The law currently stands that students are not to be taken out of school during term time.  Why is it allowable for schools themselves to do this during the last week of the summer term for trips to Disneyland but not for parents? This is a double-standard.",
