        "additional_details": "I am proposing the penalties be increased to a minimum fine of \u00a35000 with no upper limit when found to be companies caught carrying out this practice ref: Her Majesty's Advocate v Doonin Plant 2012, Company Directors to be banned and vehicles used by perpetrators to be confiscated and crushed.\r\nThis practice must be stamped out as our countryside needs proper protection and Local Authorities should be empowered and assisted to make the perpetrators think again.",
        "background": "Fly tipping is getting out of control. I live in a semi rural area and the amount of fly tipping that is going on here and in the rest of the United Kingdom is quite astonishing. It ranges from building rubble to bottles, cans, any kind of rubbish you care to name to even asbestos being fly tipped.",
