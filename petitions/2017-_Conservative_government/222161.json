        "additional_details": "It can just take a split second for an accident to occur and unlike a car it can take a bash, being on a bike it's just skin and bone which can take severe or even fatal injuries. I always wear a helmet and on this instance it saved me from having a fractured skull. \r\nSo please please think: WEAR A HELMET WITH PRIDE- IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE OR YOUR CHILD.\r\nBE A GOOD ROLE MODEL FOR EVERYONE. \r\nYou only have one life! BE SAFE!\r\nHelp me by signing my petition to change the law. Thank you.",
        "background": "Just recently I had a bicycle accident where the local news covered my story in which my helmet saved me from severe head trauma yet still sustained a battered face etc. Many don't wear a helmet on bicycles. WHY? Do some of you,  not think to protect yourself or child just because you on a bike.",
