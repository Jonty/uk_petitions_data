        "additional_details": "We have been told we have arrears we dont owe and proved we don't owe. We have been threatened with deduction of earnings despite us providing the required documents we were told they never had them despite the very documents being in our file after we order a subject for info request.\r\nI believe if the resident parent has income including ALL benefits with a threshold of 25k per year then CMS should be capped. I am sick of seeing parents get ill whilst others are able to kick out lots of kids in the hope the world owes them a living often with no cms being spent on the child.",
        "background": "I personally have battled csa and cms for 9 years. They have made countless mistakes along the way and continuous mistakes on my husbands case too. Its evident the issue is nationwide with bullying tactics, no regard for 2nd families, rude staff, appauling communication and a one sided system.",
