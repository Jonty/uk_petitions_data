        "action": "Transfer the power to revoke citizenship from the Executive to the Judiciary",
        "additional_details": "We the undersigned believe the power to revoke citizenship must reside with the High Court, must only be used in the most extreme circumstances, and must only be accessible by a Home Secretary who provides credible evidence to the court in a way which can be challenged by the defendant's brief. \r\n \r\nThe right to Citizenship is too important a thing to be left to the games of politicians.",
        "background": "Recent cases have highlighted an obvious problem: that a Home Secretary, elected by only his constituency, and appointed by a Prime Minister elected only by her own constituency, can summarily revoke a British citizen's citizenship.",
