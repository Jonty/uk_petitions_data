        "additional_details": "With inflation, including housing, running at 3.9 percent this would in reality be a modest 1.1 percent rise in real terms and so a small step towards undoing the much greater cuts school staff have suffered in the last few years.\r\n\r\nWe also want the government to change its funding plans which at present will mean almost 9 in 10 schools seeing significant cuts which will damage education. Schools should be properly funded, including the cost of a modest rise in school staff pay, so that our children get the education they deserve.\r\n\r\nWe call on the government to address the linked issues of school funding and school staff pay in its budget plans this autumn.\r\n\r\n#Worth5percent",
        "background": "We think that after years of below inflation pay awards which have cut their living standards, staff in all our schools deserve a 5 percent pay rise.",
