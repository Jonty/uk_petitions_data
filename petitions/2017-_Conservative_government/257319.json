        "additional_details": "If Assange is extradited to the United States there is a high risk that he will not face a fair trial. The US state wants to punish him for exposing crimes that they were complicit in. It should not be illegal to tell the truth. We should support those who protect the public's right to transparency as Julian Assange did. To allow Assange's voice to be silenced by the US state would not only be a travesty for the man but also for the entire journalistic profession. We must oppose his extradition.",
        "background": "We must protect Julian Assange. He is being charged for a 2010 leak which exposed US war crimes, including murder of journalists. Rather than be persecuted he should be applauded; his leaks were a noble act. The US wants to scare and subdue the journalistic establishment - we cannot facilitate this.",
