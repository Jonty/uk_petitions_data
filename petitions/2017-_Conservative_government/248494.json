        "additional_details": "We will be in a much stronger position to negotiate trade deals if we leave without the restriction of the deal the PM is trying to agree. The EU are making it difficult for us to leave because they don't want us to. They will need to negotiate new trade deals with us. The PM's deal puts us in a worse position than we currently are, and continues to tie us to the EU. Taking 'No Deal' off the table is simply sabotaging our position to negotiate our own future deals. This is NOT what we voted for.",
        "background": "The UK voted to Leave the EU. This wasn't dependent on a \"deal\", but rather just to \"Leave\". In the 2016 referendum we did not vote to exchange the current EU deal for another one. We demand that MP's honour the democratic vote and LEAVE without a deal that binds us to the EU, its laws, and rules.",
