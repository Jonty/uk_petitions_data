        "action": "Increase sentences and enforcement for vandalism within children\u2019s play areas.",
        "additional_details": "Even though there are laws in place to punish litterers, people drinking alcohol, people who cause criminal damage, graffiti and public order offences to name a few, none of these powers seem to prevent the regular damage to our parks. Cameras don\u2019t seem to catch people either. It\u2019s seems to many that these crimes are too minor to warrant higher penalties and I and many others believe harsher punishments and better funding for enforcement is needed to deter this behaviour and protect our children.",
        "background": "Parks and grounds are regularly used to loiter, drink, and cause vandalism nationwide. Our community recently raised an enormous sum to refurbish and improve our local park. Yet each weekend broken bottles and damage is left for the public to clean, putting our children at risk.",
