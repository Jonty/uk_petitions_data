        "additional_details": "With the second \"unelected\" conservative Prime Minister coming into power, it's important that UK citizens get a say on who is running decision making and negotiations on something as important and life changing as Brexit. \r\nThis is particularly important in regards to Boris Johnson, who is actually under investigation for \"lying and misleading\" in the initial Brexit campaign. Surely, we need a say on if this is the right person to be leading the Brexit Process.",
        "background": "For the second time in a row we will have an unelected Prime Minister in charge of one of the most important changes to the UK in centuries. \r\nA General Election should be held so the voters get to have a say on the person who will be in charge of this very important Brexit process.",
