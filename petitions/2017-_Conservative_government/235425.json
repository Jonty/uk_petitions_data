            "details": "The invasive alien species of grey squirrel has almost eradicated the native red squirrel. The Government is determined to protect the highly threatened red squirrel, with the control of grey squirrel being part of this strategy. Actions relating to grey squirrels will not be made exempt from the provisions of the planned Invasive Alien Species (Enforcement and Permitting) Order 2019. We must ensure that the way we manage non-native species, such as the grey squirrel, is consistent with the EU Invasive Alien Species Regulation 2014, to support our own government strategy to reduce the impact of such species on highly threatened species, like the red squirrel. The EU Regulation does not allow for a general exemption for grey squirrels.\r\n  \r\nLegally, there is no need to end the life of any grey squirrel that has been taken to a rescue centre. In fact, in some circumstances, grey squirrels taken to rescue centres may be kept until the end of their natural lives. Non-commercial owners (such as people keeping animals as pets) may continue to keep grey squirrels in captivity as companion animals, as long as they were kept as a companion animal prior to the species\u2019 inclusion on list of species of Union concern (3 August 2016 for grey squirrel). \r\n\r\n In addition, there is a requirement, under Article 19 of the EU Regulation, to establish management measures for widespread species, aimed at their \u201ceradication, population control or containment\u201d. It is possible for some, otherwise prohibited, activities to be allowed as part of a species\u2019 management measures, provided there is strict justification and provided that all appropriate controls are in place.\r\nThe Order puts in place a licensing regime to implement management measures. Grey squirrels, such as those taken to rescue centres may be able to be kept under a management measure licence until the end of their natural lives. In situations where animals are being kept, either as a companion animal or under licence, they must be kept in secure containment and prevented from breeding or escaping. \r\n\r\nRelease into the environment of grey squirrels is not permitted, except as part of a specific activity aimed at supporting the control of the species, such as part of field trials for population control activity.\r\n\r\nWe will be providing further advice. This will give guidance on situations which may be covered by a defence, permit or licence and the route for applying for permits and licences under the Order. \r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs\r\n\r\nThis is a revised response.
