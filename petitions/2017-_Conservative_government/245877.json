        "additional_details": "Analysis published in the journal Biological Conservation, says intensive agriculture is the main driver of the declines, particularly the heavy use of pesticides and insecticides. \r\n\r\nWe must ban the manufacture, sale and use of all insecticies and pesticides in the UK to ensure that ecosystems can recover. Insects are vital to UK agriculture and food production and without them food systems will collapse.",
        "background": "More than 40% of insect species are declining and a third are endangered. The total mass of insects is falling by a 2.5% a year globally, suggesting they could vanish within 100yrs. They are essential for ecosystems, as food for other creatures, pollinators and recyclers of nutrients.",
