        "additional_details": "Thousands die from alcohol-related diseases every year. The cost and burden on the NHS is vast. It is the second biggest preventable killer behind smoking. The negative impact of alcohol is worse than smoking because it takes away a persons dignity, self esteem and ruins the lives of family and loved ones. Banning advertising of cigarettes has reduced smoking-related illness. Alcohol should be no different. For example, Tesco should not be having a 'Drinks Festival' a campaign encouraging people to drink.",
        "background": "Shops must be more responsible by not displaying alcoholic beverages at the front of the shop where people are forced to pass by it. They should limit the use of promotional marketing so as not to encourage people to purchase alcohol, particularly vulnerable & disadvantaged people in society.",
