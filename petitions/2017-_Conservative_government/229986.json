        "additional_details": "The lack of grit bins is going to cause accidents and pose a dangers to pedestrians as well as causing issues for those who work to get out and about. It\u2019s all very well the council keeping main roads clear, people have to be able to get out of their estates to be able to use these roads.",
        "background": "Fife Council have decided to take away all grit bins from residential areas. This has been explained by stating they will have grit lorries put in these areas, this is not correct as these are residential streets that have never seen a gritter when the snow is lying on the ground.",
