        "action": "Lower the voting age for all elections and referendums to 16 years of age.",
        "additional_details": "Recent polls have shown that only 8% of 16-24 year olds describe themselves as politically engaged. If the voting age were lowered, it would allow schools to encourage political participation, instilling a positive atmosphere of political engagement.\r\n \r\nFurthermore, in the 2016 EU referendum over 70% of voters aged 18-24 supported remain, while only 31% of voters aged 65 or over supported remain. This shows how unrepresented the younger generation are on matters directly relevant to their future.",
        "background": "With the currently turbulent and unpredictable political climate in which decisions affecting future generations are being decided without their voices being heard, it vital to our future democracy that young adults are given the opportunity to present their opinions in the future.",
