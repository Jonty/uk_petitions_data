        "action": "Utility companies to be responsible for repairing potholes around poor repairs",
        "additional_details": "Potholes are caused when water penetrates cracks in the road. When this water freezes, it expands, widening the cracks. When it melts, traffic smashes new craters into the road surface.  Other countries do not have many drains and services under their roads, and do not give privatised utility companies the right to dig up a new road\r\nAn increasing number of road users are taking legal action. The AA estimates that the cost to insurers of claims (pothole damage) was \u00a32.85m during February alone.",
        "background": "A majority of potholes form around places of existing weakness, such as road repair works following companies digging up the roads for routine maintenance.  These companies should be responsible for filling any potholes that are a consequence of a road weakness following their actions",
