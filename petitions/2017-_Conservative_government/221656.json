Staff who are working in the UK already- and have done for many years- and those wanting to come to work in the UK are being rejected due to the point system via the home office. This leaves ALL cardiology departments across struggling to provide a safe heart service across the UK. Placing Cardiac Physiologists back on the list will fix this issue immediately. We were removed in 2013, hence the staffing issue.",
