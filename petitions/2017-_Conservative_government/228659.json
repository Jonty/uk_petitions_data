        "additional_details": "RBS is 62.4% owned by the tax payer and made \u00a32.239 billion in profit last year.  Pays its Chief Executive \u00a33.5 Million a year and were more than happy to have us, the tax paying public, bail them out to the tune of \u00a345 billion.  If this bank closes local business will have no bank to pay money in or get change from.  This will leave yet another hole in our high street and this can simply not go ahead.",
        "background": "The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) are closing 54 more banks across England and wales one of which is the Droylsden branch.  This is the last bank in Droylsden and we call upon them to review this decision.",
