        "additional_details": "Is not ok. Especially if the trousers they are making the girls change into don\u2019t fit them. They have made parents buy new school skirts which are around \u00a320 each as they have to have the school logo on. And now they are going to make them buy new trousers aswell.",
        "background": "Our school has a new skirt policy and if your skirt is more than 5cm above the knee we are forced to change into trousers. And if we refuse we get put in isolation for a day. I understand the school wanting to make a change but making girls change into trousers which makes them feel uncomfortable",
