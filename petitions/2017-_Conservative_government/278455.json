        "additional_details": "In New Zealand a few years ago, they had two referendems about changing their way of voting in general elections. The first asked whether to change - yes or no; and the second referendum asked how they wanted to change.\r\n\r\nI am a staunch remainer and would love to stay in the EU but recognise that we can't ignore or undo what's been happening over the last three years. The country is divided, and we need to find ways to reconcile our differences. Otherwise, we will be arguing for generations,",
        "background": "The aim of this type of referendum, is to find a compromise between those who voted to leave and those who want to remain. By going down this route we honour the 2016 vote to leave but we also get to choose how we leave. \r\n\r\nCompromise means that both sides have to concede.",
