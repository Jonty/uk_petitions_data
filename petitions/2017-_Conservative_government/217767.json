        "action": "Legalise a new class of light electric vehicles",
        "additional_details": "As many other countries already do, the UK should embrace the existence of Personal Electric Vehicles (PEVs).\r\n\r\nThese are small electrically propelled vehicles such as scooters which reach similar speeds to a bicycle with a range of around 20 miles, and unlike bikes are practical enough to be handled like a suitcase when not in use.\r\n\r\nWith similar regards to electric bikes, legalising PEVs will offer an added green alternative for transportation and allow individuals improved freedom of movement.",
        "background": "Living in a big city, getting around is a major consideration. Public transport is overcrowded, dirty and often inconvenient. Private vehicles are unaffordable and inconvenient. As the UK invests in infrastructure for the alternative, cycling, PEVs which could utilise this continue to be outlawed.",
