        "additional_details": "There should be an order so that multiple convictions can be removed after 10 years. The major ones should stay on for life, for example, if anyone is on the sex register, someone who has been and are still in prison etc.\r\n \r\nConvictions staying on of you have more than one is crazy when it\u2019s been over 10 years.\r\n",
        "background": "If someone has more than one minor offence from over 10 years ago, they still appear on the DBS Disclosure and Barring Service. People are refused jobs as a result, even though there\u2019s nothing serious on there. This means that they unfairly continue to suffer for stupid mistakes made when young.",
