        "action": "Abolish the annual Rod Licence for anglers in England and Wales",
        "additional_details": "Income from licences is falling. Between 2010 and 2016 a drop of 12.6%. Income down from \u00a325.4m to \u00a322.2m. Dr. Broughton at the ATA has collated data over the last six years. \u2022You don't need a licence in Scotland or for sea fishing. \u2022It is unfair anglers have to buy a licence to enjoy a legal hobby when no others who make an equal claim on natural resources do \u2022Anglers spend \u00a31.2bn annually; that is \u00a3240m in VAT income alone. Abolition is likely to see participation increase",
        "background": "More than a million freshwater anglers in England and Wales (not Scotland) pay an annual fee for a (fishing) Rod Licence. This is a tax on angling. Yet there is no licence needed to walk the same river, nor to visit our National Parks, nor to climb a mountain or bicycle on our roads.",
