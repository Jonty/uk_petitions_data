        "additional_details": "By failing to take into account parental responsibility, the government is assuming that partners/spouses in a household will support a child even if they do not have parental responsibility for them. My son should receive a c\u00a37K maintenance loan based on my earnings, however, he will only receive c\u00a34K because of what my husband earns. My husband is not his father, should I invoice him for the \u00a33K difference? The government clearly assume I should. The system is flawed and damaging for families.",
        "background": "Eligibility for child benefit, child tax credits or higher maintenance loans, is based on 'household income'.No consideration is given to who in the household has parental responsibility. The income for those without parental responsibility for the named child(ren), should not be taken into account.",

For example, you could start a new petition asking the UK Parliament and Government to take into account only the income of people who have parental responsibly for a child when making decisions about benefits, maintenance loans and so on, if that's what you'd like to happen.
