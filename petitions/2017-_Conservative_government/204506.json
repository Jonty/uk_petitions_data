        "additional_details": "By allowing this change, the whole market will benefit from movement as chains are completed by those hitherto unable to make the duty plus deposit.\r\n\r\nThose downsizing and coming out of the market would have to pay more but they sit on the largest profits anyway  \r\n\r\nFirst-time buyers in the UK could save an average of \u00a33,625, while Londoners could save \u00a313,171, if the tax burden was shifted to sellers.\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39139128",
        "background": "Stamp Duty is a prohibitive tax to home ownership. \r\nFirst time buyers need help and will struggle to find the deposit as the UK is suffering a massive shortfall in homes. \r\nMost sellers have large  equity gains & removing the need for them to pay on their purchase, will allow the cost to be offset",
