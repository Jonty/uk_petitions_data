        "action": "Negotiate with the EU the possibility of direct EU citizenship for UK nationals",
        "additional_details": "Citizens of the EU benefit from many rights that UK nationals are at risk of losing as a result of Brexit. These include the right to live, travel, work, or study without hindrance in 27 other countries. European citizenship exists as a complement to citizenship of a member state. If the UK ceases to be an EU member state, these rights will be lost. Negotiate the possibility of retention of these rights for those UK nationals who still wish to be EU citizens, rather than citizens of nowhere.",
        "background": "16,141,241 voters chose to remain in the EU in 2016's referendum - nearly 4 times the size of the Republic of Ireland's population. Their rights as EU citizens are being taken away. Negotiate with the EU the possibility of these individuals' maintaining their EU citizenship should they desire it.",
