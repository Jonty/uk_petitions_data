        "additional_details": "After several appeals to review my circumstances, SFE have rejected my request for \u201cindependent status\u201d. As a home-owner, unemployment with little student loan to pay my mortgage for the year whilst studying, has resulted in withdrawal from my course. It is suggested to marry to be considered as \u201cfinancially independent\u201d to therefore receive finance based on my own income rather than my parents. It is an outdated system to consider marriage as more financially independent, than owning a home.",
        "background": "Currently, the regulations for an individual applying for Student Finance under the age of 25, must be assessed on their parental household income, unless married or care for a child. However, SFE do not view a mortgage to be an eligble factor to verify \u201cindependent status\u201d.",
