        "action": "Make the PassivHaus standard mandatory for new buildings in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Despite the obvious benefits of the standard, the construction industry often requires more stick than carrot, with full take-up of the standard only happening in places where legislation has been brought about, such as Brussels, Frankfurt and D\u00fan Laoghaire.\r\n\r\nWhile the Building Regs are based on the minimum acceptable standard the building industry will deliver buildings of low performance, with high energy wastage, poor comfort conditions and contradicting design and living practices.",
        "background": "The PassivHaus standard delivers buildings that are healthy, comfortable, and cheap to heat, with heating bills and resulting carbon emissions less than 10% of the average UK building stock. Fuel poverty and climate change can be delivered through high levels of internal comfort.",
