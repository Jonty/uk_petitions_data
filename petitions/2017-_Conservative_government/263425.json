        "additional_details": "Currently, businesses disclose male versus female pay annually and are not met with policy to ensure that these numbers are monitored or actioned - the government is relying upon corporate shame and embarrassment alone to equalise pay.\r\n\r\nThus, equal pay is not compulsory and businesses are not prioritising the issue with swift action. \r\n\r\nImposing targets (percentiles) would set this higher on business agendas, helping to resolve this issue ahead of future generations joining the workplace.",
        "background": "The Evening Standard published today that no single country is set to achieve gender equality (equal and ease of access to resources and opportunities) by 2030.\r\n\r\nEmployers should disclose genders within their workforce (I.e. male, female, transgender, pangender) against percentile targets.",
