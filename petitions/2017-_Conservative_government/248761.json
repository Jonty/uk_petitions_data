        "action": "Empower a tougher sentence on knife crime.",
        "additional_details": "I\u2019m urging the government to empower tougher sentences on knife crime. Anyone found carrying a knife should be sentenced to 10 to 15 years and anyone that uses a knife should be sentenced to life imprisonment. People lives are destroyed because of knives and family members shouldn\u2019t have to go through burying their child. Knife crime has risen and it needs to be stopped and also taught in school about the dangers of carrying and using knives and the consequences.",
        "background": "There has been so much knife crime, some victims have fought three it and some victims have been sadly been taken from their loved ones and it\u2019s heartbreaking. After seeing a video of a young man being stabbed to death, my heart sunk and I could only imagine what his mum is going through.",
