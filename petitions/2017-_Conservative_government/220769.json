        "additional_details": "I suspect that some people are choosing to go without food etc just to pay for car parking charges which can mount up if  you are there for some hours and have to visit on several occassions.

        "background": "Cap car parking charges in hospitals to \u00a31.00 per hour.  When you attend a hospital for treatment or to visit someone then you are probably under stress, so finding extra money to pay for car parking (especially the high charges some hospitals charge) is just adding to the stress your under.",
