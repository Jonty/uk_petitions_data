Emphasis was placed on our Dad not paying attention when crossing at the Zebra crossing rather than the Driver of the Car being careless. \r\n\r\nWe feel:\r\n\r\nZebra Crossings on main Roads, near Schools and junctions be changed to Pelican Crossings\r\n\r\nThe Highway Code needs to be changed to give pedestrians greater priority at crossings\r\n\r\nThe distance of a crossing from a junction should be standardised to at least 8 metres",
        "background": "My Dad, a 91 year old Father of 5 Children, 16 Grandchildren and 7 Great Grandchildren was knocked down and killed whilst crossing the Road at a Zebra Crossing. \r\n\r\nGovt should look at position/ suitability of crossings ensuring that a pedestrian crossing is the safest place for people to cross",
