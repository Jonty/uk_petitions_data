In addition, some women are being forced to pay the fines handed down to their abusers, with unpaid fines often taken from shared bank accounts.Critics fear the introduction of 'the slapping law' has already normalised increased levels of violence against women, with the mayor of Russia's fourth-largest city reporting a dramatic uptick in incidents since the change.",

Some forms of violence were decriminalised, first by the lower parliament, known as the Duma, then endorsed by President Putin. this has resulted in an estimated 36,000 women being abused and an estimated 600 women killed.",
