        "additional_details": "1. Between 06:00 and 22:00 hrs no HGV may use lane 2.\r\n2. If the overtaking HGV is unable to pass a slower vehicle in under 90 seconds and safely pull in back in then the move should not be attempted.\r\n3. HGV's must not use lane 3 on \"smart\" motorways.\r\n4. HGV's up to 7.5 tonnes may not use lane 4 on smart motorways, anyone found doing so should receive 6 penalty points and a \u00a31000 fine. Use of the overhead cameras to identify culprits could be used.",
        "background": "With the introduction of 4 lane smart motorways traffic congestion is worse than ever. HGV's are now actively using lanes 1,2 & 3 restricting every other vehicle to lane 4.\r\n\r\nOn 2 lane highways they sit side by side for mile after mile unable to pass and holding up other faster moving vehicles.",
