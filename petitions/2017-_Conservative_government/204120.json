        "additional_details": "The government offers bursaries for secondary school positions for those in certain areas or with certain qualifications. Working full time in a school severely limits the trainees to gain a secondary job to provide supplementary income. Primary trainees are eligible for student finance, which provides a very limited income and has to be repaid. Their service to a career path so important for our next generations deserves at least minimum wage. Please sign this petition.",
        "background": "Trainee teachers are required to spend significant time working in  schools without pay. They are relied on as full members of staff and should be entitled to at least minimum wage. Due to this commitment, they are unable to hold another job and often live on a loan of around \u00a34,000 per year.",
