        "additional_details": "With no mandate and no consultation, the government should not be removing the UK from the Single Market. Doing so will endanger jobs, people's livelihoods and future economic growth.\r\n\r\nIf the government continues along this path, a vote of no confidence should be called, followed by a general election to install a government that will not follow through with something it has no mandate to do.",
        "background": "The current government is insisting that the UK leaves the Single Market but has no mandate to do so.\r\n\r\nThe referendum solely asked 'leave the EU' or 'remain in the EU'. Leaving the EU does not mean leaving the Single Market; both the general public and Parliament were not consulted on this.",
