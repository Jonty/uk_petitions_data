        "additional_details": "All schools should offer GCSEs in place of IGCSEs where they are currently offered.\r\n\r\nIGCSEs are treated by the Russell Group universities as equal to more rigorous GCSEs. This disadvantages state school pupils at all but one of those universities. Additionally, the two separate qualifications are often presented and perceived to be equally rigorous by members of the public, businesses and others. This misleadingly named qualification the International GCSE must be abolished.",
        "background": "IGCSEs have been claimed to be easier than traditional GCSEs (including by the chair of the Commons education select committee). Private schools with more resources often sitting IGCSEs while state schools must sit GCSEs. ",
