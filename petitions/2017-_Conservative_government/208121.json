        "action": "Aim to maintain freedom of movement for British citizens after Brexit",
        "additional_details": "We believe that in a modern democracy the majority cannot take a fundamental and hard-earned right such as the freedom of movement away from the minority. 17.4 million voters cannot take freedom away from a total of over 50 million British citizens, including all those who were below voting age at the date of the referendum, who risk losing their freedom of movement without having had a chance to vote. The UK Government should aim, as first priority, to protect the freedom of its own citizens.",
        "background": "In the Brexit negotiations, the UK should aim to acheive an agreement  that maintains the freedom of the British citizens to move to, work, live and study in EU countries with the current terms and conditions. If this agreement cannot be achieved, then the UK should not leave the EU.",
