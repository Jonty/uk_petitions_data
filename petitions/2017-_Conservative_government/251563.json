        "action": "Introduction of an age rating system for all television programming",
        "additional_details": "America and other European countries have an age rating system for all programming on television networks. It will appear at the beginning of shows for around 10 seconds before disappearing. It doesn't impact on programming. An age rating system in the UK would allow people to make a conscious choice about whether content is appropriate for children to view and give everyone an indication on levels of violence/sexual themes which may be contained in the subsequent programme.",
        "background": "Television is rapidly changing and mature themes are becoming more common, especially soaps who are exploring current trends. I believe it's time for the UK to introduce an age rating system for all programming so people have a better idea of the type of content which is included in programmes.",
