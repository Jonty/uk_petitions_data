        "additional_details": "Currently health tourism costs the NHS \u00a3200 million to \u00a32 billion per year. To abandon charges would put even more strain on the country and its medical resources. UK citizens pay for treatment via National Insurance payments why should patients from outside the U.K. receive medical treatment for free? This will result in an influx of more health tourists. To expect them to pay is not a form of \"racial profiling\" as has been suggested, it's only fair and just to people who contribute to the system.",
