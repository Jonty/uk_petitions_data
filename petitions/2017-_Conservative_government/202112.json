        "additional_details": "The NHS Surcharge cost \u00a3200 per year and this means immigrants have to pay an excess of \u00a3200 every time they apply to renew their Visa on top of their high visa charge. For someone applying for 5 years visa, this will amount to an extra \u00a31000. National Insurance contribution means that immigrants are already paying contribution towards funding the NHS and should be given the right to access medical treatment and not treated differently from EU and UK citizens with regards to accessing the NHS",
        "background": "The Home Office has made it mandatory for immigrants to pay for NHS Surcharge as part of Visa application while working immigrants in the UK pay National Insurance contribution that fund other state benefits and the NHS.",
