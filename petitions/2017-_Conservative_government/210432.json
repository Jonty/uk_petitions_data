        "additional_details": "RVS Chatham has been running for seven years serving all of Medway . It was set up to give the older generation a place to meet,to enjoy a hot meal and a drink and to make sure they are not left alone . Over 165 people use the centre not only to meet up but rely on the volunteers to deliver shopping and look forward to someone visiting them . Many have said without the group most will suffer loneliness and depression which will then cost the NHS so this service is desperately needed in Medway.",
        "background": "Royal Voluntary Service Chatham has been marked for closure on 31st March 2018 due to a \u00a335K grant from Medway Council being withdrawn.",
