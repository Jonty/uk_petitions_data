        "additional_details": "This exclusion is almost unique to the UK with France and the United States allowing all citizens a vote irrespective of where they live or how long they have lived outside home country. \r\nThis is not a difficult issue to address and would simply require this out of date restriction to be removed. there have been moves by previous parliaments to address this but legislation has not been passed.",
        "background": "In the Brexit referendum UK citizens like myself who have lived outside the UK for more than 15 years were not allowed to vote in the referendum (or for that matter in any General Election) despite being a UK tax payer and working for a UK company and intending to return to the UK.",
