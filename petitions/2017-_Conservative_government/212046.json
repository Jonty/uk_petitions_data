        "additional_details": "I firmly believe that a three month driving ban would help greatly stop drivers using phones as they drive. Before I retired it would have been very difficult for me to get to work without my car as no public transport was available. If others were put in this position then it will make them think before using the phone, hopefully!",
        "background": "Every day I walk my dogs I see many drivers using their mobile phones. Clearly the 6 points and \u00a3200 fine have not had the desired effect to make people stop using phones while driving.",
