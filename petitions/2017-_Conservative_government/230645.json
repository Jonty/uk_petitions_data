        "additional_details": "for example if you have a tax allowance of \u00a311500 and you are getting a state pension of say \u00a36000 a year they deduct that amount you get from the state from your tax allowance reducing it to \u00a35500 so anything you get from your works pension above \u00a35500 is taxed leaving you with a smaller pension they don't make that clear when they are asking you to take out a works pension",
        "background": "when you receive your state pension you get it tax free but the works pension that you have been paying most of your working life is not tax free what's more to the point your tax code is even reduced so you pay more tax on it",
