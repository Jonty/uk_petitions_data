        "additional_details": "Parents of chronically ill children are one of society's most vulnerable groups - they are tired, worried and stressed.  Some have even lost jobs due to their child's health.  \r\n\r\nAs schools have become more strident in maintaining high attendance levels, pressure to attend has become, in some instances, inhumane.  The current system is not in the best interests of children, of parents or of schools.\r\n\r\nA specific code that schools use for chronic health conditions would help to alleviate this issue.",
        "background": "Currently, parents of children who are chronically ill face pressure for their child to improve attendance.  This situation is mainly caused by the absence reporting done as part of inspection.  A code for this type of absence could be reported separately and not impact schools' attendance figures.",
