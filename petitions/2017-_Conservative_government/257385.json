        "additional_details": "The EU granted the U.K. an extension of time until 31 October 2019 before it leaves the EU. In that period, Parliament will not be sitting for approximately 12 weeks. This is a crucial time that could be better spent by MPs reaching a decision about Brexit. The uncertainty is disrupting most areas of our lives, be it business or going abroad. Since MPs have been unable to reach a consensus in the past three years, it is important that they focus collectively in the remaining time available, without wasting a moment on selfish interests.",
        "background": "The country is in national crisis. Parliament is incapable of reaching any compromise or decision in respect to Brexit. This is due in part to self serving & ideological intransigence. The EU has granted a further extension, this time must not be wasted. Cancel MPs holidays until Brexit is resolved.",
