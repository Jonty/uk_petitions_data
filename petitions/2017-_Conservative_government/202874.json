Local planning issues are the responsibility of your local council.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nOnce an application is made for the development to take place, all local residents have the right to request that a planning application be \u2018called in\u2019 by the Department for Communities and Local Government. This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n\u00a0\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf \r\n\r\nYou could also contact your local MP, who may wish to request the decision is called in if they agree with you.
