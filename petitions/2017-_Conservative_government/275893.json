        "additional_details": "Most law abiding citizens only use cash when dealing with an illegal vendor or other criminals avoiding tax.\r\nWhen crime plumettes the effect upon our police, courts and prisons would be breathtaking.\r\nThe increased tax revenue would fix the NHS, solve the social care issue, and much more.\r\nAll we need to do is open a bank account!\r\nIf you want your children to grow up in a country without drugs, and the violence and misery they cause, then signing this petition is the ONLY WAY you can help them.",
        "background": "Cash is only NEEDED to hide financial transactions from the police and HMRC.\r\nIf cash is abolished, and replaced by card transactions, virtually all illegal financial transactions will cease.\r\nOur society will become safer and fairer overnight.\r\nMost muggers, thieves and tax evaders would be stopped",
