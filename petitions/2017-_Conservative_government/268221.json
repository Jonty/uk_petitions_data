        "background": "The new PM Boris Johnson once wrote an article on how Gordon Brown had no mandate being unelected by the British People. I would say the same is true now of Boris who 'could appease public indignation over that, and secure the democratic mandate he needs, by asking the public to vote at once on him'",
