We trust head teachers to decide how best to structure their school day to support their pupils\u2019 education.\r\n\r\nThere are no specific legal requirements about how long the school day should be. Governing bodies of all maintained schools in England are responsible for deciding when morning and afternoon sessions should begin and end on each school day. Governing bodies are also responsible for deciding the length of each lesson and the timings for the morning session, the midday break, and the afternoon session.\r\n\r\nAcademy and free school funding agreements state that the duration of the school day is the responsibility of the academy trust.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a school decides to make changes to its school day, it is our expectation that the school should act reasonably when making such decisions; giving parents notice and considering the impact on those affected \u2013 including pupils, teachers, and parents\u2019 work commitments and childcare options.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education",
