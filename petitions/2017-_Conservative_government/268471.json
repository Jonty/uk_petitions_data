        "action": "Ensure there is no reversal in the use of metric measurements by UK Government",
        "additional_details": "Metric measurements have been used for a long time in the UK with concerted efforts to transition since the Weights and Measures Act 1963. Most UK citizens are familiar with temperature in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit, soft drinks/spirits in millilitres rather than fluid ounces, fuel in litres rather than gallons etc. Road distance, speeds and beer are still universally in imperial units. Officials currently make use of what the public commonly use and should be allowed to continue to do so.",
        "background": "Jacob Rees-Mogg MP has reportedly told officials that they must use imperial measurements. This counters the accepted common usage of many metric units (Celsius, grams, millilitres). A return to imperial units across the board would be a backward step, causing confusion amongst the public.",
