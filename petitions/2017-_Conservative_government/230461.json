        "additional_details": "I know it\u2019s not a quick fix issue but I think, even if just one corporation changed, a huge difference would be made. This discussion needs to continue and has to evolve into actions if the situation is going to get any better. People need to be educated into the importance of recycling and how it is to be carried out because, I know it\u2019s hard to believe, but some people have no idea what can and can\u2019t be recycled! Please help change occur and sign this petition to start conversations and action",
