        "additional_details": "As said previously a person aged 25 and over will be paid \u00a37.83p/h, a 21 to 24 year old will be paid \u00a37.38 an hour. If aged between 18 and 20 you will receive \u00a35.90p/h and finally, if you are a school leaver or in college under the age of 18 you will only recieve \u00a34.20. The cost of living does not depend on your age so why should your wages? This is a form of discrimination which needs to change so everyone can have a good start in life but a majority of companies play by these guidelines.",
        "background": "For people who are aged 25 and over the minimum wage is \u00a37.83 in 2018 yet if you are below the age of 25, even if just by one year, then you are entitled to less. The younger you are the less money you get. Same job, same hours but someone is going to be paid less based on their age.",
