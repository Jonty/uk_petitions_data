        "additional_details": "Priti Patel had 12 meetings with various Israeli officials without the government\u2019s knowledge.\r\n\r\nYet her meetings resulted in her seeking aid for the Israeli army from taxpayer\u2019s money. \r\n\r\nTo claim that her meetings had no serious implications would be misleading the public. \r\n\r\nStart an investigation immediately into whether she broke ethical or ministerial codes.",
        "background": "Priti Patel misled the public with her statement claiming to have only had 2 meetings. She then went onto claim that the meetings were not related to her work as a minister. These claims were later found to be false. \r\n\r\nThe taxpayers deserve to know with full transparency the nature of her visit.",
