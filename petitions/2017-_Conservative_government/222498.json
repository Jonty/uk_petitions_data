        "action": "Support the 'Campaign Against Nurdle Spills' to regulate nurdle handling",
        "additional_details": "Once spilt into marine environments nurdles absorb toxic chemicals and pose an immediate danger to wildlife as their size makes them easily mistaken for food.  The 'Campaign Against Nurdle Spills' has written a piece of secondary legislation that specifies methods to regulate all nurdle handling in the UK and UK waters.  This legislation will force anyone handling over 2KG of nurdles to be registered and agree to the highest standards of care when handling nurdles.",
        "background": "Nurdles are small plastic pellets used in the production of plastic products.  Due to poor handling and lack of regulation, nurdles have become a huge source of pollution to our oceans and waterways.  Visit https://cans.blog to see more.",
