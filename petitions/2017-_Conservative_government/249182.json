I have used this card for almost a year with \u00a31.50 coming off each time on the bus. Not only me either. This is an adult fare not 30% off. I think it\u2019s very wrong and misleading we are students and being fooled and taken advantage of.\r\n Things I want from this petition:\r\n* to actually have that 30% off bus fares\r\n* to have a tube and train discount also",

They sold us an 18+ student Oyster card making us believe we will be getting 30% off bus fares  and discounted travel. \r\n\r\nWe should get tube and train discounts also.",
