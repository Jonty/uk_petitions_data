        "additional_details": "My type of hearing impairment means that one day I will be completely deaf and will not be able to communicate properly with family members. I have tried researching the Sign Language courses and they are expensive and have no free courses offered to those who are hearing impaired or deaf. I have even emailed plenty of Sign Language teachers to ask if there are discounts given to the hearing impaired/deaf to which they said no, and I personally believe that this needs to be changed.",
        "background": "British Sign Language can be taught to hearing impaired/deaf children free of charge but not adults who are suffering. I have always struggled with my hearing since I was a child but was not diagnosed until I was 18, at which point it was too late to learn Sign Language without paying for it.",
