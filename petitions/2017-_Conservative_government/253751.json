        "additional_details": "This is a cruel and detrimental practice to our natural wildlife. If birds have nowhere to nest, populations will decline and many garden birds are in decline already.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, there have been several reported cases of birds getting stuck in the netting and dying. This must stop now.",
        "background": "Many schools, establishments and landowners in the UK have begun placing nets around trees they wish to be removed. This is because getting permission for removing the tree is a long process, and the nets are placed to prevent birds nesting there while they wait to remove the tree.",
