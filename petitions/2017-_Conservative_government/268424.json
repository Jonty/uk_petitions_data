        "additional_details": "In the wake of the disastrous tenure of Theresa May, Boris Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative party via closed vote, and therefore PM of the UK. For his tenure to continue, a general election must be called in the name of fairness and democracy. For him to continue as PM without election is inherently undemocratic. The people of the UK must have their say in fairly elected MP's representing them.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson was elected leader of the Conservative party with around 100,000 votes. He is our second unelected Prime Minister. There are roughly 66 Million people living in the UK, meaning Boris Johnson is our elected leader with roughly 0.16% of the popular vote.",
