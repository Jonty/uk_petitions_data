        "action": "Withdraw the British Army from Brunei",
        "additional_details": "According to the British Army website, the presence in Brunei comprises an infantry battalion of Gurkhas and an Army Air Corps Flight of Bell 212 helicopters, approximately 2000 personnel. Brunei is strategically important to the British Army as a jungle warfare training base as well as a source of revenue - Brunei pays for the military protection the British Army provides. A contract was signed in 2015 to keep the British Army in Brunei for a further 5 years.",
        "background": "On 3rd April 2019 Brunei introduced sharia law which, among other things, punishes gay sex and adultery with death by stoning. Such barbaric practices go completely against British values and the protection offered to the Brunei Kingdom by the British Army must be immediately withdrawn in protest.",
