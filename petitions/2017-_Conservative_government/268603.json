        "additional_details": "This nation has treasured, fought for and died for, democracy over hundreds of years within our own borders and beyond. Across our history, the principle of natural justice has upheld the right of all citizens to a fair hearing. This principle has been denied to all but 0.2% of the electorate. To argue that this small group has merely determined the leader of a political party is simplistic. The leader is in this case also the PM. The PM is the voice of us all. A general election is our right.",
        "background": "Boris Johnson has become PM with 92,153 votes. The total number of UK parliamentary electors in December 2018 stood at 45,775,800 (Office of National Statistics). This is approximately 0.2% of those with a right to vote. A cadre such as this determining the nations PM is unquestionably undemocratic.",
