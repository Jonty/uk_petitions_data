        "additional_details": "If there were one night only controlled displays many people would live more peacefully. People such as, parents with babies woken by the noise, the elderly and pet owners, I've myself spent the last 3 nights trying to keep my terrified dog calm. We could enjoy our lives more for the weeks before and after Bonfire Night. The smoky air quality is also a problem for people with breathing difficulties. Also A&E Depts are at their busiest during this period which is another strain on the NHS.",
        "background": "There's many reasons why fireworks should be banned. Not only are they dangerous, they are a big nuisance. If banned there would be no more fireworks being thrown around for fun or let off at all times for weeks on end. The outdated historic custom should controlled and restricted to one night only.",
