        "additional_details": "To have an understanding of the need for this petition is the fact that last week i worked 9.5 hours overtime plus and extra 11 hours on a rest day which you'd think would really increase my take home pay but the week prior to that i worked just a rest day of 8 hours and managed to take home just \u00a360 less, so for the extra many hours spent in work away from my family i received just \u00a360 and this is not the first time this has happened I'm sure I'm not the only one and this is why I've created this",
        "background": "Being a dad and seeing the struggle of trying to support my family pay bills, debt etc. Trying to survive on a basic wage is struggle enough so the overtime is an essential part,  I completely understand why we pay tax but why should we be penalised for trying to live without struggle?",
