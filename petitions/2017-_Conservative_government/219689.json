        "additional_details": "To prevent this from happening there would be a national safeguarding and child protection database. This would have any safeguarding, child protection cases uploaded so that every local authority and council could see the case files and would be flagged up as soon as the family move in to the area. All professionals involved in the case would have access to the database to upload their case notes.",
        "background": "Too many safeguarding cases go under the radar and have unknown outcomes.  As the way things stand now; disclosures are made and followed up. If the parents are \u2018caught\u2019 they sometimes leave the setting/more to a new one or if more serious issue/move out of the area or can be lying and deceptive.",
