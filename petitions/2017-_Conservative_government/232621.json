        "additional_details": "Palm oil production is \"disastrous\" for our planet's ecosystem, and some species are perilously close to being lost forever. Consumers should be able to boycott this product easily, facilitated by a clear graphic on all packaging and advertising on any product which could be made with palm oil, for example food, cosmetics, and cleaning chemicals. We want a \"traffic light\" mark system showing if a product contains palm oil, and whether it is RSPO-certified or Green Palm labeled.",
        "background": "We call on the government to introduce a requirement that all manufacturers state clearly on all labeling and advertising whether their product contains palm oil, RSPO-certified palm oil, or no palm oil, at all stages of production, in order to allow quick identification by consumers.",
