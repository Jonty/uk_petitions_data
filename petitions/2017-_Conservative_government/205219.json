        "additional_details": "As a young member of the British community I, along with my peers, find the current national anthem dull and meaningless. At sporting events the other national anthems seem to be more uplifting and inspirational than our own. So I would like a national anthem that is an inspiration and relatable to the younger generation as well as those who believe our country is more than just our Queen.",
        "background": "As our current national anthem is considered by many to be boring and uninspiring I would like to change it. I think it should be a song that outlines us as a country and not just our monarchy.",
