In order to sell the same meal for \u00a35, fast food chains would be forced to create the same, good tasting meal for only 500 calories.",
        "background": "People have become accustomed to eating foods such as fast food, chocolate, sweets etc. These are unnecessarily high in calories and, as a result, directly fuel the obesity crisis. A minimum price per calorie would force these foods to be made with the same taste and far fewer calories.",
