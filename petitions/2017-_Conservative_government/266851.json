        "additional_details": "Too much of our countryside is being routinely doused with a cocktail of chemicals. This needs to change \u2013 and farmers need help to get off the chemical treadmill.\r\n\r\nBee-harming neonicotinoid pesticides will be banned on all outdoor crops. But more must be done.\r\n\r\nThe government is writing its new policy for farming after Brexit. This is the perfect opportunity to make sure pesticide reduction is at the heart of farming in the UK.",
        "background": "The natural world is in serious trouble. Bees, birds, butterflies and other wildlife are in decline. One of the main reasons? Pesticides.",
