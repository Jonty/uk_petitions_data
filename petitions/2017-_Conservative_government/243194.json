        "action": "Stop increased staff car parking for NHS staff at Derriford Hospital Plymouth",
        "additional_details": "Personally for me there are no buses running from the Eggbuckland area to Derriford hospital unless walking for 1 hour to the nearest bus stop which takes you to Derriford Hospital. We should be looking after the staff not making it more difficult for them to get to work. It is bad enough with the bad traffic around Derriford let alone now leaving even earlier to get to our place of work.",
        "background": "We have been informed the the parking charge for staff at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth has been increased to \u00a33 a day and we all have to re-apply for parking permits which some of us might not get. Which means staff walking from a car park a mile away to get to work.",
