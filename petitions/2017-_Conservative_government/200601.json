        "action": "Make FCO Consular Services statutory, defined and guaranteed",
        "additional_details": "Cases prove that one British national will receive consular service while another does not for the exact same needs. The Gillian Gibbons Sudan case proved that the FCO will intervene significantly more the less important the country. Brexit especially requires that the FCO publish a charter that they will honour for each and every British citizen abroad irrespective of the country involved. Also that the FCO is more proactive in cases of civil and human rights abuse.",
        "background": "FCO Consular Service is subject to abuse and discrimination. British nationals abroad cannot rely upon the published FCO Customer Charter, as it has an enormous caveat; all help is discretionary, not statutory. British nationals currently have no recourse against the FCO for failing to help them.",
