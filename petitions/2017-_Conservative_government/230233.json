        "additional_details": "1 in 4 of us are diagnosed with a MH illness at some point. 50% off these diagnosed needs are displayed at the age of 14. Semh schools deal with a lot of these students that display these needs alongside other needs. To help these students and to give them the best they deserve, it should be mandatory that EVERY member of staff is MHFA trained to recognise and deal with students that are in crisis. These members of staff are the early help for most of these students.",
        "background": "SEMH schools have students with varying needs that are written into an EHCP. It's only right that adequate mandatory training is available to all staff to help these students especially with the varying mental health needs. Funding and timing is a major factor, therefore more inset days are needed.",
