        "additional_details": "The government's repetition that leaving the EU is \"the will of the people\" is profoundly dishonest and misleading. To ignore the advisory nature of the referendum is to abdicate the responsibility of governance. The government lost its majority and thus mandate in the 2017 general election. This government has proved incapable of negotiating an appropriate deal for leaving the EU. As it can unilaterally revoke Article 50, this is the way forward to protect citizens' rights, safety and welfare.",
        "background": "The government lost its majority and therefore mandate in the general election of 2017. It is thus not bound by the outcome of the advisory referendum in 2016. However, gvernment is duty-bound to protect its citizens' safety and welfare and must therefore revoke Article 50.",
