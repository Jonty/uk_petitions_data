        "action": "Make practicing beauty/nail/hairdressing treatments without insurance illegal",
        "additional_details": "Use of social media has made it easy for untrained freelance therapists, make up artists, technicians and hairdressers to promote themselves to the public who are unaware of the risks they are taking when using these services. Many do not even hold mandatory public liability insurance meaning that any damages or reactions caused by improper use of products and chemicals is uncovered. This puts the public in danger of life-changing deformities by negligence of the persons performing treatments.",
        "background": "There are thousands of unlicensed and uninsured treatments being carried out in beauty every day by untrained people . This puts the public at risk due to various chemicals used and takes business from qualified professionals who have spent years and thousands on training and insurance.",
