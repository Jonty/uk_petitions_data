        "additional_details": "You can't get a refund on an advance purchase ticket months in advance, unless you exchange it for another advance purchase ticket at the cost of \u00a310. This is not fair for consumers. This is simply companies trying to squeeze out every penny they can from the consumer. Megabus charge \u00a31 to change your tickets, but trains charge \u00a310, and if you're train ticket is around \u00a310 - \u00a330 anyway, on balance it's cheaper buying a new one. This would also help trains stop overreserving seats in carriages too.",
        "background": "Trains do not refund or even at least exchange advance purchase tickets. There is no economic value to society or benefit to the customer for this. If people's plans change, or they mistakenly book the wrong date, they should be allowed to refund it within a certain timeframe.",
