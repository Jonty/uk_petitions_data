        "additional_details": "I was exposed to chickenpox at 12 weeks & requested advice from my Drs on 3 occasions. I was told I had nothing to worry about because I had the virus as a child. The NHS website also states this. I ended up with chickenpox so severe that I was admitted to hospital for a week. The blood test would have shown that I wasn't immune & appropriate action could have been taken. Unfortunately, I lost my son at a day old due to complications believe to be caused by the chickenpox virus.",
        "background": "The Varicella Blood Test can be carried out to see if you are immune. A small amount of blood is sent to a lab to check for Varicella Zoster Virus Antibodies. With this test you can be given the correct care quick enough to hopefully prevent any harm to your unborn child.",
