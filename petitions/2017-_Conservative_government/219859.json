        "action": "Establish an Atrocities Prevention Board.",
        "additional_details": "Barack Obama established an Atrocities Prevention Board (ABP) in 2012. It has improved the US government's ability to identify early threats and widened the tools with which those threats can be dealt with. It has also provided the impetus to take early action in a number of countries that might otherwise not have received such attention.\r\n\r\nA UK equivalent could spur on a similar change and ensure that genocide and mass atrocity prevention are a priority at the highest levels of government.",
        "background": "Human rights and the prevention of mass atrocities should be at the centre of our foreign policy thinking. An Atrocities Prevention Board, made up of representatives from across government, would ensure a comprehensive approach to identify and address threats to vulnerable groups of people.",
