        "additional_details": "We are continuously outnumbered and outvoted by the other countries in Great Britain which is biased due to the population differences. Scotland\u2019s oil industry could create a successful fund as the median line where 90% of the UK\u2019s oil resources lies would be under Scottish jurisdiction. I believe Scotland would be independently welcomed back into the EU and NATO as no one has yet ruled that out. We should be allowed to make decisions for our own country instead of decisions being made for us.",
        "background": "Given the current situation with Brexit I think Scotland should be allowed to make a decision on how Scotland should move forward independently. Even if all of Scotland voted to remain in the EU we would\u2019ve still been out voted by England as London has a bigger population than the whole of Scotland.",
