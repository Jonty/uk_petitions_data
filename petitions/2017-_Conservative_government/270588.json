That Equates to \u00a3350 per UK adult per month or around \u00a34,200 per year. To get to \u00a3600 per adult per month or \u00a37,200 per year, would cost \u00a3377bn.\r\n\r\nCould we look at inefficiencies in benefit systems to address some of this cost and the loss of need of the department for benefits and the cost of that departments running?",
