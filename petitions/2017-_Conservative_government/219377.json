        "action": "Protect 20% PPA time for all teachers.",
        "additional_details": "The majority of teachers would cite work/life balance as one of the biggest push factors, most would put this before salary.\r\n\r\nThe amount of unpaid overtime working evenings and weekends as standard is not sustainable and I would ask that all MPS teachers have a minimum of 20% protected PPA time.\r\n\r\nMarking 13 class sets of books as well as planning excellent fully resourced and differentiated lessons in 126.5 hours a year is not achievable and needs to be addressed.",
        "background": "There is a teacher retention crisis at the moment and rather than address that with realistic aims to stop experienced teachers leaving the profession there are recruitment pushes to get more people to train to likely leave after 4 years.",
