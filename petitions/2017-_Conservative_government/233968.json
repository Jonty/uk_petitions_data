        "action": "Allow second-degree medical students access to a SLC tuition fee loan.",
        "additional_details": "For graduates who decide to study medicine they have a higher chance in gaining a place on an undergraduate medical degree, which has reserved places for graduates. However, these students are not entitled to a tuition fee loan from the SLC, and so have to fund the first 4 years of tuition themselves - \u00a337,000. Thus only those from wealthier backgrounds are able to afford this route, whilst those from disadvantaged backgrounds compete for very limited and competitive graduate medicine programs.",
        "background": "Graduate students who gain a place on a 5-year undergraduate medicine program are not currently entitled to a tuition fee loan from the SLC. This is preventing those from working class and disadvantaged backgrounds from being able to study medicine.",
