        "additional_details": "While it would be wonderful to have a more comprehensive label such as a Carbon Footprint traffic light system on foods, that would be very complex to calculate. Whereas having a simple \u2018Air Freighted\u2019 indicator would really help the public make an informed choice about the fresh produce they buy. It is not obvious at all which foods are imported by plane versus road or boat yet the carbon impact of air shipping is around 100 times that done by sea.",
        "background": "20% of each household\u2019s carbon footprint is food related but as a consumer it is difficult to know how impactful our food choices are. Having a clear indicator symbol on labels when fresh goods have been air freighted would be a great first step in ensuring we can make better environmental choices.",
