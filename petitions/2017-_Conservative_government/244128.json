        "additional_details": "You only need to look at Facebook wedding groups to see the large amount of suppliers in any one field. Too many stories of brides to be let down or conned out of money by unscrupulous conmen. As an example, anyone can buy a camera and claim to be a wedding photographer with no training or understanding of photography, or brides who think it's acceptable to ask photographers if they would like to do the job for free. We need a regulatory body which would put these issues to rest.",
        "background": "The wedding industry is made up of mainly self-employed suppliers. With no regulation anyone can set up a wedding related business and start taking unsuspecting couples\u2019 money.",
