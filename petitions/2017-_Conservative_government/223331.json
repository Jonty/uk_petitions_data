        "additional_details": "My work as a Community Psychiatric Nurse with Refugee & Asylum populations in the West Midlands has brought to my attention the needs of the English Speaking Cameroonian population. My clients are the victims of political torture & have fled to the UK to seek asylum. They have left behind friends & family, some of whom are missing & some that are still being tortured-as evidenced by video footage & graphic images. Without further intervention it seems likely that this will become genocide.",
        "background": "The English Speaking Cameroonians are being arrested, tortured & killed by the opposing French Speaking government & rebel groups in Cameroon. My work with the Cameroonian population demonstrates that there are gross infringements on Human Rights which calls for intervention by the United Nations.",
