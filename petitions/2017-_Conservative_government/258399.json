        "additional_details": "https://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/cannabis_report/en/index11.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/cannabis\r\n\r\nA 'minority' of sensible, short term users experience negative effects.  Comparative use of legal psychoactive substances (nicotine, alcohol etc.) is far more damaging and addictive, as is overuse.\r\nIf this petition is to be rejected, evidence more substantial than that included here or elsewhere for legalisation must be referenced.",
        "background": "The prohibition of cannabis on the basis of its harmful nature is in direct contention with hundreds of studies. The discrepancy between the objective truth and the law is an embarrassment to our nation.\r\nOur police officers are spread thin and it is time to prioritise targets in the war on drugs.",
