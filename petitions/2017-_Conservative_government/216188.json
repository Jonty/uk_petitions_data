        "action": "Hold a referendum to determine the will of the people for NHS and care funding.",
        "additional_details": "To remove politics as far as possible, hold a UK referendum on whether to establish an independent Commission to decide how to fund both the NHS and social care or leave it to Governments to decide. Voters would be choosing between continuing as now or having an independent Commission to set strategic funding plans, based upon need and not ideology, for Governments follow.",
        "background": "Reports by respected institutions such as the IFS, OBR and Nuffield Trust indicate that NHS funding per person is budgeted to fall and that future spending needs to rise to meet patient demand. Despite this, the Government refuses to increase funding even to match that of other wealthy countries.",
