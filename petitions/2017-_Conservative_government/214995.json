        "action": "Lower the price of public transport for under 25s in accordance to minimum wage",
        "additional_details": "Example, in Manchester a day rider for the stage coach buses is \u00a34.30, national minumum wage for over 25s is \u00a37.50 per hour, under 25s range from \u00a37.05 to as low as \u00a34.05, although these wages are increasing, it is not fair for younger people who are more likely to use public transport to have to spend more of their wage on these fares.",
        "background": "People under 25 in the uk who are on minimum wage are earning less than those over 25. However, they still have to pay adult fares for the bus and trains, which is completely unfair due to the fact it costs more for younger people to drive with insurance prices.",
