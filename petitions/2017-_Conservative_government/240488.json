        "additional_details": "Public officials speaking in a public domain should have a self-recognised duty to speak the truth and delineate clearly when something is objective fact or subjective opinion. This no longer happens as a matter of course. \r\n\r\nWe call for a new law to correct this behaviour. When a politician or public figure states a subjective opinion as objective truth or states something as fact without independent quality evidence to support it, he/she will have committed an offence.",
        "background": "With the proliferation of social media and fake news, the line between subjective opinion and objective fact is becoming ever more difficult to define. British citizens have long looked to their politicians to act in good faith, with honesty and speak the truth. Yet, these qualities are no longer.",
