        "action": "Protect trees and hedgerows with strict regulation on netting felling & flailing",
        "additional_details": "Declines in biodiversity and bioabundance since 1970 have been staggering - around 60% of wild animals worldwide, gone. The UK has lost more than its share and many native species face extinction. This damage to nature also damages us. Trees and hedgerows are not just attractive components of our landscape, they are ecologically vital. They should be incorporated into developments, not netted, felled and cleared. I want developers to plan for nature and with nature, and make good on commitments.",
        "background": "Trees & hedgerows are vital for nature, offering refuges, feeding and breeding sites, dispersal corridors and growing space for diverse wildlife from wildflowers and insects to birds and mammals. Current regulation of damaging practices such as netting, felling and flailing is inadequate and failing",
