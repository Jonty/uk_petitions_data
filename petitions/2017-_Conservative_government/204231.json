        "action": "Ban the sale of live small animals in pet shops and garden centres in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Animals sold in shops or garden centres are most at risk of abandonment or left to charities. When sold to anyone who can pay, this can result in unprepared, incompetent, or abusive owners. Often stored out of sight, these animals are kept in small crates with little space or care. Animals are often depressed, mis-sexed, sick, or injured.  Leading to unexpected litters & vet bills, while animals when bought for children or as a gift on a special occasion, are often given up or abandoned.",
        "background": "Shops should no longer be allowed to sell living creatures. It is too easy for people to make rash decisions & impulse buy animals when they're displayed like products. If the animals weren't on display, people would have to do more research & seek out a breeder or rescue for their new pet.",
