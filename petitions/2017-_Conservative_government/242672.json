A court should be able to change the wording of a trust fund to ensure it benefits the person it was intended to. Where that isn\u2019t possible the Government should change its rules to ensure that no-one loses out on support they would otherwise be entitled to",

Yet because of the trust fund, she isn\u2019t entitled to other support. Attempts to get the wording of the trust changed have failed.\r\n .",
