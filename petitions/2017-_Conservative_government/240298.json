The law clearly states upon hitting a protected animal the driver must stop and give Insurance details, and await for the police to tell them they can go.\r\nIt's evident this doesn't happen. \r\nPets are part of our families and our families deserve to have these callous incidents fully investigated and the law used again hit and run drivers.",
        "background": "Following the appauling lack of enforcement of the law & victim support when my dog was killed in a hit & run, we'd like to see the law changed so that police forces have to fully investigate & where a hit & run/ failure to stop at the scene has happened, the full force of the law is to be applied.",
