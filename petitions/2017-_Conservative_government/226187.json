        "additional_details": "Many other countries have support in place for breastfeeding to continue, eg Portugal has a 'breastfeeding license' which reduces the working day by 2 hours, this would allow a mother to arrive later, leave earlier, pop home during the day to feed or to use the time during the working day to pump to provide milk for when they are away.\r\n\r\nMany women need to return to work and a change like this would allow them to provide financially as well as physically for their child.",
        "background": "There are benefits to mother and child for extended breastfeeding with the WHO recommends breastfeeding for the first 2 years of life. Many women find the return to work makes continuing breastfeeding difficult, other countries have support in place for this to continue.",
