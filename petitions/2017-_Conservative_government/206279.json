        "action": "Increase School Funding to local authorities and Stop the Education Cuts.",
        "additional_details": "Schools should have more than the current funding settlement and the freedom to employ the right level of support staff appropriate to the needs of their pupils with the drive to improve education standards.\r\nThey are the backbone of our education system and should be treated with respect. They help the most vulnerable children and schools cannot function without them. As a consequence, many children would struggle and leave school without the qualifications and skills needed in adulthood.",
        "background": "Over the last two years schools have been forced to reduce the number of school support staff owing to unprecedented cuts in the Government support grant.Those taking the hardest cuts are school support staff who are either made redundant or have to do more by having extra duties without recognition",
