        "action": "Suspend UK training the Burmese Armed Forces.",
        "additional_details": "So far the Armed Forces have killed more than 1000 Muslims and 200,000 Muslims have been displaced from their homes and fled to other countries. They have also raped some women and have burnt people's homes. We the people paid the government so that they can make good use of it. We want them to stop funding the Burmese Armed Forces because of the actions they have done to the Muslims. Imagine if you were a 5yr old innocent child, you had fled to Bangladesh and your family had recently died. So please take action in Myanmar.",
        "background": "In 2017 the Burmese Armed Forces did something called Ethnic Cleansing to the Rohingya Muslims. Ethnic Cleansing is when they remove an ethnicity from their territory. It comes in forms like deportation and, in severe cases, mass murder and genocidal rape. Last year UK funded the Burma Army \u00a3305K.",
