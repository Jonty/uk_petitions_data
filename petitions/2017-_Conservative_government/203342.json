        "additional_details": "We wrote to our local MP, his reply states he agrees with the proposal.\r\nThe CQC web site details that only companies offering personal care can be regulated.VAT Notice 701/2 on HMRC web site confirms regulated group limitations.\r\nMost personal care companies don't want to do domestic care  and vice versa.The two services are very different but,both essential to the elderly/disabled.\r\nElderly people should not have to be taxed on a service which enables them to remain independently in their homes",
        "background": "Since 2007 we have run a business supporting elderly/disabled people with domestic help,enabling them to remain safely and independently in their own homes.\r\nDomestic Care companies should be able to offer a reputable service on a VAT exempt basis to make it more affordable to self funding clients.",
