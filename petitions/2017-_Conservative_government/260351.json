        "additional_details": "I want all diabetics to be allowed to gain their C1 vehicle licence and all those who wish to be a part of the emergency services to be able to undergo blue light training as working towards a degree and having it taken away because of a manageable medical condition is unfair. It shouldn\u2019t be a postcode lottery for people to achieve their dreams and for diabetics to feel at a disadvantage because of the medication that keeps them alive and has no effect on driving to stop them.",
        "background": "People with type one diabetes are advised against blue light training as insulin is seen as a drug. This makes it nearly impossible for diabetics to be a part of the emergency services which is wrong and needs to be changed, as being diabetic shouldn\u2019t stop someone from doing anything",
