        "additional_details": "The UK Department of Health's colour coded front-of-pack scheme was introduced in 2009 and gives consumers the nutritional info they need to make the best choices for their health. Research into similar schemes has shown that sales of green items increased by 5% and sales of red items decreased by 9%.\r\n\r\nShowing the ratio of plastic packaging:food volume empowers consumers to make the best choice for the health of our oceans. Let consumer power change the way global food corporations package.",
        "background": "More than 8 million tonnes of plastic reaches our oceans each year. \r\nBy providing consumers with a plastic:food ratio on all packaging (with an associated red, amber or green rating) we will give them the facts to enable them to accept or reject products based on their impact on our environment.",
