        "additional_details": "In his submission to the Judicial review into the equalisation of the state pension age at the HIgh court on 06.06.2019, Sir James Eadie QC said \" Parliament has no substantive, freestanding obligation to fairness\" & later that \" It is clear from case law that the enactment of Primary legislation carries with it no duty of fairness to the public\". \r\n\r\nThis situation cannot be right and the law needs to change to enable a \"duty of fairness\" to be a part of future primary legislation.",
        "background": "This petition proposes the drafting and implementation of a \"duty of fairness\" to the public clause, to future, relevant, enacted primary legislation. Any adversely affected individuals or groups should be identified & contacted, failure to do so should enable recourse to appropriate legal remedies.",
