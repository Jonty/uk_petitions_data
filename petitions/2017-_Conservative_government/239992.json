        "additional_details": "As a Health Minister, you would presume they would be promoting health matters but he seems to think promoting beer is a healthy option, whilst ignoring matters from constituents or the general public on matters concerning health. He was seen to be talking with Bill Gates, which is something you would have expected in his previous role as communications minister. He refuses to acknowledge those with issues to do with sepsis, needing drugs for loved ones, end of life care and other health matters",

So, if you have a favourite local beer, or run a brewery yourself, leave a message via the link below\".",
