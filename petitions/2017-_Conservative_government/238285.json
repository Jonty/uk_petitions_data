        "additional_details": "Increase funding; legislate so that every woman has the right to funding for 3 rounds of IVF; and set a minimum waiting time, so women like me don't run out of time to have a baby or have to choose between medical treatment and being a mother. ",
        "background": "It has become so hard for women to get IVF on the NHS now and for some women it\u2019s the only hope they have to begin a family and experience the feeling of giving birth to a baby. I personally think it\u2019s wrong for someone else to decide whether a woman can or cannot have a child.",
