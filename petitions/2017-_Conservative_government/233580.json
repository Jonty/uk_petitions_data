        "additional_details": "The four-tonne \u201cmoai\u201d holds huge cultural and spiritual significance for the Rapa Nui people, as it is believed to contain their spirit.  Governor Tarita Alarc\u00f3n Rapu has said \u201cWe are just a body. You, the British people, have our soul\u201d.\r\n\r\nA spokesperson from the British Museum has stated \"\u201cThe museum is one of the world\u2019s leading lenders and the trustees will always consider loan requests subject to usual conditions\u201d.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, urge the British Government to rule for the return of Hoa Hakananai\u2019a. The current response from the British Museum and their abhorrent suggestion of a loan, is entirely unacceptable. Considering that Hoa Hakananai\u2019a was acquired through theft and British colonial domination, it is of vital importance that it is rightfully returned to Easter Island.",
        "background": "Hoa Hakananai\u2019a is one of the most spiritually important of Easter Island's stone monoliths. It was stolen in 1868 by a British frigate and given to Queen Victoria. Governor of Easter Island, Tarita Alarc\u00f3n Rapu, has recently begged the British Museum to return Hoa Hakananai\u2019a to Easter Island.",
