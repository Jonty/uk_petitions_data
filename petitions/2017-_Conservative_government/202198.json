        "action": "Introduce a national awareness day specifically against plastic in our seas.",
        "additional_details": "A National Awareness Day is the answer; a day on which all anti-plastic in the sea organisations and individuals could come together to maximise awareness. Britain\u2019s ties to the sea are strong (historical, cultural, economic, geographic) and it would be great if our Government was the first to announce such a national day. Having a National Awareness Day is a win, win, win; for the oceans, people and politicians. There is currently no anti plastic in the sea day, we need one.",
        "background": "People are increasingly aware of how plastic, in all forms, is endangering sea and marine life. It doesn\u2019t decay, possibly for centuries and we\u2019re adding millions of new tons every year. Soon there will be more plastic than life in the sea.",
