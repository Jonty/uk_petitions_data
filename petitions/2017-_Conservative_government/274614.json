        "additional_details": "According to Asthma UK, 4,500,000 people (1 in 11) are currently receiving treatment for asthma. On average, 3 people die from an asthma attack in the UK every day. Some asthmatics are forced to withhold medication due to prescription costs (\u00a39.00 in 2019). \r\n\r\nAsthma is a serious long-term condition that needs to be acknowledged by the government. There should not be people suffering who cannot afford medication and/or do not meet the criteria to qualify for free prescriptions.",
        "background": "Asthma is a common respiratory condition that causes difficulty breathing. This condition can vary in severity and is treated with daily medication that is not offered on the NHS in England. People with other long-term conditions such as diabetes and epilepsy are entitled to free prescriptions.",
