        "additional_details": "Personal experience of being sold a substandard home. I was advised by the estate agent that a surveyor was unnecessary as my home carried a 10 year warranty. After a couple of months I appointed a Surveyor due to concerns about the inadequate construction of my home, for example, ordered wardrobes to be fitted, unfortunately these couldn\u2019t be fitted due to the sloping of the floors up to 14ml between one wall and the other.\r\n\r\nIt is is now nearly 12 months since I moved in - there are 112 defects of which 5 are serious.\r\n",
        "background": "A new independent ombudsman should have powers to impose large fines to the builders of inadequate new build homes. Failing this the builders should offer a refund to the buyers of substandard homes.",
