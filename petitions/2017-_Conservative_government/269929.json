        "additional_details": "Having adhered to a long deliberated sequence of independent research in AJK since 2005, an internal political process has been created here. Link: http://bit.ly/2ZbUxIR Since 1947, many a MP in the UK has reiterated that J & K belongs to its people & only they can determine their future. What was lacking was an internal resolution process & the UK's disinclination to share responsibility in this avoidable dispute. Our geography & water resources should be a blessing for humanity, not a curse.",
        "background": "Our forbears in J & K pre 1947 were transitioning from autocracy to democracy. Post 1947, we feel even more disenfranchised for becoming victims of an imposed land dispute that consequently nullified indigenous voices & divided our State. This transition was effected by the British Parliament.",
