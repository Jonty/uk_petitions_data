        "additional_details": "As Members of parliament seem immune to any social or morale compass. \r\nIt should be down to the electorate if enough of them agree to remove a member of parliament when they have crossed a moral line which seems to be removed from some members of parliament when they are elected.\r\nIt should be down to the public to decide who represents them and if they are going against the election or primary elected promise and actually vote in the opposite way then surely that is the trigger for a re-election",
        "background": "Due to the members of Parliament who have lied to get into office and are voting totally opposite of why they were elected.\r\nthis is to give back power to the electorate.\r\nMore than 10% of the electorate will have to agree to remove the MP and have a bye election to replace them.",
