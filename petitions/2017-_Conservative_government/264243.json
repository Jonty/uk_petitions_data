        "additional_details": "We could travel up to 30 miles per day seeing up to 15-20 patients each, each day. We are currently allocated a fuel allowance of 56p per mile for the first 3,500 miles of the year and once we get to that point the pence per miles drops to 20p per mile. We cover a varied geographical area which means most of us are hitting the mile cap early on in the year meaning we are being penalised for doing our job. This is putting unnecessary stress on an already hard hit service.",
        "background": "As community nurses we meet the needs of patients requiring care while in their own homes. Hospitals are crying out for beds and without our service patients would be unnecessarily taking up vital beds which could be used more for acutely unwell patients.",
