Furthermore nearly all the gun crime in the UK are not to due our laws but rather Guns on the black market from other sources. Additionally if the sport became more popular it may change the mindset of guns in peoples heads which might possibly reduce crime",
        "background": "The new Home Office Offensive Weapons Bill includes measures to ban certain types of Firearms and or Firearm equipment. Despite this the items that have been purposed have never been used in acts of crime. This is only punishing law abiding citizens from a fun, addicting sport.",
