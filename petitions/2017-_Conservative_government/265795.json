        "additional_details": "It is clear that after over 2 years the nation and parliament are deeply divided on this issue and that this division has severely distracted parliament from its task of running the country.  The resultant loss of parliamentary time has prevented the discussion and enactment of many other important matters.\r\nIt is therefore time to delegate to matter to the cooler and wiser heads of a Royal Commission.",
        "background": "There is no agreement in parliament on this highly divisive issue so Article 50 should be suspended until a Royal Commission can find an acceptable solution, leaving parliament to conduct its proper business.",
