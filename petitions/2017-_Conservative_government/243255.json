        "additional_details": "The british people have a MP to represent them and I can't see why the MP must take the oath of allegiance to be faithful to the monarchy in order to take their seat and so represent their constituency and constituents interests. As great Britain is a free country then taking the oath should be optional and not compulsory. So the uk government must change the law so that MPs can take their seat in the Commons and they don't have to take the oath of allegiance.",
        "background": "At the moment members of parliament in London have to take the oath of allegiance to be faithful to the monarchy before they can sit in the house of Commons. This system isn't right because MPs are democratically voted for by people to represent them and the oath of allegiance is not needed.",
