        "action": "Pardon Edith Thompson, hanged for a crime she didn't commit.",
        "additional_details": "There was no proof that Edith conspired to urge Freddie to kill her husband. The love letters she wrote to Freddie never incited him to murder. The judge at their trial acted unfairly to undermine Edith's case. The prosecution only read out edited versions of her letters. The jury was all male, but for a lone woman. She was found guilty on non existence evidence. There was no evidence. An all male legal system failed Edith Thompson in the greatest miscarriage of justice of the 20th century.",
        "background": "Edith Thompson was hanged in 1923 at the same time as her lover, Freddie Bywaters. She was dragged, unconscious and sedated, to the gallows, where she was held upright by two warders while she was hanged. Freddie confessed to the murder of Edith's husband, Percy, and absolved Edith of any blame.",
