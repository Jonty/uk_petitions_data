        "action": "Establish in UK law the principle that animals are sentient beings.",
        "additional_details": "Simply watching many of the natural history programmes on television clearly indicates the range of emotions exhibited by a huge range of animals. Watching elephants grieving for days over the death of one of their herd clearly indicates the strong social and emotional bonds that exist. Anyone with domestic animals knows full well that they show all sorts of personality traits, desires and feelings that are the signs of sentience. Even farm animals show similar sorts of feelings as anyone who has experienced the reaction of calves when taken away from their mothers can testify. It is essential that this founding principle is captured in UK law.",
        "background": "The Treaty of Lisbon includes the statement that \"...the Member States shall, since animals are sentient beings, pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals...\". This founding principle of animal welfare could be lost when we leave the EU unless it is explicitly added.",
