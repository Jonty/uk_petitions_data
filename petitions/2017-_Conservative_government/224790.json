        "additional_details": "To walk 3miles takes about an hour, whilst cycling this distance would take about 20 minutes. This reduces the amount of time children have at home to study or attend extra curricular activities.\r\nIf walking upto 2km for adults is suitable then how can the government justify the 3miles(5km) for children as young as 11?\r\nWe would like the rules changed so that those traveling upto 3 miles will have a safe cycle route most of the distance and be able to travel with a cycle the rest of the way.",
        "background": "Planning applications are judged as being accessible when within a walking distance of 2km and cycling distance of 5km to amenities.  The rules for school children should match this.  This should mean safe cycle routes for a significant amount of the current 3 mile walking distance.",
