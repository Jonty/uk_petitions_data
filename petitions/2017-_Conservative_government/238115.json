        "additional_details": "Let's get as many signatures as possible and hopefully get the government to take note as something needs to change! Give parents a little help with their childcare, give all children equal opportunities at early development and social skills whilst enabling working parents to spend more time raising their own children.",
        "background": "I believe it is unfair to offer free child care to some children and not to others. Parents are missing out on their children because they are having to work so much to pay extortionate childcare costs. 15 hours should be for all children irrespective of their background.",
