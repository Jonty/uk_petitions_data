        "additional_details": "Kids are being bullied in schools, in extreme cases, to death. We can neither blame kids for bullying nor expect discrimination to go away if the source isn\u2019t targeted, if the kids don\u2019t know why it\u2019s fundamentally wrong. There should be courses specifically designed to teach kids about why they\u2019re different to others based on colour, body type and other differences. Kids are sponges, there\u2019s no doubt that a new generation of educated kids would go on to become responsible and accepting adults.",
        "background": "The best way to stop all forms of discrimination and bullying in schools is by educating and spreading awareness on what makes an individual different to the next. Currently there are no specific courses available in schools educating kids about genetics and colour and why discrimination is wrong.",
