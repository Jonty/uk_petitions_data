        "action": "Give an alternate route for couples to reach the spouse visa income requirement",
        "additional_details": "This petition proposes that the financial requirement stays at \u00a318,600, however the UK sponsor must only earn \u00a314,966 per year (full time minimum wage). The \u00a314,966 can then be combined with the income of a direct family member to reach the \u00a318,600. After entry to the UK, the alien spouse has 6 months to find a job where the couple can reach \u00a318,600 per year. This allows the government limit to stay in place while having a much fairer system.",
        "background": "Each year thousands of couples are kept apart due to the strict and unrealistic financial requirements that must be met in order to obtain a UK spouse visa. \r\n\r\nThe current requirement is \u00a318,600 per year, this is not a small amount to earn for one individual as 3rd party income is not considered.",
