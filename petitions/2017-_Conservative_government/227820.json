        "additional_details": "Supermarkets etc would increase prices by 5p per item when they do increase a price, for eg, Mr & Mrs Public go shopping to their local supermarket, the store has had a store wide increase on tinned goods, so the couple buy 20 tins of varied products, all of which have had an increase of 5p, thats an extra \u00a31 on that shop alone, \u00a352 a year rise in costs, that\u2019s just on one example of shopping, let alone the other rises, to jump from a 1p rise to a 5p rise is too much for a lot of people.",
        "background": "Recently there have been calls for the 1p and 2p coin to be scrapped. I believe that this would have a huge effect of the UK public, This would mean any tax increases would jump to a minimum of 5p, that has an effect on petrol prices, shop prices would increase, leaving the British public worse off.",
