        "additional_details": "Please. Let's end this cruel and outdated industry now. Don't believe anyone who says there are strict welfare standards. They are not followed. Dogs are suffering here in the uk today. The dogs sent abroad, often via EU countries, to China, Pakistan etc, suffer even more. Make this a civilised country which protects those with no voice. Greyhounds and sighthounds are great companions. Racing is under 100 years old. It needs to stop now. Please.",
        "background": "The greyhound racing industry is unable to regulate itself or stick to welfare restrictions. Injured dogs and those who do not make it to the races in the first place are abandoned or killed. Dogs exported abroad end up bred and/ or raced in countries with no welfare protection. Please end this.",
