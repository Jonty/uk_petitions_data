        "additional_details": "I recently watched an episode of '24 hours in police custody'. A man was caught with 52 THOUSAND images/videos of child sex abuse and they also found \u00a3200k cash in his house plus a load of cocaine. He was given bail for the child abuse images/videos but refused bail for the drugs. The law seems to see drug dealers as more of a danger to society than paedofiles. He recieved 5 years for the drugs and cash with an additional 18 months for the child pornography. It just doesn't make sense.",
        "background": "I've noticed an increase in lenient sentences for paedofiles that make and distribute child pornography. This really needs to change. The British people want to see harsher sentences for these crimes.",
