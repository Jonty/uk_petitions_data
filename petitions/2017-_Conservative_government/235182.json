        "additional_details": "In 2016 the then-Prime Minister deemed that implementing these controls would be too expensive despite the fact they're used across the EU with great success.\r\n \r\nI'm certain there's a majority for remaining in the EU if the UK implements these tougher controls to address many leave voters\u2019 concerns. There is an implementation cost but it'd be far cheaper and less damaging than Brexit.",

If Article 50 is withdrawn or a Peoples Vote called, parliament should commit to controlling immigration in this way",
