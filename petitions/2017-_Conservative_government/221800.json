        "background": "The current state of food in both general and mental health hospitals is very poor. \r\nThe fresh frozen produce being served across many NHS hospitals is costly, unappealing and wasteful. \r\nI believe that this needs to be addressed as it is impacting on people's physical and mental recovery.",
