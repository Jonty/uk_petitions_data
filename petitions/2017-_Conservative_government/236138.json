        "additional_details": "I have heard too many stories of those with mental disabilities being discriminated against simply because they do not have a physical disability and people therefore assume they have no right to use disabled bays. However, both those with Physical and Mental disabilities have that right! Although its a small step, removing the old logo that portrays disabilities as physical could be the start of brining acceptance and equality to all kinds of individuals with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThank you.",
        "background": "We now know that disability is not just a physical thing, but can also be mental. Stories of people getting angry at mentally disabled individuals using bays are sadly common. Let's remove the icon and make simple yellow bays, so that physical and mental disabilities are equally accepted in the UK!",
