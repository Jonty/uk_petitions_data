        "additional_details": "We must immediately stop our involvement in this cruel trade of animals killed for fun, like others around the world have. Australia, France and the Netherlands have already banned lion trophy imports. Why have we not yet joined them in doing so?\r\n\r\nIn 2010 and 2015 promises were made by British MPs about introducing a ban, but years later nothing has happened.",
        "background": "The body parts of animals killed in gruesome hunts are being bought and imported into our country as \u2018hunting trophies\u2019. To hunt these beautiful animals for fun is inhumane and wrong - but it\u2019s also contributing to the rapid decline of animal numbers.",
