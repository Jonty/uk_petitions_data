        "additional_details": "We like modernity, but we are entitled to draw the line when effective choice is removed from a majority on one of the most important things in life, what we eat. Where is effective choice for a baby, a 2 to 18 year old, an elderly relative in care, for workers or curious tourists in a busy town? Open system GM is three dimensional science, omitting the fourth dimension, time. Its like introducing a rat or rabbit into a field in Australia in the 18th century and saying its all going to be ok.",
        "background": "Advocates of open system GM, hormone  and chlorine treated food say the customer has a choice. But babies, children and those at school , the elderly, and workers , tourists and those buying catering in a caf\u00e9 or restaurant are unlikely to have effective choice-  less than half the population maybe?",
