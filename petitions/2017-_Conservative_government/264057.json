        "additional_details": "There is an equal risk getting a piercing to a tattoo, and it is the persons choice to where they get the piercing i.e. getting a piercing in certain areas, the shop you go to, if it\u2019s sanitary and if they are qualified to pierce. This should be the same rules for tattooing. At 16 you\u2019re considered eligible to make the decision to allow a sharp instrument to pierce through skin so therefor its logical to allow the same with tattoos.",
        "background": "Ive always wanted a tattoo since i was little, and i have been grown around tattoos as most of my family have at-least one. It doesn't make sense that you can get a piercing at 16 WITHOUT parents consent in which involves needles, but you can only get a tattoo at 18 which again involves needles.",
