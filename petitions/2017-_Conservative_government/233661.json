        "additional_details": "The adults were intoxicated, an ambulance wasn't called until the next day, no reasonable medical care was given even though he wasn't breathing and they didn't contact Joshua\u2019s family. The case inspector said that if Joshua had been under 16, he would have arrested the adults. The law says that parental responsibility ends at 16, so justice can't be served. The coroner criticised the adults for a \"gross failure to provide basic medical attention for a child whose condition clearly required it.",
