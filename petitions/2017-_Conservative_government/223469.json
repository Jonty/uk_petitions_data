        "additional_details": "1 in 4 people suffers a mental illness during their lifetime.\r\nSometimes this is directly attributable to the behaviour of another or others.  In these cases the only legal remedy is a personal injury claim which lacks personal accountability and doesn't encourage improved behaviour.\r\nIn addition, psychological injuries don't currently have to be reported to the Health and Safety Executive so are not monitored.\r\nMental abuse is serious and should be given the same importance as physical abuse.",
        "background": "We are calling on the Government to make it a crime to intentionally or recklessly cause unnecessary psychological injury to another; add mental illness to the list of reportable injuries in relation to work; and ensure that the cause of any illness that leads to a suicide is fully investigated.",
