        "action": "Remove the 3 month ban on donating blood for gay and bisexual men",
        "additional_details": "There is currently a restriction on men who have sex with men from giving blood, where they cannot donate blood if they have had sex with another man within the last 3 months, even if protection is used. Heterosexual men can have unprotected sex with multiple partners \u2013 complete strangers \u2013 and still donate blood, while a gay/bisexual man who practises safe sex with a known partner is still excluded for a three-month period.",
        "background": "Gay and bisexual men are being prevented from donating blood for no good reason. There needs to be a greater effort to create a fairer system where gay and bisexual men who want to donate blood can do so without unfair exclusion. This lack of trust needs to end as it is outdated and discriminatory.",
