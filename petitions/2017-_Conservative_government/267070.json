        "additional_details": "6 months ago my dad got told his cancer was back and had to claim PIP while he had an major operation and then chemotherapy, 6 months later he finally got the decision... Denied!! Then having to go through an appeal, like there is strength for that. It\u2019s time the government see cancer patients as people and allow them to get PIP from the time they are diagnosed, no questions asked so they can concentrate on fighting the disease instead of fighting the government for money they deserve.",
        "background": "When your diagnosed with cancer the last thing you should worry about is how to pay your mortgage/rent, how your going to keep a roof over your families head, food in the cupboards etc. We have this system call PIP yet many cancer patients that are going through the treatment aren't entitled to it.",
