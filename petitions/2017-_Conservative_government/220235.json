This country is not a dictatorship, it\u2019s leaders are elected by the people to take up the office they stood for and fulfill the duties they excepted. Accepting public money in office without applying yourself to do any of the duties you pledged to undertake is immoral or even corrupt.\r\nEvery penny they have taken should be returned and not another penny given.",
        "background": "Take back every penny taken by MLA\u2019s from the public purse. Every tax payer has had to work for their wage, yet a percentage is handed over to Northern Ireland\u2019s non-working ministers.",
