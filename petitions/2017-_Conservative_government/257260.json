        "additional_details": "In theory we all believed that 20 packs minimum would help, but in reality and practice I\u2019m %100 sure that 20 packs do not help. Please help smokers. There are millions people affected really badly. I believe the government wanted to stop young people starting smoking, but I don\u2019t think this(20-packs) helps the situation either, ask any 10 teenagers you\u2019ll see 9 of them are smokers. If they cannot afford to buy 20s(over \u00a310) they may become violent,perhaps thats why the crime rates are crazy now",
        "background": "I used to smoke less because I would carry maximum 10 cigarettes at a time, now it\u2019s 20 units and I smoke more and more, it affects my health badly, I spoke to many friends and family too, everyone says it\u2019s been worse than before. Please bring back the 10 packs. Buy less, keep less and SMOKE LESS.",
