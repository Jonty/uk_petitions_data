        "action": "Reverse the No majority decision regarding animal sentience (EU Withdrawal Bill)",
        "additional_details": "On 15th November there was a \"no\" majority vote to an amendment clause (NC30), which sought to transfer the EU Protocol on animal sentience (Article 13 of Title II of the Lisbon Treaty) into UK law under the EU Withdrawal Bill. This was put forward by Caroline Lucas of the Green party. \r\n\r\nWithout this law there will be a serious effect on animal welfare within farms, labs, transportation methods as well as an effect on wildlife.",
        "background": "To prevent untold cruelty to animals we must continue to recognise them as sentient beings under domestic law. Many scientific studies have shown animals are sentient, meaning they feel pain, emotion and are aware of their surroundings. We cannot ignore scientific data, nor our duty of care.",
