There simply isn't the beds or the staff to manage the high number of patients needing care. On 7/1/18 Theresa May stated that the NHS was never 'better prepared' for winter. Mrs May is incongruent in her beliefs. Doctors, nurses, patients and carers cannot be more vociferous. What else needs to happen for her to accept the reality?",

On the 26/6/17 Theresa May found a billion pound to prop up her minority government after her disastrous election result.",
