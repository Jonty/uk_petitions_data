        "additional_details": "Paying over \u00a380 a week for just 1 room in a house or flat costs a student at minimum \u00a34,160 a year. Many student houses are sub-standard and the houses rented, if rented by a family of 3 would be charged at much lower rates for the whole house. These landlords take advantage of students.\r\nFurthermore the landlords and agents make up charges and fees to apply when the students leave in order to retain deposits for their own greedy gain. \r\nThe government should change the law to protect students.",
        "background": "Despite government run deposit schemes and the government's commitment to remove sign up fees landlords who let to students still charge inflated prices per room. Furthermore when you move out they charge for any mark they can find as a way to keep the \u00a3500+ deposit they ask for before moving in.",
