If my son wore his shoes he would certainly have got ill and having asthma made him worse.\r\nWhy is isolation so important I understand if a child always wears incorrect uniform but in some cases it is wrong!  A child should not be punished and miss out on lessons over not wearing wet shoes!",
        "background": "Yesterday my son came home soaked and his shoes also wet\r\nThis morning his shoes where still soaked so I sent him in a pair of trainers explaining the situation in a letter\r\nThe school put my year 7 son in isolation even after speaking to me.  This was the first time he wore incorrect uniform",
