        "action": "Bring HMP Service in line with other public services and improve the uniform",
        "additional_details": "The current rules regarding the uniform are fluid and are at the discretion of establishment Governors, some staff are not required to wear ties throughout the summer but must wear them for winter periods. The ties offer no protection from the cold and do not improve the working practice of staff, in fact can be described as a barrier between staff and prisoners. The money saved on producing white shirts and ties could easily be used to improve rehabilitation of offenders.",
        "background": "The current uniform for HM Prison service is out of date and unpractical. Staff working within prisons are required to wear neckties and white shirts when other public services like the police are not, even though they face the public on a daily basis. Polo shirts are smarter and more practical.",
