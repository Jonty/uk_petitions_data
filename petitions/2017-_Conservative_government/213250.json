        "additional_details": "There was a decades-long anti-EU propaganda campaign in high-circulation right-wing newspapers. This hugely affected the result towards a leave vote.\r\n\r\nThere was Russian interference to help the leave vote and to try to destabilize Europe and the West in general. That interference may well have influenced the final result adversely, to the detriment of democracy. Article 50 should not have been triggered until these allegations had been thoroughly investigated. \r\n\r\nMPs put party before country.",
        "background": "David Cameron had no authority from Parliament to promise that his Government would implement the result, which should have gone back to Parliament for discussion, acceptance or rejection or other action. Parliamentary democracy was by-passed.\r\n\r\nA coup then took place, subverting our democracy.",
