        "additional_details": "We want it to be a historic event. Miners Banners with brass and pipe bands parading. Run by an independent body free from the modern trade unions and the union banners supporting the labour party. For it to be overseen by Durham County Council maybe run by Beamish Museum, having a fun fair and the Durham Cathedral being elements of it as it has always been.  A place where the Union Flag could be held aloft proudly.",
        "background": "Durham Miners Gala has over the years evolved into an Extreme Left Political Event. Where local families can not enjoy it and have been driven out by Communist and terrorist Supporters nationally and internationally The miners of old would turn in their graves if they could see what it has become.",
