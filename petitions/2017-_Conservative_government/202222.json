Stop feeding teenagers and children with images of celebrities that have been airbrushed so much so they are barely recognisable. Stop telling men and women in magazines that these results are achievable and putting the self doubt into peoples minds that they are not as perfect. Lets see the truth about images that are altered and no longer real. Mental health and self esteem are more important than any advert.",
        "background": "Images that have been digitally altered are affecting today's consumers. People are being filled with unrealistic body images that can effect self esteem and mental health about themselves and what is realistic. It is time people know when an image is true to the person or a digital creation.",
