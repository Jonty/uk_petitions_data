        "action": "Fund the dualling of the A120 from Hare Green to Harwich",
        "additional_details": "With an ever increasing population and more lorries using Harwich International Port the road is under strain. It is also in need of complete relaying as the concrete slabs it was laid on are at the end of their lifespan. The road should be dualled now rather than relaying it as a single carriageway. Better road access is hoped to bring economic growth to Tendring, which has some of the most deprived wards in the country. It is also home to a major UK port - a gateway to Europe.",
        "background": "There is an agreement in place for the stretch of the A120 to be dualled with funding from Hutchison Ports as part of planning permission for a container port at Bathside Bay, Harwich. But this has been delayed for years and the town cannot wait any longer - the road needs to be dualled now.",
