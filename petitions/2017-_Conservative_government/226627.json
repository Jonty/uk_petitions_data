I emailed Claires and they gave and excuse f the country being diverse and having lots of religious practises, unsatisfactory response. Using religion as an excuse for child abuse is wrong on this day and age.its still abuse no matter what the reason.",

No other form of abuse on a child is tolerated here.High street stores should not be doing this in a window for all to see.",
