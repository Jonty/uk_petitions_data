        "additional_details": "Cells that use a lot of energy have a lot of mitochondria. Muscle cells, for example, are tightly packed with mitochondria. Sperm cells, which need energy to swim to the egg, and neurons (nerve cells), which need energy to transmit impulses, also have large numbers of mitochondria.\r\nMitochondria work hard 24 hours a day, 7 days a week with no rest. They deserve some recognition.",
        "background": "Mitochondria are organelles, which are specialized structures/units that are found in the cells throughout the human body. Each mitochondria is surrounded by a double-membrane, and they are known as the powerhouse of the cell.\r\nWe call on the UK Government to formally and legally recognise this.",
