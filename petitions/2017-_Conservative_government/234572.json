This is a backdoor way of extracting more money from even small estates of the deceased on top of inheritance tax. The fees will have to be paid in advance even though the potential beneficiaries may have no money to pay them causing distress and hardship to grieving relatives already facing having to borrow for the already extremely high death duties also payable plus interest long before inheritance may be received. As well as this the higher charges are payable twice where couples are involved to a maximum of \u00a312,000 which may bew more than or a significant propertion of any inherited benefit.",
