        "additional_details": "The precaution of displaying a red cross on overhead gantries to show that a specific lane is blocked is far from foolproof. The overhead cross is not a physical safety measure and there will always be a time lag between a vehicle coming to a halt and the gantry warning being displayed.\r\nA delay of only a few seconds could be fatal.\r\nThere are still some short refuge pull-ins on smart motorways, but they are spaced far apart and are inadequate.\r\nGovernment action is required.",
        "background": "The absence of a continuous hard shoulder on highways which have been converted to \u201csmart motorways\u201d leaves stranded motorists with no refuge from fast traffic coming from behind them.",
