        "action": "UK to raise the state pension to the OECD figure of 63% of average earnings.",
        "additional_details": "A political consensus was reached by EU Nations at the Laeken Summit in 2001, that each member state, would attempt to attain a Basic Pension of 40% of average earnings by 2007 and then work towards 60%.\r\nIn 2017 the UK state pension was \u00a37,440.\r\nFrance \u00a315,811.\r\nGermany \u00a326,366.\r\nSpain \u00a326,630.\r\nBy 2050 Germany and Spain plan devoting 16% of GDP to Basic State Pensions. \r\nThe UK looks likely to be still devoting only 4% of GDP. \r\nUK politicians should not ignore such massive pension differences.",
        "background": "The OECD reports that the UK has the lowest state pension of any OECD country. \r\nThis is a disgrace.\r\nI ask for a full parliamentary debate on the issue.\r\nUK workers retire on about 29% of average earnings, the average OECD figure is 63%.\r\nAll developed EU countries pay their pensioners more.",
