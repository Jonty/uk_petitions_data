        "action": "Make it law for all age restricted products to require approved photo ID.",
        "additional_details": "Evidence shows that there are more than 6000 incidents a day of verbal or physical abuse of retail workers because they requested to see ID for an age restricted product. A simple law that states no ID no sale on all age restricted products would remove the possibility of human error in having to guess people's ages and would help to stop the verbal and physical abuse that occurs because of this.",
        "background": "Across the country retail workers face verbal and physical abuse because of asking to see ID. The guessing of a customers age is what causes these cases of abuse with customers trying to intimidate the member of staff into selling the product. A no ID no sale law would put an end to the daily abuse.",
