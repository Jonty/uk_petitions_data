        "additional_details": "In the last 3 years I have had a mini bus go into the side, a coach driver hit the rear and an unlicensed driver reverse into me. (Videos are on YouTube under the title 'a day in the life of a London driving instructor'). \r\n\r\nI am now at risk of losing my 12 year career due to being uninsurable even though I have full no claims discount and no 'fault claims'. \r\n\r\nI have been told that 'I am at a high risk of accidents due to now being hit'. This to me is an easy way for companies to charge more.",
        "background": "As a driving instructor, we sadly get other drivers doing dangerous things to get in front and often causing accidents. Why should we pay more when we were not at fault?\r\nBut why should anyone pay more for accidents that are out of their control. Help Stop companies from taking money for nothing!",
