        "action": "Ban Halal and Kosher slaughter/meat in the UK, animal rights should come first.",
        "additional_details": "After watching an extremely distressing video on Halal slaughter where animals were clearly suffering and still alive throughout the process I needed to create this petition to urge others not to turn a blind eye to this. Refuse any Halal/Kosher products. I feel passionately that we need to ban this. I will spare the details as they are very upsetting but, I encourage you to see for yourself. \r\nI hope that the government finally thinks about our animals and gives them the same rights we expect.",
        "background": "We need to be more forward thinking in 2018, many other European countries have put animal welfare before religious demands. The way animals are cruelly slaughtered in the name of religion is barbaric and should not be something we allow. Please end this pointless suffering.",
