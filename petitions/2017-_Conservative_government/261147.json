        "additional_details": "According to findamasters.com, the average cost of doing a masters degree is \u00a37,392. In some cases, this figure can be as much as \u00a310,000. The Government only provide a loan of \u00a310,609 (May 2019), but on average living costs will amount to \u00a37,700 for a 10 month course (Save the Student 2019). Those whose parents can't afford that can't afford to do a masters degree.\r\n\r\nIf we truly want to support diversity, the government must provide additional loans so that more students can pursue a masters.",
        "background": "Current masters loans don't cover living costs, meaning that people from low-income backgrounds are put at a disadvantage. The government should provide the option of receiving an additional maintenance loan so that all can benefit from further education.",
