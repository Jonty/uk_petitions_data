        "action": "To implement a notice period before stopping disability benefits after reviewing",
        "additional_details": "Being thrust into a world of woe. Going through the stresses of being suddenly financially restricted then chasing the gov for reconsideration and then forcing an appeal process which many win this process surely costs the gov even more going through the whole tribunal process takes months to  year. Yes the money gets backdated. But all that addition stress and worry is totally Unnecessary. In human rights terms it's totally disgusting that our DWP treats the disabled this way.",
        "background": "At present many genuine disability claimants are losing benefits without any prior warning after going through a biased assessment process. Thus placing them instantly into financial difficulties and a world of uncertainty & worry even rendering many unable to actually pay the bills etc.",
