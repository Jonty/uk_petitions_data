        "additional_details": "We feel it is wrong to disregard such an important issue when discussing the hardship that 50's women are experiencing due to the 6 year wait, especially as they were not notified of the 1995 Act.\r\nWe ask that the Prime Minister acknowledges in Parliament the fact that 50's women do in fact have a 6 years wait for their pensions and advise other MP's to do the same",
        "background": "We note the PM's responses are always the same that \"no-one will have to wait longer than 18 mths\" to receive their pensions, we feel this is mis-leading as this only refers to the 2011 Act, when 50's women also bear the brunt of the '95 Act where 5 yrs were also added to their SPA = 6 years",
