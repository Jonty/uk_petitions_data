        "additional_details": "You can check hamster central forums and any face book hamster group for evidence and heart wrenching accounts from owners who have awoken to find their hamsters passed on due to entanglement or suffocation.  I have read two accounts of new owners struggling to try and save their hamsters from suffocating as the bedding had lodged in the throat, sadly they were unsuccessful.",
        "background": "Natural Cotton bedding has been the cause of at least 6 hamster deaths in the last 4 weeks that I personally know of. Deaths are caused by Entanglement and suffocation due to the fibres blocking access to the airways in the throat.  This is a priority issue amongst hamster owners.",
