        "additional_details": "Article 370 was the basis of Jammu and Kashmir's accession to the Indian union at the time of India's independence from the British rule in 1947. It allows Jammu and Kashmir to have its own constitution, a separate flag and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. Its key provision known as Article 35A gives special privileges to permanent residents, including state government jobs and the exclusive right to own property in Jammu and Kashmir.",
        "background": "On 5 August 2019, Indian Government scrapped a law that grants special status to Indian-administered Kashmir amid an indefinite lockdown and massive troop deployment in the disputed region of Kashmir suspending South Asia between the hope of a better life and fear of cataclysmic destruction.",
