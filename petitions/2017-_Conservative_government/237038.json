        "action": "Reform law to safeguard public interests ensuring against abuse of police power",
        "additional_details": "The police can target innocent people on the street or at home by saying that a crime was reported, intelligence was received, or they said or did something that looked suspicious. To protect the public from abuse of police powers, the review must consider whether the police must be made to provide within 14 days evidence to the individual/s of why that person was stopped, questioned or visited by the police and whether the police should have to apply to the court if they want to withhold any records/evidence.",
        "background": "We need a full review of police powers to recommend ways to reform the police. The review must cover whether the police target innocent people and act to avoid accountability. It must look for illegality, irrationality, impropriety in procedures, and failure to abide by rules of natural justice.",
