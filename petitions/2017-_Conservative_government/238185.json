        "additional_details": "Assaulting your child is already illegal. A ban on smacking will not prevent bad parents beating their children, it will merely criminalise good parents trying to discipline their kids. \r\n\r\nIt would also open the floodgates: will sending a child to their room be false imprisonment? Will taking away their toy be theft? \r\n\r\nChildren need discipline and it is for parents, not the State, to decide how to do it. A ban would be unacceptable interference in parents' rights to a family life.",
        "background": "The Scottish Parliament is in the process of introducing a ban on parents smacking their children.\r\n\r\nThis could influence Parliament to introduce a nationwide ban. \r\n\r\nParliament must affirm that it will not restrict parents' rights to decide how to raise their children.",
