        "additional_details": "First of all, it's convenient. Now you can get that drink from the corner shop for 60p and not over a pound. Next, it opens the door for other combinations to be withdrawn. \u00a315, \u00a325, \u00a335, I could go on. It would be so convenient and it helps people a lot. I know it would make me happy. Surely you should too.\r\n\r\nSign this petition and actually help towards making our money last.",
        "background": "So you're out with friends and you need a small bit of change to buy some chips or a drink. Withdrawing \u00a310 is a bit much and there's a 50p charge to buy a 60p drink using your card. It's just not necessary. However, if we could withdraw \u00a35, it would make life a lot easier.",
