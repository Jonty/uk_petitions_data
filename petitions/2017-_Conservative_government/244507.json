In recent examples, we can evidence call charges in excess of \u00a320 on at least 3 occasions from 1 contact centre alone. Vulnerable people, often on relatively low income, are being penalised at their most vulnerable time - often returning from hospital to receive hefty bills.",
        "background": "Current resource demands on the emergency services is currently extreme, with Ambulances regularly taking several hours to attend non-emergency calls. The majority of contact centres will ensure calls from Ambulatory Care or response remain connected until a responder or Ambulance arrives.",
