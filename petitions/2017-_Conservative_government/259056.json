No Govt can bind a successor, & Cameron resigned in 2016, replaced by Theresa May, & a new Govt following the 2017 general election.",
        "background": "Several recent Government responses to petitions have not been entirely accurate in their claims. Public trust in the political process requires that all Government communication is fully honest & correct. We request that the Petitions Committee pre-assess the accuracy of all petition responses.",

You are very welcome to contact them, to let them know your views.
