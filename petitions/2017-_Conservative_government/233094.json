        "additional_details": "Anyone who has stood under the canopy of the Menin Gate in Ypres at 8 pm and heard the last post being sounded, as it has been every evening since 1924, save for the particular circumstances of the 2nd World War, cannot fail to be moved. The designation of 11 November as a national day of remembrance and a public holiday would allow us to do justice to the sacrifice of so many that took place100 years ago.",
        "background": "In Britain we divide our remembrance between Remembrance Sunday that takes place on the nearest Sunday to 11 November and 11 November itself which recently has gained in importance. The designation or 11 November as a public holiday would do justice to the sacrifice that we try to remember.",
