        "additional_details": "End Violence Against Women Coalition commissioned YouGov to conduct the first national poll on street harassment in 2016. The poll found that 64% of women of all ages have experienced unwanted sexual harassment in public places.\n\nThere are laws in the UK which focus on sexual misconduct but none specifically related to catcalling. This is not an impossible task with countries like Portugal, Belgium and France having already implemented such laws.",
        "background": "Cat calling refers to the act of shouting harassing and often sexually suggestive, threatening, or derisive comments at someone publicly. \n\nSurveys have found that 85% of people under 40 years old have taken a different route home to avoid harassment. Cat Calling should not have this power.",
