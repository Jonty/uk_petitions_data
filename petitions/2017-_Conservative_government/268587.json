        "additional_details": "The WHO recommends a maximum workplace temperature of 24\u00baC.  Anything above this is accepted as a health risk.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that introducing a maximum temperature is not possible in every industry. For example Steelworks.\r\n\r\nHeatwaves are becoming more common. If this issue isn't dealt with now more and more workers will be put at risk each year.",
        "background": "There are no government recommendations or laws to enforce employers of keeping below 24\u00baC. Working in a retail environment is very labour intensive. Working above 24\u00baC can be uncomfortable and can be dangerous. Some retail companies will not pay costs to insure the safety of its workers.",
