As far as we know, there aren't any orcas in captivity in the UK. \r\n\r\nWe think you might be concerned about orcas in captivity in other countries. The UK Parliament can only make laws that affect the UK. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask the UK Government to raise this issue with the governments of countries where orcas are kept in captivity. "
