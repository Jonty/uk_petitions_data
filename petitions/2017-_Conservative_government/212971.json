        "additional_details": "Cannabis causes mental illness and disrupts educational progression. If as a Society we are opposed to it, we should be opposed to it all the way and not leave loopholes open so that \"Head Shops\" can sell cannabis seeds under the ludicrous pretext that they are doing it for sentimental reasons or for \"genetic storage\". This is a barefaced lie that puts the health of the Nation at risk.",
        "background": "It may surprise you that while it is illegal to have anything to do with Cannabis,it is fine to sell Cannabis Seeds.This may seem to you to be\"Asking for trouble\"and\"Clearly stupid, contradictory & sending a mixed message\".This is a loophole that allows cultivation to Start and allows gangs to form.",
