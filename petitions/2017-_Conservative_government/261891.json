        "additional_details": "I believe the ICO is failing due to the conflict of interests as it is funded by fees from the organisations it is supposed to monitor/investigate. Many people are being left frustrated as under the ICO they still cannot gain access to their records or have their information/data corrected. This failure is enabling organisations/public bodies to conceal their failure/abuse. The government must protect the general public and introduce a new tribunal to hold those who fail to account.",
        "background": "The Information Commission is failing and we need a new free single tribunal body with more powers and a legal duty to obtain all records/evidence in all complaints and the ability to fine across organisations/public bodies if they fail to comply or abuse/breach data law & withhold records.\r\n",
