        "additional_details": "The disruption has not just been as a result of the timetable change in May and is a constant battle for commuters. \r\n\r\nThe lines to Manchester have undergone major works resulting in major disruption to the service provided and in some instances no service being provided for large periods of time. \r\n\r\nCoupled with that the strikes which are causing more disruption to its passengers. \r\n\r\nThe over crowding and short formed carriages are resulting in disputes between passengers.",
        "background": "After Northern\u2019s catastrophic service this year, it is ridiculous that the company are even suggesting any sort of rail fare increase when the service currently provided is understaffed, plagued by continuous strikes and upgrades as well as the usual over crowding, cancellations and delays",
