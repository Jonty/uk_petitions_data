        "action": "Make gcse exams free for all children under 18, including home educated children",
        "additional_details": "Children and parents sometimes choose home education due to disabilities or vulnerability (for example, due to psychological issues caused by bullying brought about as a result of the main stream schooling system). As well as discriminating against home education, forcing parents/carers to pay for gcse exams out of their own pocket may result in gcse qualifications becoming less accessible to vulnerable children. This also risks certain disabled children starting life with fewer qualifications.",
        "background": "Currently, parents/carers of home educated children must pay around \u00a3200 per GCSE subject that their child wishes to sit exams for (including exam board and exam centre fees). This actively discriminates against home educated children and should be funded by the government.",
