        "additional_details": "You are owed \u00a3220,000. You have some modest savings and need to issue court proceedings to recover your debt. You will have to pay a \u00a310,000 court fee plus \u00a31,090 to have a trial. There is no legal aid available anymore. You are prevented from bringing a claim simply due to the ridiculously high court fee.",
        "background": "The Court Service made \u00a3100 million profit. The maximum court fee remains \u00a310,000 to bring a claim and \u00a31,090 to have a trial. Its time for the MOJ to review court fees to ensure we maintain access to justice for all.",
