        "additional_details": "An example is the halving of Sugar in Lucozade (a recommended drink for people with diabetes to combat hypoglycaemic events). \r\nOr drinks labled 'Regular' or 'Classic' now contain sweetener although there are already no added sugar or diet versions.\r\n\r\nThe sugar tax has reduced a consumers choice so it is near impossible to buy a drink without sweeteners and it is already being shown that they cause as much a health risk as too much sugar. \r\nModeration is the way forward not lack of choice.",
        "background": "Since the introduction of the sugar tax companies have been changing recipes for their standard drinks to reduce the amount of sugar by adding sweeteners.\r\nFor many people who either do not want to drink a 'diet' drink this has become very confusing and in most cases you cannot buy a drink without.",
