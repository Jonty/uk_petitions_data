The UK will be responsible for the management of natural marine resources in this area and will be able to control and manage access to UK waters including fisheries.\r\n\r\nThe Government has always been clear that the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill ensures that, so far as possible, the same rules and laws will apply on the day after exit as on the day before. This will provide the maximum possible certainty and continuity to businesses, workers and consumers across the UK \u2013 so that they can have confidence that they will not be subject to unexpected changes on the day we leave the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Bill delivers on our promise to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK. It is the mechanism by which the UK will leave the EU while taking back control.\r\n\r\nThe Fisheries Bill announced in the Queen\u2019s Speech in June will demonstrate how we are taking back control of access to our waters and the allocation of fishing opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe remaining technical elements of current EU fisheries law will be incorporated in to UK law under the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, ensuring both certainty and that our fisheries are managed sustainably.\r\n \r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs",
