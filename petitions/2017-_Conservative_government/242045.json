        "additional_details": "The London Mayor is aiming to make London a Zero Waste City by 2026, but what about the rest of the UK?\r\n\r\nRecycling schemes are organised and funded by local councils. However, this issue is not a local one, but a global one.\r\n\r\nThe government should make it mandatory to provide recycling bins in all public areas nationwide, and provide local councils funding to implement these bins and dispose of recycling correctly.\r\n\r\nPeople may not throw away less rubbish, but we can throw it away, the right way.",
        "background": "The recent advertising campaign, encouraging recycling at home is right, 'One Bin IS Rubbish!'\r\n\r\nBut what if you're on your way to work, eating lunch on the go, or on a night out? How do you recycle then?\r\nMost local councils do not provide public recycling bins, sign here if you think they should.",
