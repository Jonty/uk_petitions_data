The British public are still travelling to Sharm el Sheikh by joining connecting flights from Germany, France as well as Cairo . Most European countries have now lifted their travel ban, except for the UK. This ban is damaging the UK and Egypt tourism industry, the government lift the ban to Tunisia after sousse attack, so why not Sharm.",
