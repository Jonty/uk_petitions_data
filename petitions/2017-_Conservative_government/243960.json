        "additional_details": "The United States ambassador to the United Kingdom has attempted to debunk the \"myths\" of chlorinated chicken (BBC), encouraging the United Kingdom to embrace it. However, this would substantially reduce the quality of food to levels lower than previous sought after in the European Union. As such, legislation must be introduced in order to preserve such standards that we currently enjoy; such standards must not be ignored by parliament.",
        "background": "The United States of America have urged the United Kingdom to embrace chlorine washed chicken and hormone-fed beef, but lowering these food standards cannot be condoned and must be prohibited by law. Trade deals must not compromise our food standards, and it cannot be negotiable.",
