        "additional_details": "Studies these days are all speaking about Cannabis and its positive effects on users as well as speaking about how cannabis has changed America's drug system since being decriminalized and legalised in some states. If Cannabis was decriminalized in the UK, it would reduce the amount of drug-related crimes currently happening and would benefit those using it for personal issues. The UK may never legalize Cannabis, but decriminalizing will prevent unessecary arrests and jail time.",
        "background": "Many people in the UK currently use cannabis in some form. A lot of cannabis users tend to use it for pain relief, anxiety, nausea and other symptoms that they struggle with on a day-to-day basis. These same users are also risking their freedom to use a substance which benefits them personally.",
