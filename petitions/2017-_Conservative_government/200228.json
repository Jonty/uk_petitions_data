        "additional_details": "It is really differcult for me, being of approx 1950mm high to sit comfortably on a train. I often have to sit at an angle which is not good for my back and my knees are always pressed up to the chair in front of me. Because I am twisted, it takes up space from the chair next to me and this reduces the space for anyone who sits next to me, which is annoying for both of us and embarrassing for me. Though this might lead to a slight reduction in seats on trains, it will improve the journey for all",
        "background": "There should be a minimum leg room space in places like cinemas and trains of 350mm from the edge of the seat of the chair to the back of the chair in front. This will improve the experience of all, especially for people of 1950mm height, the disabled, those with loads of luggage and children etc.",
