I paid \u00a3500 Immegration Health Surcharge (IHS) and was given 30 months residence visa. Now it\u2019s time for me to renew my visa. I\u2019ve always been working, I\u2019ve never fall sick to have to go to the NHS why do I have to pay the \u00a3500 IHS again to renew my biometric residence stay for another 30 months residence stay?
