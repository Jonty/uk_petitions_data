        "action": "Ban zero hour employment contracts",
        "additional_details": "It takes a workplace back to the days of \"if your face fits\" because an employer never needs to dismiss anyone they can simply give no hours ever again so you can't take them to tribunal for unfair dismissal because your technically still employed by them, it makes it hard to claim any state benefits whilst you have no hours, I know people who have been given a full time job 40 hours a week but given a zero hour contract it's just wrong and we need the government to step in and save our people",
        "background": "I believe they should be banned for a host of reasons, gives employees no stability, make's it hard for people on these contracts to get a mortgage, it allows employers to side step employees rights,  for example if an employer finds out your gay/lesbian they can simply give you no hours ever again.",
