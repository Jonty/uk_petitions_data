        "additional_details": "Some may argue that young adults under the age of 18 are not responsible enough to be allowed to vote, however, up until now it's always been the adults voting, and as you can see, the world is not in a great political state. They also have a right to have a say in their OWN futures. This is not something to think about, it's an obvious and fundamental change which is extremely vital to children's human rights and needs to happen.",
        "background": "The government's decisions today are the foundation of our lives tomorrow. We say that teenagers aged 14 and above should also get a vote as it's their futures which are affected by government decisions.",
