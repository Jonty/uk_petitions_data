        "additional_details": "We ask that Parliament: \r\n\r\na) define the primary objective of the electoral process (i.e. whether it is to allow constituents to clearly express their will in regard to who should represent them; to give fair representation to political parties; to provide strong and stable government; or some other purpose); and \r\n\r\nb) legislate that elections be held using whatever voting system is deemed, by an appropriate independent body, to be most likely to fulfil that objective.",
        "background": "There is an obvious conflict of interests in MPs deciding how they themselves should be elected. In particular, the choice of voting system profoundly affects MPs\u2019 chances of being re-elected and this choice should therefore be delegated to an independent body, such as the Electoral Commission.",
