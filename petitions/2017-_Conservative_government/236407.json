Family B earn \u00a326,000 more than Family A but still receive FULL Child Benefit. \r\nChild Benefit should be based on TOTAL household income to make it fair for everyone. \r\nPlease sign and share. \r\nThank you :)",
        "background": "Under the current system it is TOTALLY unfair that a family where one person with an income of more than \u00a350,000 a year will not be eligible for full child benefit, whilst another family with both parents working and earning \u00a345,000 each (\u00a390,000 in total) still receive FULL child benefit..",
