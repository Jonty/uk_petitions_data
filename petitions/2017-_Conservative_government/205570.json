        "additional_details": "I am aware of many former Officers who served full careers with the British Army and left without receiving a medal of any sort.  It would be a great honour for them to receive such an award after 15+ years of unblemished military service.  I would therefore wish for the eligibility date to be extended to those Officers who have served 15+ years since 1900, with the ability for their offspring to apply for the award.",
        "background": "I have recently discovered that Army Officer serving since 2014 will be issued with a Long Service and Good Conduct medal. I view this is a slap in the face for former Officers, such as my father, who served prior to the 2014 deadline, who is still alive, and spent 35 years in the British Army.",
