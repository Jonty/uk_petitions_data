Although every measure is in place to ensure safety (going in twos, telling other staff what patient we are going to) this doesn\u2019t provide solid evidence in these situations. \r\nWhy are we allowed to be put in these situations without protection?",
        "background": "As a community support team we provide care in patients own homes. We come across a range of different patients. Some can be mentally or even physically abusive towards staff. This puts us in a very vulnerable situation and at risk of being injured.",
