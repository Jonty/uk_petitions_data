        "additional_details": "Women are stopped and have no easy way of proving the relationship without their name being on their child's passport. Changing the law would not only prevent discrimination against women, but also help border staff prevent child trafficking.\r\n\r\n1 in 7 women intend not to take their partner\u2019s name - according to recent research by YouGov - while just 4% of women intend to give their child their name instead of the father's.\r\n\r\nWe need to debate the issue so we can discuss how to rectify the problem.",
        "background": "600,000 women have been stopped at the border in the past five years to prove they are related to their own child. Women feel vulnerable and it causes delays  - as well as being a burden for border agents.\r\n\r\nWe must recognise that, increasingly, children will not share their mothers' surnames.",
