Some children are still in nappies, others still breastfed, yet pulled away and kept in cages away from their parents. There is no counselling, kids are looking after other kids while dealing with their own trauma. All families need to be reunited before we can contemplate hosting President Trump. We simply cannot do business while these human right abuses continue.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/17/separation-border-children-cages-south-texas-warehouse-holding-facility\r\n\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-44518942\r\n\r\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration/u-s-government-reunites-522-children-removed-under-zero-tolerance-idUSKBN1JK01L",
