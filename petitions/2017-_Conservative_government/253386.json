        "action": "Ensure all settled EU citizens will still be eligible for benefits after Brexit",
        "additional_details": "By possibly leaving this loophole the UK's legacy of being a welfare state would be destroyed. Thousands of EU citizens dependant on social housing and state benefits are currently being left in a limbo. Most have worked and have contributed to the UK economy through their taxes, and others are even born in the UK but do not have British citizenship. Please ensure that no one will be left hungry or homeless by protecting the rights of EU citizens to access financial help should they need it.",
        "background": "The UK has not been clear in ensuring that the rights of EU citizens reap will remain after Brexit, most notably in regards to benefits. This is a pressing issue as more than 30% of children in the UK are living in poverty. The result of denying EU citizens this would have catastrophic consequences.",
