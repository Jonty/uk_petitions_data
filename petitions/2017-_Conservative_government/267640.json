This was the highest number of people that were subject to the pilot and that subsequently didn\u2019t vote.   This is unacceptable.  With a plan to roll out this policy across the UK, the Government must scrap this idea.  It is undemocratic, it discriminates against those that are most disadvantaged and that do not have photo ID, bank statements or utility bills.",

According to the Local Government Chronicle, this restriction led to 819 voters being turned away from Polling Stations in 2019.",
