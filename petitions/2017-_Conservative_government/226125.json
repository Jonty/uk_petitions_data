Greed will prevail long after the roll-out as they make meter readers redundant , pocket the savings and plunge millions more into fuel poverty .\r\nThe energy firms can introduce \"surge pricing\" in order to charge more at peak times,\r\n\r\nSmart meters act like a spy in your home , all the data is stored on servers could be hacked.  \r\n\r\n Estimated bills will continue in  poor signal reception areas preventing transmission of data.\r\n\r\n Please sign the petition \u2013 thank-you \r\nsmartmetersscam.co.uk",
