Changes to the state pension age were made by changing the law, which needs to be approved by Parliament.\r\n\r\nA new scheme for civil servant pensions was introduced on 1 April 2015. Under this scheme, civil servants will have a normal pension age which is linked to their state pension age.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could ask for changes to the state pension age to be changed. "
