        "additional_details": "Gulfraz's only kidney has now deteriorated to the point he requires dialyses 3 times a week. This is costing the NHS \u00a350,000 a year.\r\n\r\nGulfraz's family have found a match after extensive tests in Pakistan. All that is required is a 6 months visa to accommodate this transplant.\r\n\r\nHowever the application has been refused by the Home Office.\r\n\r\nWe are seeking the Home Office to display compassion on the grounds to save a young successful business man's life. Sadly this is a matter of life or death.",
        "background": "Gulfraz Ahmed, 33 of Luton is in need of a life saving kidney transplant.\r\n\r\nThroughout his life he has suffered many serious health issues. By the age of 12 both his kidney's had deteriorated. His mother had provided a life saving kidney donor at the time, which has so far kept him going until now.",
