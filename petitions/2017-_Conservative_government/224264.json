There isn't currently a bill in Parliament that could be voted against, or an Act that could be repealed. We're therefore not sure what action you'd like the UK Government or Parliament to take. \r\n\r\nLocal planning issues are the responsibility clear of your local council.\r\n\r\nYou could raise your issue with a local councillor, who represents you. You can use this page to find out who your local councillors are, and how to contact them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/find-your-local-councillors\r\n\r\nOnce an application is made for the development to take place, all local residents have the right to request that a planning application be \u2018called in\u2019 by the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government. This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see:\r\n \r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf "
