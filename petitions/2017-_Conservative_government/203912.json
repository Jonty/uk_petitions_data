        "additional_details": "They attack and kill our pets - cats, rabbits, chickens and every other pet animal which are regularly out in our gardens. By killing our pets they also threaten the safety of our small children who regularly spend time and play outside in the gardens. The right to defend your family, your pets and property against this vermin has been removed from the residents and needs to be addressed by way of culling foxes to stop this serious city issue.",
        "background": "As foxes are protected animals and may not be killed they have become a nuisance, a danger and a health hazard. They are relentless with dragging rubbish into our front and back gardens, defecating on our doorsteps thereby spreading disease and infections, killing our pets.",
