        "additional_details": "They are trying to keep the costs down for people of those religious persuasions. However, that means that around 90%+ of the UK population are subsidising meat that we are forbidden to eat. (Christian, Sikhs, Buddhists, Hindus etc.) \r\n\r\nThe answer, is to turn it on it's head. Make a law that means all NON religiously slaughtered meat must be labelled as such. A stamp saying NRS (Not Religiously Slaughtered) would work. This would give people of other faiths a choice, one not currently available.",
        "background": "The law states that Halal and Kosher meat must only be sold to Jews and Muslims, but this law is flouted and not enforced. To make matters worse, the government will not force religiously slaughtered meat companies, to so label this meat when it enters the general supply chain, due to higher costs.",
