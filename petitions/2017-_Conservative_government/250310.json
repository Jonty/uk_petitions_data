        "additional_details": "Companies such as Cambridge Analytica have been merely slapped with fines that they can factor into their operating costs - it's not good enough.  It's not good enough that politicians lie and retract lies, knowing that once the lie is in the public sphere the damage is done.  Newspapers run fake news stories knowing that a fine of a few thousand awaits.  They should worry about bankruptcy if they are misleading the public.  If we misled an old couple down the road, we'd be jailed for it.",
        "background": "While the dishonest and manipulative practices behind the Brexit referendum are known, nothing is done about them.  Politicians continue to state known lies with impunity.  This MUST be dealt with if there is to be any trust regained in future.",
