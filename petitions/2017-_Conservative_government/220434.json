        "action": "Make a legal requirement to have a valid horse owners certificate to own a horse",
        "additional_details": "The horse owners certificate is already an optional qualification provided by the British horse society. It teaches a person essential knowledge on equine maintenance, nutrition, care and first aid. Making this qualification a legal requirement for all horse owners will have a dramatic positive effect in the equestrian community and will aim to massively reduce the number of welfare cases involving horses inappropriately cared for.",
        "background": "Currently any individual can own a horse or pony regardless of their knowledge of basic horse care. This has led to a rise in equine welfare cases, with many horses/ponies being neglected, abused and killed due to the owners lack of fundamental equine care knowledge.",
