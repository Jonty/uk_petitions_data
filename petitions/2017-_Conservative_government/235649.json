Nor do they have to check Identification or proof of ownership etc. In fact ANYONE could claim a horse was theirs and have a healthy horse shot and removed with no records leaves people with lost/stolen horses at a dead end.\r\n\r\n2) If you find your horse the police will not help you to collect them. In fact you have to take the other person to civil court!",
