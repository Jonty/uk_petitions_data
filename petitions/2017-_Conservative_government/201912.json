        "additional_details": "In these times, the importance of the Union has been highlighted by figures across the political spectrum. \r\n\r\nAdding a small coat of arms to the Union Flag comprising of four symbols for each of the nations (Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England), would not change the issues the Union faces. But it might help restore confidence, and finally give Wales visual representation. \r\n\r\nIt would be seen internationally, as well. A reminder, to us and to the world, that we are four nations - united.",
        "background": "Though iconic, the flag's design doesn't represent all of the United Kingdom. There is historical context for the omission of Wales, but if we truly are a Union of four countries, we need to show that to the world. Adding a coat of arms with four national symbols would be small, but significant.",
