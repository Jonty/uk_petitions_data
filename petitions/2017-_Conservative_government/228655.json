            "details": "Cannabis is a Class B Drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.  There is a substantial body of scientific and medical evidence to show that controlled drugs, such as cannabis, are harmful and can damage people\u2019s mental and physical health, and our wider communities.  Evidence from the Government\u2019s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (\u201cACMD\u201d), is that the use of cannabis is a \u2018significant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society\u2019.\r\n\r\nGiven these harms, the Government does not intend on legalising the recreational use of cannabis and the penalties for unauthorised supply, possession and production will remain unchanged. \r\n\r\nThe legalisation of drugs in the UK would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery this can cause to families and society.  Legalisation of recreational use of cannabis would send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs.\r\n\r\nHome Office",
