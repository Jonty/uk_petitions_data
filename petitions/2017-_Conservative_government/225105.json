        "additional_details": "The the introduction of a tens millions of non-native birds upsets the environmental balance of our countryside increasing competition, especially for food amongst native birds. Wildlife such as foxes, crows, magpies, badgers and weasels are directly or indirectly affected by shooting, snaring, trapping and illegal poisoning carried out by gamekeepers. Additionally, the loss of predator species does in itself further disrupt the local wildlife balance as species such as rodents can then thrive.",

Native wildlife is killed to increase the number of game birds available for shooting. Damage to the environment and suffering to native species and to the game birds is unacceptable",
