They are not in financial trouble. They have always said they are leaders in this type of care - severely disabled adults. Why are Leonard Cheshire now selling the very reason they came into being in the first place?  They say the homes are in the wrong places - this is not true. All of these homes arein beautiful surroundings near cities.",

The homes were all started by Leonard Cheshire years\u2019 ago and are run with the values he promoted - \u201cHomes for Life\u201d in safe and secure surroundings within a not-for-profit organisation. It is wrong to sell them.",
