If our idea takes place, we could plant approximately 60,000,000 trees!\r\n\r\nThe leading cause of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2. Seeing as trees absorb CO2, planting them is a great way of trying to fight global warming. \r\n\r\nThis is our future that will be affected. We don't want to grow old watching our children and grandchildren suffer because of our mistakes, simple things we could have done to make a change. The future generations depend on us to do something now, to save our planet and our future. We must be the change. Now!",
