        "additional_details": "Transgender people are waiting up to two and a half years for initial consultations at NHS gender identity clinics. This is despite an NHS England pledge in 2016 to bring waiting times to below 18 weeks by 2018. The average wait from receiving a GP referral to getting a first appointment is 18 months. [Source: BBC]\r\n\r\n8/10 trans young people have self-harmed and almost half have attempted to kill themselves, according to new study looking at the experiences of LGBT pupils in schools across the UK.",
        "background": "Currently, GICS have over a year average waiting time for NHS funded hormones, thousands every year applying for hormone and surgery access. Many Transgender people every year die due to prejudice. With increasing funding for NHS GICs, transgender people will be able to get help much more quickly.",
