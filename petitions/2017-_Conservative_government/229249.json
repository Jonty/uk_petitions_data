        "action": "Prevent the prohibition of Air Weapons on Private Land for those Under 18",
        "additional_details": "This bill would prevent any adult, from supervising this early experience, with long standing and catastrophic effects for all shooters. This clause was dropped from the Offensive Weapons Bill, however the Home Office has warned that it may return, effectively banning air gun use for anyone under 18 anywhere other than at an approved club. Both the shooting industry and organisations are warning that this will be the first rung on the ladder leading to gun prohibition in the UK.",
        "background": "The Government has recently debated imposing a ban on all under 18s using an air weapon on private land. The impact of this would be wide ranging. The majority of clay, game and target shooters learn their initial skills using an air gun.",
