Feedback if required can be done electronically. \r\nConsideration should be given to relocating parliament itself to a centralised geopolitical location. Current building and location present an undue burden on the British taxpayer.",

It is not fit for purpose. \r\nParliamentary process should be updated in line with modern business practice and traditional , historic, protocols disbanded.",
