        "additional_details": "Speaking to younger children and their parents they feel that they would like their children to learn about this, as some parents feel that they can\u2019t always explain about this in a way that they would understand. But if a lesson was introduced they feel that it would be of value because it can teach them about taxes and how mortgages work and what they can do to spend their money wisely, to have a stable living when they are older.",
        "background": "When I was in high school I learnt about trigonometry and Pythagoras. But now I\u2019m older I don\u2019t know much about taxes, mortgages or wages or what money is needed for, so I feel that there needs to be a lesson introduced to teach children about these, so they are more aware when they are older.",
