        "additional_details": "On first glance, supermarket \"bags for life\" seem like the perfect solution, especially as many supermarkets offer to replace them. \r\n\r\nHowever, too many people only use them once, and then throw them away and get another one. These bags can use up to 12 times more plastic than bags marketed as single-use, taking longer to break down and only costing 5p more.\r\n\r\nThe government should make supermarkets charge 50-60p per bag, in proportion to the quantity of plastic used and reinvest in recycling.",
        "background": "Single-use plastics are one of the major problems threatening the environment today. They are very rarely recycled, and normally end up in landfill, where they produce powerful greenhouse gases, incinerated, or in the ocean, where they have long-lasting effects on marine life.",
