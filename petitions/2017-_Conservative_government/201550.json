        "additional_details": "Long gone are the days when acid attacks were just associated with dreadful so called 'Honour' attacks and prevalent only among certain cultures.\r\nThe use of acid is increasingly being used by gang members and common criminals, as a water or pop bottle full of acid is difficult for the police to detect, and doesn't currently carry the same penalty as possessing a knife or gun does.\r\nThe attacks leave victims in a world of darkness and pain, worse than death.\r\nThat's why attackers should get life.",
        "background": "The throwing of acid or other corrosive substances at another person is a truly vicious, cowardly, and heinous crime.  \r\nVictims suffer blindness, painfully debilitating and life changing injuries.\r\nInnocent bystanders are often disfigured.\r\nThere can be no place for this vile crime in our society.",
