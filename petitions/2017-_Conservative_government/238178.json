        "additional_details": "I am all for children having a phone, and believe it is a parent's right to know where their child is and what they are doing. But it should not be a smart phone that has all this freedom to search inappropriate material. \r\nWe protect our children from the dangers of alcohol, tobacco and sexual relationships by having laws that state they must be of a certain age. Surely it makes sense to also protect them from the potential minefield that is the world wide web. This is destroying our children.",
        "background": "I believe that smart phone use is damaging our children. Besides being addicted to them, they may be able to access inappropriate material on line - including sites that promote self-harm and suicide, as well as violence and adult content. This simply has to stop.",
