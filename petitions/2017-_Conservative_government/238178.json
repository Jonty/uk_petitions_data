But it should not be a smart phone that has all this freedom to search inappropriate material. \r\nWe protect our children from the dangers of alcohol, tobacco and sexual relationships by having laws that state they must be of a certain age. Surely it makes sense to also protect them from the potential minefield that is the world wide web. This is destroying our children.",
