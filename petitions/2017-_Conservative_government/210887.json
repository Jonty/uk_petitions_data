        "additional_details": "Full time workers aged 18-20 are often paid around \u00a370 per week less than those aged 25 and over, and 21-24 year olds an average of \u00a316.65 per/week less. \r\n\r\nThe withdrawal of help with housing costs from Universal Credit from some 18-21 year olds and the reduced shared accommodation rate has caused a lack of independence and increased vulnerability for young people.\r\n\r\nLow wages causes increased debt, exacerbated health problems and even a risk of homelessness.",
        "background": "The National Living Wage applies to those aged 25 and over. Under 25s don\u2019t get discounts on energy bills or groceries, their outgoing costs are not reduced because of their age. \r\n\r\nJoin us and call on the government to debate extending the National Living Wage to young workers aged 18-24.",
