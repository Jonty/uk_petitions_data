        "additional_details": "The IHS fee is paid on top of visa application fees, which are already extremely expensive. Such fees have thousands of families broken around the world because the British Citizen simply cannot afford to pay the cost of bringing his/her family to the UK.\r\nCurrently, immigrants pay \u00a3200 per year as an Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS) to contribute towards the cost of running the NHS. The government has announced that this fee will increase to \u00a3400 per year.",
        "background": "We are asking Parliament to please consider the real impact this increase is going to have on families of British Citizens who are already struggling to pay for visas fees.\r\nThis increase will cause more broken families.",
