        "action": "Make the penalty for using a phone & driving an instant 12 points and ban",
        "additional_details": "In my first month of driving I was hit by a van with a driver on his phone at 40mph on a dual carriage way. I see countless people on the phone and have had so many near misses because of them, and even if you politely request they get off the phone, you\u2019re met with threats aggression and even someone attempting to ram you off the road, which happened to me today. It needs to stop.",
        "background": "Despite the fact the penalty was raised to 6 points, the many people using their phone and driving, even on motorways is scary and dangerous. It isn\u2019t a mistake, using your phone is a conscious decision to risk lives and should be instant loss of license.",
