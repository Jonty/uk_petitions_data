        "additional_details": "The Brexit negotiations are not being conducted in a proper manner, inasmuch as no clear objectives are known to the People. This has lead to much confusion, and a rift in British society. We believe that Mrs May is not delivering on Brexit in any helpful way, and call for a vote of no confidence, and an ensuing general Election. The reasons for a call for a No Confidence vote are not limited to Brexit, but to the general confusion associated with her leadership.",
        "background": "Considering that Brexit negotiations are being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of the UK and it's citizens; that further the Brexit mandate is not clear as to exactly what is meant by Brexit (total departure, remain in some institutions, trade agreements etc), change is needed.",

This was often frustrating and disappointing for petitioners. \r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about a particular policy or decision that's the responsibility of Government or the House of Commons, you could start a petition about that.\r\nPetitions calling for action on policy are more likely to be an effective way of achieving the change you want. \r\n\r\nIf you want a General Election to be called, you may wish to sign this petition instead: https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/221912 "
