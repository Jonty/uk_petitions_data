        "action": "Increase the standard fine and points for driving in closed motorway lanes.",
        "additional_details": "The current fines are either not charged, or aren't an adequate deterrent for vehicle users to not use them. Suggested alternatives - as the Highways Authority are informed of where an accident may be and which lanes to close, suggest turning on any cameras available to catch people. The cameras only need be turned on when the lane is closed.\r\n\r\nIf caught, increase the fine to \u00a3150 and 6 penalty points. Alternatively, for each gantry driven through with a red X give them the standard fine.",
        "background": "Despite radio ads, we still often see drivers waiting til the very last second to move out of closed lanes with a red X, often passing through a mile or so of warnings. Those caught in the accident and the police/ambulance service are put at risk by the idiocy of people in a hurry.",
