Without even considering the shift of public opinion and the young who were not allowed to vote for their future. Many 16 and 17 year olds that were unable to vote in 2016 are now helpless to voice their opinion. Leaving the EU WAS the will of 51.9% who voted nearly 3 years ago, \"The people\" did not and does not accurately represent this fact",
