        "additional_details": "Banning the sale of certain materials is an effective way to force manufacturers to create alternatives. Fines have not stopped individuals from littering (just look at the floor on your own high-street!). Manufacturers won't change from cheaper, more environmentally damaging materials unless their hand is forced. So, let's force their hands!",
        "background": "Cigarette butts are the most common form of man-made litter in the world. It is estimated that 4.5 trillion cigarette butts become litter every year. The fibres used as the predominant filter material do not readily biodegrade. A normal lifespan of a discarded filter is thought to be up to 15 years!",
