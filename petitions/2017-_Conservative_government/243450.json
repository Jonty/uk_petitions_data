        "additional_details": "Approximately \u00a335 Billion has been knowingly set aside (so far) by the banks as owed to their customers, and needs to be claimed by the 29th August 2019.\r\n\r\nWith potentially Billions of \u00a3 to be unclaimed when the deadline passes in just 6 months times, nobody has asked what happens to any unclaimed money after the deadline passes? Do the government or the banks get to keep it?\r\n\r\nWe believe unclaimed money should be taxed at a 100% rate, and then used to help the NHS, education & fight homelessness.",
        "background": "On the 29th August 2019, the deadline for claiming PPI refunds comes in to effect. \r\n\r\nWe are petitioning the Government to levy a 100% tax on any unclaimed PPI money after the deadline passes; this money should be used to fund the NHS & education, towards fighting homelessness & official charities.",
