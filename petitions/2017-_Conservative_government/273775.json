        "additional_details": "In 2003 the FAWC (farm animals welfare council), conducted a report and deemed non stun slaughter unnecessary and asked the government to repeal the exemption. This was ignored, the FAWC are the government's independent advisory body.\r\nIt was discovered that animals can still feel pain for between 10 seconds and 2 minutes!\r\nI'm asking for the government to rethink this and put a stop to this cruelty to animals.",
        "background": "In the UK it is the law that all animals slaughtered are stunned first, making them unconscious and unable to feel any pain. This does not stand for Halal or Kosher slaughter. This needs to stop.",
