The invitation was accepted. This invitation reflects the great importance of the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, final dates for the State Visit have not been agreed. Once dates have been set, officials will begin making arrangements for the visit.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for a Head of State to address Parliamentarians during a State Visit. However, State Visits have previously taken place without an address to both Houses of Parliament. Any such invitation would come from the Speakers of both Chambers.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
