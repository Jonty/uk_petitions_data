        "additional_details": "The Delay Repay Scheme SWR operate is not a simple process considering the frequency in late trains. Furthermore, repayment is minimal, approximately \u00a33 for a one-way journey if the train is 15 minutes late, or more. As such, whomever is paid by the hour on a client basis, this repayment is not nearly enough compensation to run a business effectively. In addition, despite several complaints internally, SWR shrug their shoulders. Unfortunately neither RMT nor SWR treat customers fairly.",
        "background": "Every month, I spend \u00a3505.40 on a Monthly Rail ticket Basingstoke to Waterloo for work. On numerous occasions SWR is delayed, late or cancelled. On numerous occasions there is RMT Strike Action over consecutive days. As a result, I and several others lose time and money.",
