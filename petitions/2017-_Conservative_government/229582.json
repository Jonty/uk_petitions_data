        "additional_details": "This currently isn\u2019t a legal requirement that companies need to state on products. With the increasing number of nut allergy\u2019s reported each year as well as the number of deaths I think this is extremely important to raise awareness. The NHS reported 4000 new nut allergy\u2019s in 2005 and the number of the diagnosis\u2019 rise each year. It is crucial that more visibility is present in the beauty industry. Some companies name the nuts as clinical terms, making it harder for the sufferer to be aware.",
        "background": "I recently was hospitlised after an allergic reaction to a moisturiser containing peanut oil. This was not clearly visible on the website or bottle. I want to make it a legal requirement for the cosmetic industry to make this clear (emboldened, capitalised) on their products to avoid this happening.",
