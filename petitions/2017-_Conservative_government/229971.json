        "additional_details": "Ideally such a vote should be extended to all eligible 16 and 17 year olds in the UK, but I recognise that there is unlikely to be enough time to enact this before a second Brexit Referendum, if there is one.  However, electoral rolls should already include the names of 17 year old household occupants.",
        "background": "Brexit will affect the UK for generations to come, and in particular the future of our young people.  As with the referendum on Scottish Independence, it is only right therefore that more of them should be given a say.",
