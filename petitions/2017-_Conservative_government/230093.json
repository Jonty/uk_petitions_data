        "additional_details": "Nits are getting immune to treatments and the removal process is not only traumatising for children with longer hair, its time consuming and expensive. For these reasons, unfortunately, some children go left untreated and the epidemic continues. \r\n\r\nPetitions have been tried before and failed and I can\u2019t understand why. People you speak to, social media posts -nits are a huge problem within our schools. We need to re-instate the nit nurse and once again, get control over this unhygienic, distressing situation.",
        "background": "Checking for and treating nits are now the parents responsibility. With the absence of the nit nurse, nits are now rife, especially within primary schools. ",
