        "additional_details": "It's powers are hardly challenged as it has many powers.\r\n\r\nThe fact this body quietly operates with professionals that do not have much legal knowledge can leave professionals open to unfair treatment. Surprisingly they almost always win cases in court. This cannot be right. The Home Office itself with much more infrastructure does not have this level of precision.",
        "background": "The Office of Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) is sponsored by the Home Office and regulates immigration advisers, professionals that do an important job and many are more specialised than solicitors. I believe the OISC operates in a secretive, undemocratic, biased and unfair manner. \r\n",
