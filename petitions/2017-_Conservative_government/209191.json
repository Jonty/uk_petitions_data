        "action": "Allow all children in school term times a leave allowance for family hoildays.",
        "additional_details": "It is a known fact that during our childrens term times average holiday's increase by hundreds if not thousands. This has been an ongoing issue that the government have never really addressed to benefit parents. The impact on working class and self employed often means we are unable to have family hoilday's due to the inflated prices. Enabling a small amount of leave days per year, will benefit all children from a family point of view as well as a educational point of view. Thank you.",
        "background": "I am unable to take leave in term times due to the loss of earnings being self employed and the inflated prices travel operators charge. This makes it impossible for normal working people to afford a family holiday. \r\nWe ask for the government to discuss allowing at least 7 days a year for this.",
