        "action": "Increase maintenance loans to students living in Oxford to London weighting",
        "additional_details": "Studying and living in Oxford is financially straining on all students, affecting a students ability to achieve the best grades possible as they have to work long hours in a part time job just to live.\r\n\r\nWith the added pressure of part-time work, on top of an already strenuous University schedule, a students mental and physical health, alongside grades, can suffer.\r\n\r\nThe government need to assess the financial situation students within Oxford, as well as other expensive cities and fix the issue.",
        "background": "After being ranked the least affordable city in the UK to live, it would make sense that the government and student finance reflect this fact in the amount of maintenance loan students living in Oxford receive, but they do not. Rent and living costs in Oxford are well above the national average.",
