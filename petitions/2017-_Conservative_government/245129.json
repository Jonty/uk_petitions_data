        "additional_details": "I'm degree qualified in youth work and was brought up in similar environment's to the young people in communities where violence, drugs and unemployment is the norm. Having positive role models who have turned their lives around as I have, is key! As well as people who care and really understand a situation. I have personal experience within my family being torn apart due to knife crime as well as family members in and out of jail, unemployment and unable to break the cycle due to victim status.",
        "background": "Due to lack of provision, cuts to the youth services knife crime has increased. More youth workers on the street, working with children and young people in schools listening to their voices. Providing emergency money for stop and search will only create further breakdown in relationships with police",
