        "additional_details": "The UK Expert Committee on Pesticides (ECP) & Health & Safety Executive (HSE) agree Metaldehyde is an unacceptable risk to birds & mammals. Alternative pesticides containing ferric phosphate, provide effective control of invertebrates without carrying the same risks to wildlife.\r\nAs a Hedgehog rescue, we regularly have to deal with Hogs poisoned from Metaldehyde. Hedgehogs are on the edge of extinction. Allowing the use of this chemical will further decimate theirs & other wildlife numbers!",
