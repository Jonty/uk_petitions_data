        "additional_details": "Carrying on from the background, we also don't need to know poems, questions 2+3+4 in english language papers etc. We need to know how to buy a house with a mortgage and if we can afford it. We don't need abstract maths. If we choose to do engineering or architecture at college or uni, we'd get taught pythagoras there. For a lot of the jobs that teenagers now want to do, we don't need all this stuff we're being taught. We need life skills and more sex education, not trigonometry or geometry.",
        "background": "Children in primary and secondary schools aren't taught what they need to be taught in order to survive. Adults say; \"Wait until you get into the real world,\" but they have no idea what it'll be like, and when they do they won't know how to survive. We need to know interest, tax etc. Not pythagoras.",
