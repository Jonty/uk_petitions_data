        "additional_details": "Pigs, the 4th most intelligent animal in the world after dolphins and chimpanzees, are beaten and live in boxes not big enough to move. Male chicks are thrown into blenders still alive. The list is endless.\r\n\r\nRecent studies and the growing attention into the meat packing industry has now told us meat is as carcinogenic as smoking cigarettes.\r\n\r\nMy aim is to educate children, at schools and colleges, to make them aware of what they eat and give them the choice of the lives they wish to lead.",
        "background": "We are raised eating meat products including dairy, from a young age with no understanding of where these products come from, continually detaching us from the amount of lives we consume daily and how unvoluntarily we are encouraging the torture and cruelty animals have endured for years.",
