Nursing staff in hospitals, often wrongly assume patients submitted in a mental health crisis are drunk or on drugs, and treat them with little to no care or importance. Many Pyhscatrists in Community Teams, are not educated in all Mental Health illness', thus making it impossable for them to provide standard levels of care. Standards needs to rise, to save lives.",
