        "additional_details": "Our great country is one of the founders of modern democracy.  Our self serving corrupt politicians are destroying the very thing that many brave men and women have fought for and paid the ultimate sacrifice. We owe it to them and our children to continue that fight to ensure that democracy lives on. Even if you voted to remain in Europe, you must agree that truth, justice and democracy is what makes this great nation stand out. Please sign this petition",
        "background": "Parliament is subverting democracy. The majority of the British people voted to leave the EU. There was no mention on the ballot that states only leave if we have a deal. We voted to leave so with or without a deal, we must leave on the 29th March. No delays",
