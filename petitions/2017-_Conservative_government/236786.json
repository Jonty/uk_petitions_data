        "additional_details": "Paramedics, Doctors and Nurses are the forefront of the NHS, they have difficult jobs to do and with no support from the government.  I believe that there are a great deal of talented bright young people who simply cannot afford to go to University and as usual the poorer members of society cannot afford to follow their dreams.  My daughter had to take a 2 year gap to be able to save money to go to University.  She is very cautious with her money and we are unable to support her financially.",
        "background": "My daughter is in her first year as a Student Paramedic, she already has debts totalling approximately \u00a314,000 for her 1st year and this will every year for a total of 3 years.  NHS staff, Doctors, Nurses and Paramedics should not have to have these kinds of debts as they are benefiting the country.",
