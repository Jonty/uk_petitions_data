        "additional_details": "The other 50% of the pupils in this country attend Local Authority schools where we have significantly less choice about what we teach.  In academies and independent schools, the requirements are simply that they create and deliver a 'broad and balanced curriculum'.  We want the same opportunity so that we can give our children exactly what they need and move with the times.",
        "background": "Children in Local Authority (LA) schools are being held back by National Curriculum requirements which do not apply to the 50% of the country's children who attend academies.  LA schools want to prepare our children for the future with relevant learning and so need these outdated limitations lifted.",
