        "additional_details": "Studies have shown patching up roads to be 10 times more expensive in the long run than resurfacing entire stretches.\r\n\r\nPlease sign this petition if you too have had enough and think it is time the funding of road maintenance was subject to a serious debate in Parliament in attempt to bring the road network of the UK to a standard where it is actually fit for purpose rather than the national embarrassment, safety hazard to road users and barrier to economic growth that it currently is.",
        "background": "The UK is the 9th richest country in the world by GDP however a recent survey of the standard of its road network placed it 27th behind such countries as Namibia and Ecuador. The problems represent chronic under investment in crucial infrastructure.",
