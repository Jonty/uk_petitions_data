        "action": "Stop food retailers from requiring plastic drink bottles to complete meal deals",
        "additional_details": "In the UK alone, 700,000 plastic bottles are littered daily, with only 43% recycled each year. With an estimated 5.25bn pieces of plastic in our oceans, it is imperative to greatly reduce our nation's consumption of plastic. Limiting the amount of plastic bottles bought from food retailers will aid initiatives already in progress, such as the straw ban and the DRS. These efforts will all contribute to the government's vow to eliminate avoidable plastic waste by 2048.",
        "background": "I propose that food retailers offering 'Meal Deals' (a discounted lunch option usually consisting of a sandwich, snack and drink) must allow consumers to opt out of including a bottled drink to complete the deal. This could discourage 1000s of consumers buying plastic bottles on a daily basis.",
