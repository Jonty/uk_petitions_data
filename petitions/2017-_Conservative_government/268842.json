        "additional_details": "The postal voting system should only be used for those voters who cannot for legitimate reasons vote in person. However, clearly that are cases where voters who are physically capable of voting in person choose the postal voting system for nefarious reasons. \r\nThe Electorial Commission knows this but has done nothing to prevent this abuse. It means that if the abuse is widespread enough the outcome of a close result at a general election could result in a fraudulent government being formed.",
