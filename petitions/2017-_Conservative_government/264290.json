        "additional_details": "Plans announced today (10/06/19), to remove free licences to all over 75's (unless means tested) is another fundamental reason the continuation of this licence fee should be reassessed. It's about time that we have our say to abolish this payment that allows them to dictate the amount of fee we pay every year. If this was a company on the Stockmarket, then us the public would be the shareholder, its about time we the public are allowed our voice to be heard",
        "background": "The BBC still have a strong hold on all of Britain, with charging us a Tax for having a TV, Broadband and mobile devices.In a time where the choice of channels and ways of viewing them have advanced so significantly, this licence fee stands out as being both unfair and completely outdated.",
