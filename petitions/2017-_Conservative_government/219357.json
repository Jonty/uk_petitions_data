        "additional_details": "Carnie has been behind a number of pointless changes he manages to justify such as Chris Evans is payed some \u00a320 million and is \u201cworth it\u201d on account he brings \u201c10 million listeners\u201d yet Wogan was paid 800k per year and brought 8 Million listeners... Evans dreams of having an ounce of Wogan\u2019s talent yet Carnie manages to justify numerous questionable expensive appointments without any recourse. Enough is enough, time for him to go.",
        "background": "With Simon Mayo\u2019s Drive Time team broken up and a long lasting show destroyed, this is the last in a long catalogue of errors by Carnie.  Enough is enough, this is OUR BBC and Lewis Carnie and the rest have a duty to serve the listeners and our needs, not dictate them. I call for him to be fired.",
