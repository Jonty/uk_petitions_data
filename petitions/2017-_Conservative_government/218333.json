        "action": "UK Government to work with the devolved assemblies to create UK free bus travel",
        "additional_details": "Many people aged 60 and over struggle to pay the cost of bus travel. It makes sense to bring in a UK standard for all .This would also help with road congestion and therefore help to reduce pollution from car emissions. It should also improve bus services due to the extra demand by this age group.  Many other countries  actively promote the use of public transport to free up congested roads especially with  Hydrogen and Electric powered public transport.Cleaner air makes  a better environment",
        "background": "Those who are 60 years and over can get free bus travel in Wales Scotland Northern Ireland and London while the rest of UK citizens have to pay. This surely is unfair on those of us who rely on bus travel for work and leisure in England. Please sign this petition to bring in a national standard",
