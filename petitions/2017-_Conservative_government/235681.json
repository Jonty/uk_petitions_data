        "background": "The UK Government has a target to recycle 50% of all household waste by 2020.  A recent report showed that we recycled less in 2016-17 than in 2011-12.  Is there any wonder that the general public is recycling less when local borough councils are imposing charges on residents for replacement bins.",
