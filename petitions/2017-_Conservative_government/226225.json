        "additional_details": "The people of Blaenau Gwent have taken too much now. Something needs to be done. \r\n\r\nThe glaring differences between two counties side by side have many historical causes. There\u2019s no magic fix. But drive out of BG and the roads acts as just one example of better run councils and the impact they have on the people in them. \r\n\r\nBGCBC and its bully boy mentality has failed its people and we want change. We wish to merge (or be taken over by) Monmouthshire and to receive a dignified service.",
        "background": "We the unsersigned have had enough of the inadequate service from Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council. \r\n\r\nWith council tax levels that are some of the highest levels in the country, the service levels received are shocking inadequate. From potholes to recycling and refuse services we want change.",
