You can find out more here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.nhsemployers.org/tchandbook/part-2-pay/section-3-overtime-payments\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Nursing has also published information about NHS terms of employment, including overtime pay rates, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.rcn.org.uk/employment-and-pay/nhs-conditions-of-employment\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
