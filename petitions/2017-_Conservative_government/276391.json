        "additional_details": "UK signed UNCRC in 1989, this is the world's most signed Treaty, we have a duty in international law to uphold its provisions.\r\n \r\nChildren have a RIGHT to be consulted under Article 12 of the Convention. Although the Convention is not incorporated into UK law, it is a binding Treaty obligation. The Government should therefore open a consultation for children looking at the effect that Brexit will have on them.  Parliament must not make a final decision until they have been consulted. Brexit is the biggest decision in their lives, it will affect them longer/more than anyone else living in the UK.",
        "background": "Signing the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UK Government has agreed to consult all UK Children in \"all matters affecting\" them, their views \"being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child\". This has not happened re BREXIT, which affects all their futures.",
