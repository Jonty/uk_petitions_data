        "additional_details": "This is often done to be in control and never in the child's best interest unless there is a risk to that child then no parent should be able to withhold contact from their child.\r\nTo many children grow up believing the father didn't care or left them when in reality the mother has gone above and beyond to deny access. This needs to stop and should be deemed as a crime. If the relationship didn't work that is no reason to not allow the child to have a relationship with the other parent.",
        "background": "When parents separate often the children involved become part of a custody battle.\r\nMore often then not the parent that the child resides with uses the children to control the other parent, they decide when they can and cannot see the child or they decide that they cannot see the child at all.",
