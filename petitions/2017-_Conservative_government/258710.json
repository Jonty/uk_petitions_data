        "additional_details": "The current law states that you have to register while living in the country at an address in the UK or have been a citizen living abroad who has been registered within the UK in the last 15 years. Many western nations allow all citizens to vote no matter where they live. Due to the fact that the actions of Parliament affect all British citizens, especially those living in the EU, we demand that all British Citizens, no matter their location, have the right to vote.",
        "background": "People in Parliament have said that the 2016 referendum represented the will of the people. However, millions of citizens live outside of the UK and had no voice in a matter that may affect us more than those living in the UK. That's not democracy in action.",
