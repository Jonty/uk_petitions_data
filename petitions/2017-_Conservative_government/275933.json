        "additional_details": "This happens in a lot of cases and effectively is not compensated for within the current laws.\r\nIt could be included within the law on a sliding scale so that it was within the interests of both parties to settle quickly. \r\nAs in a lot of cases many people are forced to contribute to a mortgage on a home they can no longer live in, in the form of credit because either party cannot afford to buy a party out. This is effectively punishing stuck parties.",
        "background": "I would like to bring to you're attention the growing problem of people who's lives are on hold effectively not being able to move forward.\r\nLike myself a innocent party after divorce stuck on a mortgage. This creates a growing financial disparity and needs to be accounted for in law.",
