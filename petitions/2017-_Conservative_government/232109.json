        "action": "Increase firework restrictions to prevent use during daytime.",
        "additional_details": "At approximately 9:20am on 05/11/2018 two fireworks were set off, causing my rescue lurcher, Harry, to panic and run away. Around one hour later he was hit by a train and killed. He was a well behaved dog who was out in daylight in a familiar area, and he would still be alive today had these fireworks not been set off.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that many members of the public enjoy fireworks, and believe that only allowing use at night - when visibility is better - is a reasonable compromise.",
        "background": "Fireworks can cause distress to many domestic and wild animals, in addition to affecting those with anxiety disorders and asthma.\r\nI propose increasing the firework time restrictions to allow their use only after dark to allow those affected by them to plan their daily activities without fear.",
