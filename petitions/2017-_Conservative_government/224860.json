        "additional_details": "To charge an EV currently requires one to be a member of a variety of different clubs with different schemes and maybe club cards in order to access charging power points. I usually charge at home but recently tried charging at a charging point but failed. I had installed Polar instants on my phone with credit but either I didn't have mobile data access or the polar servers weren't working but I was unsuccessful. Fortunately I just had enough charge to limp home.",
        "background": "Make all charging stations accept credit or debit cards or maybe cash with no prior membership. The cost per kWh should also be displayed in the same way as fuel prices are displayed on forecourts. EV uptake will be significantly improved if owners know they can easily charge anywhere.",
