        "action": "Defend and support schools encouraging acceptance of LGBT people",
        "additional_details": "The Equality Act requires schools to promote inclusion and acceptance between people of different characteristics. This is a vital part of our society's equality and human rights framework, and helps us forge a better society in which all may fully contribute. An attack on this framework is ultimately an attack on us all. Weak guidance and half-hearted support from central government has left many schools and teachers badly exposed. Robust backing must be given to schools in this important area.",
        "background": "Schools are facing increasing attacks from those who object to them encouraging acceptance of LGBT people. This is despite state funded schools being rightly obliged to do this. Schools urgently require greater moral and regulatory support in undertaking these duties.",
