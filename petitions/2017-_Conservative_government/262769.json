        "additional_details": "I have found evidence of cats, foxes and birds getting stuck to these horrible glue traps from which they cannot get away. They are stuck until they die. The RSPCA ask anyone seeing glue traps on sale to email them with the shop address, date seen and if known, the shop manager's name. Any animal caught on a glue trap suffers an agonising, slow death and such instruments of torture have no place in a civilised society. Their sale and use needs to be banned.",
        "background": "I run a small cat rescue and I was feeding strays in a back alley when I was horrified to see a mouse writhing in agony, stuck fast to a glue trap. I rushed him to the vets where a vet nurse was able to free the mouse but many animals and birds get stuck and die a horrific, lingering death.",
