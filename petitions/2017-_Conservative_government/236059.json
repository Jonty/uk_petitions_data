        "action": "Stop cross bordering licensing for Hackney and Private Hire in the UK",
        "additional_details": "Enforcement of these licenses becomes more difficult when drivers are working on areas other than that which they are licensed in. \r\nMany drivers rely on school and council contracts for regular income and cross bordering allows for drivers to tender for work from the council area they are working in but not from where they are licensed. This means proper checks may not be possible of these drivers and may cause public safety issues.",
        "background": "Cross bordering is allowing a large amount of people to license a vehicle and a driver with one authority and then work in any area of the country they wish, possibly without having any local knowledge of the area at all. Poor service lowering os standards and public safety are issues here.",
