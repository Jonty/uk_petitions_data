        "additional_details": "Despite being a British citizen, I am currently paying \u00a320,000 per year to attend Durham University. \r\n\r\nThe Department for Education justifies this by claiming British Citizens who have lived abroad have no access to public funds when they return to the UK, but there is no equivalent barrier to benefits, the NHS, or similar means of public funds. \r\n\r\nThis is a call to end the discrimination, not a request to access the Students Loan Company. This is a demand to be treated as equal.",
        "background": "Currently, a British citizen must live in the UK for the 3 years before starting university. This discriminates against citizens who have lived abroad. \r\n\r\nThe loose fee-status specifications allow for different institutions to classify the same student as an international and a home student.",
