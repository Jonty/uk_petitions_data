        "additional_details": "Having become aware of establishments that are allowed to stay open despite having a low FSA score and potentially putting the general public at risk due to their lack of management skills, hygiene & food safety, there now is a serious need for the system to be looked at.\r\nAt present anyone can open a food outlet, whether it be a restaurant, cafe, takeaway, outside catering or a bakery, with only the requirement of a certificate; which can easily be obtained online. Whilst this promotes & aids businesses, it also opens the floodgates to public safety. The training would be at the cost of the business. It would create jobs as well as assisting the businesses in gaining the scores that they should have & maintain high standards in the food industry & public safety.",
        "background": "We want the law changed in that all food establishments who score below a 3 on a hygiene inspection by the FSA, are required to take on an outside agency to retrain staff and owners. Should their scores not improve following training, then they should be closed down.",
