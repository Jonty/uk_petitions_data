We also need recycling bins in classrooms because the amount of paper, packaging and other recyclable items that are thrown into the waste bin is astounding. Let's make it the law that all classrooms and designated eating areas within schools have recycling bins.",
        "background": "I am a teenager passionate about the environment. A significant amount of food and drink available to buy in schools are packaged in plastic or paper. Paper and most plastics are recyclable, however many schools do not provide recycling facilities to allow staff and students to recycle these items.",
