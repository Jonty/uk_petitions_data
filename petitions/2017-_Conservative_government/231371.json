        "additional_details": "Non-EEA citizens who are victims of domestic violence can apply for indefinite leave to remain by virtue of having been a victim of domestic violence, regardless of employment status in the UK.\r\n \r\nThese rights do not apply to EEA nationals.  They can only qualify for settled status if they are workers, or family members of a foreign worker. This does not protect victims adequately, especially if they have been prevented from working due to coercive and controlling behaviour.",
        "background": "To date, UK immigration legislation offers protection for victims of domestic violence who hold a non-European passport. There are no easements for victims who hold a European passport, if the perpetrator was British. I believe this is in breach of art 14 ECHR, freedom from discrimination.",
