The costs to the taxpayer and impacts outlined in the Yellowhammer plans should have been estimated and presented for both the Leave and Remain options before going to vote. I propose greater levels of analysis are performed and published for future referendums to restore faith in this being a truly democratic and informed decision making vehicle.",
        "background": "The British public is only now starting to see Government information on the true costs and impacts of the last referendum result. Analysis should have been published for both options to support an informed vote beforehand. It is nonsensical to enact a decision made before the facts were known.",
