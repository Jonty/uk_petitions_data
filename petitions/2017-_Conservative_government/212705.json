        "additional_details": "Following a freedom of information request to Highways England, it was confirmed that from 01/09/15 to 01/09/16 there were 16,934 incidents recorded on the M5 between Exeter & Gloucester, of which 3,547 resulted in full or partial closure, equating to an average of 10 accidents per day. The smart M42 motorway has resulted in no fatalities, reduced injury accidents by over 50%, and journey reliability improving by 22% since 2006, delivering major socio-economic benefits which could be replicated.",
        "background": "Somerset Chamber of Commerce has long campaigned for better road infrastructure. The M5 is one of two main arterial routes into the South West.
