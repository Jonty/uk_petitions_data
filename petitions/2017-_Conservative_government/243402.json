        "additional_details": "Vaccines not only protect the individual vaccinated, but the surrounding people too. For example if someone was allergic to the vaccine and could not be immunised they would be at risk from the disease. So people who are vaccinated cannot pass it on to them keeping them safe.\r\n\r\nFurthermore many people say that vaccines cause autism, that is false information, based on outdated, biased, research by a scientist who used this for personal gain and profit.\r\n\r\nAnd, vaccines are not toxic.",
