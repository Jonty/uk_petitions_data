        "additional_details": "In 2014 Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless set a precedent that a seat should be contested when a Member changes party (Clacton and Rochester by-elections). Members who have recently joined The Independent Group now stand on a different platform to the manifesto they presented to voters in 2017, and at present there is no means for their constituents to express their consent or rejection of this change. (See: https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/independent-group-mps-refuse-face-14026674)",
        "background": "At present there is no requirement for MPs to contest a by-election when they leave or change their party mid-Parliament. The Independent Group have declined to give their constituents the opportunity to respond to their actions. It is fair that voters should be asked if they want a by-election.",
