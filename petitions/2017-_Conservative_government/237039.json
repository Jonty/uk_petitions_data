        "additional_details": "With homelessness on the rise and even news reports about children picking food out of their school bins (BBC), the right to food is needed more than ever.  \u00a317 billion of food is thrown away in the UK (WRAP) yet many still go hungry.  By passing similar legislation to that of France, who now place fines and prison sentences on those who throw away unsold food, we can tackle our hunger problem.",
        "background": "Supermarkets should be required to donate any unsold food to charities in order to relieve hunger across the country.  Millions go to sleep hungry every night so by donating unsold food it would increase the well-being of many citizens.",
