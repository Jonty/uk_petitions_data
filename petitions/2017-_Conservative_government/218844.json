        "additional_details": "This is not a swipe at Gareth Southgate. He has managed to get England to the World Cup finals in Russia. But how many England fans, in their heart of hearts, really believe that he can win the thing?\r\n\r\nArsene has won England's premier cup competition in 3 of the last 4 years. The players he would be managing are better than those he currently coaches. I am a Tottenham Hotspur supporter so can claim no bias. Arsene is of such undeniable class of manager that England fans could rally behind.",
        "background": "English football fans have put up with second best for too long. From tournament to tournament we have had to endure mediocre management of a historic national team. We have some of the best players on the planet but we need someone to fuse them into a cup-winning force. Arsene Wenger is that man.",
