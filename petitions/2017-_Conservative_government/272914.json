        "additional_details": "The people of the UK voted by majority to leave the EU. The Government has had 3 years to prepare for leaving and it is time to do so. \r\nClaims that the Government has no mandate for a No Deal exit may have some truth however the Government has no mandate for a Deal exit either, nor does it have a mandate to continue seeking extensions.\r\nThe Government simply has a mandate to get the UK out of the EU and how it does this should be left to the Government without any further delays.",
        "background": "The Government should not be allowed to seek any further extensions to the Brexit deadline of October 31st. If any new legislation is passed forcing the Government to seek a further extension then it should be disregarded. The UK will leave the European Union with or without a deal on October 31st.",
