        "additional_details": "People with diabetes are at greater risk for dental problems.\r\n\r\nThey're more likely to have infections of their gums and the bones that hold their teeth in place, because diabetes can reduce the blood supply to the gums.\r\n\r\nHigh blood sugar may also cause dry mouth and make gum disease worse. Less saliva can allow more tooth-decaying bacteria and plaque buildup.",
        "background": "I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in 2016. I hadn't required any dental treatment for over 10 years but suddenly felt that my gums were receding. The dentist later told me that diabetic people are very prone to gum disease. Besides free eye tests and feet checks, dental care should be included.",
