        "action": "Stop the passing of the Abortion Law in Northern Ireland",
        "additional_details": "Many people are very unhappy as this was not NI vote, it was the UK's. Why should our decisions be made for our selves. Yes we have no government but that is no exception for our laws to be decided by another parliament and by a mix of MPs from all the counties in the UK. Let me make myself clear, I support the life of the child being most important. I believe in democracy, we choose our law. A step closer to home rule? If anything that's against the Good Friday agreement.",
        "background": "The British parliament recently voted to legalise same sex marriage and abortion in Northern Ireland by a rather substantial majority. This was a vote nothing to do with the Northern Irish people and gave the people of Northern Ireland no say. Many people in NI and the UK are certainly outraged.",
