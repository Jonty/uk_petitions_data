These are obvious from the photos posted on a Dursley website. \r\nMy own official Foresters B&B,Cam, Glos and another local one, Waterend Farm have had their business seriously affected because of the under the radar competition. Suitable fire systems & parking, food hygiene regs, proper insurance will not be guaranteed to their customers. V E confirm smaller member units have decreased.",
        "background": "Visit England's accommodation standards are undermined by pop up unregulated providers. Business of approved and certificated self catering & serviced units is being depleted leading to official units potentially closing eg my own! V E is threatened. Risk to customers and neighbours can result.",
