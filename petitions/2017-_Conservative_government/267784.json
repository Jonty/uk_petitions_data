        "additional_details": "If these jobs really do require the skills of a graduate then the cost to the graduate in terms of debts must be reflected in the remuneration. We insist that any job advertised as \"graduate only\" or similar wording must have a minimum wage equivalent to \u00a310 higher per hour than the national minimum wage. \r\n\r\nIf these jobs do not really require a degree to perform then the employer must choose between their bottom line and their recruitment practices. This will then free up jobs for non-graduates.",
        "background": "Current graduates are leaving university with between \u00a330k and \u00a370k of debt. This commitment and sacrifice is rewarded with jobs at a starting salary of just a couple of pounds more than the minimum wage. Jobs which require no specialised skills yet somehow need a degree to perform, are underpaid.",
