        "action": "For the UK government to take a more leading and diplomatic role in Kashmir.",
        "additional_details": "We call upon the UK government to take a leading role in resolving the conflict. We reject Boris Johnson and Modi's claim that this is an \"internal matter\". It is an international dispute. \r\n\r\nBritain has a long history associated with India, Pakistan and Kashmir. It cannot simply turn its back when the people of Kashmir are yelling for help. \r\n\r\nThe UK government must call for an immediate independent investigation in Indian occupied Kashmir and for Kashmiris to have their own democratic choice.",
        "background": "For the last few weeks, there has been a communications blackout in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK), media blackout, human rights violations, use of pellet guns on protestors and Indian military forces depriving Kashmiris of basic freedoms. The Indian govt are violating UN resolutions and treaties.",
