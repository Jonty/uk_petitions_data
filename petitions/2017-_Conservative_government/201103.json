        "action": "Abolish universal credit return to old system!",
        "additional_details": "Once fully implemented will mean easier sanctioning forcing people to live on nothing. Housing subsidy will be time limited forcing more to be homeless. Support for childcare will be drastically cut. Disability element's cut or abolished altogether. Some rates are much lower than current benefit rates. Government has so far wasted hundreds of millions. They will save billions taking from the needy and most vulnerable in our society. This is a war against the poor. Whilst they prop up the rich!",
        "background": "New universal credit replaces JSA, income support, ESA, Housing benefit, Tax credits and working tax credits. Government says universal credit will make work pay. This is rubbish. Universal credit is about cutting the social security bill meaning millions will be worse off.",
