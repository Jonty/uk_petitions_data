It is also said to have introduced suicide bombings in Kashmir, with the first such attack taking place in 2000. It has been designated a \"terrorist\" organisation by India, the UK, US and UN. However, Masood Azhar remains at large and is reportedly based in the Bahawalpur area in Pakistan's Punjab province.",
