        "additional_details": "By allowing both parents to share child benefit the children will benefit from both homes. \r\n\r\nIf a household income is over \u00a325000 that parent should be financially stable enough to care for their children in their time and should therefore not be able to claim maintenance  from the other parent.\r\n\r\nIf a shared care arrangement is in place no maintenance should be payable, both parents should be financially responsible for the children in their time.",
        "background": "The current child benefit system means only 1 parent can receive the benefit. When co parenting parents should be able to split the payment.\r\nCurrently child maintenance can be claimed by the parent that recieves child benefit regardless of how many nights the child spends in the other parents care.",
