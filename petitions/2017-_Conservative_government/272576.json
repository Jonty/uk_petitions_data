        "additional_details": "I believe the people of this country, wherever you voted leave or remain are now feed up after 3 years of this sad saga. We had a referendum, a result, but this Parliament has simply been unable to deliver on that result. I think most people just want it done, and have get on with more important domestic issues, which are not being addressed.\r\nA General Election would let the people give a new government a mandate on how to proceed.",
        "background": "For the first time ever, tonight, the Opposition party abstained from voting for an early General Election, which they had been calling for, so effectively denying the people a vote. The government has no working majority, Parliament is in disarray and a Speaker now, not so impartial.",
