        "additional_details": "The young people of today are struggling. Prices rise whilst their wages remain the same. This makes becoming self sufficient more tedious than it has ever been. One of the biggest ways to find independance is driving. This has become increasingly difficult. I am a 20 year old who strives for independence on minimum wage and I rely on my car to retain this independance. It is a 2001 VW Polo - I pay \u00a32,500 a year to insure it. This to me, and many other people is theft and age discrimination.",
        "background": "I am writing this petition to ask the government if they will put a price cap on all car insurance premium quotes limiting them to no higher than \u00a31,500",
