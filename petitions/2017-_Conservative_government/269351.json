        "additional_details": "The law is used as a shield so if a claim is made on a persons land, it is for the land owner (defender) to prove that the claim exists. However, if the defendant does not have sufficient funds to make a defence, then the claimant will automatically win the claim by default. Even if the defendant has a good defence to prove the claim is unfounded, without the relevant costly legal assistance, he loses his land. Legal aid needs to be given to stop the abuse of power it at present allows.",
