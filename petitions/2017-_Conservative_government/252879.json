Removing SDLT makes entry into the property market easier &, as its paid on the profit element of any sale, the Sellers will have sufficed funds available from selling to pay any Capital Gains bill received. This proposal has the added benefit of reducing the incentive for cash in hand work as properly receipted works to the property can be offset against the capital gain. Increasing revenue further.",

Replacing it by extending existing Capital Gains Tax rules to primary residences would net an additional \u00a315B pa in revenue.",
