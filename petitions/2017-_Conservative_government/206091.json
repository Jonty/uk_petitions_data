        "additional_details": "Some 8 months later the Prime Minister has said she will only pay \"reasonable costs\" - not the full costs to our emergency services. This would leave our already overstretched services even moreso.\r\n\r\nAt the time we came together to support those affected, mourn our losses and support our brave emergency services. We come together now to ask the Prime Minister to reverse her decision not to fully fund the extra costs.",
