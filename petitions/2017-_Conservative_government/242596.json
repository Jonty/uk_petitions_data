        "additional_details": "Filtering is a careful and slow moving ability but people sometimes don\u2019t see the motorcyclist and ultimately could result in damage to both vehicles and a high risk of serious if not fatal injuries for the motorcyclist.\r\nI\u2019m asking for riders to be able to use the bus lanes to stay safe during heavy traffic and to be able to be seen more easily.\r\nA few bus lanes already allow them but if taxis and cyclists can use them to get to the destination quicker, could we not use them to stay safer? Thanks",
        "background": "There are huge amounts of accidents where bikers are filtering and are knocked off due to other traffic. Whilst this is legal according to the highway code, the results usually end up 50/50 to both parties.\r\n\r\nAllowing motorbikes to use bus lanes will reduce congestion and risk to everyone.",
