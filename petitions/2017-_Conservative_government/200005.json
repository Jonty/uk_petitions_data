        "action": "Give all British citizens living abroad the right to vote and dedicated MPs",
        "additional_details": "We believe that all British citizens deserve genuine representation in Parliament. British citizens living abroad must be able to vote for an MP to represent their interests in the House of Commons. Having their own dedicated MPs would more efficiently address their concerns which are often different to UK residents\u2019. This petition proposes to introduce votes for life and to add overseas constituencies with a dedicated MP for each constituency to better represent British Citizens living abroad.",
        "background": "About 1 million British citizens living abroad do not have the right to vote due to their overseas residency exceeding 15 years. They therefore lack representation in Parliament. And, British Citizens living abroad for under 15 years may only vote in a constituency they no longer live in.",
