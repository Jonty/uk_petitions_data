        "background": "The UK government is saying that they need to reserve some powers after Brexit to protect the UK single market.  But that\u2019s not necessarily true.  What they\u2019re proposing would actually damage the UK and the UK single market.  So I call on the UK to automatically devolve all of these EU powers.",
