        "action": "Abolish the Television License Fee",
        "additional_details": "This has invariably meant that the UK public is being held at ransom by an exorbitant license fee, even if they do not choose to watch the BBC's outdated content, to access any other non-BBC livestream.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Television License fee is being used for other strategic public service objectives including broadband, local television and S4C means that its objectives are misleading and it serves to endorse a postcode lottery that is not conducive to a free and fair society.",
        "background": "The BBC no longer provides objective analysis of current affairs, lags behind competitors and denies access to Lic. payers to its full archive of content. The BBC is used by lobbyists to engender issues outside of the public interest. Individuals who wish to solely watch a competitor cannot do so",
