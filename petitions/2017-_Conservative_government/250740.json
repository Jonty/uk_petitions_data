        "additional_details": "I am aware that one of the nice things about the BBC is no adverts, however, having an advert every 30 minutes or every hour is a toilet break, a tea break, even just a chance to talk about the program whilst not talking over it.\r\nI feel that it would be much better for the UK licence payers if the BBC showed these short adverts once every 30 minutes or every hour. It will allow them to reduce the licence fee and perhaps even wipe it out.\r\nI believe they should still keep BBC News advert free.",
        "background": "As a young person I feel that being forced to pay for a TV licence when all I want to do is watch ITV2 and E4 is old fashioned and unfair.\r\n\r\nI believe that the BBC should either introduce one advert every 30 minutes or every hour. This should then allow the BBC to reduce its licence fee cost.",
