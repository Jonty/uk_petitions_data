        "additional_details": "Why in today's world can you not accept that tattoos are not affiliated with crime and why can you not allow the British people who pay tax live in the country try to get by as hard as they can have them and feel they are free just like the public's choice in other areas of their life. Let me ask you this are we not accepted as people who have rights?",
        "background": "In today's generation and world as we know it tattoos are so much more common than decades earlier in young people. We have a duty in this country to protect freedom and individual expressions. Tattoos are a form of expression and there should no longer be any form of discrimination towards it.",
