        "additional_details": "The public sector is not in competition with anyone. Your local council will not be beaten by a competitor so why do we need to pay premium salaries for managerial staff. The BBC is funded by a tax in the form of licence fee so why do we need to at newsreaders \u00a3400k plus to read the news. They are not attracting advertising and it is perfectly possible to keep promoting younger journalists if they leave. The same is true for all publicly funded or supported jobs.",
        "background": "We pay the prime minister around \u00a3150k to run the country so it is both illogical and unfair to pay a council CE \u00a3160k or more for running a small budget operation with zero competition. We do not need to compete in the open market for those good enough to perform in non competitive sectors",
