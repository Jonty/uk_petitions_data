Instead, the government should hold these parties to account, and individuals, organisations, companies and sponsors who have actively supported the Brexit campaign. In the case of shortfall in tax received, loss of GDP, or increase in interest rates to support a devalued pound - these contributors must pay a one-off gift tax. It should be knows as Johnson Tax.",
        "background": "The official Brexit campaign broke electoral law using BeLeave to supersede the limits of spending in the referendum campaigns and spreading unfounded statements - these decision makers are liable to the nation. They should be made responsible and instructed to pay a one-off gift tax.",
