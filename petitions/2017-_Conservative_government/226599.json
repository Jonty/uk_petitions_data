        "additional_details": "There are at least 10 different help lines out of these 10 there are only 2 open out of hours . One of these is only voluntary based not professional help and the other is professional led but is so over run with people needing there help they can't keep up . There are millions of people suffering ,the suicide rate is higher than ever with a vast majority of these happening \" out of hours\" ie weekends evening and nights more needs to be done to take this seriously so that this doesn't happen to another loved one",
        "background": "After suffering from mental health issues and also close family members I realised that unless you are in a mental health crisis between the hours of 9 - 4.30 Monday to Friday help is few and far between unless you contact 999. The government need to fund help lines with trained professionals.",
