        "additional_details": "If an MP claims not to have knowledge of something, which can be proven otherwise, when questioned in the House, then this deception should be treated as perjury.\r\n\r\nIf an MP makes false claims in the House, in the press, radio, television or a public internet forum (Twitter, Facebook etc...), it must be treated with the same severity.\r\n\r\nNo more of these slapped wrists within the parliamentary system. A new set of criminal laws should be created and applied to these types of offences.",
        "background": "For far too long MP's have been protected from any direct consequences of deception. The House of Commons needs to become as respectable as a court room. Lying in the commons should be treated as a criminal offence, and the worst offenders should go to prison.",
