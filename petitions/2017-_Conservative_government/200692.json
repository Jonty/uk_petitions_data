        "additional_details": "We propose a simple solution: Stop the Convoys and get Dartford moving. Traffic at the Dartford Tunnel is brought to a standstill on average 100 times a day by a small number of oversized & hazardous goods vehicles which need to be escorted through the tunnel, in a convoy. \r\nEach convoy can take up to 2.5 mins to travel through the tunnel, and a tunnel is closed around every 15 mins. \r\nWhy should 99% of drivers suffer due to less than 1% of vehicles? \r\nOur suggestion is simple: Stop these oversized/hazardous vehicles using the tunnel & send them the other way around the M25.\r\n",
