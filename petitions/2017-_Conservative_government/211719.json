        "action": "Introduce mandatory 'basic life skills' lessons in secondary schools",
        "additional_details": "If these classes are introduced, hopefully such societal issues can be halved or eradicated for future generations. Insight in to the background of how a mortgage or credit card works could make a person think twice about taking on such a big decision. We are told to make one of the most instrumental decisions at age 16; our chosen career paths. However the other choices that go hand in hand with this are never spoken about, leaving people guessing and jumping in blindly.",
        "background": "Housing related, debt or money management, lack of law knowledge and basic life issues should all be taught in schools to provide the information on how they can avoid these troubles. Schools teach algebra despite very few students going on to study this further but nothing on how a mortgage works?",
