        "additional_details": "Europe has made it clear that there is no further room for negotiation and following the indicative votes in Parliament, no clear course of action is shown by the UK Parliament. Parliamentarians are too busy chasing personal and party agendas and not giving credence to the wishes of the UK people. I also believe that when the decision was made at the first referendum, we, the people were not made aware of the full implications of a Brexit decision and now, we are more aware of these.",
        "background": "A simple vote should be put to the people. 3 Options. Leave with a no deal Brexit, leave with Teresa May\u2019s deal, do not leave and revoke Article 50. This petition can also be signed by those not yet able to vote but who will be directly affected by the decision in future years.",
