        "additional_details": "As a mum to a 3 year old son attending Plym Bridge Nursery School I have to stand on Miller Way twice a day and attempt to cross the road. I have my 4 month old daughter strapped to my chest, nursery bags in one hand and holding my toddlers hand. We have to wait for a safe break in traffic to cross and we are often stood with other parents attempting to do the same. This can sometimes take up to 10 minutes as traffic is heavy and going above 20mph. A safe way to cross this road would help us all",
        "background": "Outside of Tor Bridge School, Primary and Plym Bridge Nursery School and Day Care there is no safe place to cross for pupils and anyone taking children on a school run. Miller Way is becoming increasingly busier at peak times and speed limits are not being adhered to. This road is becoming dangerous",
