        "additional_details": "We have all seen and heard about the damaging effects that climate change is having on our planet, therefore we should all be doing whatever we can to help save our planet. Not just for us, but for our future generations. The Sun is our biggest source of natural energy, so it just doesn't make sense to me that we are still destroying our planet because we are still so heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy. The time has come to stop trying to convince people that climate change is real. The time has come to start making big changes. This is our planet, our only home; so we have a collective responsibility to help save it. \u00a0\u00a0",
