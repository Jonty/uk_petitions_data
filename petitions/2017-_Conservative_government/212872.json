        "action": "Permit all public universities to test cannabis for medical use",
        "additional_details": "Cannabis has been shown to improve the endurance of cancer patients and to improve the experiences of those with chronic pain.  Cannabis has also been shown to be minimally addictive and minimally harmful to health, whilst the debate over its social detriments has contained more heat than light.  The way to put this to bed, one way or the other, is to let the academics test it and find out exactly what it does.  We permit tests on other classes of drugs including opiates, why not cannabis?",
        "background": "Cannabis is widely believed to have broad medical applications, and there is solid evidence to support some of these. We cannot know the true extent without research. It seems obvious that the current restriction is based on ideology rather than evidence, and this stance is academically unacceptable",
