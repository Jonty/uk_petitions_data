        "additional_details": "It has been proven that deliberate lies were also told. The 'red bus' detailing money we would save and campaigners breaking the law.\r\n\r\nWe don't think that a further referendum can sort this problem out now because what also exacerbated informed decision was that many people were blaming UK problems on the EU when they were really a result of unfair tory policies. The whole thing has been an utter shambles. We need to give the choice back to the public, for a chance to elect a new government.",
        "background": "In-depth research was not done before a referendum on leaving the EU was put to the public.  A well-researched plan and  implications of leaving should have been fully explained in a leaflet to all households.  Due to incompetence, people were not able to base their decision on the full facts.",
