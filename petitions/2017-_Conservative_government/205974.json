        "action": "Animal Sentience as set out in the Lisbon Treaty to be enshrined in UK law",
        "additional_details": "Following a parliamentary debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill, MPs voted to reject the inclusion of a crucial clause that would transfer the recognition of animal sentience into UK law, so that animals would continue to be recognised as sentient beings under domestic law post-Brexit. Despite what MPs have said about this decision, the British Veterinary Association and Veterinary Surgeons around the country are extremely concerned that a majority of MPs have voted-down this seminal clause.",
        "background": "Enshrining animal sentience in UK law would acknowledge animals as being capable of feelings such as pain and fear. It's a founding principle of animal welfare and the government must maintain current standards so that the UK will continue to be respected for our high standards of animal welfare.",
