        "additional_details": "It is registered in Lithuania and causes destruction all over the globe, and has been banned from other waters due to its destructive nature. I have tracked this ship using AIS.\r\nThere are marine conservation areas along this coast which seems a pointless exercise as this grotesque vessel can catch and process 18,000 tonnes of our precious commodity.\r\nFish caught on this vessel will not be landed at a UK port. This ship is a travesty and needs banning to preserve our fish stocks.",
        "background": "At the time of starting this petition the super trawler \"Margiris\" is operating some 20 miles off the south coast in the English Channel and has been working this area for four days previous to this petition.  This ship is the 2nd largest fishing vessel in the world with a capacity (hold) of 18000T.",
