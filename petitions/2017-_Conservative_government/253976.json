        "additional_details": "Article 17 [ex. 13] has faced harshed criticism from all sorts of people, including human rights experts, tech experts, CEOs of major platforms and the creator of the World Wide Web itself. These people are aware of the potential unintended consequences Article 17 [ex. 13] and their warnings should not be ignored.\r\nArticle 11 wishes to tax the act of sharing the online address of an article due to the existence of previews. That is absurd, especially considering that the content shown in previews of a link is entirely in control of the owners. Furthermore, that same approach has been tried in Spain and Germany and failed in both cases as it has been proven to be hurtful to businesses.",
        "background": "The EU passed the Copyright Directive. The current text is unfit.\r\nIn particular Articles 11 and 17 [ex. 13] are very likely to limit people's right to freedom of speech and expression, fair use and censor political and peaceful conversation. This Directive should be Rejected in the EU Council Vote.",
