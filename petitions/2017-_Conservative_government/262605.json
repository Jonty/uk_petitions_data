        "additional_details": "Cases are disproportionate, and somewhat a post code lottery in respect of the severity, nature, and pursuance of said fines. The following misconception must also be placed on record for anyone wishing to sign. Teachers hide behind the legislation, citing that it is not them or their fault \u201cdon\u2019t blame us it\u2019s the local authority\u201d is a regular response. FACT. It is the head teacher of the individual school, stand in, temporary or otherwise, who is the one to personally request a parent fine.",
        "background": "The government passed legislation in 2013 to give local education authorities the power to fine and prosecute those proposed parents who take children out of school during term time. Example - for a family holiday.",
