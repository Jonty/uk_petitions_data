        "action": "Review the Law and Family Court process in relation to child contact disputes",
        "additional_details": "This process undermines the idea of equal PR and is so expensive, complicated and lengthy that many cannot understand it, do not know their rights or simply cannot afford to proceed. This means that in practice our system marginalises and disadvantages a large section of our society and places the responsibility and burden of proof on the victim. I would like the Government to; consider how we could reform our current system and how we can deter parents from unnecessarily stopping contact by discussing areas such as compensation, financial reimbursement and in some cases criminal proceedings.",
        "background": "Our current Family Court system is extremely flawed and allows one parent (most frequently Mothers) to stop contact between a child and their other parent without any clear safeguarding concerns or justification, with the emphasis then placed on the aggrieved parent to challenge this in Court.",
