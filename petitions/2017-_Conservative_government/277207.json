        "additional_details": "Reducing the black box premium will allow more young drivers to be able to afford insurance which allows them to continue improving their own driving skill as well as developing safer driving patterns by the monitoring of the black box, however most young drivers aren't able to get close to affording insurance which would allow them to get the experience needed for them to become safer and more observant drivers.\r\nMany European insurers provide much lower cost insurance policies than UK based.",
        "background": "The legal age to drive in the United Kingdom is 17 years old, many teenagers will being driving at the same age or shortly after, many insurance companies will inflate the premium for younger drivers which prevents them from being able to drive, even with a black box, the premium is too high for us.",
