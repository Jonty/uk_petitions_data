        "additional_details": "The Prime Minister's deal has been rejected. No further deal is available from the EU, the UK faces an uncertain future after leaving on 31st October, still with no agreement on how we are supposed to leave. Parliament must be involved in all stages of the Brexit process. I do not believe the British people voted to leave to make themselves poorer or to allow a few to control our sovereign parliament. There must be no attempt to prorogue parliament.",
        "background": "People voted to take back control and return sovereignty to our parliament which in fact always was sovereign, but there are proposals to prorogue parliament in order to thwart attempts to delay or reverse the UK leaving the EU on 31st October.",
