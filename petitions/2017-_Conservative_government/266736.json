        "action": "Require all uk schools to have recycling bins.",
        "additional_details": "24% of waste in schools is recyclable paper and cardboard with 50% being food waste which can be composted. Every year we produce about 3% more waste than the year before. This might not sound much but, if we carry on at this rate, it means that we will double the amount of waste we produce every 25 years. Therefore we need to recycle to stop this extra waste going to landfill and staying for thousands of years.",
        "background": "This petition has been set up to try and tackle the problem of recycling within schools. Schools create a lot of waste and don't always manage it properly resulting in most recycling waste going to landfill. We need to put an end to this problem and start recycling within schools NOW!",
