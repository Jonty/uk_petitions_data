        "additional_details": "Such assertions were baseless in law and, without due diligence, irresponsible.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons Briefing Paper 07212 (03/06/15): \"European Union Referendum Bill 2015-16\" states in section 5 that \"[the referendum bill] does not contain any requirement for the UK Government to implement the results of the referendum\" and \"this is a type of referendum known as pre-legislative or consultative\" (meaning not instructive).\r\n\r\nNow that so much more is known, this agenda is NOT INEVITABLE.",
        "background": "David Cameron & others were motivated by party politics to make false campaign assertions that the result must be implemented no matter the cost.\r\n\r\nAll versions of Brexit are worse for the UK than the status quo of remaining in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Government must act now to protect the UK from harm.",
