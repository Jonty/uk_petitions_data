        "action": "The new sex education curriculum should explain what constitutes sexual assault",
        "additional_details": "Education secretary Justine Greening's much-needed, widely-applauded new curriculum covers consent, but doesn't specifically explain the arguably grey areas of sexual assault and harassment. Many victims of \"minor\" assaults don't understand that what they've experienced is a crime; or feel it's too common to be worth reporting. To reduce sexual assault and support the victims, we must first teach young people exactly what it is.\r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN06103\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-41633857\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sexual-harassment-poll-yougov-young-people-night-out-a7972991.html",
        "background": "Social media phenomenon #MeToo revealed the under-reported prevalence of sexual assault. The new Relationships & Sex Education curriculum, due 2019, must explain to all genders exactly what constitutes sexual assault and harassment; both to prevent it happening and encourage victims to come forward.",
