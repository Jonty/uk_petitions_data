        "action": "To legally stagger school holidays in each county in England",
        "additional_details": "This is an ongoing issue known by everyone. I think rather than sitting back and letting families struggle for years to take their kids away something should be done. It\u2019s not feasible to ask holiday companies to change prices without demand changing and the only way that can change is the government changing school holidays in England. Help families. Don\u2019t just accept how it is!!",
        "background": "The current holiday system for schools forces holiday prices up very high in current school hols as all parents want holidays at similar times. Spreading this demand out by schools having different weeks off would lower prices for families but shouldn\u2019t affect holiday companies profit. Help!!",
