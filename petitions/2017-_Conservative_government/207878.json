        "action": "PIP should be administered and decided by the NHS, not the DWP/contracting firms",
        "additional_details": "In August this year the UN criticised the UK government for its treatment of people with disability and stripping people of their livelihoods, dignity and being.  This has led to an increase of post-decision making unexplained deaths of people with disabilities. The DWP is not concerned with helping people or listening to experts on health related issues with relying on 'for profit' companies making decisions on people with disabilities.  The NHS needs to be the decision making body for PIP.",
        "background": "Currently the DWP handles the deliberation of PIP and ESA. Disability is a state of being dealing with health, not work and pensions. The decisions for any disability related payments or dictates should be handled by the government's experts (i.e. health professionals) in the NHS, not DWP.",
