        "action": "Make Food and Farming education in UK schools part of the curriculum",
        "additional_details": "Food production represents the single largest human use of land. Why is food production not part of the curriculum? The increasing influence of social media can lead to dramatic lifestyle changes and criticism, often based on myths surrounding farming practices and confusion with those which happen outside of the UK. Informed choices can only be made if food and farming education becomes part of the curriculum in all UK schools in order to deliver unbiased facts to children and young adults.",
        "background": "Children and young people are becoming more disconnected than ever from where their food comes from or how it is produced. Is it right that out of 27,500 children 1/3 thought cheese was made from plants? Additionally, 1/4 thought fish fingers were made from chicken or pork. (BBC News, 2013).",
