        "additional_details": "The majority of meat in our supermarkets is from religious slaughter sold on by stealth, unlabelled. Cast off Halal (haram meaning 'not permissible') and rejected Kosher. Those who are against religious slaughter or are forbidden to eat it, do not have an informed choice. Why not? EU codes have to be checked as a result of absent labelling to determine the slaughterhouse used. A clear and honest labelling system in place such as a colour code similar to the healthy eating symbol could suffice.",
        "background": "The law says that \"labelling must not be misleading\". There is no legal labelling system apart from Halal and kosher. Those from other religions such as Christians, Buddhist, Sikhs, Hindu and many others are forbidden religiously slaughtered meat. Clear, honest labelling is therefore required.",
