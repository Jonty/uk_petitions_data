The country taken to war! Most of this is due to the effectivity of the party whips who hold dirt on all MPs enabling them to effectively gain the MPs vote. Therefore it very often is not a free vote on the MPs conscience for the will of their electorate. Tradition is good but the must be some change.",

Party Whipping, in order to effectively blackmail MPs to make them vote the way the party whip sees fit or lose their job or station perhaps prison.",
