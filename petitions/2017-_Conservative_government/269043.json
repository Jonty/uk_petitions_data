        "additional_details": "I propose that next to the food hygiene or trust pilot rating, business should be made to display a rating out of 5 stars indicating the proportion of tax paid in the UK.\r\n \r\nThis could be a really effective way of persuading big businesses to revaluate their tax strategy without legislating for it. If some big chain stores displayed a 1* rating for their tax hygiene levels, people would then have a choice between that and, say, a 5* rated independent chain. At the moment, it is very difficult to know whether your hard earned money is going back into helping fund the NHS and education, or is off lining the pockets of shareholders. It would be excellent to have that choice.\r\n",
