        "additional_details": "1. Fixing Easter to the calendar will improve all aspects of school term planning and thus vacation planing both for visitors and those in provision. This will also provide good separation from the May Bank Holidays thus encouraging two distinct visitor periods.\r\n\r\n2. BST is currently 1 hour plus from GMT which is welcome but the additional daylight is at the wrong end of the day. BST plus 2 would be of great benefit to the evening economy, the environment, mental and physical health.",
        "background": "Working in the Visitor Economy and as part of Visit Cornwall a Destination Management Organisation it has become clear that there are two simple things that could be done to improve both quality of life and the economy. Firstly fix Easter to the third week of March & secondly makes BST + 2",
