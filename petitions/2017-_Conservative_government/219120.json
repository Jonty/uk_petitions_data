        "additional_details": "In its official EU referendum pamphlet, the Government said: \"This is your decision.The Government will implement what you decide\". Continued membership of the EU Single Market or Customs Union would clearly not deliver the decision of the referendum to take back control of our laws, borders and money paid into the EU budget. The Government should reject lobbying by any MPs and overseas billionaires who are refusing to recognise and respect the clear democratic verdict of the EU referendum.",
        "background": "In June 2016 people voted by a majority of 1.2 million for the UK to leave the EU. The messages of the Leave campaigns were clear - take back control of our laws, borders & billions in public money paid into the EU budget. The Brexit deal being negotiated with the EU must respect this clear verdict.",
