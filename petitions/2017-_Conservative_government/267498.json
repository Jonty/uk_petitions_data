        "additional_details": "Many councils are now looking at electric buses and other zero emission forms of transport. They are also looking to charge drivers, of petrol & diesel vehicles, a daily fee to drive on their roads. Electric vehicle are exempt. Meanwhile, Formula 1 is allowed to produce as many emissions as it likes, all in the name of money! \r\n\r\nSadly, there will be no \u2018planet B\u2019. The Government must act now! Formula E has existed for a number of years now and plans to come to London in Season 6.",
        "background": "As the United Kingdom looks to reduce the amount of emissions it produces, before eventually becoming \u2018net zero\u2019 in carbon emissions in 2050, we need to start looking at all none essential producers of carbon emissions.",
