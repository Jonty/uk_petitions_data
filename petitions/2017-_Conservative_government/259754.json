        "action": "Brands that use palm oil to show pictures on packaging of deforestation",
        "additional_details": "Cigarette packaging has health warnings and graphic images so humans understand what they are doing to themselves. Why can't brands show what they are doing to animals and other innocent people by using 'dirty palm oil'. For example, a picture of a baby orangutan being brutally killed by a forest fire or the damage it will do from destroying the trees. We have 12 years to save the earth and many people are not aware of the real issues, let them be aware.",
        "background": "Animals are being killed, the size of a football pitch is gone every 25 seconds and local people are loosing their homes. Palm oil plantations are now thought to cover more than 27 million hectares. Brands that are using Palm Oil should use packaging with pictures of what they are doing to the globe",
