        "additional_details": "Since the BBC Panorama 8 years ago, little has changed. Everyone, disabled or not, have the basic right to dignity and safety. We implore the government to create local, smaller, and 'personalised' residential homes within the communities - where parents/carers have easy and quick access to visit whenever necessary. More money should be invested into vetting, training and managing the staff at the residential homes, in order to provide optimum care for the most vulnerable groups in our society.",
        "background": "Following the recent and harrowing scandal of Whorlton Hall, it is about time the government work together with the disabled, carers, and health professionals to create a safer and better care environment for the disabled. The government must act now, to stop abuse against the disabled.",
