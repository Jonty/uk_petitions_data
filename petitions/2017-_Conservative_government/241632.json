        "additional_details": "There is numerous social media groups who advise on dealing with the Dwp and these assesments, many people are rejected who then have to ask the Dwp for a mandatory reconsideration and even after all this having to appeal , with the majority of applicants winning at this stage, costing more money than is saved for Dwp, due to court costs. Taking advantage of the most vulnerable in society, by making the process long winded and stressful. This needs to change.",
        "background": "For pip applications, the Dwp use private firms for assessing disabilities they generally go by these very short assessments, rather then seek medical evidence from medical professionals involved in the individual cases, with many people being rejected for the pip benefit, who after appeal win.",
