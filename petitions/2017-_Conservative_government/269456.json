        "additional_details": "Glasgow was the first Scottish city to introduce a cap on private hire car and taxi licenses. Scotland has this law in place, council has the powers to cap. \r\n\r\nWe already have too many private hire plates, it's causing issue with our air quality, traffic and saftey issue, drivers working long hours to make ends meet. Because of too many cars, Hackney has a cap so it's time to change the law on private hire plates.",
        "background": "The study showed that during week days use of private hires drops, 90 percent of cars were needed on Friday and Saturday nights. Law change will give council powers to cap how many plates they issue every year.",
