        "additional_details": "1. All manifesto commitments should be considered legally binding - and if the leader of a party deviates from these policies they should be held in contempt and personally subject to legal ramifications such as appropriate jail term. A new party leader should then be selected by a voting majority of Party Members\r\n\r\nMaking this policy law will mean that any and all future governments will be forced to up hold democracy by law and be forced to stand by the policies they were elected on.",
