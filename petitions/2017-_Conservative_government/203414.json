        "additional_details": "So far, the EU has refused to discuss the mutually beneficial matters of trade and cooperation until they have agreed a financial settlement which, they claim, will cover UK's past, present and future commitments to EU finances. The UK recognises that it has some financial obligation.  But, by insisting on a precise financial settlement as the precurser to trade agreements, the EU is  frustrating, a mutually beneficial settlement.  This procedural delay detrimental to long-term UK interests.",
        "background": "In June 2016 the UK electorate voted by referendum to \"Leave the EU.\"  In March 2017, Parliament voted to invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.  The UK wishes to maintain a close relationship with EU, particularly in trade and and security, after leaving.  Two years are allowed for negotiations.",
