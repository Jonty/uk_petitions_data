        "additional_details": "I would like to aim to open safe places for children/teens when they are in need, I believe if a child is suffering and feels like they want to run away/can\u2019t talk to professionals about what is occurring in their life it would make it a lot easier to run to a safe environment where there is comforting people around to support them with care, a bed, food and compassion. Too many people suffer in silence, I believe this is a great way to prevent some of the awful things that our children/teens are going through.",
        "background": "I believe there are so many children/teenagers suffering in many different ways and are silenced behind closed doors and are unable to go to a comfortable safe place to stay when they are in need. There is a huge rise in homelessness, sexual abuse, mental health and much more with our children/teens",
