        "additional_details": "Parliament have shown that they are unwilling to act on the wishes and instructions of 17.4m people to deliver the UK from the stranglehold of the EU.\r\n\r\nIf that level of support can count for so little, and be so easily disregarded, what is the point of any on-line petition - which typically garners a few hundred thousand signatures at best?\r\n\r\nParliament are not interested in the opinions of the public and therefore the petitions scheme should be closed as it is simply a waste of taxpayers' money.",
        "background": "If Parliament can unilaterally decide to scrap Brexit, ignoring the express wishes of 17.4m people in a national referendum, there is no chance that anything raised in an online petition will ever drive Government opinion or legislation. The system should be scrapped as a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money.",
