        "additional_details": "There are polarising views regarding Brexit within the governing party, so it is unfair to change PM mid-term, as their agenda wont be what people voted for.\r\n\r\nWe would like an addition to the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act 2011, Section 2, stating that in times of instability, where major changes are being decided that will affect the direction and identity of the British people, a change in leadership to the governing party will automatically require a GE to seek the approval of the voting public.",
        "background": "We don't want our country to be forced to put up with a Prime Minister (PM) who wasn't leading their party at the time of the last General Election (GE), especially in times of political instability such as Brexit, or another political crisis akin to Suez, or the Falklands conflict, for example.",
