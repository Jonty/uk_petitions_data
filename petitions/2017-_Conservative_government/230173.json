        "action": "Make a law for causing serious injury by careless driving with severe penalties",
        "additional_details": "There are stiff penalties for death caused by careless driving, serious injury caused by dangerous driving but there is nothing for serious injury caused by careless driving. This is not just, people are getting away with a slapped wrist, there is no deterrent to make people think before driving carelessly. People\u2019s lives are being turned upside down and the judges are powerless to impose stiffer penalties. This has to be changed.",
        "background": "My son received catastrophic life changing injuries in a RTA. The CPS could only charge the driver with careless driving and nothing more serious. All he got was \u00a3750 fine and 8 points, the most the judge could impose. There needs to be a law for causing serious injury by careless driving.",
