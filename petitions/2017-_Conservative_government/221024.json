        "additional_details": "Britain's dependency on coal has plummeted to under 7% in 2017 compared to over 40% in 2012. The amount of coal to be taken from this site is insignificant in this context and not worth the extent of the environmental degradation and damage to health it will cause. Sajid Javid recognised that Britain is moving beyond this outdated way of thinking; James Brokenshire needs to step up and stop Durham County Council from allowing this. Coal is part of County Durham's heritage but not it's future.",
        "background": "The opencast site covers 71ha of wildlife habitats, including nesting curlews and crested newts. There is no protection from the dust for the local residents and school. The Banks group have repeatedly violated the terms of their planning permission, beginning work without completing an access road.",
