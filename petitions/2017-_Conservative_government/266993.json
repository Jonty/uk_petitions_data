        "action": "Stop TfL building rental properties on Underground station Car Parks!",
        "additional_details": "Those who need to use the Underground, including the elderly and infirm and those coming in from surrounding areas and beyond, will have greatly reduced ability to access the 21 tube stations by car. They cannot necessarily use limited bus services or bikes to get to a Station. People who live in the outer suburbs cannot always pursue their lives exclusively by bike or on foot.\r\n\r\nThese new developments would also lead to a reduction in education and health services for local residents.",
        "background": "TfL are proposing to build high-rise rental housing, in pursuance of the Mayor\u2019s London Plan and to raise finance for TFL, on and around 21 station Car Parks in London. This will drastically impact the commuting options for outer London areas and destroy local communities' access to services.",
