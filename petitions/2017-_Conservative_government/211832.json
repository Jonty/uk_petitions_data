        "additional_details": "Since 1995, more than 400 serving UK troops have killed themselves while the number of personnel suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has almost doubled since 2007 to 2,500 cases.\r\nYet, shockingly, the Government has cut back the provision of mental healthcare to the Armed Forces. Today, traumatised troops must rely on the NHS and charities for help outside office hours and at weekends.",
        "background": "The Mail on Sunday is campaigning to ensure our brave soldiers no longer suffer in silence.\r\nOur 'Helpline for Heroes' campaign calls on defence chiefs to set up a 24/7 helpline staffed by mental healthcare experts. It would cost just \u00a32million.",
