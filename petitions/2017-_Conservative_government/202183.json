        "additional_details": "When a bill is late the phone provider will send out a txt to let the customer know the payment is due. Why can't they do the same when a contract is due to end?\r\n\r\nThis is a petition to encourage all phone providers to have the same procedure when a contract is ending or due for an upgrade. This would save hard working people from paying hundreds extra for their contracts.\r\nIts totally unfair and phone providers should be forced to let customers know when their contracts are due to end or upgrade.",
        "background": "Life can get busy and for whatever reason we forget things. \r\n\r\nSo many people are unaware or forget when their phone contracts are due to end or upgrade. Because of this millions of people continue to be charged by the phone providers and end up paying so much more than they should be for services.",
