Many Judges make a decision about a parent in five minutes and base the case on little other than a feeling. A new Judge every twelve months would prevent childrens' entire childhoods being ruined by common attribution errors. Many judges simply cannot possess empathy. This is a sign of horrible cluster B personality disorders.",

More than one judge would be ideal as we are giving a lot of responsibility to one person who will make mistakes. Many judges present as having covert personality disorders. Please test them.",
