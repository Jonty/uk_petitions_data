        "background": "The Iraq war started in Mar 03, ending Apr 09. 2 months later the PM announced an inquiry that took 6 yrs.  The Afghan conflict lasted 13 yrs, so a similar inquiry might last 15 yrs, meaning it might report ~30 years after the start of the conflict.  It is time for an inquiry.",
