        "additional_details": "In many of the debates in Parliament following the EU Referendum, many MP's put the case that parliament should not presume to know better than the People of Britain.\r\nThe people of Britain are of average intelligence.\r\nMP's have a wealth of resources: access to experts, studies and all of the available information and are paid a generous salary to be appropriately informed in order to make good decisions.\r\n\r\nIf, despite all that, they remain no better than average, then they must be pretty thick.",
        "background": "Throughout the post referendum debates, parliament made the case that it does not know better than the People of Britain.\r\nIt logically follows that parliament really is a bit thick.\r\n\r\nParliament should be peopled by our brightest and best. If it is not, then we must review how it is selected.",
