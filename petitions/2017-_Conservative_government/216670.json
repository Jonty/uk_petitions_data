        "additional_details": "I have researched this condition and have found that Sepsis can be brought on by babies contracting Group B Streptococcus from the mother during labour.   I would like to see changes made through the NHS to routinely test pregnant mothers for GBS in late pregnancy,  or routinely test new born infants at birth, thus identifying the deadly potential to further develop Sepsis.\nMost mums, both during pregnancy and post pregnancy have never received NHS information on either of these deadly illnesses",
        "background": "My newborn son was diagnosed with Sepsis at 14 days old, this is a very serious condition that can cause infant fatality in hours, loss of limbs and or the body organs to shut down, it can also cause Meningitis and other serious conditions.",
