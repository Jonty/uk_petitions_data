        "additional_details": "On the 23\u02b3\u1d48 of June 2016, the UK made a (largely uninformed) decision to leave the EU, with many people voting on the basis that \u00a3350m would be sent the NHS and that we would remain in the EU single market, and it's become harrowingly apparent that neither are true. Long story short, many people based their vote to leave the EU on lies. A 2\u207f\u1d48 referendum would allow people re-evaluate their vote, using only true and sufficient information to be persuaded by. This is how a democracy should be!\u270c\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f",
        "background": "We the undersigned politely request that HM government hold a 2\u207f\u1d48 EU membership referendum, in which only true and sufficient information can be spread. In doing so, the people of Britain will be able to make a more informed decision. Have you ever made a momentous decision, without second thoughts?",
