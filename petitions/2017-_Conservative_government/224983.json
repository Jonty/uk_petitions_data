        "action": "Redesign the 'homegrown players rule' within the Premier League.",
        "additional_details": "Currently Premier League clubs are allowed a maximum of 25 players in their first-team squad, eight of them must be 'homegrown.' That's a percentage of 32%. That's less than half of the full squad must be 'homegrown'. To make things worse the term 'Home Grown' does not mean 'English', for example Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas, having come up through Arsenal's academy, is classed as a homegrown player despite being a Spain international. This gives a bleak future for English talent. It needs changing!",
        "background": "We have seen a potential within our national football team, but having fallen short we must look to improve the future by redesigning the current outdated and inaccurate 'Home Grown Players' rule to which the FA is poorly executing thus not providing a future for English talent and their experience.",
