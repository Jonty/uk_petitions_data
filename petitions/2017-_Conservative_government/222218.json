        "additional_details": "In 2017 there were 194,668 legal abortions carried out in England & Wales (ie just over 745 abortions per working day). Of these, 98% (185,448) were carried out under category C. Of these, 99.5% were reported as being performed because of a risk to the woman\u2019s mental health. In 13 cases, an abortion was performed under category C because of complications of pregnancy. Source - Abortion Statistics, England and Wales: 2017, Department of Health & Social Care",
        "background": "The Irish are proposing to introduce legislation that will restrict Category C abortions to 12 weeks, whilst we continue to allow abortions up to 24 weeks - far beyond the time when a baby can survive outside the womb.  This needs changed.",
