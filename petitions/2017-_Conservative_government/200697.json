        "additional_details": "Because there is not an specific Act in place to compel online bullies to behave in a reasonable way, their behaviour causes damage to people's lives, and, there needs to be a law with sanctions to prevent this from happening.\r\nWithout a  law to deter cyber-bullying with sanctions, it will snowball out of control, as the evidence in the media indicates.",
        "background": "Online Bullying has become very wide spread on social media and educational forums causing emotional and psychological suffering, and in some cases even suicide.  \r\nIt is not enough to report online bullying, the Search Engines need to be compelled to have sanctions in place to deter the bullies.",
