I was told it had gone to a lady who dialysis wasn' t working for anymore and she was very ill. I am very passionate to this cause as recipients can lead a normal life after receiving their kidney and so can the donor.",

This would mean carrying a card in the event of death if you did NOT want to donate your\r\norgans.",
