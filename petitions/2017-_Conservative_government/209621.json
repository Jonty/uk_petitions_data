        "additional_details": "The current London assembly is running with the idea that the election should be delayed until 2021 because of the chance of a general election in the same year (2020). This will give the current mayor an extra 12 months in power without being re-elected.\r\n\r\nLondoners should be given the opportunity to select a new mayor sooner rather than later. The people of London must be given the chance to rid themselves of the massive increase in crime associated with the current mayor.",
        "background": "The 2020 London mayoral elections should be brought forward from 2020 to 2019 in order to de-conflict with a possible general election also due 2020.",
