        "additional_details": "Im asking the government to introduce a test including hazard awareness for people using mobility scooters.\r\n\r\nAt the moment anyone can buy and use a mobility scooter. Some are very considerate but some users are dangerous. Speeding on the pavement, hitting people,  no awareness of door ways or children who can unexpectedly change direction or suddenly appear from doorways onto the pavements.\r\n\r\nThe scooters should also have a speed limit.\r\n\r\nI feel a test would ensure people are safe to use mobility scooters and will keep pedestrians and road users safe.",
        "background": "Yesterday I was hit in town in a pedestrian area by a mobility scooter user and they didn't stop to see if I was ok.\r\n\r\nI'm asking the government to introduce a test for mobility scooter users to protect all pedestrians and keep our pedestrians safe. I know of children and elderly people being hit.",
