        "additional_details": "It is self-evident that a referendum decided by 37.4% to 34.7% of the electorate has provided no conclusive mandate to deprive any citizen of the UK of rights which they currently enjoy. \r\nThis petition demands that the UK Government make the preservation of UK citizens' rights as EU citizens central to its negotiations with the EU so that current and future citizens retain these benefits regardless of what other arrangements may be agreed respecting the Customs Union and Single Market.",
        "background": "UK citizens have a number of rights currently as EU citizens - in particular the right to move freely around Europe to live, work, study and retire. As EU citizens, UK citizens can petition the EU Parliament and complain to the EU Ombudsman.",
