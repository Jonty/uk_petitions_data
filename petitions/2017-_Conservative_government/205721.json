        "action": "Increase security at unmanned train stations to prevent suicide",
        "additional_details": "My son Oscar Phillips took his own life aged just 16, with no history or signs of any mental illness. Oscar one day took himself to our local station and never came back. A lonely unmanned station, with 80mph trains passing, but no restrictions on public access.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "All unmanned train stations should have security gates and CCTV that captures motion. No passengers should be allowed onto the platform until the train has stopped. People getting off trains should be monitored to make sure they leave the station. This would help to prevent suicide and accidents.\r\n",
