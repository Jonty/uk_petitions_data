        "additional_details": "I've been making YouTube videos on this subject for the past 7 months and what made me really spring into action was when people contacted me explaining they were unable to cycle for medical reasons and did not want to be in a wheelchair or use a mobility scooter - However they were able to use an electric scooter to get around independently.\r\n\r\nThe UK needs to join the rest of the world by legalising electric scooters and other portable e-vehicles to ensure a greener future of Urban Mobility.",
        "background": "Global Action Plan found that London is the worst UK city for costs\u00a0to the NHS from pollution from cars and vans, totalling \u00a3605m.  \r\n\r\nTo get people out of cars and off our strained public transport system we need to allow viable eco-friendly alternatives for people to get around.",
