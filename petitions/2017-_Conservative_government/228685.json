        "additional_details": "Organ donation is highlighted with public campaigns as is blood donation. Both saves lives. Bone Marrow Donation is not. It needs more public awareness, more understanding within the communities and schools. It must be made compulsory within the school age of 14-16 years. It can reduce concerns and highlight the simplicity of the procedure, which will potentially save someone's life ! \r\nThere should be an 'Opt Out' system where those who wish to not donate can remove themselves from the register.",
        "background": "Every day at least 5 people start their search for a bone marrow donor. There are currently only 2% of people in the UK registered. This compares to 13% in Cyprus, 12% in Israel and 9% in Germany.\r\n90% of donations take place via peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection, similar to giving blood.",
