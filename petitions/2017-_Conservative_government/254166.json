        "additional_details": "ComRes, a market study firm, conducted a poll for the campaign group Open Sundays which found that 72% of people don't support current Sunday trading laws and would rather shop whenever is convenient to them. In the modern world of Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm shifts, shopping is growing more difficult and relaxing these laws would provide this opportunity. ",
        "background": "Extend Sunday trading hours to match other days of the week. The restrictions of trading on a Sunday are based on religious beliefs that should not dictate the legislation and commercial freedom in a progressive society. Allowing businesses to open as they see fit would be more suitable.",
