In the modern world of Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm shifts, shopping is growing more difficult and relaxing these laws would provide this opportunity. ",
        "background": "Extend Sunday trading hours to match other days of the week. The restrictions of trading on a Sunday are based on religious beliefs that should not dictate the legislation and commercial freedom in a progressive society. Allowing businesses to open as they see fit would be more suitable.",
