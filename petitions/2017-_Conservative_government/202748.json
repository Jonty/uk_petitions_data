        "action": "Debate the United Kingdom's recognition of Kosovo as an Independent Country.",
        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom wrongly recognised Kosovo's unilateral declaration of independence a day after it was declared on the 17th of February 2008. The unjust settlement was introduced without the agreement of both parties and a binding Security Council resolution. Serbia\u2019s sovereignty was thus undermined and disrespected in the process. Therefore, the declaration of independence by Kosovo can be argued to be an unlawful secession and needs to be debated in parliament once more.",
        "background": "I believe Kosovo was wrongly recognised as an independent country by the United Kingdom. The bombing campaign conducted by NATO in 1999 and Kosovo's separation in 2008, were unjust acts upon Serbia. This should be debated in Parliament.",
