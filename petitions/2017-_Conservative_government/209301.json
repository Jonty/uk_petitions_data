The Scottish dialect is very important to Scotland\u2019s past and future and children should be able to learn and enjoy everything they can about their language and the country that they live in.",
        "background": "In today\u2019s education system in Scotland children are learning to speak and write other languages (French and German) but struggle to speak or write Scottish dialect. They only learn the language for Robert Burns and they struggle to read and speak it.",
