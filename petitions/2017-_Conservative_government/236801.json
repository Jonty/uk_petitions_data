        "additional_details": "The Digital Economy Act requires all websites with adult content verify the identity of UK visitors with the goal of blocking under 18s from accessing.\r\nWhile a potentially positive goal (although the evidence of harm to under 18s accessing adult content is lacking) this can be achieved through parental action and existing technologies.\r\nThis amounts to a database of who is accessing what adult content. It is a breach of our rights to privacy and a huge risk of blackmail and security breaches.",
        "background": "In April 2019 the law will force websites displaying adult content to verify a user's identity before allowing access. This will involve recording your personal details in massive databases, which is a breach of privacy and a security risk. I ask the government to keep their eyes out our bedrooms.",
