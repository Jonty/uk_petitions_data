        "additional_details": "Drugs such as cannabis, psilocybe mushrooms and others that are scheduled under the Act, have genuine uses, whether medicinal or spiritual. The world has changed since the Act was passed, with Canada recently legalising cannabis for adults on the federal level, with Luxembourg next.\r\n\r\nThis Act has been used to incriminate countless people who did not deserve to be punished and given a criminal record.\r\n\r\nIt is time the Government asks the Law Commission to review the Misuse of Drugs Act .",
        "background": "The Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 is an archaic law that is not fit for purpose in a modern United Kingdom. More and more evidence is being published, proving the safety profiles of drugs that are criminalised by the Act.",
