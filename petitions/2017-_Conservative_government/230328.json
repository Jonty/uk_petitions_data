        "additional_details": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45812419\r\n\r\nThe new rules mean it's illegal to spread religious fanaticism by, for example, having \"abnormal beards or unusual names\". And extremism is defined so broadly that it even seems to be applicable to parents who complain if their children want to marry someone of a different faith.\r\nChina wants to stop the use of halal products that are not food. New regulations also make it clear that Muslim women are banned from wearing veils",
        "background": "China's Xinjiang region has written \"vocational training centres\" for Muslim Uighurs into law. Xinjiang says the centres will tackle extremism through \"thought transformation\". Rights groups say detainees are made to swear loyalty to the President and criticise or renounce their faith.",
