We think you might be referring to the London Living Wage, which is currently \u00a310.20 an hour (and \u00a38.75 an hour outside of London). The Living Wage is calculated independently and paid voluntarily by employers. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, the National Living Wage is a legal minimum that all employers have to pay to employees over 25 years of age. There is one rate (\u00a37.50 per hour, set to rise to \u00a37.83 in April 2018) for the whole country.\r\n\r\nYou can find out more here:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a petition asking the Government to increase the National Living Wage to more than \u00a37.83 in April 2018."
