        "action": "Close the legal loopholes in the High Hedges legislation",
        "additional_details": "A high hedge is defined as two or more evergreens, more that 2m tall planted in a line and where the branches meet so as to provide a barrier to light. Enforcement of high hedges legislation is the responsibility of councils.  However, the legislation does not cover individual trees and therefore people are merely cutting gaps in their hedges so that the former hedge becomes a line of individual trees which despite being large, cannot be dealt with by councils under the high hedges legislation.",
        "background": "Part 8 of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 introduced legislation to combat the scourge of fast-growing evergreens like Leylandii which, when planted in a line as a hedge has blighted the lives of those living in neighbouring properties.",
