The risk to bystanders is thought to be negligible.\r\nThe cancer risk associated with vaping is quoted as less than 0.5% of the risk associated with smoking. E-cigarette use is associated with improved quit success rates and accelerated decline in smoking rates in the UK. #helptoquit, #vapenotsmoke, #ecigarettepetition.",

Present indoor smoking ban does not distinguish between vapers and smokers. Moreover, majority of the workplaces and NHS establishments do not cater for e-cigarette users all together.",
