        "action": "Leave the EU immediately as per the referendum and before EU elections",
        "additional_details": "Parliament is in breach of 17th century laws and as such we have left the EU. We need to make deals outside the EU. We traded with many nations before entering the EU and we can do so again. MPs must carry out the leave decision and not Make decisions based on their own remainer views. Teresa may is a remainer and is not the right person. Let\u2019s get out and build our nation up with the much needed money that the EU receives including unelected gravy train MEPs. We do not need unaccountable MEPs",
        "background": "The Referendum two years ago clearly stated that we leave the EU. No mention was made of leaving with a deal. It is time parliament agreed to leave now without a deal before the EU elections which will result in more money being paid to the EU. We did not sign up to a federal Europe.",
