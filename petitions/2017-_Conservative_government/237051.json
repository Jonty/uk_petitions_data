        "additional_details": "The restoration of ties with Syria and the reopening of an embassy there would have significant benefits, both for Britain and the people of Syria. We have embassies in all neighbouring countries of Syria, including Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, and now that Damascus is safe and stable, it's time we restored the British Embassy. Trade, cooperation in regards to terrorism and ISIS, reconstruction, intelligence, and investment could thrive as a result. The British embassy in Syria should reopen.",
        "background": "After closing the embassy in 2011 due to the war, the British Government should now reopen their embassy in Damascus, the Syrian Capital, as the war draws to a close. Reopening the embassy and restoring ties with Syria could produce cooperation in regards to Islamist terror, and help rebuild Syria.",
