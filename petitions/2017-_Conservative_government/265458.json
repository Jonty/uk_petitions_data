Our government should be doing all it could to protect valuable natural spaces.\r\n\u201cIt seems irrational that the government is allowing Heathrow, as part of its plans for a 3rd runway, to propose routing for the first time 47 low-flying arrivals and 17 to 47 extra departures hourly directly over Richmond Park, London\u2019s nature reserve and a site of scientific interest.\u201d",
        "background": "Under the planned expansion of Heathrow hundreds of planes will fly at low altitude over Richmond park \u2013 a national nature reserve \u2013 for the first time.\r\nThe negative effects of noise and pollution from low-flying aircraft on affected residential areas are of great concern.",
