        "action": "Demand that May and Hunt condemn Saudi Arabia for the murder of Khashoggi",
        "additional_details": "Recordings have been released that show Khashoggi was tortured, interrogated, and grotesquely murdered by Saudi Arabian government agents inside the Consulate. Some of the Saudi officials are notorious for their involvement in other disappearances and assassinations. \r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia has long been criticised for its extensive human rights abuses and its role in Middle East conflicts. Our alliance with Saudi Arabia and the sale of British arms should be stopped and reviewed immediately.",
        "background": "Evidence has emerged that Jamal Khashoggi, an exiled Saudi Arabian journalist and critic of the Saudi war with Yemen, was murdered in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on 2nd October 2018. The UK Government should strongly condemn the Saudi Government and halt weapons sales to the regime.",
