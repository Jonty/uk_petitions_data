        "action": "Stop charging students council tax on property rented for graduating year",
        "additional_details": "Contracts are only available for 12 months from most letting agents therefor trapping students into a fee that most of them can\u2019t afford or have to pay with their student loan which is supposed to be used to help forward they\u2019re education and living costs. We still have to pay this loan back and being forced to give a large amount of it away for a period of time in which you can\u2019t control is very worrying. The exemption of students paying council tax should last their whole tenancy agreement.",
        "background": "Students are exempt from paying council tax however if a student is still living in student accommodation after they\u2019ve graduated, they\u2019re expected to pay the remaining months, even though their finically situation is still the same or most of the time, even worse.",
