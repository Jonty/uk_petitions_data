        "action": "Stop iLearn at Milton Keynes College",
        "additional_details": "A lot of students end up getting home at 9:00 because they have to get buses, meaning it is inconvenient for a lot of people. When we arrive at iLearn they give us a laptop and no further instructions and those doing iLearn feel it is a large waste of time. We were promised an extra course that we don't even need because the majority of us did Computing or IT in school, as well as that - the sessions have nothing to do with IT other than loading up a laptop.",
        "background": "MK College started a course on the side which is a Level 2 IT Qualification. We have 2 lessons of iLearn every week and we go into the library and have nothing to do. The qualification hasn't been organised, so when we go we sit doing nothing. This petition is to stop us having to go to the session.",
