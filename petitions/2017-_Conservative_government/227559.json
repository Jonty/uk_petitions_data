        "additional_details": "So why should the disabled client, that cannot work, have to pay for the second carer to get in when it's ok for one carer to get in for free. I feel like associations do not realise how much this impacts individuals with additional needs enjoying their lives as they cannot afford it. \r\nThe human rights act 1998 states: \r\nRight of life \r\nFreedom of assembly and association \r\nProtection from discrimination \r\nRight to education \r\n \r\nSo why is this a issue in disabled individuals lives on a day to day basis. The Government needs to intervene and make this a legal requirement.",
        "background": "As a carer for disabled people it frustrates me when myself and other carers take disabled clients to attractions such as the zoo and are unable to get in as they only allow one carer in for free. A lot of individuals with additional needs have two carers for a reason, not just for show.",
