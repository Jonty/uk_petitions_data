        "additional_details": "The 2016 referendum tiny \u2018win\u2019 was won via Brexit campaign lies, untruths, sophism, illegal overspend and funding. So in addition to the minority of the electorate voting to Leave the EU it was a legally flawed referendum. Revoking A50 is the democratic solution, and a rerun of the referendum sought if Parliament consider this is an additional necessity. The maths out of 53 million: 17.4 Leave, 16.1 Remain,13 registered & 7 unregistered who did not vote -many of them certain of Remains majority.",
        "background": "It is undemocratic of the Government &Parliament to ignore the 2/3 of the electorate,none of whom voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum. As it is thus undemocratic and wrong that they seek to take Britain out of the EU for 1/3 they should either Revoke A50 or also allow a second referendum",
