It was confirmed by the coroner that Michael Nicholas, 17, took his own life on his own accord under no other influence. Although substances were found in the body. The press released information to make the public and readers think otherwise with their unneeded wording and wrong information. Due to their own take on events an article was released to the public and Mikey's friends and family.",
