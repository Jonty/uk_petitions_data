Today I can't work because I had a heat stroke at work spending 8 hours in 50\u00b0C. I contacted environmental health where they told me there is no low for a maximum temperature at work places.\r\nI was completely shocked! \r\nThis is absolutely inhumane!\r\nThis low must be changed for our health!",
