        "action": "Halt Taunton Deane District Council taking over West Somerset District Council.",
        "additional_details": "The proposed merger was based on a deficit accumulated by West Somerset. The deficit, that is forecast to drop dramatically, is not surprising given West Somerset's relative deprivation and the unfair distribution of the rural grant that pays a city like Bristol more per head in than the deeply rural and under populated West Somerset.\r\n\r\nConstruction of Hinkley C nuclear power station and the government's policy of local councils retaining business rates will change the fortunes of West Somerset.",
        "background": "The obliteration of West Somerset Council will reduce electoral its representation, will centralise services in the more prosperous and more urbanised Taunton Deane and distance people in West Somerset from the delivery of services by making those delivering the services less accountable.",
