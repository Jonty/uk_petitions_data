Our Green Belt is even more precious as we have nowhere else to go! With an abundance of Brownfield sites and at least 5,000 empty properties on the Wirral - utilise these FIRST!",
        "background": "Wirral Council plans to release Green Belt for building on the fields either side of Lever Causeway and from Mount Road towards Storeton. Views across to the Welsh Hills with expanses of rolling country side will be lost forever! Together we can stop this!!",

This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed.
