        "action": "Make Mental Health First Aid a compulsory element of teacher training.",
        "additional_details": "Some teachers, who will remain anonymous, have reacted positively to the idea when it was put past them stating that teachers often won't act at all as they don't have the knowledge or confidence to deal with the situation. A compulsory course will provide the confidence to at least approach a student about their mental wellbeing and start working on a solution. This vital next move, which is cheaper than alternatives, can combat the ever-escalating problem which is teenage mental health.",
        "background": "I'm Ben, I've set up this petition as part of a teenage mental health awareness campaign started after my brother, Sam West, tragically committed suicide aged 15 in January 2018. Your signature won't bring my brother back, but it could save someone else's life and that's all I want.",
