        "action": "Place a maximum cap on insurance premiums for younger drivers.",
        "additional_details": "Using a popular comparison web site. Only a single quote has been issued all other insurance companies have declined to quote my son for a \u00a3600 car. The insurance quote is \u00a33688 this seems unreasonable and unfair and I cannot believe justifiable. This shows insurance companies using youth as cash cows to increase and inflate profit margins, not to cover required premium costs. This could potentially be a negative process thus increasing the risk of uninsured drivers on Britain\u2019s roads.",
        "background": "As a younger driver I never paid more than \u00a3700 for a years premium. I believe insurance companies could do more and place a 2x value cap on younger drivers. I.e a \u00a3600 car should not be valued to be insured for more than 2x it\u2019s value I.e \u00a31200.",
