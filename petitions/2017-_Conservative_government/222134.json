        "additional_details": "Due to these drastic measures, many Youth Centres in the hearts of our communities have already faced forced closure and hundreds of thousands of young people now face a much-reduced range of services, support, guidance and now lack access to opportunities to acquire critical life skills. \r\n\r\nAccording to research on the government website london.gov.uk, between 2011 and 2017, at least \u00a339 million has been slashed from council youth service budgets across London. Across 25 councils with similar data, 81 youth centres and major council-supported projects have been cut, and about 800 youth service posts are gone. \r\n\r\nA statutory youth program would mean that the government would proper scrutinize where the money they invest in youth channelled programs would be spent well.",
        "background": "There is currently no statutory obligation on local authorities to provide Youth Service Programs in respective Councils across the UK. Recently, this has meant that councils, when faced with Government austerity cuts, have had to slash services to young people.",
