We have been campaigning for months and attending the CCG consultations, which themselves must have cost thousands, to convince our CCG that this ever expanding area deserves decent NHS services.\r\n \r\nMoney that was \u2018earmarked\u2019 for this purpose is no longer guaranteed - we want it back.\r\n",
