        "additional_details": "UK forces under the EU flag Sept 2018:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZMhx0T9Tfg\r\nThis is very different to badges denoting mission, the UN or NATO - they don't have quasi-Governmental ambitions.\r\nThe EU from its foundation has had an ambition to be a union of states. It is currently a quasi government and is expanding that role.\r\nDecisions go through on a nod with a UK minister present.\r\nThe UK public was not consulted or made aware that UK forces would be wearing EU flags.\r\nWho therefore is in control?",
        "background": "It is a travesty to see uniforms of Her Majesty's Armed Forces corrupted with the flag of the EU, an anti-democratic wannabe superstate which we're thankfully leaving.\r\nMembers of the Armed Forces serve the Monarch and the democratic will of the British People and NOT Mr Juncker or EU technocrats.",
