It is currently a quasi government and is expanding that role.\r\nDecisions go through on a nod with a UK minister present.\r\nThe UK public was not consulted or made aware that UK forces would be wearing EU flags.\r\nWho therefore is in control?",

Some of the operations the British Armed Forces serve on are EU Common Defence and Security Policy missions and operations. While the UK continues to contribute to EU operations, such as Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, we will demonstrate cohesion with our allies by wearing the symbols of those missions.\r\n\r\nThe UK remains committed to European security and the Western Balkans is an integral part of that commitment. Maintaining security in Europe is crucial to the security of the UK. Through Operation ALTHEA, our service personnel play an important part in supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina to maintain a safe and secure environment in the country. It is important not only to military commanders and other nations\u2019 troops, but also to the civil authorities and population, that those soldiers deployed on Operation ALTHEA are clearly identified as such. \r\n\r\nAll international contributors to the operation, regardless of whether they are in the EU, wear the EUFOR badge.  This is similar for the other EU operations and missions to which we contribute, for example on the EU Training Missions in Somalia and Mali, and in countering migrant smuggling and human trafficking in the Southern Central Mediterranean and countering piracy off the coast of Somalia.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence",
