        "action": "Repeal the EU Withdrawal Act to Prevent Accidental No-deal Brexit",
        "additional_details": "The inevitability built into the Act is an irresponsible gamble that threatens to throw our country into chaos. While the courts and the government have influence, they no longer have the power to disarm this threat even if they find the will; only Parliament can unmake laws. Repeal the Act before it's too late. Prevent \"Brexit at any cost\" and eliminate the chance of accidental no-deal Brexit. The terms of our future with the EU must be thoughtfully arrived at, not recklessly stumbled into.",
        "background": "The passing of the EU Withdrawal Act in June 2018 means that by law the UK is set to leave the EU on Exit Day. Unless the Act is repealed, Brexit remains a statutory inevitability, and no-deal Brexit is what we'll get by default on Exit Day if our paralysed politics prevent something better.",
