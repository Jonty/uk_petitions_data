        "additional_details": "The suffering of the Windrush generation which is all over all media currently should be evidence enough. However, High Court judgements document the illegality of deportation proceedings under May as Home Secretary and Prime Minister. For example in R (Kiarie and Byndloss) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 42 the Supreme Court has struck down \u201cdeport first, appeal later\u201d certificates, such certificates specifically and publicly advocated by Theresa May in 2013.",
        "background": "Given Ms May's appalling record on immigration over many years as Home Secretary and Prime Minister we urge her to take responsibility for the unnecessary and on occasion illegal suffering she has caused so many British subjects and resign.",
