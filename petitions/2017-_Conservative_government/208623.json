        "additional_details": "The above claim came at a time when a report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary revealed that Scotland Yard had failed to properly handle 90% of recent child protection cases. A report by The Times states that The Met is now worse at helping and protecting children at risk of sexual exploitation and rape than it was In 2016. Dick's response is exactly the attitude that led to the scandal at Rotherham and elsewhere. She is a disgrace to her uniform and office, and should be removed immediately!",
        "background": "In response to the assertion that the Metropolitan Police Force \"could be sitting on a Rotherham-style sexual grooming gang situation\", the head of the Force claims that rape gangs have \"been part of our society for centuries\". There is no evidence to support this. She should be sacked immediately!",
