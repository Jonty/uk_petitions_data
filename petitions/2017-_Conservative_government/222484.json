        "additional_details": "Over 7000 people are currently on the organ donation register awaiting a chance to improve their health and well-being. I am trying to increase awareness of the importance of organ donation across the UK and break down the stigma of having this crucial conversation. \r\nGP's play a vital role within our communities and have a close professional relationship with their patients, where discussions may be held freely. Please support my campaign to increase awareness and enrolment for organ donation.",
        "background": "I would like to raise awareness for organ donation to help those currently awaiting a transplant. At present, GP's do not ask patients whether they have ever considered donating their organs. \r\nI would like GP's to ask patients about organ donation as part of their routine medical appointments.",
