        "additional_details": "(From the Guardian) For over a year now, Carillion has been in meltdown. Its shares have dropped 90%, it\u2019s issued profit warnings, and it\u2019s on to its third chief executive within six months. And this week, the government moved into emergency mode. A group of ministers held a crisis meeting on Thursday to discuss the firm. Around the table, reports the FT, were business secretary Greg Clark, as well as ministers from the Cabinet Office, health, transport, justice, education and local government",
        "background": "Carillion plc is the main contractor to HS2, among other major projects and have been in financial difficulty for over a year.  It is likely that the UK taxpayer will be expected to fund a bailout of Carillion to enable HS2 to continue to plan.  The UK taxpayer should not need to rescue a plc",
