        "action": "Hold a second referendum on the UK's membership of the EU before exiting.",
        "additional_details": "When the referendum took place it was unclear what kind of Brexit and future relationship with the EU voting 'leave' would bring, with possibilities ranging from staying in the trade and customs union to leaving without a deal all floated as possible ideas. Before the UK permanently exits the EU, a referendum should be held to decide between A) remaining in the EU, B) leaving without a deal, or C) [enter deal that government has failed to get through parliament - if this option materialises]",
        "background": "During the referendum, it was unclear what voting leave really meant. In order to ascertain whether the government is still acting on the will of the British people, a second vote should be held to determine whether a majority of voters will want to leave the EU and what kind of Brexit they prefer.",
