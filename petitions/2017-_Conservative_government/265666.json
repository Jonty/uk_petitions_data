        "additional_details": "During the event, several protestors entered the building and were stopped by security. Unfortunately, some managed to get through and the MP was forced into defending himself and others by ejecting an individual with reasonable force. \r\nHe has now been suspended pending an investigation which does not need to take place. \r\nMark Field needs to be reinstated with immediate effect.\r\nI feel this petition is urgently needed to present the public view and this petition is from a pro-Labour supporter.",
        "background": "Tory MP Mark Field has been suspended for defending himself from a potential threat by forcefully stopping a protestor encroaching on MPs during an event. \r\nThe MP was forced into action as unknown to him the protestor could have had a concealed weapon or liquid with the aim to attack an MP",
