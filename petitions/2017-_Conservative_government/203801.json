        "additional_details": "As an example of the current system, Apple in 2014 paid just \u00a312 million in UK tax on UK profits of \u00a32 billion. To do this, 'Apple UK' pays its profits to 'Apple Ireland', where it can pay less than 4% corporate tax. CCCTB would change tax rules so that companies be charged based on where their activity be done \u2013 meaning that a company with sales, employment and assets (say, 20% of its European total) in the UK would have to pay UK tax on 20% of its European profits; a far fairer system.",
        "background": "Tax-dodging by companies like Apple and Google is a huge problem in the UK. The proposal for a 'Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base' (CCCTB) by the European Commission would change the rules to stop this. Whatever our views on EU membership, this needs to be included in the final Brexit deal.",
