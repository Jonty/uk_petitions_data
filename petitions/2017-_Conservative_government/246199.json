Research by the Express listed homes with school in the name in the top 50 house names in Britain. Many of these houses have been sold and are under private ownership, but due to their locations may have access to the school grounds or line of sight into classrooms and playgrounds.",
        "background": "Currently, depending on a convicted child sex offenders custodial sentence they may only have to sign the register for 5/10 years therefore they can freely observe children after this without rousing suspicion. A change of the law in the UK so that this can\u2019t happen needs to take place.",
