Many are not collected by charities and can't be recycled so instead end up in landfill sites.\r\n\r\nThe average tent is made largely of plastic and weighs 3.5kg - the equivalent of 8,750 straws. A four-man tent can be picked up on the high street for as little as \u00a330.\r\nReduce single use plastics: www.skyoceanrescue.com",
        "background": "Disposable \"festival tents\" should be banned to help prevent almost 900 tonnes of plastic waste each year, festival organisers have said.\r\nA group of more than 60 independent festivals across the UK have urged retailers to stop marketing and selling tents as single-use items.",
