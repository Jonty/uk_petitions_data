        "additional_details": "Although the tax relief for higher rate taxpayers is currently being phased out by the \"Section 24\" of the Finance Act 2015, landlords are still able to enjoy tax relief at the basic rate. This is still unfair and puts first time buyers at a disadvantage. \r\n\r\nI cannot get tax relief on the interest to borrow money and invest in the stock market, or to buy my first home. Why should buy to let property be any different?",
        "background": "Currently landlords in the UK can claim tax relief on their interest payments. Ordinary homeowners are not able to do this. Tenants are not able to claim tax relief on their rent. \r\n\r\nThis is grossly unfair and has distorted the housing market.",
