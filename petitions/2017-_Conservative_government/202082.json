        "action": "Remove rip-off compound interest from student loans",
        "additional_details": "Even though the base rate is only 0.25%, students are exploited by horrendous 6.1% interest, compounded monthly, being charged on their loans \u2013 this can double or treble the size of the loans and massively increase interest costs, too. Most \u2018normal\u2019 loans do not do this. It is exploitative. No wonder student loans get bigger even while borrowers are paying off their loans. Sign the petition to remove interest from student loans. More info. here: https://www.afairdealforstudents.com/",
        "background": "Student loans charge a huge 6.1% interest, even during study. Worse, the 6.1% is compounded monthly, meaning interest is added to the loans every month, making loans bigger, so the next month the interest costs even more; the loans get bigger and interest costs increase every month. It is a rip-off.",
