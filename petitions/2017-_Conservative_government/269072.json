        "additional_details": "Referendum so flawed that NO JUSTIFYING MANDATE FOR ANY BREXIT. \r\nChosen franchise let COMMONWEALTH citizens vote but NOT UK citizens over 15 yrs in EU. Manifesto commitment \"Votes for Life\" not enacted first! Let Irish/Malta/Cyprus citizens vote (EU countries all 3) but NOT other EU countries. Did NOT let 16-17 yrs vote when their long-term future at stake. WHY? All those excluded from Right to Vote are also likely much affected by result.\r\nReferendum held as Party split on THE ISSUE - so FIASCO",

Right start is The Issue: UK MEMBERSHIP OF EU. Special franchise needed. Not about legalities but relevance, principle and common sense",
