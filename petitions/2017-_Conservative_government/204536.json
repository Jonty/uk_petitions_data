        "additional_details": "On Facebook over the weekend, there were so many posts about noisy fireworks traumatising people\u2019s dogs, tales of hiding under the stairs & beds etc. My dog is always terrified too. I saw an advert for a firework company in Halifax selling quiet fireworks & an article about a town in Italy using quiet fireworks, both advcoated care for animals as a reason to buy. It seems to me that this is the way forward, ban the noise but still celebrate Guy Fawkes, enjoy the spectacular without the noise",
        "background": "Every year around November 5th our pets, wildlife & anyone who has an aversion to loud noises are subjected to a loud barage of bangs from fireworks. It has come to my attention that there are quiet fireworks available, so why not use them, we don\u2019t need bangs to enjoy the visual spectacular",
