        "action": "Stop Theresa May from bribing the government with her resignation.",
        "additional_details": "The PM is offering to quit if her own party backs her deal. She is essentially bribing them to take a deal they, and many more, don't want by giving them the promise of resignation. This shows that her terrible Brexit negotiations are about looking after the Conservative Party, not about what is best for the British people. She shouldn't be able to bribe the government with her job and further ignoring and condemn the British public.",
        "background": "Make it illegal for Theresa May to bribe her party by offering to quit if they back her Brexit deal. She can't get the votes she requires from the deal so to get them she is offering to resign as a way of getting her deal passed. This shouldn't be allowed.",
