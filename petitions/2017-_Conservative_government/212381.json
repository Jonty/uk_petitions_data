        "additional_details": "The blame is put onto us as motorcyclists, we must lock our bikes, we must keep an eye on it, install CCTV etc, but not enough is being done to support all that we do. More resources need to be put into this issue and in turn, will assist in fighting other crimes also. Owners of stolen bikes should not be persecuted for protecting their property and themselves, and more powers should be given to police and the criminal justice system to tackle this ever growing problem.",
        "background": "More and more you hear about motorcycle theft, and these people are not being deterred, we must end this problem. The emphasis should not be on manufacturers or the owners, we do what we can to protect. Stricter and harsher punishments should be imposed by courts, the CPS and support from Police.",
