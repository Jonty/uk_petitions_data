        "action": "Make gender neutral uniforms compulsory in UK schools",
        "additional_details": "However, British schools are prescribed to teach British values. Most notably, individual liberty, and mutual respect. Yet, such values are compromised if, for example, boys cannot wear skirts, or girls are unable to wear trousers. Not least, in some uniform policies boys cannot wear earrings, or possess long hair, whereas girls at the same institution can. Such uniforms also put those children who do not identify as either a boy, or a girl at risk. Attitudes towards gender need to change.",
        "background": "Across the UK, children are unnecessarily, and directly discriminated against in schools, simply because of their gender. Despite various acts of parliament, schools in the UK are still able to dictate what a child of a certain gender can wear. This is most unfitting in 21st century Britain.",
