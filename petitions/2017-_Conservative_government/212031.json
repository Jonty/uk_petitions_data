        "action": "Stop SMI payments being turned into loans with interest",
        "additional_details": "SMI payments are only paid in comparison with how much is out standing on the mortgage and this is a small percentage. So, someone like myself with only  \u00a319000 left on the mortgage, gets a miserly payment of \u00a39 a week. Although this does help it is nowhere near as much as payment made for someone in council housing. surely the government are out of pocket because of these benefits and not SMI ones? Trying to help buyers onto the property ladder, then, if they need help, telling them they have another loan on top of the one taken out for the mortgage is not a good incentive.",
        "background": "for years SMI payments have helped people, on benefits, with mortgages, so they don't get into debt or lose their homes. Now these payments are going to be in the form of a loan which will have to be paid back, with interest. I think this is unfair and penalises homeowners. Why is it being changed?",
