This happened in 2009 yet the debt collection company legally waited until 5 years and 10 months before obtaining a CCJ. So with 2 months remaining legally before it was STATUTE Barred they obtained the ccj staying on my credit reports for a further 6 years. In total it will effect me for 12 years something which is completely wrong and needs to be stopped",
