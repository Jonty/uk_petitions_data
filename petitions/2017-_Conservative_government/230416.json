        "background": "The Government currently spends 0.7% GDP on Foreign Aid. This means it will spend over \u00a314bn of tax payers money on projects which could be better spent at home. By 2020 this figure will have risen to almost \u00a316bn. We believe the Government should abolish the 0.7% GDP target for Foreign Aid.",
