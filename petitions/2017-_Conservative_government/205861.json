        "additional_details": "Estranged students struggle to succeed in HE.  Over 50% can\u2019t meet the costs of living even with maximum maintenance loan, and 33% experience homelessness whilst studying, as they have no family home to return to over summer. Many cannot afford to engage with their academic community and struggle with the stress and anxiety of living a life unsupported. Thus, these students\u2019 needs must be recognised and prioritised in Higher Education policy, enabling support to be put in place.",
        "background": "There\u2019s an assumption that all young people who enter HE have a \r\nsupportive family. But estranged students, whose relationship with their parents has broken down, and who are not leaving local authority care, are three times more likely to drop out of university than the average student.",
