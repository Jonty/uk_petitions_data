        "additional_details": "Some venues & ticketing websites do not sell single tickets if remaining seats are in pairs. Cheap flight prices are based on two people flying on the same booking. Hotels and travel agents add on a single person supplement when one person occupies a room that could accommodate two. Some hotels do have single rooms but they are often small and tucked out the way. The cheap price advertised for bargain holiday are usually for couples and families. Life car & home Insurance is often cost more single people. Cinema ticket & meals deals are often advertised as two for the price of one. the list goes on",
        "background": "For all those who prefer to live alone, or have little choice but to do so. It seem like an unfair to pay more than couples for everything from flights to insurance. Single people contribute more to society than everyone else, but get less back in return.",
