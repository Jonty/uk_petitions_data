        "additional_details": "There are notable and increasing amount of road users on alternative modes of transport, horses, bicycles & on foot. The current unenforced speed restriction of 50mph is an extreme danger to those in particular.\r\nI propose the change from the top of Manchester Road, Barnoldswick to the junction of Barnoldswick Road and Standing Stone Lane (B6251).",
        "background": "The current unenforced speed restriction of 50mph along this stretch of the B6251 is considered too high and is frequently ignored. This causes a danger to other road users on bends, narrow sections of road and more importantly local residents accessing and egressing their driveways.",
