        "additional_details": "Whilst many check for access to fibre everyday the response is always \u2018sorry not available\u2019.  BT retail and Openreach are well aware of the issue but seem to point blank refuse to update and expand the telephone exchange that services the village.\r\nBT retail are now saying there is nothing they can do and that the only course of action is to raise it with the ombudsman.\r\nPlease sign this petition so we can get access to fibre in the village and force BT to do the right thing.",
        "background": "For a number of years now the people of Staining Village in Blackpool has consistently requested access to fibre broadband in order to benefit from online information, to run a home business, teach children online, communicate with family, setup blogs and news pages but BT just say \u2018no sorry\u2019.",
