        "additional_details": "Staff at every level should be registered, increasing protection for the vulnerable but also placing carers on a professional footing. The cost of registration should be borne by providers. This register is not a criticism of hard-working care staff, and should increase their status and security, while registration of senior staff will enable them to be held accountable if they fail to provide good care.",
        "background": "Care is in crisis. There are regular reports of older and vulnerable people being abused and neglected. Most carers are hard-working professionals, but to increase confidence and standards everyone in the care industry should be regulated. ",
