        "action": "Review the DFT\u2019s decision to disqualify Virgin Trains from WCP franchise bid.",
        "additional_details": "The disqualification came from the DFT asking for Virgin Trains to take a financial risk that they could not have managed or been in control of themselves, a decision that would have been reckless. This is an industry-wide issue and forcing rail companies to take these risks could lead to the failure of more rail franchises. \r\n\r\nVirgin Trains have been revolutionary in UK rail with initiatives such as Delay-Repay, Beam and Alexa. \r\n\r\nVirgin Trains has a 90% customer rating. Long may it continue!",
        "background": "On Wednesday 10 April, the Department for Transport announced that a joint venture between Virgin, Stagecoach and SNCF had been disqualified from the West Coast Partnership bid which would have meant the West Coast Mainline continuing under Virgin Trains whilst getting to work on starting HS2 plans.",
