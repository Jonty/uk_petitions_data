        "additional_details": "When they stop winning races or become injured, some owners don\u2019t want to pay for a horse who doesn\u2019t bring in any money. Many end up in slaughterhouses where they are turned into dog food and glue. They may endure days of transport in tiny trailers where there is no access to water, food and injuries are common. Horses tend to thrash about in order to avoid being shot by the gun, which is supposed to render them unconscious before their throats are cut.",
        "background": "Horses are whipped and forced to run around tracks that are often made of hard-packed dirt at speeds of more than 30 miles per hour while carrying people on their backs. Racehorses are the victims of a multibillion-dollar industry that has problems with drug abuse, injuries and race fixing.",
