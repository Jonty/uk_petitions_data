        "additional_details": "The cost of such a card would be minimal, estimated at between \u00a317-\u00a330 a year for the average taxpayer. However, the savings on such a card - rebated through tariff adustments on online purchases or in stores would be two or three times this. The payments for businesses would be higher, but the tariff savings higher too.\r\n\r\nMost importantly this option offers the choice for those who wish to retain EU benefits, or those who wish not to do so. Something currently not offered through Brexit.",
        "background": "This stems from the currently divided situation over Brexit - allowing British citizens who wish to retain the rights they currently enjoy with the UK\u2019s EU membership (travel, trade, reciprocal health-care) post-Brexit, plus allow businesses the same privilege, if they so wish.",
