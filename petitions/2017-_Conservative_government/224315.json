        "additional_details": "Many people still believe that it\u2019s OK to leave an animal in a car on a warm day resulting in distress and sometimes death for the animal.\r\n\r\nBystanders and the police often have to watch dogs suffer whilst trying to find the owner. Many are unrepentant about their behaviour and will probably repeat it.\r\n\r\nA publicity campaign and an option for police to issue an on the spot fine would act as a proper deterrent and statement that this is unacceptable and would thus reduce the number of occurrences.",
        "background": "Every year, despite numerous warnings in the media, there are reports of dogs dying in hot cars or being rescued close to death.  The law on what bystanders and even the police can do is ambiguous and confusing.  We need an obvious and enforceable deterrent to help prevent this recurring problem\r\n.",
