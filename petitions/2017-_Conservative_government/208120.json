        "action": "End homelessness in Britain by adopting and funding the \"Housing First\" project.",
        "additional_details": "Finland adopted the \"Housing First\" model in 2008. To date Finland is the only European country to see homelessness numbers falling. The model is simple: Provide a home first, treat the causes of homelessness and help people to retrain and get back into work and reintegrate into society. Not only is \"Housing First\" cost effective but it is morally the \"right thing to do\". Many MP's already support \"Housing First\". By supporting this petition you could force a parliamentary debate.",
        "background": "There are over 9000 homeless people living on the streets of Britain. Many are ex military men and women suffering from mental health issues. No one chooses to be homeless. Britain can and should eradicate homelessness. The \"Housing First\" model has already proven to reduce homelessness in Europe.",
