        "action": "Set up a public inquiry into Greater Manchester Police.",
        "additional_details": "Police forces shouldn\u2019t be able to investigate themselves as GMP has done. That is a failing in the police complaints system, resulting in a lack of accountability for senior police officers. GMP also has primacy over the North-West Counter Terrorism Unit. Any problems in GMP could risk being transferred to the NWCTU, which could potentially have a national impact. We need a public inquiry now.",
        "background": "GMP has been the subject of negative media reports. Complaints have been to the Independent Office for Police Conduct & the Mayor, but there are still problems. ",
