        "additional_details": "Every Tier 4 Student studying in the United Kingdom may benefit from the new Post Study Work Visa is the ideology behind the petition. We as international students appreciate the UK Governments efforts towards the country and international students and would request them to consider our request as the current 4 month period following graduation is insufficient to find work, the students applying this year are being forced to defer studies for one year due to the uncertainty over the matter.",
        "background": "Recently, the UK Government has announced to re-introduce a Post Study Work Visa for Tier 4 (General) Category Students, there is information that this may not benefit students graduating in 2020, We request that this please be extended to current Tier 4 Students in the UK to ensure equality.",
