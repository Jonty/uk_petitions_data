        "additional_details": "Brexiters have also declared they would be happy to be much poorer if it means Britain leaves the EU. Some have even said they do not care if it results in their family members losing jobs.\r\nSeeing as a lot of remain voters aren't wealthy, I suggest the government allow every remainer to claim up to \u00a31million from the treasury in order to start a life in Europe, buy a home, and apply to remain an EU citizen. This can be means tested based on savings. This is likely to result to a more united UK.",
        "background": "Remain voters are increasingly being ignored and insulted by ministers and brexit voters for voicing concern on the direction our country is taking. We are told we can leave if we don't like it. As such, I call on the government to provide financial assistance to remainers looking to leave the UK.",
