        "action": "Reduce the House of Commons recess dates to allow dealing with priority issues",
        "additional_details": "This situation is simply unacceptable. No business could survive allowing all of its staff time off for 9 weeks in a time of crisis, when what is needed is strong leadership and time dedicated to resolving the issues. This petition is calling for a considerable reduction in the recess period and a call to defer individual party conferences to allow MPs and the House of Commons on all sides to focus on what the country needs as a priority.",
        "background": "The House of Commons recess dates are 25th July, returning on 03rd September. This equates to 6 weeks of MPs not being in Parliament to focus on the UK\u2019s biggest priorities. Upon return there are 3 weeks of party conferences. There is less than 4 weeks active parliamentary time between now & Brexit.",
