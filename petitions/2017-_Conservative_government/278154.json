        "additional_details": "According to the Independent newspaper: \r\n\u201cIn 2018, UK use of plastic water bottles increased by more than 7 per cent, according to market research company Zenith. The industry is worth \u00a33.3bn.\u201d\r\nThis is a shocking statistic and only serves to prove that we have learnt nothing in the last few years.\r\nVenues should be actively trying to ban single use plastics and putting the planet above profits.",
        "background": "UK water is safe to drink. The need for single use plastic water bottles is futile in bars, clubs, music and sporting venues when there are taps available with a water supply. Alcoholic drinks should be served in reusable plastic cups as they do at Glastonbury, Twickenham and other large events.",
