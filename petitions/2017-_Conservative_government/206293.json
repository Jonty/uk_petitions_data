        "additional_details": "The principle of \"up to one third\" of adult life over State Pension Age (SPA) was announced in the 2013 Autumn Statement.\r\n\r\nBut in July the Secretary of State said \"Government is minded to commit to \u2018up to 32%\u2019 as the right proportion\u201d.\r\n\r\nUnder the original principle, SPA reaches 68 by April 2041 and 69 by April 2055. Under the new approach it would be 11 and 13 years earlier respectively and 70 by April 2056.\r\n\r\nRigging future reviews increases SPA for millions of people.",
        "background": "Government regularly reviews State Pension Age (SPA). The agreed approach means the proportion of adult life we spend over SPA remains constant. The target proportion was up to 33.3%. Government now wants to reduce this to 32%. This would mean increasing SPA earlier and a higher SPA for millions.",
