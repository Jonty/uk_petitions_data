This meant that despite a restraining order being made in civil proceedings, my abuser was able to continue his campaign directly against me through the family courts.\r\n \r\nLegal aid would have provided me with the safety of a solicitor during the proceedings, which after spending thousands in legal fees I could no longer afford later in proceedings",
