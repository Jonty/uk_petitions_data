        "additional_details": "Reading DTC conducts, on average 70 tests per day and tends to have an 8 week waiting list. Moving outside of Reading or closing it completely will cause huge disruption to Leaners, ADI and examiners. There will be greater financial, environmental and time costs for all involved. Reading can provide an excellent test area that meets the new style driving test, essential for it 250,000+ residents",
        "background": "We would request the DVSA reconsider the proposal to move the Reading practical driving test centre outside of the area that can reasonably be considered the Reading area. In our opinion keeping a DTC in Reading makes practical sense for the customers or Approved Driving Instructors.",
