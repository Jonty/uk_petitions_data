Deal or no deal we employed MP's to do what we elected and pay them to do.\r\n\r\nYet, here we are three years late and yet the MP's who we pay have not done as they were asked. This has led the minority to think that they deserve to have us vote again and again until they win. This is not democracy.\r\n\r\nIf the people cannot employ MP's to do what they are instructed we need to sack them all and start again.",
