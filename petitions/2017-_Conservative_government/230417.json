People should be more aware of what's go in to the product in front of them, right there in the shop without having to search online. At total of 3.79 million experiments were conducted by the U.K. In 2017",
        "background": "Many people are against animal testing or want to reduce the number of products they buy that use it but there isn't enough information in store about the companies that use animal testing so people are generally unaware about the extent of it. This addition would allow a more informed choice.",
