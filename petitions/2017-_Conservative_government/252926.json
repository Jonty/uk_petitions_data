        "additional_details": "Whilst the results of the \u2018indicative votes\u2019 have widely been presented by the right wing media as a failure, there appeared to be a highly significant number of mp\u2019s supporting the proposition for a  legal requirement for a \u2018confirmatory public vote\u2019 for any subsequent agreement reached by parliament. This proposition should be reinforced and subsequently, secure the right of the public to express their views in the light of information that was absent at the time of the original referendum.",
        "background": "MP\u2019s took control of Brexit process this week to explore ways of reaching consensus in a process where differences of opinion have proved otherwise irreconcilable.  Responsibility for such division lies in Teresa May\u2019s failure to engage those with alternative and equally valuable viewpoints.",
