        "additional_details": "The UK paid out 0.7% of GDP or approximately 13billion pounds to foreign countries to aid their failing countries, yet we are neglecting our own country as a result, foreign aid should be paid if and when we are in a stable position to afford to pay it, as the government keep telling us about debt management that you need to cut spending and prioritise what is important, then they should set the example and prioritise our system and people.",
        "background": "I am proposing that the government implement what they tell us to do and in a time where we as a country are in massive debt and suffering a failing health care system, that we divert foreign aid spending and use that money to rebuild our failing system rather than trying to fix other countries.",
