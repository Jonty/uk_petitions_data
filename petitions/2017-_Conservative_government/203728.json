        "action": "Introduce a 'no-fly' list banning disruptive & dangerous passengers from flying.",
        "additional_details": "Instead of punishing the majority of decent passengers, a 'no-fly' list, similar to the one the Americans have, would be fairer on the majority of passengers and more effective in preventing alcohol-related problems like air rage.  Also the prospect of being given a lengthy or indefinite ban from flying would likely provide a much greater disincentive to avoid breaking the law during flights.",
        "background": "Presently several politicians claim the lack of alcohol-licensing at airports is to blame for an increase in air rage incidents.  Therefore several are pushing to restrict in-flight alcohol-sales at airports and in-flight, which would punish the majority.",
