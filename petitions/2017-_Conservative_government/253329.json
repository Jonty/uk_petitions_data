        "additional_details": "Many SMEs are suffering because of lack of decision and even larger companies such as JCB have publicly announced their support for No Deal.\r\n\r\nWe already trade with many countries under WTO rules. \r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning we would be in charge of agreeing proposals for importing German cars, Dutch flowers, French wines, Italian olive oils, etc. \r\n\r\nWithout agreement the large German, French and Spanish fishing fleets would be stopped from their main fishing grounds.",
        "background": "To renegotiate a new Brexit deal requires a long extension of up to 2 years which, at \u00a339 billion per year, equals \u00a378 million plus the costs of holding an election for MEPs.  That money could be better used to soften any disruption. During that time, trading agreements could be finalised.",
