        "additional_details": "Under 10m boats make up 77% of the UK fleet but their quota pool only accounts for 1.5% of the national Fixed Quota Allocations (in tonnes). This directly causes wide spread discarding of marketable fish. \r\n\r\nPlease see paper titled, How Government and Fisheries management policies caused over fishing in UK waters, on The British Fishing Industry Facebook page.",
        "background": "The inshore fishing industry should be legally entitled to 30% of all UK quota. The current system is based on historical quota allocation which is grossly unfair. ",
