        "action": "Reverse The Decision To Fortify All UK Flour with Synthetic Folic Acid",
        "additional_details": "Synthetic folic acid is not the same as naturally-occurring folate. It is converted inefficiently, builds in the bloodstream and is increasingly linked to the reverse effect: cancer, heart disease, stroke, midline birth defects such as tongue tie, and an adverse effect on the 30-50% of the population with MTHFR mutation. Supplementing all UK flour makes folic acid unavoidable, promising a disastrous costly backfire on UK health and the NHS. Read full at https://tinyurl.com/folic-acid-uk-petition",
        "background": "Upon what reasoning are we supplementing the entire UK at all times, with a synthetic vitamin only advised for childbearing women during a 6-month window? What effect will it have on men, children, the elderly, non-mothers, and the mothers' own bodies? It should remain a choice of the individual.",
