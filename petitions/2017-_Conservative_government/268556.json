        "action": "Impose an automatic minimum sentence for assaults on emergency workers.",
        "additional_details": "Clearly simply doubling the maximum potential sentence is little deterrant nor is it any guarantee of what most would consider justice. The reason for this is simple, a maximum potential sentence is all but never handed out. The overwhelming majority of such offences are punished with community orders (often not enforced) and suspended sentences which courts rarely activate even when suspects continue to offend. A minimum sentence would be far more effective than a hypothetical maximum.",
        "background": "Recently a change was made in the maximum sentence available for assaulting an emergency worker within the U.K. essentially doubling the potential punishment. This has had, demonstrably in the form of the latest national statistics, no effect whatsoever on such assaults.",
