        "action": "Establish a national day commemorating the significance of 15th August 1945.",
        "additional_details": "Over 50,000 UK servicemen were held as Japanese prisoners of war in South East Asia between 1941-1945, of whom twenty-five per cent were either killed or died during captivity. With few survivors now left, this conflict is fast disappearing from living memory. These brave men felt cruelly overlooked upon their repatriation and beyond, and a national day of commemoration would go some way to putting that right.",
        "background": "Thousands of servicemen were held as Far East prisoners of war from 1941-1945, caught up in a conflict that endured long after the celebrations for VE Day. The contribution of those who had the misfortune to be held as pows, many of whom did not survive, deserves to be remembered nationally.",
