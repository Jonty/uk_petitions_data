        "additional_details": "My story- I am a sufferer of PTSD and crippling anxiety which causes me to be unable to leave the house alone. My dog can sense when I\u2019m anxious and he can tell when I\u2019m going to faint. He can take me to a safe space so I can avoid injury to myself or others. I need him in order to leave the house and lead a normal life however,  he is unable to be registered as a support animal since my disability is invisible.\r\nLets get recognition for emotional support animals and PTSD dogs in the UK.",
        "background": "People like myself suffer with invisible illnesses like PTSD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, BPD among countless others.\r\nI\u2019m petitioning to get recognition for emotional support animals and PTSD dogs. They should be classed as service dogs as they can potentially save lives. Mine has many times.",
