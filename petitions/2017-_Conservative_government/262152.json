        "action": "Reform current laws to allow the use of electric scooters",
        "additional_details": "Existing laws only allow electric scooters to be legally used on private land. In a bid to reduce our carbon emissions and be more environmentally conscious we should look to consider these as a greener means of transport especially for those who are wary of cycling on roads but want a quicker way to get around. Certain EBikes or Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycles (EAPC) are permitted on any cycle paths/anywhere else that bikes are normally allowed so why are electric scooters any different?",
        "background": "Currently, you cannot ride an electric scooter on the road, because the DVLA requires that electric vehicles be registered and taxed, concurrently, the 1835 Highways Act prohibits anyone from riding a \u2018carriage\u2019 on the pavement which means you also cannot ride an electric scooter on the pavement.",
