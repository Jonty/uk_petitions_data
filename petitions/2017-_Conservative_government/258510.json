Time is up.\r\n\r\nRising temperatures and unimaginable levels of pollution in our atmosphere and oceans, is threatening our natural world, and our civilisations too. Humans face ultimate extinction, as do the many species that also belong here.\r\n\r\nThis government must declare a climate emergency and protect Earth: the only home, we\u2019ve ever known.",

We must take action.\r\n\r\nGovernments of the world must take immediate action to protect our world. Climate change is no longer the future, it is now.",
