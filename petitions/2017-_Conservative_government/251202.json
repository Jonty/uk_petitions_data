        "additional_details": "With 31,000,00 taxpayers in the 2018-19 financial year, the potential increased revenue from this opt-out service could be as much as \u00a3372 million per year. \r\n\r\nThe ability to opt-out will enable those to not pay this tax should they wish, but may also help to dramatically increase the amount of capital donated to the NHS through the will of the general public. \r\n\r\nReference: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/710887/Table_2.1.pdf",
        "background": "With increasing concern for the future livelihood of the NHS, the importance of ensuring adequate funding is now vital.  \r\n\r\nThe introduction of an opt-out tax of \u00a31 per month would dramatically increase the amount of capital invested directly and support the financial livelihood of the NHS.",
