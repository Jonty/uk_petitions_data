        "additional_details": "So the only way to do that, is the tax authorities, HMRC need to be more aggressive towards this group of people making sure they pay their taxes and put their tax rates up to 90%.  Another thing I would say is this: they should also go to jail for what they have been doing and should never be let out until they have paid their taxes and if they planning to take their money abroad, the authorities should stop them at the airports, so that they cannot keep all their money.",
        "background": "From what I have heard from the Paradise Papers today, which is investments in tax havens, literally tax avoidance, we have far too many of these super-rich in society avoiding paying tax, which means public services are missing out, and the government has to do something about to stop this.",
