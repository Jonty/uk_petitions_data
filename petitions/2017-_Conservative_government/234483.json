        "additional_details": "I have checked at multiple cinemas, and they have said that you can request for a film to be shown subtitled, however there are no guarantees they will and also they require several weeks notice with no flexibility on times or days, which means I am usually left with their day and time schedule or nothing, which is more often the case. I feel very strongly that this is unfairly discriminating people with a hearing impairment. Given that, most movies are shown around 5 to 10 times a day for 2 or 3 weeks, resulting in at least 105 showings of each film. I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s too much too ask to have 4 subtitled showings a week.",
        "background": "I am a 13 year old boy who is hearing impaired, and fed up with not being able to watch movies like my friends can. I miss out on so many movies. The cinemas only show at best one a week and they are usually at very inconvenient times. Why can\u2019t there be 4 subtitled showings of every movie a week?",
