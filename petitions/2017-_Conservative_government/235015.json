        "additional_details": "I'm sure somebody in every community has been affected by this growing problem which is very un-predictable. The un-predictability of suicide is what makes the issue so dangerous, with such glamourizing information on the internet if this is searched, it can be very influential to anybody suffering with mental health issues. Even young teenagers facing mental health issues may find this information and act on it.",
        "background": "This issue needs addressing with a view to potentially reduce the risk of suicide. Suicide due to mental health is an increasing problem in many communities, not only my local one. I believe if the proposed action was taken, this would ban all cyber influential instructions on how to end your life.",
