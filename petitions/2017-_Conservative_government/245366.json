        "additional_details": "The problem with MPs having every single expense paid for by the tax payer, is that it not only detaches them from the real world but it attracts the wrong kind of people into politics. MPs get far too many perks and fringe benefits, based on the disgusting behaviour of Parliament overturning Brexit, they don't deserve any of them. MPs sure love our money, but our democratic vote? Not so much. An MP's greed for money is not the tax payer's problem so pay your own darned bills.",
        "background": "Bearing in mind that MPs' pay reviews are always inflation busting, why then should they have all their bills paid for? They refuse to abolish the TV licence and yet are not even required to pay it, they claim it on expenses like everything else. They literally live for free. It's time that stopped.",
