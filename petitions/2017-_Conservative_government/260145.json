        "additional_details": "Despite Brexit being delayed until October, Operation Brock is still in force. There is a 50mph limit and no hard shoulder which means longer journeys and frequent delays due to broken down vehicles having nowhere to go. Operation Brock should be dismantled until October.",
        "background": "Operation Brock was implemented to create space for parking lorries on the M20 between junction 9 and 8 in preparation for Brexit. By erecting a barrier to separate the London-bound carriageway into two opposing directions with two lanes each, the coast-bound carriageway can become a lorry park.",
