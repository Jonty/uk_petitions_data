        "action": "Increase the sentence time for those caught endangering aircraft with drones",
        "additional_details": "It only took two drones to cause widespread mayhem at Gatwick airport on the 19th and 20th of December requiring the armed forces to be deployed.\r\n\r\nGiven the widespread and increasing availability of drone technology a stronger sentence is the best deterrent to stop further breaches of aircraft safety through drone technology.\r\n\r\nA stronger sentence will prevent even the accidental breach of security as operators will be greatly aware of the consequences of flying a drone in restricted airspace.",
        "background": "A maximum sentence of 5 years for endangering aircraft, those on board, people on the ground as well as the untold catastrophic disruption is too short. I feel that this maximum sentence should be increased to reflect the criminally reckless and dangerous behaviour",
