        "additional_details": "Return to older licensing laws where \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d premises sales of alcohol be restricted to 9 hours in the metropolis, 8 and a half hours elsewhere and 5 hours on sundays and bank holidays. The \u201cLicensing Act 1921\u201d requires a two hour interval and opening hours were 11am - 11pm in London and 11am - 10pm elsewhere. This will create a culture change and reverse some of the ill effects of the liberalisation of the licensing act in 1988.",
        "background": "Binge drinking has become a huge cultural problem in the UK in our towns and cities. People\u2019s selfish behaviour accounts for 12 - 15% of attendances at emergency departments due to acute alcohol intoxication. This peaks to about 70% on Friday, Saturday nights, Christmas Eve and New Years Eve.",
