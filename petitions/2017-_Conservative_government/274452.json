        "background": "Badger culling is ineffective - rates of TB in cattle went up by 130% in key cull areas in 2018. It's also immensely cruel, at least 9k badgers took more than 5 minutes to die in the last cull. Furthermore, with 63,000 badgers due to killed in the current cull, we're pushing them to extinction.",
