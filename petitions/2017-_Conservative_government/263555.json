It is currently under threat of closure due to a major shortfall in funding.\r\n\r\nHelp prevent the erosion of the critical care system for our children & their families requesting Parliament:\r\n(a) Increase baseline funding for children's hospices so that charities are able to raise the balance necessary for hospices' long-term sustainability (b) a safety net fund for hospices in financial difficulty to give time to raise funds to prevent closures.\r\nThe closure of Acorns would result in 100s of families each year losing critical specialist care & put extra pressure on the NHS.\r\n",
