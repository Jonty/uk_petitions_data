This is a firm commitment by the candidate and a strong message to the electorate.\r\n\r\nThey should not continue as MPs if their views have changed so significantly from that advertised.",

Many people take that as meaning they agree with the policies and positions of that party, if they leave the party it's no longer what the people voted on",
