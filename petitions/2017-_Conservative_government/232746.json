        "action": "Apply national space standards to dwellings allowed by permitted development.",
        "additional_details": "It has been reported that in one property in Barnet, for example, 96% of the 254 flats were smaller than the national minimum space standards with the smallest being 16 sqm. In many cases these will be used by more than one adult and even children and contain no outdoor amenity space. It is possible we are storing up a physical and mental health time bomb by creating dwellings of such a small size.",
        "background": "Under permitted development rights offices can be converted into residential units & planning authorities are not allowed to consider the size of the dwellings. This has meant dwellings being created of 15 & 16 sqm in size whereas the national space standards require 37 sqm for 1 adult.",
