        "additional_details": "Among those people denied the right to vote are our skilled labourers, teachers and lecturers. They are people with whom we work alongside in the NHS. Our doctors, nurses and carers who work tirelessly everyday to save lives and to care for the most vulnerable within our communities. We NEED European workers to remain in our services and industries and to feel valued not ignored. To deny them their legal rights when they pay taxes and support our people and economy is a travesty of justice.",
        "background": "Hundreds of EU citizens in the UK were denied their democratic right to vote in the EU election due to unacceptable administrative failures. To deny our Labourers, Teachers, Doctors and Nurses this right is unlawful. We demand that the UK government take action AND investigate immediately.",
