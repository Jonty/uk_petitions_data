But there is no record of how long a member claiming this money actually stays present at the Lords and they can claim it even if they do not participate regularly, e.g. by voting, speaking or sitting on committees.\r\n\r\nHouse of Lords financial support rules: https://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-finance-office/members-guide-may-2018.pdf",

The rules must be changed so that peers can only claim taxpayers' money if they have actively participated in Lords business.",
