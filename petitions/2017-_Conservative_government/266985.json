This needs changing, this needs implementing as a safety matter for people of all ages.\r\nThankfully my son came out OK. However something he won't be forgetting in a hurry. Not all people can say the same story. I'm saddened to see not one petition on helmet safety has made it into parliament discussion. Let's change this!",
        "background": "Wednesday 3rd July my son came off his bike resulting in him heading straight into a concrete wall.\r\nLuckily despite his face being sore, and covered in bruises and scrapes he made it out OK. \r\nI would like the law changing to make it a legal requirement to wear a helmet. Get rid of peer pressure.",
