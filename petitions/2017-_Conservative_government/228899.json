Reduce the fee by putting an end to this nonesense. Add value to the service instead of publicly wasting our money\r\nIt never adds to a broadcast, just makes you more angry",
        "background": "Instead of increasing the license fee, they should be making much more of an effort to reduce their spending, not just salaries, but production costs, pointless features with repetition at the cost of our money. It seems they have a blank canvas to spend how they want. Little added value",
