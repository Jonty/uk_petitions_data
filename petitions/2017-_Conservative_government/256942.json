        "additional_details": "Glue traps cause the unnecessary suffering of many different species. Although normally used to trap pests the glue traps birds, reptiles, amphibians and small mammals. Threatened or endangered species can also become trapped causing protected species to be killed unintentionally.\r\n\r\nAnimals can stay stuck for days before suffering the painful death cause by dehydration. The poor creatures rip skin and chew off limbs in an attempt to escape. \r\n\r\nFor more visit www.facebook.com/animalmadhouse",
        "background": "Glue traps are sold in the UK as a form of pest control. They are cardboard strips coated in a strong adhesive glue that sticks animals to the cardboard. This causes skin, feather and fur to rip, animals chew off limbs to try to escape. Ultimately the animal dies a long painful death.",
