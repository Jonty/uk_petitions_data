        "additional_details": "Adultery is not legally recognised as grounds for marriage dissolution in the UK. The message this sends out is that the laws will selectively discriminate. It also shows a lack of foresight and planning - always check your dependencies (cause and effect of law changes).",
        "background": "When the UK Government welcomed same sex marriage and updated the Marriage Act accordingly, they neglected to sufficiently update the divorce law. We are now living in a country where same sex couples cannot divorce under the grounds of adultery. Where is the equality? Equal rights for all.",
