        "action": "Immediately recall Parliament to save the UK from a no-deal brexit.",
        "additional_details": "Parliament is on recess from 25 July to 3 September 2019. During that time, the government has stuck to its plan for a no-deal brexit. The implications of no-deal for jobs, trade, medicines, the health service, transport and many other parts of the economy are considerable. Already during the recess, the UK economy has shrunk for the first time in seven years, the pound has fallen significantly and clear warnings have been given of the impacts on food shortages and job losses.",
        "background": "It is not good enough that we have a parliament which goes on holiday for more than a month during the worst political crisis in generations. We are concerned at the possibility that the UK could leave the EU with no deal. We are worried about the impact on the economy, jobs, medicines and food.",
