        "additional_details": "If we use re-usable cloth bags, we could save up to 25,000 plastic bags in an average lifetime (and it can take over 1,000 years for a plastic bag to biodegrade).\r\nAccording to the environment department, much progress needs to be made: while 45% of shoppers have bought a reusable bag, only 12% use them. If we could make the supermarkets & shops to give loyalty points to customers using cloth reusable bags, it may potentially reduce plastic bags usage for 40-50%",
        "background": "Supermarkets & other local shops are currently using plastic bags for customers, charging 5p or 10p.These bags contribute to pollution and can easily look like jellyfish if they get into the ocean and thus be mistaken for food by turtles and other animals. \r\nLet's try to replace them with cloth bags",
