        "additional_details": "Myself and my husband have been residents in this country for 9 years and we are both working, paying our taxes and NI. We are not entitled to public funds including child tax credit or child benefit.\r\n\r\nIt is UNFAIR that we get taxed as other working parents/ persons but we are denied the 30 hours free child care. This is harsh, unjust, unacceptable and discriminately. \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-brings-forward-plans-to-double-free-childcare-for-working-families",
        "background": "The conservative government introduced the 30 hours free child care to all working parents in 2016. This was a very welcomed news as it will help greatly with childcare costs.\r\n\r\nI was greatly shocked to realise that we were NOT eligible for the 30hrs because of our immigration status(outside EEA).",
