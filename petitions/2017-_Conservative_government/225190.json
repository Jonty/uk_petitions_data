        "action": "Award a campaign medal to those who fought in France & Norway between 1939-40.",
        "additional_details": "A new campaign medal to retrospectively recognise the sacrifices of those who served in various theatres of WW2 is not without precedent - a Bomber Command clasp and Arctic Convoy medal have both been created in recent years. Thousands of men fought in Norway and in the desperate rearguard action in France in an attempt to halt the Nazi war machine including almost the entire 51st Highland Division. Their courage in the face of the enemy and fortitude as POWs deserves recognition.",
        "background": "There have been medals awarded for most of the major campaigns of WW2 however one glaring omission has been a recognition of those who fought the Nazis in France and Norway period 1939-40. Many of these soldiers became POWs and endured many years suffering with no recognition for their sacrifice.",
