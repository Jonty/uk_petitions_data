        "additional_details": "More car accidents are had on regular roads.\r\nSpeed cameras are on many roads where crashes aren't even a problem. \r\nAmongst restricted parking, restricted roads and roads being flooded with traffic lights, traffic is a problem. Speed cameras further increase this as people slow down just for these cameras.",
        "background": "The motor way is used by drivers to get to further destinations quickly. Having a speed limit is already limiting its use and having an abundance of speed cameras is further limiting it. Making the NSL 80mph will at least contribute to a quicker journey time amongst all these other limitations.",
