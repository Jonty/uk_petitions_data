        "action": "Introduce legislation to protect students from universities and letting agencies",
        "additional_details": "It should be illegal for:\r\n\r\n- Letting agencies and landlords to let below par properties for high rent.\r\n\r\n- Universities who knowingly deliver below par education and still charge high fees.\r\n\r\n- Letting agencies and landlords to overcharge student deposits.\r\n\r\nOne in four students suffer with mental health problems. Students are currently vulnerable and have no protection from the government against these flaws.  Students need to be taken seriously and be seen as the future of this country.",
        "background": "Started by a student who has had exposure to injustice in regards to university, letting agencies and landlords. University is stressful as it is, let alone overpaying for a property that isn't fit for purpose. I want to make life bearable for students who want to better themselves.",
