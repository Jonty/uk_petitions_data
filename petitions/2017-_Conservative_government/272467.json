        "action": "Repeal the Act which prevents no deal with the EU",
        "additional_details": "This Act goes against Article 50 which was passed by parliament and states to leave by the 31st October with a deal or if not, without a deal. This date was extended from the original date of 28th March 2019.  This Act also contradicts  the repeal of the EU Act which repeals all eu law within the UK set to end October 31st 2019 as we may be be in the EU indefinitely.",
        "background": "This Act could keep the UK tied to the EU forever, why would the EU give the UK a good deal or any deal when they know we can never leave the EU without a deal.  This Act is in effect tying the UK to the EU.  The deal will not be one which the majority of the UK voted for in the referendum.",
