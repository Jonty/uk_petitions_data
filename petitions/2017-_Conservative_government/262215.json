        "additional_details": "It\u2019s time for the people of the United Kingdom to once again use our voice and speak up! Nationalise British steel!  Thousands of peoples livelihoods not just in  Scunthorpe but across the UK are at risk.  The steel industry was the pride of the UK not so long ago and has now been whittled down to only two major companies.  Losing British Steel will not only devastate a town it will also devastate a county and other places across the UK and beyond.  With Brexit looming overhead British Steel will be used as a scare tactic into reversing Brexit altogether let\u2019s make this our first great achievement of Brexit. Calling for every man and the woman to stand up And take pride in ourselves and our country we cannot let British Steel go to the Wolves.",
