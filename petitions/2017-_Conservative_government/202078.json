        "action": "Support the secession of Catalonia from The Kingdom of Spain",
        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom respected the will of the Scottish people to hold a referendum and when the result came they respected that as well. The Spanish government has failed miserably to do either of these things. The UK, as a nation which respects the wishes of it's minorities should thus support the Catalan bid for independence and recognize their independence if they chose to declare it. They should also aid the diplomatic efforts to secure a peaceful secession of Catalonia.",
        "background": "The people of Catalonia have voted overwhelmingly to leave Spain despite the attempts of the Spanish Government to stop them. The United Kingdom should recognize the will of the Catalan people and support their peaceful secession from the Kingdom of Spain along with recognizing their independence.",
