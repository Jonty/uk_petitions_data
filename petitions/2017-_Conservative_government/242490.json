        "background": "Shamima Begum, along with 2 others, was a 15 year old school girl who was allowed to leave the UK when under the legal care of her parents, and was not returned by the Foreign Office or Interpol, after being ideologically conditioned into going to Syria to join ISIS as an underage bride and mother.",
