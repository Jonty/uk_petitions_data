        "action": "Make UK taxpayers' salary and tax searchable and revealable to other taxpayers",
        "additional_details": "Any taxpayers whose salary is searched for and revealed will be able to see the name and ref number of the taxpayer who their salary and tax totals have been revealed to. This reduces spurious usage and makes it equitable in that the searcher's salary can be searched for too. Inequality thrives in dark corners, make salary and taxation more open in the UK!",
        "background": "Making taxpayers' salary revealable to other taxpayers is achievable with our digital tax system. Openness about salary and tax paid can act to reduce the gap between boardroom and shop-floor pay, gender pay gap and tax evasion.",
