Having self defence lessons can teach children signs of being followed and how to avoid it to prevent a fatal event to happen. It can also teach children that there are other ways to feel safe while walking the streets rather than ending someone\u2019s life. I don\u2019t believe young people know how to react in situations like this but unfortunately this has become frequent and they should know how.",

One of the main reasons one of the main reasons people carry knives is for self defence so if they have alteratives it can be prevented.",
