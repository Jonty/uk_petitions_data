        "action": "Make the 16/30 free hours worth of childcare available to children from 6 months",
        "additional_details": "The current system is out dated and ridiculous.  There are plenty of families/single parents that want to go out to work when their child is a few months old but are unable to do so because of the crippling prices of childcare fees.  For this reason the government needs to start the free childcare entitlement age to 6+ months, so that every family that wants to go out and work can do so without working to just cover nursery fees.",
        "background": "The government offers 16 hours worth of free childcare when your child is two and either 15/30 free hours for children aged 3-4, what about free childcare for children younger than this for all the parents that want to work but will struggle to do so with the current fees for childcare?",
