        "additional_details": "We're calling on the government to make it unlawful for insurance companies to cover damage caused by tenants whilst specifically excluding any damage caused by the tenants' pets.\r\n\r\nThe Tenant Fees Bill means landlords will not be allowed to ask tenants to pay for insurance against their pets causes damages to the property and 4x the number of landlords surveyed have announced they will no longer accept pets in their properties from 1st June 2019 when the Tenant Fees Bill is expected become law.\r\n\r\nInsurers who cover damage caused by tenants should indiscriminately extend this cover to damage caused by pets owned by the tenant just as it will usually cover damage caused by the tenants or their guests.",
        "background": "Research carried out by Harry Albert Lettings & Estates indicates the private rented sector will become 4x less accessible to tenants with pets as landlords and agents are banned from asking tenants to pay for insurance to protect against the risk of damage caused by the tenant's pets",
