The law defines mopeds as vehicles that are designed to have a maximum speed of 28 miles per hour. A vehicle that goes faster than 28 mph is defined as a motorbike.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. For example, you could start a new petition asking for a minimum legal speed for vehicles on the roads, if that's what you'd like to happen. "
