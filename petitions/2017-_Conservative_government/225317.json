        "additional_details": "If I could attach a video here I would. Lincoln city centre has been taken over by drug abuse and nothing seems to be getting done about it. Someone needs to do something soon as it has made a lot of people uncomfortable and will be having detrimental impact on local businesses. The abusers do not care as to the location in which they carry out these activities whether that a shop door or a bench in the centre of the street.",
        "background": "Homelessness is sad, I understand that. But to be openly injecting heroin and using other drugs in the middle of the day, in the center of town is wrong. After calling the police three times and being told it's not a priority what else can be done!?",
