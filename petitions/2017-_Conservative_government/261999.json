        "additional_details": "The housing market one of the main drivers of the British economy is crippled by this high tax. More home buyers will spend money on their new purchase making it their home. They will spend on kitchens, bathrooms, furniture, carpets, curtains, decorators, new windows, local builders, etc. That's without the extra VAT being raised on Conveyancing, Agent, Architects, fees, etc. Also what an incentive to new homes builders. Their homes will be more affordable giving them an incentive to build more.",
        "background": "One thing George Osbourne got seriously wrong was to increase massively the taxes on our homes. SDLT or stamp duty is now huge, introducing much higher costs for a property purchase resulting in fewer transactions. Less people are now able to buy, culminating in less being able to sell.",
