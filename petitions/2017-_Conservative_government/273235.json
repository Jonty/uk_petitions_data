        "additional_details": "Dementia is a terminal condition. The life expectancy for someone with dementia in a care home is the same as for someone with metastatic breast cancer. People in the later stages of dementia lack mental capacity so there is reluctance to be more proactive in end of life care yet I feel this is precisely the reason that these people need support to die with dignity and unnecessary suffering.\r\nI want Archie\u2019s death to start a conversation about assisted dying for end stage Dementia patients.",
        "background": "My Grandad Archie suffered from the devastating effects of Dementia for 5 years. Slowly and painfully he lost the ability to speak, swallow, walk and even sit up. Archie\u2019s final hours saw him slowly suffocate without palliative care support. His inevitable death was prolonged and undeserved.",
