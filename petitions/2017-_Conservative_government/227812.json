        "additional_details": "\"Just months after closing, the Poolway Shopping Centre in Garretts Green, Birmingham looks like a ghost town. A series of photos released by the Press Association show the complex built in 1961, is now derelict and neglected, with rows of shuttered shops. Only 2 stores remain, and two families live in the flats above them, waiting to be relocated. The site, which was compulsory purchased by Birmingham City Council, is planned to be the new home for the Birmingham Museums Trust.\" - BBC Midlands",
        "background": "BCC want to turn a closed down shopping centre into a museum - when housing should be a priority! There are already tenants living the flats above awaiting to be re-housed - which is understandable if the place to be raised to the ground, however the future use of the land is not what our city needs",
