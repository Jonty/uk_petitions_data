        "additional_details": "Maintenance Loans are 100% repayable.\r\nShould cover rent + bills + school expenses but is not enough to cover even rent if studying in London.\r\n\r\nPart of the maintenance loan is supposed to go towards school expenses - for Art students, this is a particularly large sum.\r\n\r\nDWP add the full loan amount into their calculations as income, they do not take substantial expenses, such as deposit towards housing, into consideration as an expense for the student.\r\n\r\nIt has become a privileged situation to be able to study in this country and this shouldn't be the case when studying towards your first degree. Those who haven't got parents to rely on to fill in the gaps in their budgets and are struggling to find part-time jobs are left with no options.",
        "background": "As per DWP, full - time Students in the UK are currently not entitled to any benefits and are solely dependant on their maintenance loan.\r\n\r\nPart-time students may claim limited universal credit and it is hard for them to find part-time work as employer preference remains full-time employment.",
