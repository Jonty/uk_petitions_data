        "action": "Annul the result of United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016.",
        "additional_details": "Although political constitutionalism allow those who felt they have been lied to to punish the parties in the next election, given that this was a referendum which started a irreversible process of the UK leaving the EU, those who felt they have voted based on misrepresentations and lies do not have the opportunity to punish the parties and stop or reverse the process. As such, the result of the referendum should be annulled.",
        "background": "Gross misrepresentation and possible outright lying by proponents of the UK leaving the EU have misled the electorate, which resulted in a referendum result that will cause long-lasting harm to the economical and social health of the UK.",
