        "additional_details": "In Scotland, Upskirting is an illegal offence, and has been since 2010. Victims and police are only able to pursue offences of voyeurism and indecency, with a Freedom of Information request made by the Press Association revealing that the police have pursued 78 offences related to upskirting since 2015 - but only 11 led to alleged offenders being charged.",
        "background": "Upskirting is the act of taking a photograph of underneath a person's skirt without their consent. It is often performed in a public place such as on public transport or on an escalator. Many women across the UK are targeted in places such as nightclubs, restaurants and shops. This needs to stop.",
