        "additional_details": "The worryingly popular petition which aims to prevent Brexit is garnering millions of signatures, those of the 48% of people who voted not to leave the EU when the 2016 Brexit referendum was held. On that day, a majority of British citizens decided that we should leave the EU. This decision has not been respected by many in Parliament, and those who believe that we should remain in the EU are taking the opportunity to attempt to circumvent the will of the majority and if democracy itself.",
        "background": "52% of British Citizens voted for Brexit, therefore those who sign this petition should be of the opinion that democracy should be upheld no matter the result of the \u201cRevoke Article 50 and remain in the EU\u201d petition. The country was consulted, and the result of the referendum should be respected.",
