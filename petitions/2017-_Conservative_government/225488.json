        "additional_details": "Recent channel 4 Dispatches found that Facebook's moderators were not removing child physical abuse images from its platform, they merely place a warning on the images. Similarly, the mail online recently showed a graphic video of a mother beating her twins for profit. It is my belief that by leaving this kind of footage on media, whereby you needn\u2019t seek it out, desensitises the public, normalises this behaviour and justifies mimicking. Any abuse of children should be taken as seriously as sex abuse",
        "background": "Failing to censor this material on platforms that are at so many peoples\u2019 fingertips normalises this behaviour and perpetuates child abuse. Social and news medias have a responsibility to protect the vulnerable. These platforms must stop putting revenue before child safety by reporting and censoring",
