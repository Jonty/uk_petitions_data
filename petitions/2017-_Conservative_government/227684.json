        "action": "Remove hemp from schedule 1 and reclassify as an agricultural crop.",
        "additional_details": "With Brexit looming, the UK needs to become self-reliant for our sources of food, energy, fuel and raw materials. Hemp is the perfect crop to provide all of these. Hemp seeds are a nutritionally complete food. The plant could replace cotton. It's an abundant source of cellulose so can make paper and plastic. It needs no pesticides, pulls carbon from the atmosphere, prevents soil erosion and absorbs toxins from the soil, helping to prevent climate change, and it only takes 3 months to grow.",
        "background": "We are calling for the immediate withdrawal of hemp from Schedule 1 and urgent reclassification as an industrial and agricultural crop. It should not be regulated under the Misuse of Drugs Act at all, let alone put in the most restrictive category alongside dangerous class As.",
