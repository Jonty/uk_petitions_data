Also viewing the horrific and unimaginable stories on the recent Madeleine McCann documentary which highlights in graphic and chilling detail the extent of these most horrifying of crimes that as we speak are being perpetrated against young and vulnerable children across the UK and the globe. This most evil of crimes requires innovative ideas, funding and support from central government.",
        "background": "Live child abuse, trafficking and exploitation are horrific matters that are not sufficiently funded, nor are they taken seriously enough by central government who pay lip service to this incredibly important blight upon our society affecting the most vulnerable. More needs to be done and NOW.",
