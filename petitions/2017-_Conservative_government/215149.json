Both; General Practice \u2013 Developing confidence, capability and capacity (NHS England, 2017) and General Practice Nursing (GPN) Workforce Development Plan \u2013 Recognise, Rethink and Reform (HEE, 2017), are encouraging responses, however neither address the \u201celephant in the room\u201d. Pay and conditions are central to the recruitment and retention of GPN\u2019s and must be addressed.",
        "background": "General Practice Nurses (GPN\u2019s) are not directly employed by the NHS and so a great deal of disparity exists amongst the pay and employment conditions offered by individual employers. Some GPN\u2019s cannot access training and receive only statutory levels of sick pay, maternity pay and annual leave.",
