        "additional_details": "We believe that there should be an overall maximum an individual should ever face paying and that the Government should introduce a cap on care costs. The average cost of a care home place is \u00a3600 a week. If anyone needing support has capital, including the value of any property, or income above \u00a323250, it is likely they will be liable for care fees. People should not be forced to sell their home to pay for care. It is time to cap care costs!",
        "background": "Last year as many as 50000 pensioners were forced to sell their home to pay for care. In a survey, two thirds of people said they believed social care care payments should be shared between them and the Government. But nine in 10 want a solid cap on contributions from individuals.",
