        "additional_details": "Guidance notes have been issued for councils to use, to enforce the new law but they contradict the legislation in places and there are many grey areas open to interpretation. The guidance notes do not seem to cover all aspects of the regulations, and in other places seem to bear no relevance to the regulations. The guidance seems to be aimed at bigger day care centres and small home businesses will be forced to close. Some have already taken the decision to not apply for a new license at all.",
        "background": "New regulations for licensed activities involving animals are coming into force on October 1st. Two activities covered are day care for dogs and home boarding for dogs. The new law is contradictory and unclear in many aspects and will force a large number of home businesses to have to close.",
