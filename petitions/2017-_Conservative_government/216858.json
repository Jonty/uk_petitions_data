        "additional_details": "Plastic straws take 200 years to break down and in the UK alone, 550 million straws are thrown away each DAY. Can you imagine the impact this is having on our oceans and wildlife? A healthy ocean provides resilience to climate change and if this problem is not resolved, we are simply allowing humanity to kill our planet.",
        "background": "Plastic has a major impact on our environment and oceans. By banning the use of plastic straws, we can replace them with paper straws to ensure we can drastically impact our environment in a positive way. Our oceans will be cleaner and the wildlife in these oceans will be safer.",
