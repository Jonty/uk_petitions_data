        "additional_details": "Many road uses when passing these slow machines that achieve 30mph as their top speed pass closely to the rear wheel which is very dangerous and could have the rider come of and sustain injuries but if the rider was able to ride a 125cc motorbike instead then they could keep up with the flow of traffic as these machines tend to have a top speed of 65-70mph this makes them safer on the higher speed roads while still not being to fast to encourage new riders to speed as they often can\u2019t get any faster.",
        "background": "I live in an area where the speed of the roads is 60mph and most 50cc motorbikes can only achieve 30mph as standard and this low speed makes all other road users pass including lorry\u2019s which for a new rider may be quite daunting especially for those who unfortunately are of the less confident",
