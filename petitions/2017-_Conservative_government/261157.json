        "additional_details": "Pets are currently property under UK law, this means upon dispute the person who can prove that they bought the animal will be the one who is allowed to keep it. Many family pets are viewed as valued members of their families, upon the break-down of a relationship the family pet can become an area of contention, causing emotional distress and a delay to proceedings. This petition argues that family pets should not be viewed as property in divorce proceedings, but as the valued family members that they are. The court should have the ability to act in the best interests of the animal, awarding joint custody to both parties if necessary.",
