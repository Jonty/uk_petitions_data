        "additional_details": "Many 16 year olds are expected to start becoming self sufficient at 16, paying for transport and their own clothes, phone contracts etc. Working long hours on \u00a34.20 is really not allowing 16 year olds to be able to afford such things. As well as this, we cannot save for things such as a car or even put money towards university fees in the future. As long as we\u2019re working the same hours and doing the same jobs, the \u00a31.70 pay difference an hour isn\u2019t fair.",
        "background": "Minimum wage for a 16 year old is \u00a34.20 an hour, but at 18 it is \u00a35.90. Many 16 year olds do the same work as their older colleagues, so why is there a pay difference? Prices such as train fares go up a lot at the age of 16, and \u00a34.20 is not enough to pay for prices of transport among other things.",
