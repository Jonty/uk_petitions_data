The UK would need 60,000 officers to keep track of 3,000 known suspects around the clock.  Removing such people far from the UK would leave MI5 free to concentrate on those who are a clear and present danger.",

In particular, we're not sure what you mean by \"exile\". The UK Government does not have the power to force other countries to accept British Citizens. \r\n\r\nForeign national offenders can already be deported under the UK Borders Act 2007. So we're not sure exactly what else you'd like the Government or Parliament to do. You can find out more here: \r\n\r\nhttp://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-8062\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.
