        "additional_details": "The A628 road is every day heavily congested, there is a planned project to utilise Roll on Roll off trains taking trucks off the Woodhead Pass, this would be a business cost saving on fuel wear & tare to the haulage industry, and reduce the Carbon Footprint improving the environment for the communities along the A628 route. Also reopening the line allows another cross Penine rail line to ease the pressure of the current Penine Rail routes.",
