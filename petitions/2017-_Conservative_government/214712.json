        "additional_details": "To run a Business, premises are often required. Different types of Businesses have different requirements. For example, a Small Office Business may run with low Business Rates and a high turn-over. Where as a Small Manufacturer may require a much larger premises, huge Business Rates, and have a smaller profit margin. We need a fairer and balanced Business Rates system that works for the different types of Businesses, because at the moment it is killing our Small Businesses and preventing growth",
        "background": "Business Rates in this country are driving existing Businesses into debt and liquidation, preventing them from expanding and new Businesses from forming. The extortionate cost of Business Rates are set far too high and there is very little help available and no incentive for Local Councils to help",
