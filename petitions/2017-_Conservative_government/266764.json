        "additional_details": "Enjoyed by so many families over the years; children allowed to take part behind the scenes & on stage was a great way for all to get involved. A way for all the forces to show their abilities in a fun way and for the public to show their respect, support and thanks. By adding Veterans, would enable the nation to show their gratitude & respect to those past & present who are prepared to pay the ultimate price for our security & freedom. Does NOT glorify war. Let's be proud to be British again!\r\n",
