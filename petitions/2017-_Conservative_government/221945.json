        "action": "Add metric km/h to speed signs under the imperial mph sign.",
        "additional_details": "This would make it easier to judge distance for younger people as younger people are being taught the metric system. As most cars have km/h along side mph this would mean it would have almost instant impact. Also it is great for tourists and european people that come from a totally metric county drive safer.",
        "background": "So as the Metric system is a lot easier to convert lengths through I think we should convert our measurements to km/h while keeping the mph sign for old road users. I think we should add the km/h sign under the mph road sign with a different coloured ring (green maybe) and km/h after it.",
