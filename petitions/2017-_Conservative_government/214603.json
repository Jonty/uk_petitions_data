        "additional_details": "https://www.facebook.com/StopCareHomeAbuseNow/ and \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/supportstowell/ have been established to gain support for and to discover more about cases of care home abuse, as well as getting the story from the other side of the carers - some of who have spoken out about abuse they have witnessed and sadly been silenced and removed from their positions/jobs. Additionally, some family members who have raised their concerns have been threatened & blocked from seeing their relatives.",
        "background": "There are a raft of reports and incidents where claims are made that elderly residents are being abused, both physically and mentally in care homes and nursing home facilities.  It must be made law for CCTV to be installed in ALL facilities to ensure the safety of both residents & carers alike.",
