        "action": "Allow the Magistrates court to review police investigations after 4 months.",
        "additional_details": "What this means is that people are being released from police custody with no charge, however, can remain under investigation for often longer. As a result this will have an impact on many people e.g by losing their jobs or suffering emotional distress. In order to prevent this there needs to be an option for individuals to have their investigation reviewed by the Magistrates court after a 4 month period. This will ensure that the investigation is being conducted in a fair and just manner.",
        "background": "In April 2017, the government made provisions to police bail prior to charge. This meant that people were no longer kept on bail without charge for months and often years. Almost a year down the line we have seen this change give birth to many individuals being released under investigation.",
