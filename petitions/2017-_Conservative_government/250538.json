        "additional_details": "Some of the people who voted have now died, but the 16/18-21yo have not had a say and are still alive and they have to go along with a decision which they had no part of. The very core of democracy is that ALL people should have a vote and depriving people of it is tantamount to being a dictatorship. Young people are more politically engaged and will vote, this would not be a waste of time. This may break the Brexit deadlock. #Under21EUVote #ItsOurfuture",
        "background": "Theresa May describes Brexit as the 'will of the people' but people under 21 didn't get to vote. I propose offering 16/18-21yo the chance to vote on the original referendum, as a sort of top up vote. This would be added to the original figures and may break the deadlock.",
