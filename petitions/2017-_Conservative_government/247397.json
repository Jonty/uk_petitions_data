Right now an estimated 12.7 million tonnes of plastic \u2013 everything from plastic bottles and bags to micro beads \u2013 end up in our oceans each year. That\u2019s a truck load of rubbish a minute. This is the time for us to make a change! Our oceans are slowly turning into a plastic soup and the effects on ocean lives are chilling please help us to reduce plastic as soon as possible",
        "background": "Plastic is a major issue around the UK! Each year, 400 million tonnes of plastic is produced and 40% of that is single used, more than 8 million tonnes of plastic enters the world's oceans each year, and most of that escapes from land. Please sign this petition if you want to save the environment.",
