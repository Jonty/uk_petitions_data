        "additional_details": "The case FOR 'No Deal': \r\n1 We'll be free to strike our OWN trade deals with others\r\n2 We'll be free of all EU entanglements \r\n3 If we leave with no deal, we owe them NOTHING. There's no legal mechanism for the EU to recover a penny from us after 29 March 2019 \r\n4 We'll be free to control our own borders\r\n5 We'll be free from European Court of Justice jurisdiction \r\n6 If they threaten loss of access to their market, we must simply  threaten the same to them. They sell more to us than we do to them",
        "background": "It's now 1 year 4 months since Britain voted to LEAVE the EU. The EU's negotiators show no willingness to offer us a fair deal. The practical way forward, to fulfill the Referendum decision, is therefore to actively prepare to leave WITHOUT a deal, moving to World Trade \r\nOrganisation rules ASAP.",
