        "additional_details": "The attempts to propose yet another referendum and poise a set of questions to the British public on the final deal is a distasteful proposal, considering we were already given a free and fair referendum last year, to now agree to another referendum would be an appalling waste of taxpayers money and send out the wrong message to the British public that the vote last year was meaningless.\r\n\r\nThe referendum should not be re-run just to placate individuals unable to accept a democratic decision.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, herby call upon HM government to dismiss calls for a referendum on the final deal as the British people were asked an important question on the 23rd June last year, the choices were abundantly clear, remain or leave the European Union and leave won a decisive vote.",

            "details": "The decision to hold the referendum was supported by a clear majority in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and the referendum was the largest democratic mandate in UK political history. In the 2017 General Election more than 85% of people voted for parties committed to respecting that result.\r\n\r\nThere must be no attempts to remain inside the European Union, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door, and no second referendum. The country voted to leave the European Union, and it is the duty of the Government to make sure we do just that. Rather than second guess the British people\u2019s decision to leave the European Union, the challenge now is to make a success of it; not just for those who voted to leave but for every citizen of the United Kingdom, bringing together everyone in a balanced approach which respects the decision to leave the political structure of the EU, but builds a strong relationship between Britain and the EU as neighbours, allies and partners.\r\n\r\nBoth Houses of Parliament will have the opportunity to vote on the final agreement reached with the EU before it is concluded. This will be a meaningful vote which will give MPs the choice to either accept the final agreement or leave the EU with no agreement.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, but we are not leaving Europe. We want a deep and special partnership with the EU. We aim to get the right deal abroad and the right deal for people here at home. We will deliver a country that is stronger, fairer, more united and more outward-looking than ever before.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union",
            "summary": "On 23 June 2016 the British people voted to leave the European Union. The UK Government is clear that it is now its duty to implement the will of the people and so there will be no second referendum. ",
