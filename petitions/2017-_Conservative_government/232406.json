        "additional_details": "For years, some supermarkets/retailers have been selling unlabeled halal and kosher meat; whilst it's good that these animals were raised humanely, unfortunately that doesn't mean that they were slaughtered humanely - and customers deserve to know exactly how these animals were treated during their lifetimes and at the time of slaughter. \r\nAfter all, egg packages already say whether or not the hens were caged or free range. Why shouldn't the same thing apply to other livestock!?",
        "background": "Currently there is no legal requirement for supermarkets/suppliers to declare how animals are slaughtered for meat. We have the right to know the slaughter method and if they were treated humanely, e.g. were they stunned or conscious? Information should be provided to help make informed choices.",
