        "action": "Government to place a Bill before Parliament to legalise Pre-nuptial agreements",
        "additional_details": "We call upon the Government to place a forced marriages and marriage contract Bill before Parliament which would repeal the current Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007.\r\n\r\nThe Bill would allow the prevention of the equitable aspects of marriage being used as an instrument of fraud - strengthening the true intentions of the contracting parties. It would also impose set criminal and civil sanctions for the act of \u2018forcing\u2019 a marriage contract.",
        "background": "The Government has failed consistently to legislate to legalise Pre-nuptial agreements and to set civil and criminal penalties for commercially and \u2018culturally\u2019 forced marriage. These issues need to be addressed urgently to strengthen the rights of all marriage contracts post-2013.",
