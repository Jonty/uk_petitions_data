        "additional_details": "Legislation pertaining to the rearing of commercial broilers does not prevent unnecessary suffering. Instead it can cause it. Stocking densities must reflect the chickens' need for space. The Five Freedoms should be more than something to aspire to. Points 4 and 5 are almost wholly overlooked. The law should ensure that these birds can grow free from unnecessary distress caused by a lack of space: like feather pecking.  They should also be able to express normal behaviour: like scratching.",
        "background": "Housing requirements for commercial broilers are not conducive to good health and well-being. Birds should be allowed to exhibit normal behaviour and to live free from distress.  Non-commercial keepers would be committing an offence, under the Animal Welfare Act, if they adopted farming conditions.",

We can't accept new petitions if they are very similar to petitions that are open.
