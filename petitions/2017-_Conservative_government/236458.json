Landlord is suddenly claiming halfway through the lease that in the terms of present lease it states that it will terminate this lease end with no renewal - this is not true, it is the landlord manipulating by using a play on words. Conveyancing solicitors did not advise tenants against buying as was not transparent to them either.",
