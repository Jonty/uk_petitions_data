        "additional_details": "The goal of this petition is for parliament to endorse body positivity by stopping the media and the fashion industry, labelling women and models as \u201csuper skinny\u201d, \u201cplus size\u201d, \u201cbig boned\u201d etc. because this causes women and young girls to feel as though they only belong in one sector in society. \r\nThanks for taking the time to read this and i hope that you consider signing my petition to put an end to labelling women.",
        "background": "As a young woman, it\u2019s hard enough to feel confidence with your body, especially when the media tells you that you have to look a certain way. \r\nIn my mind, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a size 4,10,20 etc. you should still feel beautiful in your own skin.",
