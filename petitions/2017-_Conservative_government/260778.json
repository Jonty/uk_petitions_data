        "additional_details": "Hydrogen can be produced by electrolising water. Hydrogen, or fuel cell, power plants exist in Italy and Korea. Soon in the Netherlands a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant will have a conversion to Hydrogen power. Using our existing renewable power installations when production outweighs demand, we can power the process of electrolising water and producing Hydrogen to be used in fuel cell plants. The byproduct of burning hydrogen as a fuel source is water.",
        "background": "Climate change is here! We need to act fast to limit the damage we will do for future generations. The ability to burn fossil fuels for energy is finite and sends tons of CO2 into the atmosphere daily. Hydrogen can be produced by renewable sources and used as a type of battery to store energy.",
