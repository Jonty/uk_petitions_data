        "action": "Switch to quiet fireworks & prohibit unlicensed displays.",
        "additional_details": "By prohibiting unlicensed displays it would decrease hospital admissions caused by the mishandling of fireworks and put less of a strain on emergency services. It would also ensure fireworks are not being set off outwith organised displays, therefore protecting animals from unnecessary suffering and in more serious cases death due to underlying health conditions or running from their owners and being hit by a stray firework or even a car. It's time for a change.",
        "background": "Quiet fireworks have grown increasingly common because they rely on rich color effects, visual choreography but go without the explosiveness usually associated with fireworks which would reduce stress in animals, children, the elderly and even those with PTSD.",
