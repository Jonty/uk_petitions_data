        "additional_details": "NATO was founded in 1949 by the United States as a military alliance between western nations to oppose the Soviet Union and serve a purpose in defending the west against the eastern block. However, today NATO is now a cold war relic. Britain should take control over its military affairs and its foreign policy to prevent the country from getting involved in wars.  We should follow our own operations rather than following NATO.",
