        "additional_details": "It\u2019s the British government\u2019s responsibility to deal with it here, under British jurisdiction because this is where it started.\r\n\r\nShe was a victim of child grooming and radicalisation and she deserves a second chance. If she were to return she should be put through the justice system and thoroughly investigated but if she were to stay in Syria for any longer she could potentially become more of a danger to us if she even is in the first place. \r\n\r\nIn the end, she is a teenager and she is a victim.",
