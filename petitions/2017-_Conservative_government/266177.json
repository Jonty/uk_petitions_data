        "additional_details": "The EU regulation requiring manufacturers to label plastic content o packaging is not until 2021. By then we will have used another 22,000,000,000 (twenty-two billion) wet wipes. Some of us will flush them down the toilet, creating fatbergs (plastic clogs in sewers) and releasing microplastics into the oceans. This can be avoided if the consumer knows what they are buying and make an educated decision. For more information, watch: \"Fighting the War against Plastic\" on BBC",
        "background": "We all are wet wipe fanatics in this country. But what we don't know is that wet wipes contain 85% plastic. There is absolutely no reason why the manufacturers cannot own up to this fact and stick on a label. They should take responsibility and give the consumers the right to an educated choice.",
