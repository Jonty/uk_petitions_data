        "additional_details": "This aim to encourage people to take a reusable cup to the coffee shop and have an effect similar to the carrier bag 5p charge introduced in 2015, that reduced use of single plastic carrier bags by 83%.\r\n\r\nIn the 25 Year Environment Plan the Government states that \"Waste is choking our oceans and despoiling our landscapes as well as contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and scarring habitats\". This might be one way to tackle this issue.",
        "background": "Around 7 million coffee cups are thrown away in Britain every day. That is 2.5 billion per year. Of all this, only around 1% is properly recycled, which means 6.930.000 cups going to landfill every single day. The material is not easy to recycle; and the few that are, are treated as general waste.",
