        "action": "Make it illegal to sell religiously slaughtered meat unlabelled.",
        "additional_details": "The law says \"labelling must not be misleading\". It also says religiously slaughtered meat \"must be done in a way that follows Jewish and Islamic religious practice and that the meat must be intended for consumption by Jews or Muslims\". These laws are clearly being breached and ignored. EU codes confirm that meat in our supermarkets is from halal slaughterhouses and is being sold on by stealth, unlabelled. Honest clear labelling is our right, an informed choice against religious slaughter.",
        "background": "The public have the right to an informed choice and are unaware the meat they buy is cast off Halal or rejected Kosher because it's not labelled, they are, therefore, being misled. Many religions are forbidden to eat meat that's had a blessing to a false god. Others object to barbaric slaughter.",
