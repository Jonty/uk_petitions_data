        "action": "Increase LGBTQ+ awareness in the sex  education and relationships curriculum",
        "additional_details": "With more LGBTQ+ representation in the media, more and more children and adolescents are exploring their sexuality with little to no education about it. Subsequently, as they grow up, they have very little knowledge of such interactions. Children are made to feel isolated and different due to the exclusion of LGBTQ+ material in the curriculum, leading them to think they are wrong for feeling different to the \"apparent norm\".",
        "background": "With the legalisation of gay marriage in 2012 and a persistent increase of gay rights in the United Kingdom, it's time that the curriculum caught up with the modern world. The curriculum is dominated by heterosexual information, but lacks anything for the LGBTQ+ community, and this must change.",
