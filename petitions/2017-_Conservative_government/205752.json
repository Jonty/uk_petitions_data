This would also prevent the high numbers who resort to going to A&E to try and find help because there are so few alternatives. Let's protect vulnerable people.",
        "background": "Often people who feel suicidal are discharged from mental health services, against their will. This can gravely increase the risk to their lives and causes needless deaths. No one who feels suicidal and asks for help should be turned away.",
