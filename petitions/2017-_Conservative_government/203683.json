        "action": "Garages must provide free air & water in working order for drivers at all times.",
        "additional_details": "There were 8459 petrol stations in the UK in 2016 (Source: Statista) The experience of many drivers nationally is that air & water services are often lacking, of poor quality, not working & / or expensive. \r\nOil companies & government make profit & tax revenue from motorists. This petition seeks to ensure that drivers may be assured of the free provision of air & water services, maintained in good working order at all times, this being a condition of trading for all garages throughout the UK.",
        "background": "Road safety requires that drivers maintain vehicles by law, yet garages charge for & / or fail to provide working air and water at petrol stations. This petition seeks a legal requirement, that all petrol stations must provide free air & water services at all times as a condition of trading.",
