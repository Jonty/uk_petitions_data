        "additional_details": "I came to Britain in 2007 and when it came to finally doing my naturalisation in 2019 I realised that I had to do a B1 test. B1 test is for testing one\u2019s English understanding. I obtained my GCSEs in England and I am currently studying at an University level but I am still required to do an English understanding test and since I grew up in England. It is insulting to be spoken to as child who does understand. I Believe  that the test should not be a requirement if you have GCSEs or equivalent .",
        "background": "None-English speakers who were raised in The UK  and went to school in the UK and gained at least a level 2 or equivalent qualification should not do an English understanding test also known as (B1).B1 test should not be for those who were raised and went to school in the UK because it is insulting.",
