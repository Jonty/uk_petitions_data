        "additional_details": "The red, amber and green food labelling has made it easier to identify healthier food and drinks but added sugar can still only be identified by going through the list of ingredients. In a time of increasing numbers of diabetes, obesity, cancer and other conditions a healthy lifestyle should be made easy. Natural sugar is still sugar but the way healthier option as it comes combined with nutrients.",
        "background": "Being in the situation of needing to make lifestyle changes and cutting down on sugar, it turned out to be a lot more difficult to find food and drinks without added sugar than expected. Most processed food contains added sugar, not just the obvious sweets, cake and fizzy drinks!",
