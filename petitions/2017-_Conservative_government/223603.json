        "action": "Add recycling to the curriculum. Even if it's 1 day a year - possibly a visit.",
        "additional_details": "School is where we learn life skills, preparing us for adulthood. Recycling is currently not as efficient as it could be because the public are not fully educated. Personally I've attended beach cleans, researched where to recycle electronics / printer parts / clothes... It is all difficult to follow.\r\n\r\nIf schools had one lesson a year dedicated to recycling.\r\nMaybe an expert from the industry could visit, they would learn the common mistakes of recyclers. Some would see it as a career path.",
        "background": "Incorrect recycling costs taxes.\r\nI received a leaflet about what can be recycled in my area. It also explained the process which interested me. I think more education is needed.\r\n\r\nChildren are the future this will help them recycle correctly or even improve the system.",
