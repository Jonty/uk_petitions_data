        "additional_details": "Currently councils allow owners of void properties to pay double council tax in order  to remain empty for an indefinite period. Surely as there is a housing crisis and also a demand for social housing - most people cannot afford to buy - owners should not be allowed to sit on empty dwellings, whereby the purpose of the building is to be lived in? There should be a scheme for them to at least rent, as this would also provided much needed housing  also stop the building falling into disrepair.",
        "background": "There are numerous properties across the UK that are owned but are classed by the local council as 'void' meaning empty.  Most of these properties would make good homes for local people who wish to either rent of buy.  There should be a maximum period where they remain empty, ie no more than 2 years",
