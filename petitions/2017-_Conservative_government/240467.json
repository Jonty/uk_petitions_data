        "additional_details": "Police are failing to identify suspects in more than 90% of car thefts. Criminals have no fear being caught. The number of vehicles being stolen in the UK has risen to its highest level. Organised criminal gangs often break into homes for car keys and steal high value cars in order to ship them overseas or to \u2018strip them to a bolt\u2019 to sell the parts. A tracker built into a vehicle would help police track the vehicle down instantly. This would deter car thieves and reduce car thefts dramatically.",
        "background": "On 30/01/19 my home was broken into. My safe place violated. They took my car keys and stole my high spec car. Unfortunately it didn\u2019t have a tracker. This kind of crime is on the increase. A vast number of people are made to feel violated and victimised in their own homes every day. I am not alone.",
