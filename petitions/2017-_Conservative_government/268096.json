        "action": "Reduce company car tax for when the car is a genuine tool and not a pure perk.",
        "additional_details": "Years ago, there used to be a reduction in company car tax if drivers did over a certain amount of mileage purely for business purposes and people having the car purely as a perk were penalised, i.e managers who only drive to their own office and back. Now, drivers such as service engineers and sales reps have to pay very large amounts of tax for having a vehicle that is absolutely necessary for their job. A reintroduction of a fairer system would be greatly appreciated.",
        "background": "The increasing company car tax (BIK) is unfair on drivers who use the car almost entirely for business, for example service engineers and sales reps. It is particularly mean on those who are home based and are not allowed the option of leaving the car in the firm's car park when not in use.",
