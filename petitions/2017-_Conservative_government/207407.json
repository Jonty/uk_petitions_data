        "action": "Make it law that animals slaughtered are given proper anaesthetic and stunning.",
        "additional_details": "This petition calls for three additional laws to protect animals killed. \r\nThere will be: first, second and third class animals slaughter offences. They should be titled 'cruelty during slaughter of animals.'\r\n\r\nA first class offence will be acts of sadism by slaughterhouse workers and deliberate suffering to an animal. (Up to 9 years custody)\r\nA second class offence will be refusing to comply with the stunning laws. (Up to 2 years custody)\r\nA third class offence will be failure to comply (\u00a35k fine).",
        "background": "Under the 'Slaughter of Animals Act 1933' all animals must be stunned at slaughter. Sadly it did not apply to all cases and animals killed for religious meat can still have their throats legally slit and the blood drained out of them.\r\nThis petition calls for the religious exemption to be scrapped.",
