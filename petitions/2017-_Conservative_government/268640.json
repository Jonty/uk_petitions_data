        "additional_details": "When the referendum happened and we voted to leave the EU no one asked us, the public what type of Brexit we wanted and, more importantly, whether we would be happy to leave without a deal or not. The EU is our biggest trading partner and a no deal Brexit could threaten many jobs and our economy yet we have had no say as to whether we, the public would accept this. Give us the chance to accept the withdrawal deal even if the backstop is still in it or leave with no deal. Let the public decide.",
        "background": "The Government has said they will leave with no deal if the backstop isn't dropped but, although we voted to leave, no one asked us if we, the public want to leave with no deal or take the withdrawal deal offered. It should be our decision not the Government as this affects all of us.",
