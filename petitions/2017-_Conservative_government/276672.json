All shareholders of newspapers should be expected to pay tax with no avoidance whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe British press is already least trusted in the EU: https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/survey-finds-that-uk-written-press-is-by-some-way-the-least-trusted-in-europe/\r\n\r\nIf this petition becomes law, this will go a long way into remedying that.",
