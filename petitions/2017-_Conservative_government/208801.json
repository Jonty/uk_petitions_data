        "additional_details": "Bed blocking is a major problem in NHS hospitals, with some patients being medically fit for discharge but having no care provision upon discharge. Family members cannot provide adequate care, with carers allowance at just \u00a363 per week, they simply cannot afford to give up work. \r\nWith hospital beds costing around \u00a3400 per day, a patient staying a week longer than necessary costs the NHS \u00a32800 a week. Bringing carers allowance inline with NMW will save the NHS potentially \u00a3millions per year.",
        "background": "It costs around \u00a3400 per day per patient in an acute hospital bed. The NHS is under increasing pressures due to cuts in social care. \r\nBring carers allowance in line with national minimum wage, to allow family/friends to care for sick or elderly relatives and free up hospital beds.",
