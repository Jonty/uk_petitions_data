        "additional_details": "I would like a return to the Medical Assessment prior to 2008.\r\n\r\nThis would mean all Chronically Sick people on ESA who have a medical certificate from the GP stating they are unfit for work would all be examined by an Independent doctor appointed by the DWP to decide if they are fit for work. \r\n\r\nSince 2008 the WCA has proved very controversial because the assessment does not have an Independent doctor examining each person to decide if in their clinical judgement they are fit for work.",
        "background": "Between 1995-2008 I was examined by 5 Independent doctors appointed by the DWP to decide if I was fit for work.They all concurred I was not. In 2016 I was examined by the Work Capability Assessment. DWP  decided I had a capacity for work. My GP disagreed. Decision Overturned at Medical Tribunal\r\n\r\nI",
