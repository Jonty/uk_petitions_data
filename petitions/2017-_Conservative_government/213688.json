        "action": "Stop allowing biased TV producers from profiting from propaganda.",
        "additional_details": "For decades the BBC and other TV producers have invaded our homes with propaganda without interference. For decades people have been expected to pay for this, an amount which goes up year on year regardless of the value of service. The people are sick of this and demand that these companies either conform to the charter or accept that license fees will be reduced and/or scraped. Biased TV companies should have their licence fee money reduced.",
        "background": "Those who have access to the TV licence fee need to be held accountable. This government has admitted that these companies produce biased news; this government has, and no doubt will continue to, ignore all calls for abolition of licence fees. And they continue to pick our pockets. It must STOP NOW.",
