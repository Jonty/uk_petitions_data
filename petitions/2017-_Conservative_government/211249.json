        "additional_details": "With more people forced to rent due to housing prices so only the wealthy can afford them, then allowing the landlords to dictate if the tenants can get a pet or forcing them to abandon those they already have is completley wrong! \r\nI've never heard of an animal throwing a party & trashing a property or running up debt at an address so why the discrimination? \r\nIf an animal is allowed to cause damage or left alone too often this is cruelty & should be dealt with as such by the correct authorities!",
        "background": "Allowing property owners to discriminate against pet owners needs abolishing! \r\nWith animal shelters full and requesting funding and tenants forced to abandon pets (- members of their family) to keep a roof over their heads the solution seems pretty clear!\r\nBan the pet clause in tenancy agreements.",
