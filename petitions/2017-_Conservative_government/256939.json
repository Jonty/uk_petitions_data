        "action": "Legally binding referendum on Brexit options under the supplementary vote system",
        "additional_details": "A UK referendum will only have the force of law if the Act setting it up says so. In practical terms this would mean someone would be able to go to court to make the government implement the result. \r\n\r\nThe Alternative Vote referendum in 2011, for example, was legally binding in this way whereas the EU referendum of 2016 was only advisory.\r\n\r\nNow that the viable Brexit options are clear, a legally binding referendum is the best way of resolving this growing impasse.",
        "background": "The government claims the UK has 3 viable Brexit choices - Ratify the Withdrawal Agreement/Political Declaration; No deal Brexit (WTO terms) or Revoke Article 50. \r\n\r\nThese options must be put to the British people so we may express a first and second preference, and in so doing, move on.",
