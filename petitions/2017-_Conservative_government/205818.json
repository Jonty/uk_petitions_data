        "additional_details": "Great strides have been made by some TV broadcasters to raise awareness of mental illness by depicting it so accurately, and some broadcasters exemplify how such a sensitive topic should be handled.\r\n\r\nHowever I have noticed how web-based broadcasters offer no warnings of content and offer no signposting after the programme. \r\n\r\nThis is potentially dangerous and I feel strongly that people who are vulnerable should be able to enjoy these programmes but know where to find help if needed afterwards.",
        "background": "While some depictions of people's battles with mental illness in the media can oftentimes be accurate representations and this should be applauded it should also be done safely taking potential risks to the viewer/listener into account by offering warnings before the programme and signposting after.",
