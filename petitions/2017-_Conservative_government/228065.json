        "additional_details": "I know plenty of people who have suffered with injuries / conditions which have temporarliy affected their mobility. People with broken legs, hip & knee replacements, back issues etc. The use of a disabled bay would assist me greatly as I struggle to get in / out of vehicles  but I will be fined as I do not have a blue badge. It is common sense to allow temporarily incapacitated people to be issued a blue badge for the period of their recovery.",
        "background": "I recently injured my knee. I'm temporarily incapacitated and it's difficult to get out and about. I request for people like me to be issued a blue badge by their consultant for their period of recovery. We need the use of disabled parking bays without having to worry about being fined",
