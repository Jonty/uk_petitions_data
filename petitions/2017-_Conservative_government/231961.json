        "additional_details": "The World Health Organization lists 120 decibels as the pain threshold for sound, including sharp sounds such as thunderclaps. The noise from fireworks exceeds that and can lead to permanent hearing loss. \r\n\r\nIn parts of Europe silent fireworks are used increasingly to protect pets, livestock and wildlife. In 2015 Collecchio in Italy passed a law in  that all fireworks displays must be silent, yet their displays are still spectacular.\r\n\r\nAs well as Italy, firework companies in the U.S. have been developing quiet fireworks displays in anticipation of the trend toward respecting animals and wildlife expanding world-wide.\r\n\r\nhttps://fantasticfireworks.co.uk/ - this is a company in England that has been producing silent fireworks for over 30 years.",
        "background": "The noise from fireworks terrifies pets, farm animals and wildlife, some of which end up getting getting lost, injured or killed and the explosion from fireworks can also frighten young children, elderly people and veterans suffering from PTSD.",
