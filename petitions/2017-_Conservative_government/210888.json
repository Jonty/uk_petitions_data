        "action": "Stop Reducing our Armed Forces and Spend 3% of GDP. CUT AID to 0.3% to fund it.",
        "additional_details": "France has 23 Destroyers and Frigates. We've 19. They've 3 Amphibious ships. We've 2 which are now going to be scrapped. Their Army is 30,000 bigger. You now want to cut another 14,000 and are talking about merging two extremely distinct units: Royal Marines and Parachute Regiment. It's a joke. You don't want the Army to \"Be the Best\" and the new adverts are laughable. Recruits join for war fighting, adventure and service. Not for PC. That 2% clearly feels like 1% and those in charge are inept.",
        "background": "When I say \"reduce\" I mean in three ways: Funding, manpower & resources and credibility. We're told the Government spends 2% of GDP on defence and we have \"the second largest budget in NATO... Largest in Europe\". Then why can't we even match the French in capability anymore? Spend 3% GDP on Defence.",
