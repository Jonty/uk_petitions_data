        "additional_details": "We are simply fed up with the inertia and want this resolved by the 31st of October when we are due to leave the EU. It has gone on long enough.\r\nWe DO NOT want a second referendum as a referendum has already been held and NOT yet implemented, moreover leaders of certain parties have gone on record to say they will not respect the result of a referendum if it does not go the way they want it to and so a referendum WILL not break the deadlock.",
        "background": "We the undersigned urgently request parliament to repeal the fixed term parliament act to enable the government call a general election as the current parliament is deadlocked with regards the issue of Brexit and refuse to vote for an election themselves.",
