        "additional_details": "As parents we have full right over what information is delivered to our children. Muslims should not have to compromise with anyone on what they believe to be clear cut orders and principles conveyed in their religion. So therefore the subject music should be optional. Evidence from the Holy Book (Quran), Allah SWT, says in Surah Luqman, \"And of the people is he who buys the amusement of speech [music] to mislead [others] from the way of Allah will have a humiliating\r\npunishment\". [Luqman 31:6] ",
        "background": "Some muslims believe Islam forbids them to play musical instruments, listen to music, dance and can not play a role in it. As this subject is compulsory on the National Curriculum, some muslims are being forced to go against their religion by schools.",
