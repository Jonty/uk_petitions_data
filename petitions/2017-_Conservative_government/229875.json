The developer has handed over a defective, small, low quailty home. They will not honour the warranty and fix the defects. The NHBC only covers a selection of things that is outlined on there website. I have photos emails and letters I have sent to the mangers and none of the defects get sorted out. Helptobuy schemes are helping developers and not me.",
        "background": "Large housing developers such as Persimmon homes are providing low quailty, defective houses that are too small under the helptobuy scheme. The government needs to take action and provided more protection to these buyers, and new laws that mean developers cannot build and handover defective housing.",
