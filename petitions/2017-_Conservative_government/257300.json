        "action": "A MINIMUM 5 YEAR SENTENCE ON CONVICTION OF ISSUING DEATH THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA",
        "additional_details": "The MP for Stafford and his staff received a death threat In first week of April. the woman who put down the epetition on Article 50 which has received over 6 million supporters has had three death threats. Stan Collymore of Aston Villa had to spend his own money chasing a troll on line. Cases of school students taking their own life because of on line bullying including death threats are now commonplace. A stand has to be taken.",
        "background": "The increasing issuing of death threats on social and other media demands a clear statement by government this is unacceptable. A minimum sentence is now required. The claim such behaviour is 'free speech' and restricting it is an abuse of human rights has to be made clear to be completely false.",
