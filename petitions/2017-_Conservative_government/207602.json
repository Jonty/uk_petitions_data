        "action": "Stop Southern Rail being able to increase their fares in January",
        "additional_details": "There is a myriad of websites, forums and social media pertaining to the disruption Southern have caused for commuters over the last two years. People have had to move house for work. People have lost jobs. Even now in London, companies are screening candidates based on their dependence on Southern rail. These are facts and in no other arena can a company provide such abysmal service and continue to raise prices.",
        "background": "Southern Rail have a long and well documented history of terrible service. We believe this will continue irrespective of financial investment. Given the last two years of hell commuters have endured because of their dependence on Southern, they should not be allowed to increase their fares.",
