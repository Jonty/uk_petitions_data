        "additional_details": "War with Iran will lead to millions of innocent civilian deaths, adding to countless brutal & unfinished US invasions in the Middle East that bloodthirsty war hawks such as John Bolton have pursued for decades.\r\n\r\nThe Iranian government has been faithful to the Nuclear Agreement (JCPOA) & there is NO NEED FOR WAR. Any escalation will only worsen the situation & increase the risk of global terrorism.\r\n\r\nUK citizens & Government MUST rule out involvement & denounce support for a US war with Iran.",
        "background": "Escalating tensions between Iran & the United States in the Persian Gulf are a worrying development for global geopolitics with consequences that can further destabilise the Middle East, Europe & other regions. The UK government must commit to standing against further US destablisation of the region",
