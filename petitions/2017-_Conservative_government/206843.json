This petition is not for people who changed their minds about wanting to leave the European Union and its common market, but for the people who did not vote at all to change their minds about keeping silent.",
        "background": "The British public made their decision to leave the European Union on 23 June 2017, yet, this might no longer be what they feel. After one and a half years, we have seen the effects of Brexit, for better or for worse, it is only fair that we be allowed a second chance to reaffirm our choice.",
