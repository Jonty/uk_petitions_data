        "additional_details": "Hong Kong residents shall have, among other things, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and of publication; freedom of association, freedom of assembly, freedom of procession, of demonstration, of communication, of movement, of conscience, of religious belief, and of marriage; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike. China has reneged on this agreement and is now attacking the people of Hong Kong using organised gangs. The police have also failed in their duty.",

The Law derives its authority from the Sino\u2013British Joint Declaration, an international bilateral treaty signed between China and the UK",
