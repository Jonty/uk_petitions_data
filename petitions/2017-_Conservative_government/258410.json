        "additional_details": "Ticketing websites such as AXS and venues such as the O2 Academy group now only give the mobile (fast) option no longer physical tickets, so what happens if the app crashes? If WiFi is not an option, you have no mobile data or you phone has died?\r\n\r\nThere still needs to be a physical ticket option to counteract the digital option in case technology fails. \r\n\r\nMany people do like to collect the physical concert or event tickets to keep as a memory.",
        "background": "As we head even more into a digital age, some ticket providers and venues are only allowing mobile tickets to be presented at the venue. I wish for there to still be both options available of physical venue printed ticket or print at home ticket as well as the mobile version of the ticket.",
