        "action": "Ensure cancer patients wait for no longer than a week for scan or test results.",
        "additional_details": "At present patients with suspected cancer may have to wait for 62 days for test results to confirm a diagnosis. For those already diagnosed, there are no time limits for scan or test results. In our increasingly overstretched NHS, scan results are being given too late. This is an unacceptable situation which could be remedied. I am asking the government to ensure no cancer patient has to wait for longer than a week for test results so that their treatment isn't delayed or their choices limited.",
        "background": "There are currently no guidelines which determine how long a cancer patient should be expected to wait for scan or test results. This means that many patients are waiting for several weeks to know their fate. Inevitably, this holds up treatment and can lead to a worse outcome for the patient.",
