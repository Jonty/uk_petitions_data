We're not sure whether you'd like to ban a specific kind of non-jury trial, or whether you'd like custodial sentences to be able to be given only when a jury has been involved in a case. \r\n\r\nNon-jury trials can happen in cases where there is danger of jury tampering or where jury tampering has taken place. You can find out more about this here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/non-jury-trials\r\n\r\nMagistrates' courts can give custodial sentences, but don't have juries. You can find out more about sentencing in magistrates' courts here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Definitive-Guideline-Imposition-of-CCS-final-web.pdf\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do."
