        "additional_details": "Debt and money issues are a rising concern for young people in the UK, with those aged 16 to 24 having the highest individual debt to income ratio amongst all over age groups (Household debt inequalities dataset, ONS, April 2016). School should be preparing our children for the real world, and I call on the UK Government to make financial studies a core subject in our National Curriculum, so that our children can leave school with the best chances of being financially stable and debt free.",
        "background": "Sometimes we all question some of the things we had to learn at school, like pi or algebra, and how they have had no relevance in our lives at all. Some of us may have achieved an A* in our English Literature exam, but Shakespeare will never help you understand how to get a mortgage or manage debt.",
