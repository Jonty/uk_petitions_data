There is a massive differenct between letting people have their opinion and putting peoples lives at risk with nothing more to go on than the false research of a disgraced doctor.",
        "background": "As I'm sure most of you know, Italy have just created a law that forces parents of children under 6 to vaccinate their children before they attend school. This new law is brilliant but I don't feel it goes far enough and I believe all children should be vaccinated by law due to a rise in desease.",
