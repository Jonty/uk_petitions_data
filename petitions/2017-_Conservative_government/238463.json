Another spate of cat dissections.Groups of people scouring streets for cats for dog baiting. Better sentencing is needed.Example;guilty of one cat death=maximum 5 years,someone done over 400 deaths,still a maximum of 5 years?Sentencing needs to go on how many cat deaths:Example 1 cat=2 years 5 cats=10 years &so on",
