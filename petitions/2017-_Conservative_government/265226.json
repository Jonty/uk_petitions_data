        "additional_details": "We have a responsibility under the Joint Declaration to protect the freedoms of the people of Hong Kong. We have failed to do this and China is steadily tearing up that treaty. We have little clout with the Beijing government but at the very least we could extend right of abode to BNO passport holders, particularly in the wake of Brexit when we are losing doctors, nurses, care workers etc.",
        "background": "If we are actually going to leave the EU and be a so-called \"Global Britain\" then lets start showing some responsibility to people from Hong Kong, many of whom have a BNO passport which does not give them right of abode in the UK.",
