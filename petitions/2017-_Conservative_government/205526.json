        "additional_details": "Religious marriages conducted abroad are legally recognised, but UK religious marriages are not. The result? Chaos, injustice and discrimination:\r\n\r\n- Overnight homelessness, destitution\r\n- lost savings invested in \u2018matrimonial\u2019 home \r\n- No Pension or Inheritance rights\r\n- Men, women and children suffer\r\n\r\nThere are no Cohabitation rights - and these couples face a double handicap as they thought they were married.\r\n\r\nIn the 21st century, a fair and equal marriage law needs to cover all faiths.",
        "background": "We need to reform the Marriage Act 1949 as it is 70 years out of date. \r\n\r\nMake it compulsory for every faith to register marriages, not just 3 faiths (Anglicans, Jews and Quakers). \r\n\r\n100,000s have no legal rights in an unregistered religious marriage and this figure is rising yearly.",
