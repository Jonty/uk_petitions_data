        "additional_details": "Back in 2014/2015 many petitions were made for Northumberland to once again join Scotland. Many news articles reported on this. However, the people who signed those petitions did not get their wish. We have a shared history and culture. The UK Government in London doesn't govern Northumberland very well.",
        "background": "I think that Scotland should rightfully own Northumberland. This is because Northumberland and Scotland share a similar culture and have strong ethnic ties. I believe this may help with the economy and natural resources as Northumberland has a lot of coal.",
