        "additional_details": "After doing some a search on rightmove, I found some flats available for between \u00a3100 and \u00a3200 per month.   I suggest we make rent or mortgage interest payments tax deductible up to a limit of \u00a32000 per year, but scale this every year based upon a yearly government analysis of uk rent/interest payments.\r\n\r\nIf we combine this with a family allowance, it may help alleviate the following problem:\r\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45487695",
        "background": "It seems unfair that somebody who owns their own property and has a lower cost of living pays the same tax as somebody who rents or has a mortgage.   I suggest we add a tax deductible allowance for rent or mortgage interest, capped at a low level that is comparable to the lowest rent within the uk.",
