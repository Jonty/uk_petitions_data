Vera Baird QC commented: \u201cThe Sentencing Council makes clear that the huge breach of trust involved\u201d, in this offence, \u201citself merits harsher punishment.\" https://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/police-chief-welcomes-new-sentence-rules-for-domestic-violence-1-8826066 \r\n\r\nReferring sentencing for this offence to the Court of Appeal would ensure senior judges reiterated the crime\u2019s gravity and followed sentencing guidelines",

But it does not include serious domestic abuse, e.g. coercive control, for which there are frequent poor sentences which often seem to disregard Sentencing Council guidelines.",
