        "additional_details": "It could be much faster and, I believe, safer, cheaper, quieter and better for the environment than trains and aeroplanes. A fully developed and implemented hyper-loop could be far more cost effective and have many more benefits than a train line or indeed aeroplanes. Hyper-loops could allow people and goods to travel at speeds similar to a jet aeroplane with fewer costs, risks and inconvenience. Various worldwide companies are already starting to build hyperloop prototypes. \r\n\r\nThe UK should be at the forefront of this development. It would be a great step forward in the connectivity of people and business nationally and would greatly benefit the whole country. The money would be much better spent than on unpopular and older technology such as HS2.",
        "background": "HS2 (high speed train 2) and train lines could become outdated technology. A hyper-loop uses a partially evacuated pipeline with the carriage moving on a maglev (magnetic levitation) within. ",
