        "additional_details": "My dog was attacked by another dog who had my dog pinned down and was biting at his face. My dog was on his lead, however the other dog was not and the dog\u2019s owner blamed US for the situation even though their dog approached mine. Thankfully my dog walked away with minimal injuries (a few cuts on his face) but more than anything he was shook up. The other dog was not on a lead so it made it extremely hard for anyone to pull the dog off my dog as they had nothing to pull.",
        "background": "Make it illegal for dogs to be out in public without a lead on. Dogs who are without leads run the risk of attacking other dogs, being attacked, running away from their owner, getting lost, being stolen and most importantly, running into a road which then can cause a car accident.",
