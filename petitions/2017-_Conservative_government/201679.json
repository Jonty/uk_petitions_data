        "additional_details": "100% attendance schemes are detrimental to school life:\r\n\u2022\tthey demonstrate exclusion, not inclusion, by discounting children with disabilities or chronic conditions\r\n\u2022\tthey encourage children to view their peers with disabilities as weak and detrimental to class targets\r\n\u2022\tthey encourage children to go to school sick and spread infections\r\n\u2022\tthey do not foster or recognise important characteristics of determination, persistence or hard work.\r\n\u2022\tparents are responsible for attendance, not children",
        "background": "100% Attendance Awards should be identified as discriminatory and a potential for inciting bullying. National and school attendance strategies should\u00a0support struggling families but not penalise or demonise sick children. The DofE and Ofsted must identify such awards as not fit for purpose.",
