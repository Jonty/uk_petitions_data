        "additional_details": "Votes are influenced by misleading media, encouraged by friends, and, especially in the younger generation, for an image. Newspapers will smear different party\u2019s in different papers, affecting the older generations view on a party and their policies, meanwhile, social media predominantly encourages the younger generation into believing it\u2019s \u2018cool\u2019 to \u201chate the Tory\u2019s\u201d. The aim of this petition is to disregard all media and other influences and allow people to vote based on policies and fact.",
        "background": "Many people vote for parties without knowing their proposed policies, understanding what their policies mean and how they\u2019ll be achieved, and how they will change current policies. This petition proposes that all voters should take a small test, simply quizzing them on these things. Fail=no vote",
