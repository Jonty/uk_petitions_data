        "additional_details": "Why \u00a320,000? This may not seem a lot for those with wealth, however this is a major amount to the average working person and represents a financial restart we could all use.\r\n\r\nWhy via tax? Because this ensures each person has only one entry, making it a fair raffle with reasonable chances to win rather than those who have more, being able to obtain more.\r\n\r\nNo, this does not solve all the problems of financial inequality but its a decent first step.",
        "background": "Tax payers can opt in to pay \u00a31 a month to a government raffle.  The prize fund is then divided into lots of \u00a320,000 with the number of winners dependant on the pool size i.e. if 31 Million people enter, there are 1550 winners that month.",
