        "additional_details": "Every household in Britain is forced to pay for a corporation that represents a minor part of many peoples viewing habits or face criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nIntroduced to fund public broadcasting, the BBC now makes revenue from its commercial businesses, government grants and rental collections and royalties from overseas broadcasts of programming on top of the licence fee. Public funding is no longer as essential as it once was.\r\n\r\nMake the licence and optional subscription and not a forced tax.",
        "background": "The TV licence is an outdated concept which needs to be re-evaluated and made fit for modern-day use.\r\n\r\nWith many households now choosing to purchase subscriptions to services like Netflix, Sky TV and Amazon Prime it may now be time for the BBC to follow this model.",
