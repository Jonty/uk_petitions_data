Rats and mice experience excruciating pain and toxic effects from the glue. In the uk once you catch them with this you must kill them quickly and humanly but 63% of people have forgotten they set the trap, so they are left to suffer and those that catch them tend to crush them. That doesn\u2019t sound very humane does it.",
        "background": "There are many ways to get rid of mice if in your home. But, these sticky traps are nothing but a torture method. It causes them extreme pain and stress. And most forget they are there and these creatures are left to die of starvation. If you want to exterminate them, do it. But do it humanly.",
