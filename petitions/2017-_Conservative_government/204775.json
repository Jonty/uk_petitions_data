Lorraine Atkinson was one of the researchers behind the paper who visited Halden prison in Norway in 2014, where conjugal visits are allowed. As a result, Norway has one of the lowest reoffending rates in the world, currently standing at 20%. In comparison, 59% of British prisoners reoffend within a year of being released.",
