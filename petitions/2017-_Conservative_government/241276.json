        "additional_details": "Having clear terms of service, associated with a job description, would provide clarity for what is, or is not, expected in their role as MP. This clarity is particularly important for public servants. The UK Government and Parliament have a duty to ensure the public have confidence in those they elect. It should be made clear within the manifesto when an elected politician would express personal views, constituents' views or, in the case of a referendum, the views of the UK public.",
        "background": "Since the 2016 referendum, voters have been dismayed by the way in which some MPs have been unwilling to uphold the referendum result. To prevent future ambiguity, terms of service should be introduced and included in manifestos.",
