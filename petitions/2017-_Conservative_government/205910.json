To give stronger protection to the environment and to forfil UK obligations to the Convention of Biological Diversity.",
        "background": "Follow the example of Bolivia and Ecuador, make a law which gives Mother Earth, trees and creatures legal personage. This would help lawyers to better advocate on behalf of nature- this would have been particularly useful in the case of Sheffields street trees and against fracking in beauty spots.",
