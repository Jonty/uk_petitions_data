        "additional_details": "We need to properly fund our roads, child social care, police, NHS and fire service and look after our elderly people. All of these are falling further behind other counties every year.\r\n\r\nSurrey gets \u00a3134 more per person\u200b this year despite being considerably \u200bless needy, according to Government statistics.\r\n\r\nThe Local Government Association says Northamptonshire is the county least able to fund itself in the future.",
        "background": "Several \u200ble\u200bss-deprived counties \u200bget much more spent on them per head than\u200b Northamptonshire\u200b, mainly due to an out-of-date funding model\u200b.\r\n\r\nWe need a fairer allocation scheme to better reflect today\u2019s population growth and levels of deprivation in Northamptonshire.",
