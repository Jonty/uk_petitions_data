        "additional_details": "The new History GCSE requires pupils to study from three eras: Medieval (500-1500), Early Modern (1450-1750) and Modern (1700-present day) on three time scales: short (depth study), medium (period study) and long(thematic study)on three geographical contexts: a locality (the historic environment); British; and European and / or wider world settings. \r\n\r\nEvidence: https://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-news/gcse-content-unmanageable-say-majority-history-teachers",
        "background": "75% of teachers agree that History GCSE content is unmanageable. Teachers are not able to cover the specification in the two year time frame. As a result, teachers are increasingly forced to 'teach to the test' meaning pupils are not given the time to develop the skills to become a good historian.",
