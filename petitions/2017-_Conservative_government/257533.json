        "additional_details": "I believe in order to make this legal people need to be over the age of 18 also wearing a helmet at all times when on the device unless they're on private grounds.\r\n\r\nThis will then make the devices safe to use as people will be mature enough to ride it in public areas.\r\n\r\nCountry's like America has allowed electric assisted devices like the hoverboard and electric skateboards with these similar rules.\r\n\r\nThis will then allow people to explore local areas or even ride to work with these devices.",
        "background": "I believe electric assisted devices like electric skateboards and hoverboards should be allowed in public as it's the future of mobility, \r\n\r\nI was buying a device then realised that it wasn't legal,\r\n\r\nThis made me fustrated as i can't enjoy having a device that I wanted for months.",
