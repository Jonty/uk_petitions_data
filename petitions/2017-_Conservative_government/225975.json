All of this information can be found on the .gov website. This proposal would be an additional, voluntary payment that would go solely to fund the NHS.\r\n \r\nAs members of the public, we are quick enough to comment that the NHS needs more funding and investment, this option would put the ball in our court. Something needs to change.",

Without the NHS, the treatment my daughter has received and is still yet to receive would have cost me tens of thousands of pounds that I simply could not afford. We all depend on the NHS.",
