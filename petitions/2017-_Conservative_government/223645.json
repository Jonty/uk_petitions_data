        "additional_details": "There are more reported burglaries, instances of shoplifting, people dealing drugs and in some instances children as young as 12 are apparently selling drugs.\r\nUnless something is done and soon, problems will only escalate. Resources are limited across the public sector but it is false economy not to deal with the situation.\r\nPeople must be able to feel safe in their own homes, and city.\r\nWe are hoping that if enough people support the petition the issue will be debated in Parliament.",
        "background": "We call on the Home Secretary to provide an extra \u00a310 million a year for overstretched Leicestershire Police.\r\nIt would provide 300 extra officers on the beat to fight increasing crime including shop lifting, burglaries & knife-crime.With fewer officers, the force is struggling to deal with crime.",
