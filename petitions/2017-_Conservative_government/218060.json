        "additional_details": "We need alternative disposable straws at a similar price to plastic straws that will survive hot drinks, chewing, can also be wide bore for those on a puree diet drinking thick shakes and will last in a cold drink for 12 hours. \r\nPlastic straws are a necessary evil.  \r\nIkea \u00a31/200\r\nBiodegradable straws online \u00a32.40/250.\r\n6 straws/day for a year = plastic \u00a310.95 or biodegradable \u00a321.03\r\nCosts doubled. Multiply this for many patients in hospital or care homes.\r\nI welcome questions as space here limited.",
        "background": "I support banning plastic straws for the majority BUT many disabled, elderly & ill people NEED straws to be able to take in fluids.\r\nReusable straws need thorough cleaning especially for hot drinks.\r\nPaper straws disintegrate & go soggy.\r\nHospitals, care homes, individuals all need cheap straws.",
