        "additional_details": "Hong Kong Basic Law grants residents freedom of speech,the press, demonstration and assembly among others. The central government's violent crackdown and past actions show that like with Uyghurs the government does not care for the rights of its citizens. The UK government and international community need to move against China to protect the residents of Hong Kong, we must value the right of people across the world to protest for their democratic freedoms and right to self governance.",
        "background": "The Chinese government's escalation of the situation in Hong Kong through both words and actions is a sign of what is to come. By labeling some protesters actions as \"terrorism\" it is clear that the Chinese are in breach of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and of Hong Kong Basic Law.",
