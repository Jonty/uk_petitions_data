I believe that low pay workers and their families would benefit from having their tax reduced or removed for a minimum of three weeks per year, and included in this would be that they would also be able to carry out overtime for these weeks, free from taxation and enable them to have a better quality of life away from work, with extra money to spend",

In particular, we're not sure if you want people on low pay to pay reduced tax or no tax at all.\r\n\r\nThere is already a tax-free \"Personal Allowance\" of \u00a311,850. This is due to rise to \u00a312,500 in April 2019. You could start a new petition asking for the Personal Allowance to increase further or for the basic rate of income tax to be reduced, if that's what you'd link to happen. You could also start a new petition calling for overtime payments to be tax-free if that is something you would like to see happen."
