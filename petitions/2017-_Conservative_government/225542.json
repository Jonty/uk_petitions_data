        "background": "Cadet funding is low, especially in areas such as the Thongsbridge detachment, as their cadet building is more of a mobile home than a building. Furthermore, more than half of the air cadet forces have had their volountier glider squadrons disbanded, meaning these air cadets can no longer fly planes",
