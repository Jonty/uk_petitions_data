        "additional_details": "As a stroke nurse within in the UHD, I am extremely worried about the consequences of this move. The new protocol would mean a journey to the RVH in Belfast resulting in a delay of up to 60 minutes compared with travelling to UHD. It is vitally important that stroke patients receive medical care in the shortest possible time frame. This delay in travelling to RVH will result in life threatening situations, as well as affecting the quality of life of stroke patients living in rural communites.",
        "background": "The stroke services in the UHD are under threat of closure which will potentially have life threatening consequences to those who have the misfortune of having a stroke in the lower ards area.",
