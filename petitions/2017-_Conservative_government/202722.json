When these attacks are then reported to the police, owners are informed nothing can be done, as in is not detailed in the \"dangerous dogs act\". I feel strongly that this needs to change. I am not asking for dogs to be put down, but that they have to wear a muzzle in public. For me, this is part of being a responsible dog owner.",
        "background": "Under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, action can only be taken against a dog owner if their dog attacks a person or an assistance dog. I want to see this extended so that where a dog severely attacks other dogs (where they require vet treatment) that action can be taken by the police against the owner",
