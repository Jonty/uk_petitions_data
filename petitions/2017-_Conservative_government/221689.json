        "action": "Hold a referendum to rejoin the EU before June 30th 2019",
        "additional_details": "There is much debate about the possible negative effect of leaving the EU in March 2019. The UK will know shortly afterwards what the real effect has been and should be given the chance to rejoin again if there has been damage caused which will become worse the longer it continues, hence the referendum must take place within 3 months of leaving.",
        "background": "UK voted to leave the EU and has the chance to view what life outside the EU is like post 29th March 2019. If it is good then we can vote to stay outside the EU, if not we can vote to apply to rejoin as a full member of the EU.",
