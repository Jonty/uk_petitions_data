        "additional_details": "Shared Parental Leave was introduced to allow new parents to split up to 50 weeks statutory leave after birth or adoption, with the aim of promoting flexibility and equality both domestically and professionally. The proposed amendment to allow Grandparents to take part in Shared Parental Leave was put on hold by Government in 2018. By signing this petition we can get Government to restart the conversation, giving this progressive concept a second chance at becoming a reality.",
        "background": "Since its introduction in 2015, only 2% of eligible parents have taken part in Shared Parental Leave (SPL). Allowing Grandparents to take part in SPL will increase the flexibility of the programme, as well as support the 1.7 million single parents who have previously been overlooked.",
