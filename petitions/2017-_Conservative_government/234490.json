It is a low-cost intervention - there is no excuse.\r\n\r\nUse of PrEP reduces new HIV infections among men who have sex with men, heterosexuals, people who inject drugs. We were inspired by our MP publicly revealing his status in parliament on World Aids Day last week. \r\n \r\nPrEP is not only beneficial from a public health perspective, but also financially. It should be universally accessible across the UK.",
