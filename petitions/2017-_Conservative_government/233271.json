        "background": "There are many people still serving an ipp sentence (imprisonment for public protection.) Although the law changed in 2012 to get rid of this sentence as this was classed as inhumane. Many people are still serving this sentence. My partner is currently 1 of 3000 people who are on this sentence.",
