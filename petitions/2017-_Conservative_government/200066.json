        "additional_details": "The NHS provides psychiatric therapies for what it refers to as \"CFS/ME\". These therapies are often ineffective and sometimes make patients worse. They are the result of a Myalgic Encephalomyelitis policy heavily influenced by psychiatrists who are skeptical about the existence of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis. It is time for a policy re-think about the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of current treatment.\r\nSee: http://www.tymestrust.org (for the effect of current policy on children with ME).",
        "background": "Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) means \"muscle pain plus inflammation of the brain/spinal cord\", a chronic neurological illness, but \"the majority of patients presenting with symptoms of ME in the UK are still referred to psychotherapists for treatment\" (Dr Ian Gibson). A policy review is overdue.",
