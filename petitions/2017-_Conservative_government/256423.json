        "action": "Enforce replacement of plastic packaging with biodegradable alternatives.",
        "additional_details": "There are several, biodegradable alternatives to the plastic packaging used by the big supermarkets for their own brand items and prepacked fruit and veg. Too much emphasis is put on customers and their duty to make the right choice. This is impossible when there is no choice presented. The banning of free plastic carrier bags has shown how big an impact can be made when those who create and sell the problem take a measure of responsibility.",
        "background": "Plastic pollution has got out of hand. It is destroying wildlife and impacting on the global environment. It's time for those responsible for it's creation and sale to take action to rectify this situation",
