        "additional_details": "Kids' magazines are bright, colourful, educational and fun - but the big sellers come with plastic throwaways. Designed to have children hooked and longing for more, these not only take advantage of children's susceptibility to advertising, but encourage them to imagine that plastic tat is a harmless feature of everyday life. The toys are cheaply made, break easily and are soon discarded, adding to the vast quantities of plastic waste that pollutes our environment.\r\n\r\nThis practice has to stop.",
        "background": "UK parliament has declared a climate emergency. Plastic pollution contributes to the degradation of ecosystems, to a reduction in human health, and to climate change. \r\n\r\nPlastic-toy giveaways should no longer be included with children's magazines.",
