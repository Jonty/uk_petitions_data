        "additional_details": "This is substantially more than the current 49 Councillors who sit on Bucks County Council and significantly more than the 98 Councillors originally proposed for the new Council. \r\nThere is no justification for this increase in the number of Councillors and the extra costs it will incur will mean that funds are taken away from vital public services in Buckinghamshire.",
        "background": "Following the decision to form a new Unitary Authority called \u2018The Buckinghamshire Council\u2019 it has been proposed that the new Council will be made up of 147 Councillors. We call for the number of proposed Councillors to this new Unitary authority to be set at a more realistic and efficient level.",
