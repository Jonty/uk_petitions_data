        "additional_details": "We decided to choose self defence classes as a way to help children protect themselves. Our local area is affected by knife crime and we want every young person to feel that they can be safe in society. We would like self defence classes to be introduced in Year 5 and continue onward.",
        "background": "Within our citizenship class we highlighted knife crime and the damage it causes. We decided that enforcing self defence classes in schools would minimise the ravaging effects of knife crime. Everyday at least one parent is robbed of their child. No one wants their child to become a statistic.",
