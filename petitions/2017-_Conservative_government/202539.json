Emotional support animals have been known to assist disabled individuals with severe depression, generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and many other emotional and psychiatric disabilities. These animals need no specific training and are therefore of no cost to the government but may change the life of a person granted permission to keep one. They provide therapeutic benefits to people with mental health disorders through companionship.
