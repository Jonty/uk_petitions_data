        "additional_details": "His lyrics no longer reference violence but rather his loneliness, the questioning of his own sexuality and overall peaceful. \"I'm the loneliest man alive\" and \"Can I get a kiss? And can you make it last forever?\" are just a couple of examples from a load.\r\n\r\nThe lyrics that he was banned for were from 2009-11. Since then, as a person, he has matured. The Odyssey Online describes \"Flower Boy\" as a \"mature, introspective, and downright beautiful collection of songs\".",
        "background": "In 2015, musician Tyler Okonma was banned from performing in the UK due to lyrics that 'may foster hatred'. It has since been 3 years and I, along side many fans and artists, believe that this ban should be revoked. His lyrics no longer insight hatred and this is clearly shown in his latest music.",
