        "additional_details": "This makes a mockery of our judicial system and means MPs are being held to a lower standard than others.\r\nWe believe that the law needs changing so all elected officials are held to the same standard.\r\nAll elected officials should be automatically disbarred from office for serious offences against the law.",
        "background": "The recent high profile case of a sitting MP jailed for breaking the law has highlighted a serious flaw in our legal system.\r\nLocal Councillors are disbarred from public office if they are imprisoned for three months.\r\nYet MPs can stay in office if their sentence is less than twelve months.",
