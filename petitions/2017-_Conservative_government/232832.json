        "additional_details": "To sea turtles, plastic bags in the water can look like jellyfish, floating on the surface plastic can appear to be a tasty snack for a seagull, based on millennia of experience, So far, it is known that marine litter harms more than 600 species\u00a0amid what some regard as the beginning of the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth. Killing off sea creatures is bad for humans because we consume so much of it ourselves. Some 92.6 million tonnes were caught worldwide in 2015.",
        "background": "The sea now contains 51 trillion microplastic particles 500 times more than stars in our galaxy. It is estimated there will be more plastic than fish by 2050.. plastic needs to be replaced with biodegradable bags and packaging.",
