        "action": "End freedom of speech suppression and the no platform policy in universities.",
        "additional_details": "Simply banning people simply because they offend people doesn't help, even if they express intolerant views of others. The best way to challenge ideas and intolerant views is through open debate. If a university opposes a speaker, a referendum should be on whether the speaker should be given uninterrupted platform. If a majority of students oppose the speaker, they should be allowed to speak only if they agree to be debated against another student or speaker.",
        "background": "University is a place were students are encouraged to explore ideas and gain an open-mind. Universities understandable don't accept speakers who have expressed deep intolerance and prejudice or certain in groups in society. But even some of the most liberal speakers have been banned.",
