        "additional_details": "As all children are expected to remain in education until the age of 18 it is unfair that their parents should have to pay full adult rail and bus fares for them.\r\n\r\nBecause our train and bus companies are all privately owned it is very difficult to ask them to change their policies, however, I do believe that the Government has a duty of care to all students and those undertaking low paid apprenticeships and I would like to ask Government to consider funding a student/young persons rail/bus discount card thereby helping to reduce travelling costs for parents.",
        "background": "My friend's 16-year-old daughter is starting college this year and will need to travel by train and as there is no other alternative she has had to purchase an adult season ticket at huge expense.",
