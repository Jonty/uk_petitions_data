        "additional_details": "Animals have been having to adapt to the amount of plastic we pollute for years, snails are now making homes out of bottle caps, turtles are cutting off their circulation with 6 pack plastic rings and more and more fish and seabirds have been found with plastic in their body. What do you think happened with the plastic that isn\u2019t recyclable, it gets thrown in the bin, goes to the landfill, or worse to the sea! I will not be buying any more plastic that is not recyclable, you should do this too.",
        "background": "The world is in such a bad state and it is just getting worse I do think everyone could do their bit, sadly not all packaging is recyclable! We must start making changes, BIG & small. The sea in swimming in plastic, if this problem continues by 2050 the ocean will have more plastic than fish!",
