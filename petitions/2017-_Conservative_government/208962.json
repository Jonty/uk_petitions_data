        "additional_details": "I am on housing benefit for health reasons, no other, yet I feel I am tarnished and placed into that bracket of what people call \"benefit scroungers\". If I could swap with a fully fit person and be able to work for my own money again then believe me I would. Unfortunately this is the life I have been dealt with so I have to get on with it. That is why I am trying to build a better life, find a home suitable for me and my daughter to live in, but I keep coming up against this same brick wall.",
        "background": "Stop landlords & letting agencies from discriminating against people for being on housing benefits or having pets. There are NOT enough council properties so we are forced to look into the private rent sector, only then to be told constantly NO because you are on housing benefits or you have a pet.",
