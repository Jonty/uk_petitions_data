Please see these references to prove the accuracy of our petition.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-29885832\r\n\r\nhttps://www.greenoptimistic.com/batteries-made-child-safe-new-quantum-coating-20141105/#.WmS61UvLhTY",
        "background": "My daughter Freya swallowed a button battery when she was 11 months, which stuck in her oesophagus for 4 weeks, before it was removed, causing a chemical burn. Had it gone into her stomach, it might have killed her. If a button battery has a quantum coat, it makes it safe & inert when swallowed.",
