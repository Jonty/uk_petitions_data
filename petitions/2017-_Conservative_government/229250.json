        "additional_details": "Recently I was lucky enough to fall pregnant&welcome my first child in to the world. Before I did so, I was completely unaware of the difference between the maternity / paternity packages that different large organisations had in place. The difference between you and another Mum / Dad might be in excess of thousands of pounds which makes a huge different to any working family. I propose for all large organisations to pay the same, enhanced package rather than the government minimum guideline.",
        "background": "I wish for it to be made a legal requirement for large corporate companies who employee over 50,000 employees to pay enhanced Maternity / Paternity benefits as some industry leaders already do. The gap between the government minimum&some industry leaders is outstanding eg. Ford pay 52 weeks full pay",
