        "additional_details": "As a HGV driver, I struggled to understand completely the concept of a smart motorway. If there was no hard shoulder to stop on, what happens next? \r\nThe answer, after pounding the smart tarmac, is ... it isn't smart enough. It isn't quick enough to put lane restrictions/closures in place. It is in fact....a death trap! Emergency services take longer to reach an incident due to no empty lane. It doesn't work!\r\n",
        "background": "When your vehicle has issues on a motorway, you look for the relative safety of the hard shoulder. Smart motorways have removed that safety and are not smart enough to recognise lane 1 blockages quick enough. As a consequence, lives can be put at imminent risk!",
