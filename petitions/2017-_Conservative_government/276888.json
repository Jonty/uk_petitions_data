        "additional_details": "People last year were caught throwing fireworks at other people, as well as into the street where vehicles were passing by! Live stock panic and run; only to die of shock, whilst pets shake in fear and people on the autism spectrum or other mental disabilities; let alone other citizens feel trapped within a wall of noise and cannot stand the constantly loud, booming explosions. Houses are built closer together; which in turn makes sound echo, which makes fireworks a nightmare for everyone now.",
        "background": "On average people and animals are having to endure fireworks going off every night from October 15th until well past New Years Day. That's three to four months too long. As opposed to decades ago where it was one or two nights on average.",
