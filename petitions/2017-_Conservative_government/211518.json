        "additional_details": "For minor/unintentional errors it would be better to pay a lower penalty on exit or within a 24 hour grace period. A secure National Reference Centre would help a motorist to trace the impending charge and be redirected to the Operator's web site for the actual payment. After 24 hours the car park Operator could access DVLA keeper data. Normal secure access could be free by internet, but an affordable telephone facility should be available.",
        "background": "Supermarkets, Leisure Centres, Motorway Services etc. provide timed free parking, but need significant deterrents to abuse. Cliff-edge penalties for minor infringements cause  unnecessary ill-will towards Land Users and car park Operator with unnecessary cost. Some genuinely forget at pay-on-exit.",
