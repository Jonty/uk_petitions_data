        "additional_details": "After contacting National Rail Conditions enquiries, I tried to establish some clarity. After being placed on hold numerous times, he said the reason behind the restriction was due to a minimum fare of \u00a33.90 between 4:30am -10am. This 'reduced' fare is actually the standard price and is available to everybody including Senior Citizens. So it still offers no valid explanation for this inverted ageism. Please join me by signing this petition to ensure national companies work for all!",

After exhaustive enquiries with National Rail Conditions, there has been no clear explanation as to why these restrictions exist.",
