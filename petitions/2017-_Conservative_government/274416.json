        "action": "Ban plastic bags, takeaway containers, cups, utensils and lids.",
        "additional_details": "We ask that the government ban the use of the plastic products listed above as well as unnecessary packaging of food within a year and require cigarette sellers to switch to biodegradable filters asap. You should ban polystyrene from public use (for food) as the chemical styrene leaches toxins into food and when in the ocean absorbs waste making it doubly lethal for marine life. Also, ban plastic packaging on dry or uncooked food and replace it with eco-friendly packaging.",
        "background": "8 million tons of mostly plastic rubbish is dumped in the ocean annually. Each year 1 million sea birds die from eating plastic and 300,000 dolphins and porpoises die from being entangled in it. We ingest plastics through the fish we eat as fish often mistake microplastics for food.",
