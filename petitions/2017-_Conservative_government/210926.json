        "additional_details": "Here are 2 options you could consider:\r\n\u2022 Students have a minimum of 1 core GCSE subject which they choose ans then where they would have their core subjects, they could have free periods of time where they can complete work.\r\n\u2022 Students complete their core subjects during the 2 years before their chosen GCSEs",
        "background": "I believe that GCSE students should have the option to have maths, English, biology, chemistry and physics as a GCSE, this is because they also have 4 other GCSEs which they must complete throughout 2 years, making it hard for students to complete these other 6 GCSEs aswell!",
