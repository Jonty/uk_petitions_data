        "additional_details": "This has resulted in a dangerous black market where many deaths have occured due to overdose or due to what has been mixed within the drug. This petition isnt trying to condone the use of the drug but to make a safe, regulated market where if the drug is to be used it is coming from a trustworthy and controlled source. This will ultimately reduce ODs, increase knowledge and education of the drug, create tax revenue, cut out the black market AND SAVE LIVES! Please do some of your own research:)",
