        "additional_details": "The act in question in the face of free speech, it is without an objective standard and is so broad that it can easily be misused. The provisions to exclude comedy from this section have been shown to be ineffective in recent trials, as the courts have successfully argued that they can decide the context. Humour is subjective, thus the court cannot be able to discount this at will. We ask for an update to account for digital content creators and give them the same protections as broadcasters.",
        "background": "The right to offend is an important part of free speech and the communications act does not define within reason what offensive speech IS and furthermore this act is selectively enforced to silence certain opinions and ideas whilst refusing to do the same against other groups.",
