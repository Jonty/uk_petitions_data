        "additional_details": "Hunstanton is a seaside resort located on the Norfolk coast, where horse and pony rides are available throughout the summer months on a small area on the seafront. The general public have expressed concerns about the welfare of these animals due to them having no area of shade despite the elevated temperatures in which they are obligated to work in.\r\n\r\nM, L., 2010. When the Rider is Hot, the Horse is Hotter. University of Guelph, [Online] Available at: <www.uoguelph.ca>.",
        "background": "Studies have shown that only 17 minutes of moderate intensity exercise is enough to raise a horse\u2019s temperature to dangerous levels. Horses and ponies on Hunstanton beach have no access to shade and are expected to work full days during summer months at temperatures of 27 degrees and upwards.",
