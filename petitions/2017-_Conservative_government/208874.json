        "additional_details": "According to the Identity and Passport office, while there is no requirement to register stillbirths before 24 weeks, many hospitals offer parents a certificate which recognises the loss of a baby. Such informal certificates enable individuals preferences to be met. The Government should make offering these certificates to all parents a legal requirement.",
        "background": "Many parents who suffered a loss of a baby under 24 weeks gestation believe their baby and their loss is being clearly ignored like the baby never existed. It would help the parent if they were offered certificates acknowledging their Baby.\r\n \r\n",
