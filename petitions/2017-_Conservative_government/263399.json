        "additional_details": "The mission statement of the RCVS states they \"set uphold and advance veterinary standards\" . In recent years, the College has started a mediation service funded by them they set the remit too. In 2014 just one MOP gave oral evidence in their consultation on OOH provision out of 24 other stakeholders. There are undoubtedly many brilliant veterinary professionals. Failure to consult a vet could result in prosecution under the Animal Welfare Act.",
        "background": "For a Veterinary Surgeon or Nurse to be able to practice in the UK, they need to be registered with the RCVS. Unlike utility providers, etc, there is no Independent & external regulator to deal with the mounting complaints we have. Corporate companies entering the market have their own policies too.",
