        "additional_details": "I find that most insurance providers do not even quote me.  My colleague was forced to quit work/driving as her car (ca \u00a32,800) was costing \u00a32,500 insurance, as a 50y.o. woman.  She has been driving 3.5t vans all her working life.  The situation makes no sense.  She has never had any motoring, or any other conviction.  My own license is squeaky clean, and @ 10,000 miles/annum my own insurance on a small van (3.5t.) would cost ca. \u00a3250 @ 5% of fuel consumption.  Collecting the insurance, pro-rata, at the fuel pump, would assist greatly in blocking the insurance dodgers, thereby reducing this so-called crime.",
        "background": "Currently, a gas-guzzling, air-polluting, 7litre Bentley pays far less insurance than a moped, and the current system is also agist/sexist.  I currently find that over 1,000,000 miles of experience in the past 50yrs works against me, also my 50yrs of D/C + E experience.",
