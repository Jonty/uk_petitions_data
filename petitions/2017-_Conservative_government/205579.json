        "action": "Establish an independent board that investigates complaints against the Police",
        "additional_details": "Presently the Police investigate themselves and this is obvious it is open to misconduct.  We and our victims we represent have complained to the IPCC on numerous occasions and they will not investigate the Police often sending the complaint straight back to the Professional Standards Department.  We want a Police Complaints system totally independent to the Police made up of members trained in Law and with civilian oversight and a number of victims of crime on the panel.",
        "background": "After our own personal experiences of accessing the Police Complaints System we soon realised it is not fit for purpose.  We  represent a large number of victims  and all of those who have made a complaint to the Police have either not had their complaint investigated or had a satisfactory outcome.",
