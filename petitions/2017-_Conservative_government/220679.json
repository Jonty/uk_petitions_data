        "additional_details": "The Terror threat level in Europe is getting worse, with innocent people of all races being murdered. The threat to the Jewish community is always greater, in particular when elements of the media promote anti-semitic perspectives on the Middle East conflict. The Gov't Provides armed Police for Foreign embassies and must do the same for it's own citizens who need it.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for a policeman or security guard without a weapon to protect sites from  terrorists armed with weapons.",
        "background": "European governments are providing armed security for synagogues and Jewish institutions following numerous fatal terror attacks. This is because where there is a serious risk of fatalities, the only feasible solution is to provide armed security for Jewish public places. The UK must do the same.",
