Ideally  some form of personal photographic numbered electoral card should be introduced in all areas, in all elections and referendums. \r\n\r\nThe UK Postal Voting system is totally open to fraud and should not be freely available to everyone, the only exceptions should be the very elderly and the extremely disabled who are unable to get to a polling station.   In all instances all postal votes should have to be reapplied for every 3 years.",
