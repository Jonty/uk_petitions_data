The government and the British Horseracing Authority have turned a blind eye to this truly serious issue.\r\n\r\nImagine not knowing anything other than racing with a heavy load on your back, being whipped to make you run faster than you thought was possible. And just when you are about to collapse, you are ordered to run even faster. You grow old. You get sent to the abbotoir. This isn't fair.",
        "background": "We believe that equestrian sports should be made a criminal offence because many horses die or are seriously injured both mentally and physically as a result of this.\r\n\r\nThe government ignored the last petition, saying there had been no deaths since 2012. This time, a horse has died. Listen to us.",
