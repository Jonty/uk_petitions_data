Therefore the law should be changed and recognise that at the age of 17 you are old enough too go out and consume alcohol. Yes many can argue that they are still young but how can they justify it when 17 year olds are viewed as eligible parents. Looking at the acts the law should be changed.",

The law should recognise that those that are 17 years of age are old enough too consume alcohol.",
