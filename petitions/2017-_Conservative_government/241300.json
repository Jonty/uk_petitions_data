        "additional_details": "Pay extra \u00a3 310 along with road tax up to five years and after five years pay normal road tax. WHY AND FOR WHAT DO WE PAY EXTRA \u00a3310 for five years. Is this a kind of punishment to buy little extra luxury in life after all hard work and pay humongous income tax genuinely?",
        "background": "My petition is to remove the unjustified road tax for cars over \u00a340000. Vehicle tax is depends on engine size and CO2 emissions, which is fair enough. But paying extra \u00a3 310 for cars over \u00a340000 up to five years is totally baseless and unfair to car owners.\r\n",
