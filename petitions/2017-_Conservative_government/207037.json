        "additional_details": "Over the past three years, approximately 6000 new homes have been and continue to be built in Nuneaton, without the relevant infrastructure, schools or health services. Residents in the Higham Lane and Weddington areas are gravely concerned about the impact the proposed Top Farm development will have on congestion and the environment. We question the purpose and location of these houses, while so many brown belt properties in prime locations, remain vacant and derelict.",
        "background": "There is a proposal to build approximately 1700 new houses and other amenities on the land at Top Farm on the outskirts of Nuneaton. This has met huge controversy with local residents for a number of reasons including the inevitable impact on the infrastructure and environment.",
