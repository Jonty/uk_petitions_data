        "additional_details": "Walking around my local Tesco supermarket on the 4th January I was confronted with Easter chocolates for sale (and we're talking proper Easter eggs, not just small cream eggs) I also understand some retailers had Easter out on New Years day. This is wrong and erodes the meaning of these events as they are becoming like the sales, an event that happens every day. It is not good for children to see things available so quickly as this does not teach them anything about the significance of the day.",
        "background": "This is destroying the spirit of Christmas and Easter as they are becoming one event. There should be a restriction that prevents shops from doing this, eg a time restriction of for example 8 weeks before Easter.",
