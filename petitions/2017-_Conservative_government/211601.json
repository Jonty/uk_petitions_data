        "action": "Automatic Settlement Rights to the Elderly Parents of the British Citizens",
        "additional_details": "In the past few years, the immigration rules have made it virtually impossible for the elderly dependent parents/relatives of the British citizen to settle in the UK. This has led to the elderly parents forced to leave the UK and/or refusal of their entry clearance application resulting them living alone without the vital physical and emotional support. A change in the law is well overdue to make sure that they live with the dignity that they deserve in the most vulnerable years of their lives with their loved ones.",
        "background": "Elderly parents/relatives should be given an automatic right to settle in the UK subject to their UK family\u2019s ability to maintain and accommodate them without recourse to the public funds.",
