People are struggling to pay rent, council tax, car insurance, food, gas and electric and water rates. Alot off people in the UK are accumulating more and more debt because there is insificate help for people on low incomes, and by doing what they doing with the Universal Credits is putting for strain and pressure on working families and persons.",
        "background": "I am starting this petition on behalf of the working families within the UK. \r\nBy 2019 everyone who claims Child Tax Credits and Working Tax Credits will then be transferred on to what they call \"universal credit\" which then goes through the job centre.",
