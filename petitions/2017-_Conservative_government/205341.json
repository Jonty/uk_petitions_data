        "additional_details": "There is (as seems to have been the case in the USA and the UK recently) much greater risk of external agencies inappropriately influencing the vote.  And those agencies\\individuals who have greater financial resources (and probably lobbying interests) can also unfairly influence the voting patterns.\r\nA 60% majority would to some extent indicate a genuine ground swell of opinion towards the change.",
        "background": "We vote for M.P.s to make decisions on our behalf. They have the time to research and debate issues appropriately. When major decisions are handed over to the population, there is a significant risk of voting being based on  emotional or personal rather than objective reasons.",
