        "additional_details": "In response to the ongoing campaigns for the option of the UK to remain a full member of the EU, as clearly demonstrated by the massive marches and demonstrations in London, elsewhere and online. \r\n\r\nTo proceed with brexit, ignoring:\r\nthe 'Current Will of The Good People of The United Kingdom', is UnDemocratic and UnBritish.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the correct response to the referendum result did not happen in 2016, is shameful, to continue to decieve ourselves is both foolhardy and unforgivible.",
        "background": "The 2016 'referendum' result, was both legaly and technicaly not a decision, but simply a display of how divided the nation was and still is. \r\nSuch an indecisive result, requires further debate and education including legaly defining  'Leave/Brexit', before seeking 'the people's opinion' again.",
