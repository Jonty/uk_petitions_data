        "additional_details": "Given the sizes of these documents, the 'reader' may inadvertently agree to terms not directly related to their immediate and expected business with the provider. In their current form Ts & Cs do not support the common good. E.g. commonly used clauses like \"how we will shared your data\" should be clearly defined as a predicate to a defined clause describing data usage. All terms must be defined in law. The Government must develop minimum standards for Ts & Cs, require companies to follow them.",
        "background": "Nobody reads Ts & Cs. The rise of internet/mobile services has hugely increased how often we encounter Ts & Cs. We need regulation to closely define the language used and compel companies to use standardised clauses, phrases. This will allow readers to understand to what it is they're agreeing.",
