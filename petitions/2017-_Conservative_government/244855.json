        "action": "Abandon HS2 and prioritise the funds to tackle knife crime in our communities.",
        "additional_details": "With the project cost soaring towards \u00a3100bn it would be better to stop HS2 now and instead use most of the money to restore Police numbers nationally, re-open Police stations where possible and tackle rising crime levels, in particular funding anti knife crime initiatives; e.g opening youth clubs to give youngsters somewhere to go instead of hanging round in groups on street corners. This knife crime epidemic threatens the very fabric of our society.  The public are extremely concerned.",
        "background": "The business case for HS2 has not been made. We ask that the money \r\n saved from this widely thought vanity project be used to restore Police numbers,re-open Police stations and support projects to tackle knife crime and rising crime generally;  this effects us all and the very fabric of society.",
