        "additional_details": "Worcester County Council have recognised this junction is sub standard but do not have the funding, despite funding a \u00a38m project to raise the road by 1metre so we can now queue 365 days a year and not worry about the couple of weeks every 10 years or so that the road flooded.\r\n20 years of using this junction, I have now idea who has the right of way when entering and turning right. Maybe a \"no right turn sign\" would help, making all traffic to go left and then join the road at the Defford turn",
        "background": "The junction is unsuitable for a trunk road. When joining the A38 and turning right when leaving Upton it is almost impossible to make the manoeuvre, this creates miles of queuing traffic. The junction is like a scrapyard, with car parts littered from the frequent collisions.",
