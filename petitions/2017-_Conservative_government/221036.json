        "additional_details": "Currently, it is possible to donate to small pockets of the NHS, mainly NHS Trusts, however, this doesn't go far enough and it's pretty hard to access. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, the RNLI raised \u00a3196m (this figure grows year on year) through fundraising, imagine if the NHS created a central pot to accept donations.",
        "background": "There's one thing everyone agrees on in the UK, everyone values the NHS. The incredible impact from NHS staff is felt by family and friends near and far. Yet while the Government discusses blanket tax rises, they fail to recognise the easiest route to raising cash, through voluntary donations.",
