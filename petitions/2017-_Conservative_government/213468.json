        "additional_details": "Currently in the UK, those in receipt of a student loan have it included as \u201cincome\u201d when benefits are calculated, and it can affect their entitlement.\r\n\r\nPart-time students are particularly at risk; should they find themselves temporarily unable to work, they may not be eligible for the same financial assistance as another person in exactly the same position as them who is not in part-time study.\r\n\r\nFor more information on benefits that are affected by student loan: https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Benefit-guides/Student-Support/How-does-student-support-affect-benefits",
        "background": "We are calling upon the government to stop penalising those who are committed to making themselves more employable by studying for Higher Education qualifications.\r\n\r\nA student loan must be paid back (with interest). It is not a grant - and therefore should not be considered as income.",
