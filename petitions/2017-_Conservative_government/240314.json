        "additional_details": "I would like all taxi companies to ensure taxi drivers and escorts have an awareness session before applying for tender with local authorities.  \r\n\r\nThis is a UK wide problem.  It is inconceivable to think you would put your child into transport with someone who knows absolutely nothing about their condition or how to help if there is a problem.\r\n\r\nSimple things like drivers being aware that something as small as an air freshener can cause great sensory distress.",
        "background": "When you have a special needs child, sometimes non verbal;  you must put your absolute trust in those involved with your child's care.\r\n\r\nMy child goes to school in special needs transport as do countless others.  There is NO requirement for those who care for him in this time to have any training.",
