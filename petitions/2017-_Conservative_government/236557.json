It is unjust to force all EU nationals currently living in the U.K. to have to pay for the new \u2018Settled Status\u2019 application. \r\nAs an EU national, many of us cannot vote in General Elections therefor make little difference, yet we pay taxes like any other employee. \r\n\r\nMake the applications for \u2018Settled Status\u2019 free for all existing EU nationals in the U.K.",
        "background": "With Brexit and its embarrassingly (still) unclear direction, the Government\u2019s proposal concerning EU citizens in the U.K. has remained the same throughout. In short the Government is forcing all EU citizens to pay for a new \u2018settled status\u2019 or face deportation - Thank you Theresa and Co.",
