        "additional_details": "This is also to account for any ACOs, or any other organisation operating under the thinly veiled guise of privatisation. \r\n\r\nA priority needs to be placed on our NHS. When the current political party can muster \u00a31 billion for the DUP and find endless resources for unjust attacks on foreign nations, it can certainly find resource to support an institution that is not only ingrained in our society, our society depends upon it.\r\n\r\nIf our healthcare is owned by others, they will start to own us.",
        "background": "The NHS is not a commodity to be sold at the will of any political party; the ownership lies with the tax paying general public. Therefore, before ANY party makes a decision on the future of the NHS it has to be presented to the general public first in the form of a national referendum.",
