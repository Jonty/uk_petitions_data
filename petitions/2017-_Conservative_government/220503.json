        "additional_details": "Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is when a person with epilepsy dies suddenly and prematurely, and no other cause of death is found. Around 1,200 people die from Epilepsy each year in the UK. Around half of these deaths are SUDEP (sudden unexpected death in epilepsy). If you have seizures during the night, having a seizure alarm that alerts someone if you have a seizure is a life changer. The Government must provide enough funding for everyone who needs one.",
        "background": "I decided to start this petition after my son, 2 years old, got diagnosed with epilepsy and started to have nocturnal seizures. 1st December 2016 is when it all began with his first seizure - a 4 hour status seizure which resulted in him having to be placed into a coma on life support for 2 weeks.",
