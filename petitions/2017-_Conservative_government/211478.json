        "additional_details": "Fur in 10 drivers admit they sometimes break 30mph speed limits by at least 10mph. A quarter (24%) admitted to doing this regularly, at least once a month. The technology to restrict vehicle speed to the local limit is now available and yet is not fitted to new vehicles. There is little consistency in law - the British government currently bans the sale of electric bicycles capable of travelling at over 15.5 mph under their own steam, but allows the sale of cars capable of 155 mph.",
        "background": "In many areas of life, the government imposes restrictions on the sale of items that threaten life. Most motorised vehicles are capable of of easily capable of travelling at 50% above the national speed limit. Cars exceeding speed limits kill and are a major cause of road danger.",
