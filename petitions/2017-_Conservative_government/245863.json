In Dec 2016 Alexander Nix was spotted in 10 Downing Street yet this did not appear on the transparency data and is not being properly responded to in PMQ\u2019s. Art 50 must be revoked and first true referendum is needed",

The PM has strategically \u2018run down the clock\u2019 in order to force the HoC into voting for her deal, or no deal at all. I urge everybody reading to research exactly what is happening.",
