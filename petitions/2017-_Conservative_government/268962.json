        "additional_details": "Ethiopia recently instigated a national Green Legacy Initiative with the aim of planting 4billion trees this summer. In just one day they closed public offices and organised a nationwide event, encouraging every citizen to plant at least 40 seedlings. This led to 353 million trees being planted. The rest of the world should follow Ethiopia's example and launch similar initiatives, starting here in Britain.",
        "background": "Following the example of Ethiopia who planted 350million trees in one day, we call on the government to instigate a similar initiative, a nationwide day of tree planting with an ambitious goal, to combat climate change",
