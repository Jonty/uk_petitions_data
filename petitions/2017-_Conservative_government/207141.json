        "action": "Introduce mandatory dog licence In the UK",
        "additional_details": "Let\u2019s only permit responsible people to own dogs. How many times must we read stories of serious injuries or death, mistreated pets attacking adults, children or other dogs. Having adequate licence regulations in place would help weed out and ban future ownership of dogs belonging to people incapable of the task of raising a dog in a caring and responsible manner. If you are a caring dog lover then please support this petition to make life safer and kinder for both owners and dogs.",
        "background": "We all know in most cases it\u2019s not the dog but the owner at fault. If you are happy to take on the responsibility of the care of a pet dog then you should not be adverse to paying a fair licence fee and being held responsible for the dogs actions.",
