        "action": "The UK must expel the North Korean ambassador",
        "additional_details": "Other countries which have expelled their North Korean ambassador include: Spain; Kuwait; Peru; Mexico; and Botswana.  Meanwhile Egypt, the Philippines, and Uganda have drastically scaled back diplomatic ties.\r\n\r\nLondon has an (est. 20,000) Korean community from both North and South.  North Korean \"enforcers\" spy on this community as well as locals (who aren't always Korean) near the embassy, intimidating people who joke about the country or regime.\r\n\r\nThey shouldn't benefit from life in London.",
        "background": "North Korea is a rogue state threatening the entire world.  They are extreme cybercriminals, exporters of terrorism, and have now ramped up their nuclear weapons programme in defiance of UN sanctions and international outcry.\r\n\r\nWe must send a strong message by expelling their ambassador.",
