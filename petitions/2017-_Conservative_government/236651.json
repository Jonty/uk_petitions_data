        "additional_details": "1 in 10 girls aged 14 to 21 can\u2019t afford menstrual products. \r\nA menstrual cup can last for up to 10 years.\r\nMany women have been forced to use improvised alternatives such as socks and toilet roll.\r\nAn average cost of a period in the UK is \u00a3128 in a year. This would be a saving of \u00a31,280 over 10 years.\r\nYoung women shouldn\u2019t have their education needlessly compromised.\r\nUse of menstrual cups will reduce non degradable sanitary products being sent to landfill and polluting our environment.",
        "background": "Period poverty can be stamped out and our government can do a lot more about it. Free menstral cups and education in how to use them should be given to 11 year old girls when they start secondary school. Half of all school girls needlessly miss at least one full day of school due to their period.",
