        "action": "End discrimination of pay based on age",
        "additional_details": "The system where minimum wages depend on what are you are just doesn't add up - life isn't any cheaper just because you are younger and the minimum wage for younger people should be raised to match that of people who are 25+.\r\n\r\nThis law teaches young people that they are worth less to society and it is disheartening to know that you are being paid less than your colleagues for doing the same work - if not working harder as younger workers usually bear the brunt of undesirable jobs and positions.",
        "background": "People who are younger and doing the same work should not be discriminated against based on their age. We live in an accepting and tolerant society where it would be unthinkable to pay any section of society less money based on their characteristics, so why do we discriminate against younger people?",
