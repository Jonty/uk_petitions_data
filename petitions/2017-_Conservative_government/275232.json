        "additional_details": "As the Dawlish Chamber of Trade and Commerce Chairman, I constantly hear if anything is going to be done about the abysmal speed that BT seem to think is acceptable.  \r\n\r\nI also run a business running live webcams along the South Devon coast. I run my cameras in Dawlish at 5000 kbps and can barely run the in Dawlish Warren at 100 kbps.\r\n\r\nThis has been a topic of frustration for many years in Dawlish Warren while every other area surrounding seems to be on super fast fibre.",
        "background": "I have been talking with local residents, business owners and holiday makers over the past 4 years about the BT network in Dawlish Warren that is unfit for purpose.\r\n\r\nThe internet is so slow in Dawlish Warren but neighbouring Dawlish has ultra fast fibre.",
