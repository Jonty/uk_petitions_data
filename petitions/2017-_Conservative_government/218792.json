        "additional_details": "All the political parties receive funding which they use to manage their parties and campaigns etc. The taxpayer already funds too much public sector/NHS compensation and in this particular case the blame for the Windrush position is firmly with politicians. Their parties should therefore provide funds for the compensation not the tax payer.",
        "background": "The blame for the Windrush debacle can be apportioned to all the political parties in government since the decision was made to destroy landing cards. At this time of austerity & cutting of essential services the compensation should be directly paid out of political party funds not by the tax payer.",
