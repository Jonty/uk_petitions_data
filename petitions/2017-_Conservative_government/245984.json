        "action": "Raise licence renewal years for drivers over 70 from 3 years to 5 years.",
        "additional_details": "The pension age has been increased due to the better health care now available. The older population is now therefore much more aware and fitter than in past years. They are more cognisant of their surroundings thereby making them safer on the roads so should not now be discriminated against. The change could also be looked as being a cost saving exercise with regard to the population's longevity. More people over 70 more cost in providing free renewals.",
        "background": "Longevity due to better health care leads to a fitter older population. Because of this the 3 years for a renewal of a driving licence for those of 70 or over should also be raised to 5 years. Or allow the first over 70 licence be 5 years and subsequent licences then to be 3 years.",
