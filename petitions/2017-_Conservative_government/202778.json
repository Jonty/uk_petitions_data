        "additional_details": "My first year car insurance was \u00a31600 on a Ford Ka. Paid in monthly instalments. Unfortunately I crashed in my first year due to a spillage on the road during a wet day. Unavoidable. I was following the speed limit, no one else was involved. But my insurance is due to rise to upwards of \u00a33000 in January. I am 19 and well paid for my age but still this is going to be a struggle. I know many people who also struggle with this however first year drivers older than 24 pay less, how does that work?",
        "background": "Insurance prices in this modern day are through the roof. And its even worse for young drivers. I know there is more of a chance of us crashing due to lack of experience however we still need to get to work and function as a part of society.",
