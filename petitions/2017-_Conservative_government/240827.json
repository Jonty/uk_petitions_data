        "additional_details": "The decision-making process around the cost-effectiveness of prescription drugs is very obscure. The Government must make clearly understandable information available to explain how cost-effectiveness is calculated and how quality-adjusted life years work and consult the public on how they quantify the cost of a life. These calculations must be reviewed, as patients are dying because they can\u2019t access the medication they need.",
        "background": "NHS and NICE guidelines for prescribing drugs should lead to the highest quality of patient care. Patients deserve access to drugs that can help to either save, extend or improve their lives no matter what the cost. The cost of drugs can be quantified, but how does one quantify the cost of a life?",
