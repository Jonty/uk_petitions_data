        "action": "Make the House of Lords appointment process fully independent from government.",
        "additional_details": "The government's power to select members of the House of Lords, leaves the Chamber open to unethical appointments, for example the recent selection made by Prime Minister Theresa May, which appears to be an attempt at quelling opposing voices inside government: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44167066\r\nThis should never be allowed. A fully independent body must be set up to elect peers to the House of Lords.",
        "background": "Peers are appointed by the Queen on the prime minister's advice. Some members are recommended by an independent body, called the House of Lords Appointments Commission, but only for non-party-political individuals. This process allows government to tip the balance in the Lords for political gain.",
