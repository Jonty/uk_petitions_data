        "additional_details": "When we used to obtain new passports any time left on the old passport was automatically added to the new passport.  Thus ensuring that on always paid for a FULL 10 years.  \r\n\r\nThis is no longer the case which means that we pay for a 10 year passport which can only effectively be used for a period of 9 1/2 years.\r\n\r\nThis effectively constitutes a 5% increase on the cost of our passport s.\r\n\r\nThe decision to stop adding existing time on old to new passport appears arbitrary and extremely unfair.",
        "background": "We used to get any remaining time left on our passport added to the expiry date of the new passport.\r\n\r\nAs passport is not accepted in most countries with less than 6 months to expiry this effectively means we are purchasing passport for 9 1/2 years not 10 years.  Unintended price rise ?. !!!!!!!",
