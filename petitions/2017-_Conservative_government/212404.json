Who does this? Why is it happening? \r\nWe need a deterrent - jail for a LONG time.\r\nWe need more action for these images to never hit the screens or ever made.",
        "background": "I hear more and more stories of adults prying on young children, even children hurting and torturing other children, adults looking at child pornographing and when (and if) they get caught they receive minimal time in jail for punishment - if that.\r\nWe need tougher sentencing & removal of images.",
