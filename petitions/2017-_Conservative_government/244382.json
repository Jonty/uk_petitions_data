        "additional_details": "Each year thousands and thousands of children are victimised and exploited by paedophiles, either family members or grooming on and offline, and yet the government still do not seem to be doing anything to get rid of these monsters. Letting paedophiles off with light sentences is sending messages that the consequences of these crimes are minimal. I am calling upon the government to debate the sentences that paedophiles get for their crimes and asking them to consider LIFE imprisonment no parole.",
        "background": "The Government seem to be doing absolutely nothing about cases of paedophilia and sexual exploitation of children. All that is given is a slap on the wrist and absolutely delusional sentences for the heinous crimes. I call on the government to change the sentences for sex offences against children.",
