After allowing an insurer to obtain a targeted medical report from my GP they have offered to cover me, but I was shocked that there was around a 200% premium increase compared to that of my wife\u2019s. The added financial burdens will not only deter people from getting help but will also add more pressure to those affected and may hinder recovery.",

After a battle with myself I finally built up the courage to get the help I needed, but It has now taken me 2 years",
