        "additional_details": "Over the last 10 years the Government has continually capped and sliced funding to the areas of Welfare and Social Care.  We call on the Government to scrap the plans for changing the colour of the UK passport to Blue and to use the reported \u00a3500 Million allocated to that budget to be used where it can serve a better purpose:  Use the money to alleviate poverty and homelessness to some degree in the UK as a whole.",
        "background": "We find it ludicrous that the Government would consider wasting \u00a3500 Million on changing our passports to a different colour when that money could be put to better use towards alleviating poverty and homelessness in the UK as a whole.",
