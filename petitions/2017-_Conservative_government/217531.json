        "additional_details": "A conflict in Syria between U.S. and Russian forces is not only something that we cannot afford to take part in, it's something we should do everything in our power to prevent. The potential consequences of such a conflict - a huge civilian death toll and the risk of igniting nuclear war - are things that need to be avoided at all costs. We urge the government not to take part in any military action in Syria but instead, with urgency, focus all available resources on finding political solutions and aiding diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russian governments.",
        "background": "Bombing Syria will not help the situation. It will kill more civilians and ignite a conflict that could spiral out of control, causing massive devastation. We call on the government to refuse to engage in the conflict. Focus on political solutions and aiding diplomacy between the US and Russia",
