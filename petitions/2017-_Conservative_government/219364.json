        "action": "Remove standardised testing from schools in the U.K.",
        "additional_details": "As Frederick J. Kelly, the man who invented standardised testing, once said \u201cThese tests are too crude to be used and should be abandoned.\u201d Every child is different which is what they are told throughout school, but when it comes to it every child is tested in the same way, not taking into consideration their abilities and strengths. Tests put a lot of unnecessary pressure on both schools and students.",
        "background": "I believe strongly in the fact that every child is different and deserves to be tested as an individual not as a collective group. Tests are not suitable for every child.",
