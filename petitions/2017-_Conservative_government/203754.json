        "additional_details": "Most disposable cutlery isn't recyclable and even recyclable cutlery pollutes and uses up precious and expensive energy. Also, normal cutlery and metal straws are so much more practical as: they only need to be bought once and then put into the dishwasher/cleaned with the cleaning brush and then put away whereas disposable cutlery is bought many times and each time put into the bin, which you then need to take out.",
        "background": "Disposable cutlery and straws are meant for single use only. They then end up in our ecosystem and cause harm eg. by killing turtles.The fossil fuels used making disposable cutlery and straws are bad for human health.",
