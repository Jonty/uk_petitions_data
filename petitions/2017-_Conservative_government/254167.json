        "additional_details": "In nations like Australia, polling day is a weekend or holiday, and if we made it a bank holiday in the UK and have people the day off work then those people that have to work two jobs or have busy work lives can have more time on their hands to go down to the polling station (if they don't use a postal ballot) and cast their vote.",
        "background": "Many people across Britain have busy lives and can sometimes struggle to find the time to post their ballot or go down to the polling station. By making Polling Day a Bank Holiday, we can allow more people the opportunity to engage in the democratic process in Britain.",
