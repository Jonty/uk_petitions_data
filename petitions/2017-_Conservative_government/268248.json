It goes against the laws of democracy to deny the public the right to choose who represents us, and we demand that right by insisting on a general election before the end of this government's allocated time in power.",
        "background": "Not one single person in the UK voted for this current government. We deserve a chance to choose who will be making the decisions that affect us all, instead of having the choice forced on us. Give us the choice to elect who we actually want to run the country.",
