        "action": "Make it illegal to smoke within 10 metres of a dwelling if it is hotter than 25C",
        "additional_details": "I personally have been hugely affected by this issue. Smokers pollute the environment and contribute to global warming. They also severely harm others with second hand smoke, especially children. \r\nChildren are often unable to play in the garden in the summer due to the noxious gases being emitted from the smoke, this causes a deficiency in vitamin D. This law will apply to all areas (public or residential) unless the owner of the properties affected allows them to smoke. Penalty: \u00a3400 - 6 months",
        "background": "In the summer, due to global warming, temperatures now regularly reach 30 - 35C. This is extremely hot and it is simply insulting to expect people to not open their windows because inconsiderate people are smoking outside their house.",
