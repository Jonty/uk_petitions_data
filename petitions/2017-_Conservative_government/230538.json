        "action": "Reduce the age of buying beer and alco-pops 5% and under, wine under 13% to 16",
        "additional_details": "This theory is modelled on many European countries laws; Belgium, Germany and Spain. In 2016, 7,327 people died from alcohol related deaths of which many were caused by excessive drinking of spirits. The countries current legislation promotes the use of spirits for underage teenagers to become intoxicated. So by legalising a safer alternative to consume alcohol, which is an inevitability, there will be a decrease in alcohol related medical conditions in underage teenagers.",
        "background": "We would like the legal age of purchasing certain alcoholic beverages to the age of 16. By reducing the purchasing of beer and wine to 16 there will be less consumption of hard spirits as well as the use of counterfeit identification. This will promote a safer way for children to experiment.",
