        "additional_details": "Children can have many complex medical needs/ food allergies. As well as everyday trips and bumps in the playground. Unfortunately acciends have been reported in the news and a recent case of a boy choking at lunchtime. All staff should be trained to avoid being left without a first aider for our children when they need one. All adults working with children should know what to do.",
        "background": "Not all members of preschool/school staff are first aid trained only a select few. Trained adults can be absent from work or out on a course or a school trip and leave the school without a first aider. This is a particular issue at lunchtimes in school when the adult ratio to children is often low.",
