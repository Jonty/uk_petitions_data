Democracy demands we have the right to vote  Grenfell disaster, Windrush hostile environment and Cambridge Analytica scandals & Carillion collapse, homelessness crisis, rise in child poverty, cuts to Police & rise in violent crime.

Zero hours contracts, poverty wages and the Brexit shambles.",

Any modern day Prime Minister that suffered a colossal historical defeat in the House of Commons like the Brexit deal would  resign. \r\nMay has shown no leadership and since the start of her premiership has shown a complete lack of judgement, arrogance & incompetence.",
