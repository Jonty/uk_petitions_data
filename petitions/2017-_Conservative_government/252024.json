        "action": "Replace the current electoral system with a Proportional Representation system",
        "additional_details": "Brexit has shown us just how ineffective Parliament, and partisan politicians, can be. Party and personal interests have overridden the need to govern in the nation's best interest, and decisions are forced through in back-room deals costing the taxpayer billions. we need a Parliament that is truly representative of how people vote, and only a proper system of Proportional representation can deliver that. We're fed up with self-serving, partisan leaders. We the people want our government back.",
        "background": "Recent political deadlock has shown just how broken our FPTP electoral process has become, with partisan posturing damaging our nation. Replacing the current system with proportional representation will ensure Parliament reflects the people's vote, and will force co-operation at Westminster at last.",
