        "additional_details": "The National Minimum apprenticeship wage in the United Kingdom is \u00a33.90 per hour. The National Living Wage for an 18-20 year old in the United Kingdom is \u00a36.60, and for someone under 18, the National Living Wage is \u00a34.35. Apprentices are paid less than the living wage, and students are essentially paying to do placements when they pay their annual tuition. All placements should be paid at least apprenticeship wage as it is work that counts towards a qualification as with an apprenticeship.",
        "background": "So many students are required as part of their course to work unpaid hours- up to and over 40 a week, in order to get their degree. As this counts towards their degree, they are essentially paying to work. This also makes it very difficult to get a part time paid job for financial support.",
