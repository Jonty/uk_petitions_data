However, in my modernism lecture alone I missed at least 5 weeks due to strikes.\r\n\r\nYou would never be expected to pay for a service that you did not receive. University tuition is a service, why should this circumstance be treated any differently?",
        "background": "University fees are already extortionate enough being \u00a39000 a year. Thousands of students are going to be graduating with at least \u00a327,000 debt hanging over them just as tuition fees. If we did not receive the tuition for a considerable amount of time, why should we be expected to pay in full?",
