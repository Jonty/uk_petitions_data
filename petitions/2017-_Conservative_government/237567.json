        "additional_details": "Carrol James is a 74-year-old South African grandmother who, in October 2014, moved to the UK with her husband of over 40 years, Bernard James. Bernard is a full British citizen. Carrol was told that she would have to eventually return to South Africa. Bernard has been fighting this decision for the past 4 years, spending thousands of pounds in legal and administrative costs, and has now been told that it was all for nothing and that she will have to return to South Africa.",
        "background": "Carrol James arrived in October 2014 from South Africa with her husband who is a British citizen. Now, almost 5 years later and after a lengthy legal process, she is being refused the right to remain in the UK with her husband and family. She faces a return to a volatile and dangerous South Africa.",
