        "additional_details": "ITV reported it, dicriminating against the church on mainstream media for having a biblical view in a place of worship. So now there is no tolerance for Christians in a country where there is freedom of religion by those asking for tolerance. The man came into the church seeking help from a church with biblical views. The church did not go looking for the man and force their views on them. This public bullying of the church is an effort to aggressively oppress a group of people in the free world",
        "background": "Itv news sent a reporter into a London church pretending to seek counsel from a pastor about being gay. The pastor responded with the bible\u2019s view without condemnation and offered prayers for the person not knowing they were being filmed. The language used by ITV was false and was a public attack",
