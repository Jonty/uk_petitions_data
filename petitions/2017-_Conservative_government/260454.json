        "additional_details": "If you wish to learn more, search online for proportional representation, alternative vote and single transferable voting systems. We don't have to be beholden to what we've always done and we do have the power to make real and significant differences to how our country operates. There is no need to feel that the only power you have is spoilt or withheld ballots.",
        "background": "The UK voting system is out dated and does not fit with party politics or what we, the electorate, truly want from our parliament and executive. First past the post promotes tactical voting, not voting for who we believe in so we should push for a more representative form of creating our government.",
