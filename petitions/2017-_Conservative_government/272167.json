        "additional_details": "We propose the government create a mechanism by which the views of the under 18s can be canvassed by politicians in relation to climate issues.\r\nThis could be through consultation with focus groups made up of school eco-representatives rr through the creation of youth climate summit like they have at the UN. Under 18s should be given the opportunity to express their views on local national and international climate policies with a view to influencing legislation through MP's.",
        "background": "Adults are responsible for the climate change we are experiencing. They can also make the decisions that will improve or worsen the situation. \r\nUnder 18s cannot vote, but will be the ones most affected by these changes so their opinions should be taken into account before such decisions are made.",
