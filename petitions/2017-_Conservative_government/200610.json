        "additional_details": "Families\u2019 rights must be protected with a new law to ensure that the state only revokes parents/children\u2019s rights by court process. Authorities must provide evidence to a judge to prove neglect or harm to a child. Parents/children must be granted full and equal access to legal aid and justice as the authorities. Domestic law must be accessible, comprehensible and any defects enabling the abuse of people\u2019s rights must be addressed. It\u2019s in any society's interest that families & children flourish",
        "background": "A change of law is required as parent\u2019s rights can be revoked unnecessarily, excessively denying them a say in their children\u2019s treatment. Current law tramples on innocent parents/children\u2019s rights and is open to misinterpretation/abuse allowing public bodies to collaborate to abuse families\u2019 rights",
