Let\u2019s make it easier to get a child into the right school. Inclusion, not exclusion. No mainstream school could cater for my son. Many children are placed in the wrong provisions to make the numbers match. It\u2019s time this changed and this process is looked at.",
        "background": "I thought my son would go to mainstream school, I was wrong. If the EHCP was a procedure that was required to happen, he would not be without a school. Most high rate DLA children cannot cope in a mainstream school. This needs to be in place to give parents the options that\u2019s right for their child.",
