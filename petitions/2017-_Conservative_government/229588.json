        "action": "Introduce a law to fit microchips in every ammunition round produced in the UK",
        "additional_details": "This will take time, but will reap benefits in years to come once existing stocks have depleted. This would need a small hand held device that could be worn by security officials that will send a vibrating alarm to the wearer and log the GPS location and serial numbers of all ammunition read by the microchips. The microchips would be similar to those used in dogs, only the size of a grain of rice. They would be inserted, by law into the gunpowder of every round made.",
        "background": "With gun crime on the rise in the UK, it makes sense to try to detect those people carrying ammunition by means of a detection device worn by anyone with a reason to do so e.g. Police officers. A gun with no ammunition cannot kill.",
