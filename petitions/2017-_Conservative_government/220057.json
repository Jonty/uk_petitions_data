        "additional_details": "I understand prison is place for people who broke the law but prison nowadays are full of people suffering from mental health issues who should not be there in the first place.\r\nPrisons are the new \"Asylums\" and inmates suffering from mental health issues are particularly vulnerable in a cell sharing scenario.\r\nPrison is about the loss of freedom, not suffering further torture while inside one.",
        "background": "Prison is a very stressful and violent environment. People are placed there to be so called \"reabilitated'.\r\nIn order for a prisoner to progress, inmates should not have to endure the added suffering that is to share a cell.\r\nHow would you feel if you had to go to the toilet in front of a stranger.",
