        "action": "Government not to introduce a night time driving ban for young motorists.",
        "additional_details": "The idea comes from apparent figures that suggest a fifth of young drivers have an accident within their first year of driving. Restrictions could include not driving with passengers under a certain age.\r\n\r\nThere isn't a current ban on young drivers from driving at night. However in the news broadcasted yesterday the idea was said to go to parliament, this petition asks for the Government to not go ahead with this and leave young people free to drive 24 hours a day without restriction.",
        "background": "Young people could be banned from driving at night. This could affect thousands of young adults forcing them to find another job or give up on a career. I think we need to divide sensible drivers to ones that contribute to accidents on the road, and not just classify the situation by age.",
