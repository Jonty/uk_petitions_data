        "action": "Introduce owner-funded dog DNA register so that Councils can fine owners easier.",
        "additional_details": "DNA registration is relatively cheap, and economies of scale with a national database would reduce the costs further. This cost would be the responsibility of the owner, and a legal requirement to have a dog DNA registered. Due to the amount of dog fouling, especially on open public spaces away from Wardens/Police, there is very little chance of anyone being fined for letting their dog foul, or picking it up but throwing their dog bag into the hedge.",
        "background": "Dog fouling is the blight of Britain.Whilst Councils have powers to enforce legislation most don't have the manpower to do this away from town centres. A DNA register would allow a much more efficient prosecution process. People have the right to walk without looking at their feet.",
