        "additional_details": "According to Shelter, over 300,000 people are homeless in the UK - in temporary accommodation, sleeping on the streets or in cars.\r\nThere are over 200,000 long-term empty homes in the UK (www.emptyhomes.com/assets/2017-10-17-empty-homes-press-release.pdf).\r\nEven with just 2 bedrooms per home, that's enough to house everyone and end homelessness immediately.\r\nHowever, since the right to own empty properties and second homes beats other people's rights to a home, access to those homes is denied.",
        "background": "The homeless crisis in the UK is not caused by a lack of housing, but by access to housing being denied to homeless people.\r\nWe demand that access to habitable shelter be recognised as a human right, so that action can be taken to end homelessness immediately - with no one left out.",
