        "additional_details": "There used to be direct flights with Ryanair that were very convenient and always very busy. Although they were still cancelled.\r\nNow to get to Riga you have to fly through Lithuania and then get 4h uncomfortable drive by mini bus to Latvia.\r\nOr you could travel to South East airport (Luton or Stansted airport) which lets say say from Tiverton in Devon is about 5h drive away. \r\nSo if you live in UK permanently but are from Latvia and want to visit your family back there it is very uncomfortable even on your own. Let alone if you have children.\r\nSo please help us get all the signatures to get this problem sorted.",
        "background": "Bristol airport is a central point for Latvian people from all over South West to fly and visit their homecountry. And not having direct flights makes it very difficult to do so.",
