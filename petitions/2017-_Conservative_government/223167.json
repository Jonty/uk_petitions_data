        "action": "Require local councils to issue parking charges by recorded delivery",
        "additional_details": "There are many instances on multiple forums of people experiencing this exact issue. It\u2019s unfair to not have received the original letter on time and as a result the fine being multiplied and even in some cases warrants issued to bailiffs. I personally didn't receive the first PCN letter and the fine was \u00a365, now the fine is \u00a3195 as a result of not receiving the 2nd class letter sent out by the local council. Is this fair or just a money making loop hole by the councils.",
        "background": "Sending PCNs by 2nd class postage does not guarantee delivery to home addresses and as a result quite often representation or appeal of the contravention is missed. Recorded delivery would eliminate this issue and the cost should be added to the original PCN meaning no cost to the council.",
