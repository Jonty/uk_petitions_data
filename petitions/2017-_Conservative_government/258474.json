Results must always go up..no each child and year is different they do what they can to reach what they can do. Not an imaginary bar set by government. If a child is only a year 4 ability by the time they leave so what?As long as they are doing the best they can and progressing at a natural rate where is the harm for that child. these are children not a statistic",

Creativity and enjoyment of learning has been removed.Nobody,families,children or staff want these barbaric tests. Secondary schools don't use the findings and it is just another stick for OfSted to beat teachers with",
