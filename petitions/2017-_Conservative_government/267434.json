        "additional_details": "The emotional distress caused from the prosecution process often only worsens the survivor\u2019s mental state. Things need to change. Support needs to be offered to all survivors and all should have an equal chance to fight for justice. Many times survivors can\u2019t prove their case. But all should be given the chance to tell the court their story despite lack of physical evidence. Survivors lost their voices once already... The least they deserve is the chance to feel in control again by being heard.",
        "background": "Only 6% of all sexual related offences end in criminal prosecution. This is not enough. So many survivors are put through hell in the aftermath whilst they are made to prove their truths. It\u2019s almost impossible to prove without physical evidence & even then it\u2019s not guaranteed. This needs to change.",
