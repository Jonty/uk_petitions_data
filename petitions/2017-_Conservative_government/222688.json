        "additional_details": "Food insecurity is where a person is unable to get adequate food due to a lack of resources. In the UK many suffer from food insecurity as prices continue to rise. \r\n\r\nThe summer holidays of 2017 were a time of hardship as families struggled to make ends meet. Oxfam reports that 1 in 6 parents have gone without food in order to feed their families.\r\n\r\nIt is shocking that this continues in 2018. It is important to pass the Food Insecurity Bill, which will monitor and report annually on food insecurity providing data on which government can plan to tackle the root causes.\r\nhttps://services.parliament.uk/bills/2017-19/foodinsecurity.html",
        "background": "UNICEF data indicates that 1 in 10 children live in households experiencing severe food insecurity. The Trussell trust has reports foodbank use has hit a record high. We are ordinary citizens horrified that so many families are not receiving adequate food. This Bill will investigate the issue.",
