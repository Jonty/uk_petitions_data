That's up to schools. However, the Government does required a foreign language GCSE as part of the English Baccalaureate. Some universities also require them for entry.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition calling for the Government to no longer require a foreign language as part of the English Baccalaureate if that's something you would like to see happen."
