These men felt they had nowhere to go. My petition is to reduce suicide altogether. Suicide in the community. Suicide in prison. Suicide everywhere. If a person feels so bad that they have to take their own life they have been failed massively. The government needs to take more responsibility for this epidemic. And do it swiftly. Please everyone back me on this. I\u2019m tired of the loss and the heartache xx",
