        "additional_details": "In June 2016, Theresa May promised that, \"Brexit means Brexit\". In the same speech, she promised, \"I will therefore create a new government department responsible for conducting Britain\u2019s negotiation with the EU and for supporting the rest of Whitehall in its European work. That department will be lead by a senior secretary of state and I will make sure that the position is taken by a Member of Parliament who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU.\"",
        "background": "The Prime Minister, by announcing that she will lead negotiations with the EU, while DExEU will only prepare, has broken her promise and lost the trust of the voting public and a significant part of her party and MPs.",
