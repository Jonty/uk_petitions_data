        "additional_details": "Your deadline is too late for our generation. Not only does plastic waste ruin our fragile, beautiful environment, it is becoming harmful to our health. Companies use plastic. They need to be more culpable for the amount of unnecessary plastic being produced. This can be enforced by the government as you can change polices to prevent this or heavily tax companies that produce excess plastic. Please consider our words.\r\n\r\nYours hopefully, Year 6 Sandgate Primary School",
        "background": "Our planet is being consumed by plastic. It is a major crisis. Plastic has taken thousands lives of sea wildlife. By 2050 there is going to be more plastic in the sea than fish. 2042 is too late for us! We're children. We can't do anything about the production of plastic but you can.",
