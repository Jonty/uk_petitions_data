        "additional_details": "We have recently seen (December 2018) the scant disregard for the safety of aircraft, passengers and staff by those intentionally flying an unmanned drone over protected airspace at London Gatwick Airport.\r\n\r\nGiven the risk to human life from such reckless actions, and the significant cost and disruption, signatories to this period want to see the minimum sentence raised to ten years and used for mindless idiots endangering life.",
        "background": "The signatories to this petition want to see the maximum sentence for flying an unmanned drone over a UK airport increased from 5 to 10 years.\r\n\r\nWe also want clear direction given to the courts that severe sentences - close to or at the maximum - should be handed down for such reckless behaviour.",
