        "additional_details": "An increase to 2.75 days per month (5 additional days annually) would allow employees to reset mentally, acquire an improved work/life balance and provide stronger work place morale. \r\nStudies consistently show that breaks from the work place allow employees to boost their creativity levels, which CEO\u2019s believe to be the number 1 most important trait in their employees.\r\nThe economy and employers would ultimately benefit as a result of this betterment.",
        "background": "Legal annual leave entitlement currently sits at 28 days per year. \r\n28 days per year gives us employees 2.3 days per month. \r\nI believe that this should gain a modest but reasonable increase, to improve the health and well-being of our work force.",
