        "action": "Declare the Brexit referendum void as public information was misleading & false",
        "additional_details": "A simple search for statements related to \"Brexit lies\" will generate pages of information, both for and against the idea that information may have been misrepresented. This petition aims to demonstrate that a substantial element of public sentiment was not captured in the original Brexit vote, nor has it been sufficiently represented subsequently. Far from delivering what the public really wants, current rhetoric risks the same damage to public trust which the House claims it wishes to avoid.",
        "background": "Information presented by both sides during 2016 Brexit referendum has been found, subsequently, to be apocryphal at best or, at worst, to be directly misleading. Had the result been a criminal conviction, it would have been quashed due to unsafe evidence; similar tests should apply to this vote.",
