This is clearly written in all universities\u2019 webpages. Non-EU citizens pay much higher fees.\r\n \r\nDespite paying exorbitant tuition fees in the Universities, I believe non-EU citizens are treated on an unequal platform in employment. It is time for EU and International to be treated on same point-based-immigration and employment system",
        "background": "I believe the current EU Freedom of Movement rules are unfair to many non-EU citizens, who are highly skilled and talented in seeking employment in the UK. The government should remove this practice and subject all non UK-nationality with point-based system as part of Brexit.",
