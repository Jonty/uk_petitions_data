        "additional_details": "Postgraduate courses can vary from \u00a36000 up to \u00a325000, meaning that students may have to find and extra \u00a315000 to pay for the course after and if they receive the full \u00a310000 loan from the government, that doesn\u2019t include living costs! This is clearly putting a number of students at a disadvantage and preventing them from studying postgraduate courses as many will not able to find this amount of money. We should be encouraging education, therefore a cap on fees would be the best option.",
        "background": "Postgraduate fees are not governed by the same rules that undergraduate fees are. Student are regularly left with a short fall and having to money to help pay for courses or living costs. There is no consistency with postgraduate fees like there is with undergraduate fees.",
