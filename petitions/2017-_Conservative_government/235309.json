Many pigs go through this process a number of times in their life so are unable to access their young or nurture them properly.\r\nhttps://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&context=ans_pubs",
        "background": "I know that sadly the last petition on the issue ended without receiving a debate. Pigs have high cognitive intelligence that has been proven to be higher than that of cats and dogs - it is cruel enough to put them through the pain of death and unwanted pregnancy, but a farrowing crate is torture.",
