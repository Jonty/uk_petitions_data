        "action": "Strip remainer MPs of their Knighthoods for acting in the interest of the EU",
        "additional_details": "These MPs have enabled the EU to hold this country to ransom and all but demand we hand over vast sums of money for nothing and carve up our country by ceding Ulster to the EU, or vote again and remain in the EU.  All of this is a betrayal of the people of the United Kingdom and our ancient democracy.  We the people would like remainer MPs with Knighthoods to be stripped of their Knighthoods for this betrayal",
        "background": "Since the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU, many remainer MPs have worked against the interests of the United Kingdom and have colluded with the EU.  By removing the government of 'No Deal' and demanding another referendum, they have given an advantage to the EU and weakened our position.",
