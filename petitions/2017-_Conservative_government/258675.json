        "additional_details": "The headlines over recent years have highlighted the real issues around Mental Health that are only recently coming up the priority list for the Government of the day.  I have many close friends who are on a Mental Health journey and the lack of resource even now is evident.  Also Mental Health in the community can be a challenge.  As who can you call to assist someone other than Police or Ambulance service; which in my humble opinion; were not intended to deal with such situations.",
        "background": "So many resources that are not set up to deal with Mental Health are drawn away from other duties.  It is really time to create a new service meet the needs of the population and at he same time free up the likes of the police and other services who get called to Mental Health related call outs.",
