        "additional_details": "This refers to PS4 and XBox digital download stores. Copying software (piracy) was once a problem but with subscriptions to gaming networks and digital signatures this is no longer possible, nor is it possible to use the games without these subscriptions. Some developers are now taking to \"hyping\" their games to promote pre-orders - to take money first and worry about problems later and there is nothing to stop the developer abandoning game support after sale. The CCR's are being exploited.",
        "background": "Software digital downloads are exempt from the CCR's. There's a trend developing where developers are producing software which doesn't do as claimed. Customers pay for downloads in advance and cannot get a refund if the software turns out not to be as described. Devs should also release demos first.",
