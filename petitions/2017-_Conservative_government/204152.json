        "action": "Change marriage law in England/Wales from registered buildings to celebrants.",
        "additional_details": "Currently in England and Wales couples must choose either a religious service in a church, or a wholly secular service in secular building, where they are not allowed anything even vaguely religious including music. Under the Scots system couples can choose any venue in which a celebrant is willing to conduct a marriage service, and a religious or civil ceremony. This means that couples can choose a religious ceremony in a greater choice of venues, and administration is simpler (and probably cheaper).",
        "background": "The Scots system of registered celebrants is very much simpler than the English and Welsh system of registered buildings, and it also affords greater flexibility to couples.",
