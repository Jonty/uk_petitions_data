        "action": "Fairer road fund licence rates for motorcycles.",
        "additional_details": "Motorcycles take up less space on our overcrowded roads, don't usually get held up in traffic and take up far less space when parked, as a result they will usually pollute less than most cars, yet motorcycles pay road fund licences based purely on engine size.  This means that modern, low emission machines can be paying \u00a385 per year compared to zero for similarly poluting cars.  We therefore call on the government to reduce the road fund licences on all motorcycles.",
        "background": "HMRC allows 24p per mile for business use on motorcycles yet allows 45p per mile for cars, it therefore seems unfair that motorcycles can pay considerably more in road fund licence than cars with similar emissions, they should be encouraged to be part of an integrated traffic solution not penalised.",
