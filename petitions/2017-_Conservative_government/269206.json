        "additional_details": "Diabetics can improve their HbA1 level using the sensor, as it\u2019s quick and convenient to regularly scan. \r\n\r\nGood glucose control reduces the risk of complications, which are very expensive to treat.\r\n\r\nThese devices can track of the glucose readings over the last 8 hours, helping diabetics to improve control through using these insights.\r\n\r\nThe NHS could reduce consultations as data can be uploaded. By making a sensor affordable, more people can gain access and everyone can benefit.",
        "background": "Many diabetes are forced to 100% self-fund the use of flash glucose monitoring systems \r\n\r\nThis petition is to recognise that there is no justification in not at least offering the sensor to diabetics for the difference in cost between using test strips and lancets and the `freestyle libre sensor.",
