        "additional_details": "It is becoming a large issue in the UK that consumers have no idea about where their produce has come from, how it lived or how it died. This is not good enough. Many people want to be able to eat meat responsibly, buy local produce where possible and consume more ethically. Without the key information being provided on labels this is an impossibility. The UK needs to review what is mandatory on labels especially food items so that the minority and the majority are allowed to make their choices.",
        "background": "It must become mandatory to label produce with country of origin, animal welfare standard and most importantly slaughter method. This is a basic consumer right in order to make an informed choice about produce. Must be brought in as part of Brexit, the food industry has to become more transparent.",
