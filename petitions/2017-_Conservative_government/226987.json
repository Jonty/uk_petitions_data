        "additional_details": "The complaints against Boris Johnson will be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the Tory party's board, which has the power to expel him.\r\n\r\nBUT!!  There are MANY of us who actually AGREE with Boris!!   Let's balance this out and show parliament there is a HUGE flip-side to these complaints about him.  \r\n\r\nLet's tell them Boris Johnson is merely saying what MANY MANY of us are ALREADY thinking!! \r\n\r\nSign this petition in support of Boris Johnson MP.",
        "background": "The Tory party has received dozens of complaints about Mr Johnson's comments in the press this week about Muslim women wearing burkas. \r\n\r\nBoris rejected calls to apologise for saying people wearing burkas looked like \"letter boxes\" or \"bank robbers\".",
