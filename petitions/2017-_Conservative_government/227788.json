        "additional_details": "Knife crime, scooter mugging, drug taking and obesity are all escalating issues amongst young people both as perpetrators and victims. National Conscription for one year with the opporuntiy to volunteer abroad could be such a constructive initiative following the lead of Norway, Denmark and Israel - three of the happiest, most disciplined, best-educated countries in the world. Germany, France and Italy are considering something similar.",
        "background": "It seems it would be more constructive to direct school leavers at 16 or 18 to have the opportunity to be part of a group who provide the opportunity to engage in social positive role model building than to be unemployed and idle when so much help is needed across society. A better use of gov money.",
