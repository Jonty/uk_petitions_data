        "additional_details": "17,410,742 people and 406 constituencies voted leave. That\u2019s 406 MPs elected as our voice who should be delivering the result, not frustrating it! Parliament should set party politics aside and stand together for the sake of democracy. With the PM weakened and ready to sign us up as a rule taker - we need to stop this and petition parliament to give the PM power to walk away. No deal IS better than a bad deal so please stop listening to scaremongering politicians and SIGN up to save our future!",
        "background": "On 23rd June 2016 the UK took part in the greatest democratic exercise in our history as we voted to leave the EU. 2 years on party in-fighting and government instability has led to the negotiations being dominated by the EU, who have shown complete and utter contempt for our democratic decision.",
