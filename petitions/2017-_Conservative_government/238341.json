        "additional_details": "I regularly drive along the A1 from Yorkshire to Cambridgeshire and I am truly ashamed of the huge amount of rubbish that I see.  I feel money must be made available to have this litter collected and higher fines should be implemented for people who are seen to litter.  We need more bins in our layby\u2019s which are emptied regularly.  I am a volunteer litter picker in my village but I feel helpless in respect of the massive litter problem that I witness on our roadsides daily.",
        "background": "The amount of litter on the side of our roads is shameful. We have a beautiful country which is  blighted by the huge amount of rubbish on our verges. It gives such a bad impression to visitors to our country, it is detrimental to our wildlife and iits a sad reflection of our throw away society.",
