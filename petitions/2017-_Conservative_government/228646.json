        "additional_details": "When not supposed to be on site, it will also help them to be identified by the pupils and parents etc. I strongly believe that figures in authority should lead by the examples they lead and follow the same rules as the pupils with uniforms and piercing and hair cuts etc police ambulance firefighters etc all wear uniforms so teachers should too.",
        "background": "Pupils have to wear uniforms for numerous reasons and if not are punished and sent home even if parents cannot afford it. I think it would be fair for teachers to have to wear them too to set examples to the students and also for security reasons to help prevent non staff members being on site.",
