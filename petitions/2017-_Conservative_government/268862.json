        "additional_details": "As a family we often take my niece to play centers to try and stimulate her. We also hope that by her watching other children play, it may encourage her to attempt the things she is unable to do by watching the other children, which always brings a smile to her face. We take her down the slides and into the ball pit ourselves so that she is able to have a little fun. For my sister to be charged \u00a35 for her child who cannot be left unsupervised is disgusting and discriminating. I think a discounted price should be given to all disabled children.",
