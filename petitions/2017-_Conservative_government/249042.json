        "additional_details": "When you walk into a supermarket, you are surrounded by plastic. There is no alternative when buying products, the only option available is single use plastics or occasionally, recyclable plastic which is then packaged with single use plastic. If there was a ban on these plastics we would not have the option to buy them and it would cut our use dramatically.",
        "background": "We are set to see drastic changes to our planet in our lifetime and these changes will be devastating. There is a large section of our population that are not aware of the severity of the situation and this is why there needs to be a ban that makes damaging products unavailable.",
