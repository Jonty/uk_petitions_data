If the EU wishes at some future time to have mutual tariff free trade with the UK this can be offered without additional conditions on their part.   \r\n\r\nThe Government mustn't give a penny to the EU following the withdrawal date. The British people haven't given you a mandate to give our money to the EU, the mandate you have is to leave!",

We want full control over our laws, immigration policy and to end all payments to the EU. We want to have control over animal welfare to ban live exports, the import of fur and foie gras.",
