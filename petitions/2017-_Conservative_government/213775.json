        "additional_details": "Mandatory vaccination laws are already being introduced in other European nations such as Italy. The introduction of such a law would save many lives. Vaccinations proposed to be compulsory would include, but not be limited to, those against tetanus, measles, and hepatitis B.",
        "background": "The absence of vaccinations for young children is a serious threat to both the child in question and others around him or her. Not vaccinating poses a risk of serious infection and transmission of contagious diseases. Vaccinations do not have serious long term effects or any health risks.",
