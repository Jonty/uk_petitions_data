        "action": "Implement a system whereby Voters can re-call their MP triggering a by-election",
        "additional_details": "Only those who voted for an MP should be able to initiate a re-call, this would prevent a malicious recall being instigated by supporters of opposing Candidates.\r\nIt is important that voters remain anonymous in the poll, the ballot paper would be given randomly, but would have a detachable stub with e.g. a unique number or bar-code matching the ballot.  A voter could then (later) present the stub to the returning officer proving their right to re-call and if enough do so, a by-election is called.",
        "background": "Many voters chose their local MP based on policies in the party manifesto and promises made in the local campaigns.  If the MP subsequently changes their stance on an issue which is important to those constituents, there is no option to remove them and their tenure is guaranteed until an election.",
