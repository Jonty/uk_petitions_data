        "action": "Parliament debate whether Israel has 'improper influence' over British Politics",
        "additional_details": "An investigation revealed plots by the Israeli diplomat to destroy the careers of numerous senior politicians. It is only on the basis of an investigation that Parliament and the British public will be reassured that such activities will not be tolerated by ANY British government. Therefore, and due to the Mrs May's outright rejection of a public inquiry into the matter, I feel it is deemed necessary to debate whether Israel has improper influence over British politics.",
        "background": "Theresa May has 'rejected' calls, from the leader of the opposition party, for a public inquiry, into alleged 'improper influences' in British politics by Israel. This is wrong.",
