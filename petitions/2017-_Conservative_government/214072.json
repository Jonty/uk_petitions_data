        "additional_details": "An investigation revealed plots by the Israeli diplomat to destroy the careers of numerous senior politicians. It is only on the basis of an investigation that Parliament and the British public will be reassured that such activities will not be tolerated by ANY British government. Therefore, and due to the Mrs May's outright rejection of a public inquiry into the matter, I feel it is deemed necessary to debate whether Israel has improper influence over British politics.",
        "background": "Theresa May has 'rejected' calls, from the leader of the opposition party, for a public inquiry, into alleged 'improper influences' in British politics by Israel. This is wrong.",

This is built on decades of cooperation between our two countries across a range of fields such as education, hi-tech research, business, arts and culture. Trade between our countries is at record levels, and Israel is an important strategic partner for the UK.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not agree with the allegation of improper influence stated in the petition. \r\n\r\nIn 2017 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was made aware of comments made by a member of staff at the Israeli Embassy in 2017 who was being secretly filmed. Following the publication of this video, the Israeli Ambassador apologised and was clear the comments made by this member of staff do not reflect the views of the Embassy or Government of Israel. The UK has a strong relationship with Israel and we consider the matter closed.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
