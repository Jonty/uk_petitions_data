        "additional_details": "Drastic measures are needed for the sake of our children, grandchildren and their children's future: banning the use of private motor vehicles nationwide on Sundays would be one drastic action to cut pollution and raise awareness of the human race's plight in these changing times, one small sacrifice for the future of all people and the Earth.This has been done before: as a consequence of the 1973 oil crisis, some European countries, among other measures, banned the use of private motor vehicles on Sundays to save energy. Many european cities regularly ban or restrict the use of private motor vehicles on Sundays to reduce air pollution.\r\nPublic transport and emergency services would continue to operate as normal.",
        "background": "We know from scientific consensus that if nothing is done now, catastrophic earth events are likely to occur within the next 12 years due to pollution, climate change and desecration of the planet, putting at risk the very survival of the human race.",
