        "action": "Parliament to vote of withdrawing Article 50",
        "additional_details": "Brexit is a huge constitutional change that must NOT be made without The fully informed consent of the British People. That has not been obtained by this Government . People were misled by lies and interference from foreign sources. Electoral fraud was committed. Article 50 should never have been triggered when it was, and the whole situation is now intolerable.  We must withdraw Article 50, since time is now short.",
        "background": "Brexit is clearly unconstitutional, and hugely damaging to the UK. Article 50 must be withdrawn, and a long breathing space allowed for the present furore to die down and for sober views to prevail.",
