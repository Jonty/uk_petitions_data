        "action": "Allow postgraduate students the right to financial support for childcare.",
        "additional_details": "Discrimination of parents wishing to complete postgraduate study means they are financially excluded from completing positions which, if afforded support for childcare costs, they would be able to complete. Following postgraduate study, when in employment they would pay a higher rate of tax and would contribute more to the repayment of undergraduate loans. As it stands parents of young children are financially  better off remaining on income support than pursuing funded postgraduate positions.",
        "background": "Postgraduate students are not classed as eligible for working tax credits, nor are they recognized as students due to not being in receipt of a student loan. This excludes parents from receiving financial support for childcare that is afforded to working parents or undergraduate parents.",
