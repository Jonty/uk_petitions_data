        "additional_details": "In what is a significantly emotional time, the added stress and emotional turmoil experienced by women like myself and others around the country is simply quite unnecessary and could be avoided. \r\n\r\nTo amend the birth certificate requires legal representation which adds significant financial and emotional stress during what is already a very traumatic time. I hope that this petition can make the process of registering the father\u2019s details easier and without the need for legal representation.",
        "background": "I am starting this petition as currently, unmarried couples are unable to register a deceased father\u2019s details on his child\u2019s birth certificate. When registering the birth of child who\u2019s father has died during the pregnancy, the father\u2019s details are left blank. This shows a lack of empathy & respect",
