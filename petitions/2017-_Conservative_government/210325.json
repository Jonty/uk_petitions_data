Why should we not be entitled to the living wage?\r\n\r\nAt the age of 16 you are permitted to have a child and be expected to provide. At 17 you can drive and own a car, which needs upkeep. At the age of 18 you can buy a home which come with bills and expenses.\r\n\r\nTo discriminate on age is unacceptable. The government does not know an individuals curcumstance.",
        "background": "At the age of 21 you are regarding as an adult. You pay the same rates as a person 25+ and receive no tax reduction, discount on food/petrol/electricity/mortgage bills, etc. Why then, does the living wage only apply to the 25 and overs? Help the younger home owners and families live and provide.",
