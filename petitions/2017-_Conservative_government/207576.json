I can't put gas on at all because I can't afford  it and I haven't been able to buy food for the past 3 month. And I'm single and live on my my own god for bit these poor people with children.",
        "background": "The law states they can take up to 40 per cent of your universal credit payments which is leaving many people in poverty, lifes are now in danger. It's absurd to think you can take nearly half of the amount the law states u need live on and expect people to be able to afford the essentials + bills.",
