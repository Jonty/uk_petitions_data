        "action": "Ban Staples From Newspapers",
        "additional_details": "Staples are for the most part made using steel which is produced with the requirement of a blast furnace and this using large amounts of energy. No staples would also mean that newspapers would be more easily recyclable due to the absence of metal and the decay of newspapers would be much increased.\r\nBanning staples would bring down production costs for newspaper companies And would create a safer environment in factories.",
        "background": "Staples are an unnecessary addition to newspapers which are an environmental liability - this petition asks the government to ban the use of staples in newspaper production.",
