        "action": "Increase funding for councils, so they are able to deliver better services",
        "additional_details": "In a trend that is increasingly common with local authorities nationwide, my council has seen its funding reduced by 48 per cent since 2011, equating to \u00a373m. Further financial pressures such as inflation, increased demand on adult and child services have meant my council was forced to save \u00a394m in that time, putting further strain on other services. This cannot continue. We urge government to increase funding for councils. Vital services are being closed, it is not acceptable to the people. We are suffering.",
        "background": "My council is facing more reductions in funding from the government. With a growing and aging population comes the need for public services. Housing is widely considered to be in crisis up and down the country. These cuts are unrealistic and are having a huge impact on people\u2019s lives.",
