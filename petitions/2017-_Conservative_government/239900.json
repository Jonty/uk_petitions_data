        "additional_details": "Since 2016, we have seen a direct and deliberate attempt by MP's of all political persuasions, to disregard and dismiss the democratic will of the electorate. \r\n\r\nThey were given clear instruction to end our involvement with the EU project. Yet I believe at every juncture they persist with a plethora of reasons not to carry out that instruction. This petition aims to ensure future generations that they will no longer have to put up with career politicians, who seem to think they know better than the people who elect them.",
        "background": "For decades we have seen a conveyor belt of politicians of all parties that I believe are completely out of touch with the electorate. This petition will provide the vehicle to clear the decks and allow more normal people the chance to make a difference, with fresh thinking and fresh ideas.",
