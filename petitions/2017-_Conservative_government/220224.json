        "additional_details": "With our vehicles currently having a white registration plate at the front it would make sense to match this with a white registration plate at the back.",
        "background": "In many countries around the world registration plates on vehicles tend to be white at the front and white at the back. In the UK our rear plate is yellow, which spoils the appearance of our vehicles. White number plates would go with any body paintwork colour and this should be adopted.",
