        "action": "Hold a general election and a 3-option referendum to decide brexit",
        "additional_details": "This solution will heal divisions and allow voters to elect new MPs to improve trust in parliament without their choices having to be skewed by opinions on BREXIT. The referendum could be implemented using points scoring, whereby voters can express preference for a first choice and a second choice, with the first choice scoring 2 points and the second choice scoring 1 point. The new government must implement the referendum result based on the highest total points scored by each option.",
        "background": "General election with a confirmatory referendum is essential before BREXIT. Voters choose from: a) Hard brexit (no deal), b) Soft brexit (Mrs May\u2019s deal), c) Remain in EU (repeal article 50), expressing preference for 1st & 2nd choices. New government must be obliged to implement referendum result.",
