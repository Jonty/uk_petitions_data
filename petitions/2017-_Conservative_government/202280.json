        "additional_details": "Stoma patients face prejudice from both the able and visibly disabled communities. Stoma patients are forcibly pushed and pulled out of the way when trying to access disabled facilities. 21,000 people are left with a stoma every year, this is a growing issue.",
        "background": "Stoma patients have unseen disabilities and although entitled to use disabled toilets, often face verbal abuse from the public when trying to access them. Stoma patients need a hygienic area to change ostomies and this is not provided. Unseen stoma disabilities need protection and recognition.",
