Approved Document M gives statutory guidance for new facilities, includes the needs of stoma patients and advises on the use of well recognized signage. Layouts for unisex accessible toilets already include coat hooks, a small shelf, a waste disposal bin and a wash hand basin. Guidance in Part M (Access to and use of buildings) of the Building Regulations also refers to the British Standard BS 8300-2:2018 Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment. Buildings. Code of practice. This standard makes further recommendations as to how a toilet can provide changing accommodation including facilities for users of stoma bags.\r\n\r\nBuilding Control Bodies check for compliance of new accessible WC\u2019s, but the Building Regulations only apply to building work, and do not extend to the management of buildings in use. The Equality Act sets out a \u201creasonable adjustment duty\u201d and service providers are expected to anticipate the reasonable adjustments that stoma patients may require and manage how toilets are used by different users without discrimination. Designating unisex accessible toilets with stoma signs would segregate rather than include stoma patients. \r\n\r\nGovernment is considering how current guidance supporting Part M works for stoma patients.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government",
