        "action": "Boris Johnson continues to prorogue Parliament & get UK out of EU deal/no deal.",
        "additional_details": "The decision to Prorogue Parliament while not specifically done to thwart the Remainers has caused a lot of posturing and anti democratic statements from Remain side. Boris Johnson should be allowed to fulfill the result of the vote three years ago to leave the EU with or without a deal, it is not necessary to go back to the people to ratify a no deal Brexit, we voted out with no conditions. Remainers need to remember who they are representing and get on with carrying out the democratic decision.",
        "background": "The UK voted by a majority to leave the EU three years ago, it was a clear in or out vote, politicians who don't agree with this democratic decision seek to undermine it by saying we did not know what we were voting for! Boris Johnson seeks to uphold the original democratic decision, support him.",
