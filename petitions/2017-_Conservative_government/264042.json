Your employee should not single out individual employees for drug or alcohol testing unless this is justified by the nature of their job.\r\nHowever, by publishing the results, including if an individual refused a test the threat of deselection would make sure most of them would act responsibly.",
        "background": "With the publics lack of confidence in our governing bodies at an all-time low and PM candidates admitting to drug use, a cleanup with the threat of immediate sacking of positive drug results and suspensions for alcohol excess would help to restore some of the public confidence",
