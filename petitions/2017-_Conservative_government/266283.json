        "additional_details": "Our next PM will be chosen for the Tory membership, Theresa May was chosen ONLY by MPs ( although did go to the country and lose the majority), Gordon Brown was chosen by the Labour party only. \r\n\r\nThe PM needs a mandate from the country, not from its party only.",
        "background": "A change in leader resulting in a change in PM also results in the manifesto mandate being lost by the new leader or they are hamstrung by their predecessors promises. Similarly, despite being a constituency democracy, people do vote for leaders, that's why we have leaders debates on National TV.",
