        "additional_details": "Stolen defibrillators are unlikely to have a warranty or user guide and may be excluded from product recall as serial numbers would not be recorded. Theft puts lives at risk for both the new owner and the community, school or charity who have lost their defibrillator which may have cost considerable time and fundraising to provide. Correctly used alongside effective CPR, defibrillators increase the chance of survival from Sudden Cardiac Arrest from 6% to 74%.\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2Mca2gN\r\nhttps://bbc.in/2Hk6Gpp\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2ONCCXu\r\nhttps://bit.ly/2IPiUGZ",

An Approved Supplier List would eliminate a black market for the sale of stolen defibrillators so they are not targeted by thieves and are accessible for emergencies at all times.",
