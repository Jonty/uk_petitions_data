We aren't sure whether you want to disqualify those people from signing petitions or not.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like the rules on petitions to change, so that only people with National Insurance numbers are eligible to sign petitions and need to provide their NI number to sign, you could start a new petition asking for that.
