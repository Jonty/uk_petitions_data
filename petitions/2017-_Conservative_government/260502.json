        "additional_details": "As the NHS begins to fail, tackling mental health at a young age and teaching children healthy coping mechanisms would reduce the need for professional help, later in their adulthood, putting less strain on the NHS system in the future. The usual cupcake sales are not going to save lives. A new approach within the early agents of socialisation need to be taken, the most effective being through compulsory education.",
        "background": "Mental health; a topic never addressed. Every child deserves the chance to receive emotional guidance. No matter who you are or where you come from mental health can affect you, however receiving this compulsorily means children receive this guidance without feeling its victimising them individually",
