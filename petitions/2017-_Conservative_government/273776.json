        "additional_details": "Parliament now want to ask for a further delay beyond 21st october 2019 as time has run down and this again is further costing the public.\r\nTherefore it should be made illegal to ask for an extension without a valid reason/plan to strike a deal. Brexit should not be delayed because mps are still trying to undermine the peoples democratic vote.",
        "background": "Brexit was delayed in march as the deal put forward from eu was rejected. Since then parliament have not resolved the issue but instead wasted time playing political games at a cost of 1bn to the public each month.",
