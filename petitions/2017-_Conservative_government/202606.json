It is, however, a condition of funding for some education providers. There are circumstances in which students can be exempt; for example, if they have multiple and complex needs. \r\n\r\nYou can find out more here (page 50): https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/607246/16_to_19_funding_guidance_2017_to_2018_v_1.0__003_.pdf \r\n\r\nYou may wish to speak to your education provider about this issue. \r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition asking for all students with special educational needs to be automatically exempt, if that's what you want to happen.
