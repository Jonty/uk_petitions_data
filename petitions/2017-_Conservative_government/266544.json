        "additional_details": "The UK prides itself as having a robust and transparent democracy, yet there is currently a huge hole in our democratic process. Election of party leaders must be done by party members. However when this also leads to a change in PM then a fresh mandate from the people must be sort. A new PM also means a change in how the country is governed both within cabinet and the direction the country takes. Any PM whatever there political views must have a mandate from the people in order to govern.",
