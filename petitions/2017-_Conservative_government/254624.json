In particular, we're not sure what question you want a referendum on.\r\n\r\nYou could start a new petition explaining clearly what you would like the Government or Parliament to do.\r\n\r\nThere are already petitions calling for article 50 to be revoked, followed by a referendum. You might like to sign one of these if it calls for something you want to happen. You're more likely to get action on an issue if you sign and share a single petition.\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/237168\r\n\r\nhttps://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/245960\r\n"
