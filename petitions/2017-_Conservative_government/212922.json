Because one of the factors taken to the account by CMS is the time child spends with a paying parent. It is very easy for receiving parent to get more money and affect child live routine , only by reducing, controlining and manipulate the time that child spends with paying parent (mainly father).",

This affects the child and paying parent relations and lives.",
