        "action": "Drop the EU Withdrawal Agreement on the basis that it is unconstitutional.",
        "additional_details": "VAT was introduced on joining the EEC. It replaced the similar Purchase tax to avoid double taxation. VAT is therefore an EU mandated tax, irrespective of whether the EU is the main beneficiary or because it's collected by HMRC. The EU control the rate for competition reasons between member states and will retain ultimate jurisdiction in the UK over it. This is not a petition to \"get rid of\" VAT, but against the ramifications and precedents the EUWA may have on our fundamental rights",
        "background": "The EU Withdrawal Agreement (EUWA) stipulates that we will have no representation in the EU Parliament while mandating we still pay VAT at rates limited by the EU. This means British citizens will be taxed without representation which is unconstitutional and may set a \"taxes for deals\" precedent.",
