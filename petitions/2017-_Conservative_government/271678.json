        "additional_details": "This has the knock on effect of lowering the number of deployable officers & lengthening the waiting times for victims.\r\nMaking it a legal requirement would not only free up officers, shortening the vehicle stop time, assist the police with a legal photographic identification document but save the service money and make them readily available to respond to other incidents.\r\nAdditional benefits would be to help identify seriously/fatally injured drivers thus informing their family members quicker.",
        "background": "Hours of police time are being wasted on a daily basis when conducting vehicle stops  & completing driving licence checks. This is because some drivers are unable to provide their details as it is shown on the licence, resulting in their driver records not being found, prolonging the stop for 30mins",
