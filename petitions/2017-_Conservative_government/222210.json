It is poorly termed which in turn is open to an invalid judgement.School Refusal sounds like a choice to not attend school, when it is in fact the extreme level of anxiety that prevents them from being able.There is a great amount of feedback to suggest that school environments are not suitable as they clash with a child's sensory problems due to un/ diagnosed spectrum conditions.",
        "background": "School Refusal is a term describing children having difficulty attending school due to extreme anxiety.Parents are fined for low attendance.There is evidence to suggest that this anxiety is linked to conditions on the Spectrum.Children need this recognised as an illness & staff trained accordingly.",
