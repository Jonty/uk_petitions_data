Not to mention, it is the home of our national team.\r\nWith all due respect to the FA, I think they don\u2019t know what they are doing. Hence, the parliament and the government need to act quickly to stop them and protect the public interest. The FA is not merely selling the stadium, they selling the fans\u2019 souls as well. \r\nI urge everyone who loves Wembley Stadium to sign this petition.",
