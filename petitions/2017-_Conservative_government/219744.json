        "action": "Increase the VAT threshold for small businesses.",
        "additional_details": "Small companies make up 96% of the business in the UK and contribute to 33% of employment and 22% of turnover. I feel that if small companies - specifically ones that cater purely to the needs of private households where added VAT is only a hinderance for all involved - had an increased VAT threshold of anywhere between \u00a3110,000-\u00a3150,000 then they would be encouraged to grow and in doing so support the UK economy even more.",
        "background": "As a small business that operates on a purely residential basis - in private homes where any added VAT is not claimed back by home owners - I feel that all small businesses would benefit from a raised VAT cap which would allow them to grow and would boost the economy further.",
