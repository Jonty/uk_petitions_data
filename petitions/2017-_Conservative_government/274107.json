        "additional_details": "Mp's and ex PM's are working in their own interests and not for their electoratate, their country or even democracy. \r\nThe referendum was over 3 years ago and still nothing has been done. The government are unable to deliver on that referendum due to what I believe to be traitorous acts by the now majority of MP's. A General election would allow the public to vote for someone who will genuinely carry out their wishes",
        "background": "We now have a government unable to make any decision due to its minority position. \r\nMany MP's are defying their constituents the democratic choice by going against the reason they were voted into power. I believe this is fundamentally wrong.",
