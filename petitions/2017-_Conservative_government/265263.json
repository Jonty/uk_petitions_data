Mankind Initiative is probably the biggest agency to support men, predominantly through their helpline which they fund themselves.\r\nThis is wrong and has to change. 40% of all victims are male (that we know about) and their needs should be reflected as such with equal funding for support.",
        "background": "40% of domestic abuse victims are male, but funding doesn't represent this. This hasn't helped men to come forward to seek help. The Government need to understand the needs of male victims to represent them equally to female victims in facilities, law and funding.",
