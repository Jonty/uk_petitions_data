        "additional_details": "By stating this, it stands to reason all average speed cameras are unsafe\r\n \r\nGiven the similarities between the dummy camera and normal average speed cameras, I believe Highways England have effectively stated all average speed cameras are distracting. \r\n\r\nThe government rightly outlawed the use of mobile phones behind the wheel because they are distracting. It is therefore reasonable for all average speed cameras to be banned. ",
        "background": "Highways England have declared that an incredibly realistic looking 'dummy' average speed camera is distracting and therefore is unsafe for the public, and have requested Bedfordshire county council have the camera removed.",
