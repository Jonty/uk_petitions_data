        "additional_details": "People live in the United Kingdom unlawfully and they must for 20 years before they qualify for leave to remain (2.5 years visa NOT Indefinite stay).\r\n \r\nThose granted with 2.5 visa do NOT qualify for access to public funds, therefore, they are not able to claim benefits.\r\n \r\nPeople living unlawfully in the UK work illegally in exploitative situations. It is therefore unreasonably harsh to perpetuate a degrading lifestyle for 20 years when it could be reduced to 15 years.",
