        "action": "Improve mental healthcare provisions available for prisoners",
        "additional_details": "90% of prisoners experience some form of mental health condition whilst in prison (Singleton et al., 1998) and acute disorders such as psychosis are extremely high (Bebbington et al., 2016).  Suicide and self harm rates are at an all time high (Fazel et al., 2017).\r\nWhilst HMPPS and the NHS alongside the department of health provide \"in reach teams\" to help those suffering from a mental health condition, more needs to be done.",
        "background": "Levels of mental health conditions amongst prisoners are disproportionately high compared to those in society.  Despite this, provisions available for prisoners are lacking and the prison environment itself can be a driving force which exacerbates a mental health condition opposed to combatting it.",
