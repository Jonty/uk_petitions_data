        "additional_details": "We need funding to actually respond to 999 emergency calls, to educate, engage and complete outreach activities to try and decrease crime. Particularly in young people and youth clubs. As a professional working with young people I feel that we should have the support needed, this includes, police presence, responses to 999 calls, and consistency. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s absolutely disgusting and devastating that you are put in a QUE when calling 999 as an emergency, how does that reassure anybody?",
        "background": "Majority of our police are resourced to Luton, however Houghton Regis, Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard have a high level of crimes being committed also. You should be able to call 999 in an \u2018EMERGENCY\u2019 and actually be reassured that you will be helped, reassured and receive a police presence.",
