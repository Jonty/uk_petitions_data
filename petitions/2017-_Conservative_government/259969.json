        "additional_details": "During my experience donating stem cells it became apparent that many people are keen to sign up to the register but they are discouraged by the fear that their employer will either not allow them the time off or will discriminate against them for taking the time off. \r\nThis petition calls for it to be a legal obligation for an employer to give an employee the required time off work if evidence can be provided that they are a match for a patient in need of a stem cell or bone marrow transplant.",
        "background": "Every single person who joins the Anthony Nolan and NHS Stem Cell Registry has the potential to give someone a second chance of life. An employer should not prevent that from happening. It could mean the different between life and death.",
