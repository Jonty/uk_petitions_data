        "additional_details": "A further referendum gives the government the opportunity to check whether, in the light of all that is now known, the country still wants to leave Europe. However, there will inevitably be continued unrest if the margin is so small as to leave a large minority dissatisfied. \r\nThe proposal is to allow the Government to ignore a result that fails to achieve 60% agreement.",
        "background": "The original Brexit vote has been so hard to act upon, in large part due to the closeness of the result. The 48% remain voters feel that the nearly half of the country are being ignored in the biggest constitutional issue of a lifetime.",
