        "additional_details": "This is why I propose we properly arm our police. Not with guns but with swords. The reasoning for this request is simple. Guns are a poor choice. They can easily inflict mortal wounds on targets I imagine in implementing guns we would be faced by many of the media out-cries the U.S.A faces. So I propose a more elegant solution. Sword tasers. The sword gives you ample range on any knife wielder and the taser allows you to easily incapacitate your foes.",
        "background": "We live in troubled times. Tyranny and terrorism run rampant. Our Police force stand against this threat but are significantly under equipped. I understand that they are a disciplined and well trained force but there is only so much one person can do when faced by an assailant with a knife.",
