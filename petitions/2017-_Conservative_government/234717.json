        "additional_details": "Examples of what Parliament needs to be able to challenge: \r\n1.

Endorsing and funding road infrastructure instead of on-shore and offshore wind turbine projects. \r\n3. Withdrawing support for the Swansea Bay Tidal Project lagoon. \r\n4. Nursing the new fracking industry(which releases the more hazardous methane as well as CO2) in spite of the need to keep fossil fuels underground.",
