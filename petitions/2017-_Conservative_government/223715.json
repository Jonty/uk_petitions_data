        "action": "Legislate to make all sewage treatment plants into biomass digesters.",
        "additional_details": "Raw sewage is also sprayed onto fields.  It still smells and is still releasing methane.  It is easily washed out and pollutes water and it has less benefit for the soil.  Processed sewage is drier and more composted.  There is little methane and and nutrients are locked inand are not so easily washed out therefore it feeds and conditions the soil. It can also be used all year round and not just on empty fields.",
        "background": "IThis has a number of benefits. Capping the tanks where the solid waste is digested would mean that less smell and methane (one of the worst greenhouse gases) is released into the atmosphere.  Instead it would be fed into the gas network reducing our reliance on imported or fracked gas.",
