        "action": "Abolish the Luxury Car Tax for EVs (Electric Vehicles)",
        "additional_details": "The tax contradicts numerous Government statements about wanting to do more to reduce emissions, improve air quality and push EVs & autonomous driving. Many EVs suitable as replacements for petrol/diesel cars are higher priced by virtue of the large, expensive batteries and advanced manufacturing required, and therefore cannot be cheaply produced. It is hypocritical to punish manufacturers and consumers for buying the same innovative electric cars the Government says they want on the road.",
        "background": "Cars valued at or exceeding \u00a340,000 are subject to the Luxury Car Tax (\u00a31600 over 5 years). This should be abolished for EVs as it impedes numerous Government initiatives and targets for transport and emissions. A tax refund should be available for those who paid the tax from at least 2019 onwards.",
