        "additional_details": "Party endorsement at the next election obviously depends on MPs sharing the overall aims of the party. But if it depends on them voting according to the party line on every specific issue, their ability to vote in good conscience, in the best interests of all their constituents, is seriously undermined.\r\n\r\nWe ask that political parties be banned from asking MPs (openly or through coded messages) to vote in a particular way on any particular issue.",
        "background": "Currently political parties can ask MPs to vote in a particular way through \u2018the whip\u2019. This is widely regarded as an instruction from the party leaders and, according to Parliament's website, defying a three-line whip can result in an MP being effectively expelled from their party.",
