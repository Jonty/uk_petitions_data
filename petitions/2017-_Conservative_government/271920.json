        "action": "Reform how the new exams in this country are ran and operated.",
        "additional_details": "Learning is about teaching people how to think. The new exams students sit doesn't project this principle. It revels in shoving a plethora of information down students throats,forcing them to remember paragraphs & paragraphs of text; sheets of equations. Students sitting the new GCSE's, (if sitting 10) learn 330% more information than before. Is forcing people to learn mark schemes & lines testing knowledge? Because they may not remeber quotes or equations doesn't mean they can't make use of it.",
        "background": "This pettiton has been passionately formed from a former student who has endured the ridiculous ways this country examines people. The standards set are ludicrous, unrealistic, and uneccesarily placed as a means of testing. I want others who feel the same to stand with me on a topic so important.",
