        "action": "Force a by-election if a Member of Parliament resigns the Whip",
        "additional_details": "Since 2017, 16 Members of Parliament voluntarily resigned the Whip in protest of different aspects of party politics, the most famous being the formation of Change UK/The Independents. All of these MPs were elected under a different party representing different views, so why are these MPs allowed to continue representing their constituents? A by-election should be called to give the vote back to the constituents to ensure they're being represented by the party and MP they democratically decide.",
        "background": "When a Member of Parliament resigns the Whip from the party that they are voted in with, the member is no longer part of that party, and no longer representative of the constituents. A by-election should therefore be called in order to give constituents a say on their Parliamentary representative.",
