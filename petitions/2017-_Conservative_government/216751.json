        "additional_details": "They must talk to us as well. The current situation is fundamentally undemocratic and wrong. A developer made a planning application for a supermarket down my little street. There is no parking, huge lorries will make deliveries and we were concerned our tiny road would not be big enough. Nobody in planning would listen to us. Elected councillors refused to discuss the planning application. My objection comments went unread: I was denied a voice: I was silenced.",
        "background": "If a local resident affected by a planning application requests a meeting, planning officers and councillors must meet them to discuss their concerns before a decision is made. Council officers discuss planning applications for months with developers and their army of planning consultants.",
