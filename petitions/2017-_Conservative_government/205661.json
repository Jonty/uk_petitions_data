        "additional_details": "I've just watched a parliament debate 20/11/17 4:30pm they made some very good points about the quality of the programs the jobs and skills the BBC provides (please watch it) which I'm sure most people would agree with but I don't know if these ministers are living in a bubble as the tv fee to some people who are struggling to eat or heat the tv licence fee is unachievable so I believe there should be some sort of discount for people because of no fault of there own ie illness,redundancy etc should be able to pay a reduced rate until there financial circumstances improve this may also help reduce the amount of evasion obviously the finer details ie the amount of discount the cost of running scheme and how low the income threshold would be to qualify would have to be debated",
        "background": "The current BBC tv licence fee only offers reduced fees for certain select groups( ie free for the over 75 etc)I believe there should be a reduced fee for people on very low incomes to be thought out in a sensible way",
