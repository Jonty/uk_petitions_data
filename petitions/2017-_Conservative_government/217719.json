As a multi-cultural nation, we should be celebrating all religions and not just one. This song symbolising the freedom of the United Kingdom and how we are independent. The lines \"I'm just living my life\" and \"I just think I'm free\" are perfect examples of this. as they represent our individuality as a nation. Finally, the song is a lot more catchy than the current anthem, making for a great choice.",
