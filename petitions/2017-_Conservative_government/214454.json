        "additional_details": "For years women have been spending money that they don\u2019t have on sanitary towels and tampons when in reality the money they are spending on these products could go to something like cost towards living and food for themselves or their family. Personally I think it is outrageous having to pay for something that we don\u2019t have a choice about, something that comes naturally. I\u2019d understand charging women for these products if having a period was a choice but it is clearly not a choice!",

It is appalling that women are forced to pay for these products when you have people who suffer from conditions such as PCOS which causes which can cause extremely heavy flow when it\u2019s that time of the month. Something should be done about this.",
