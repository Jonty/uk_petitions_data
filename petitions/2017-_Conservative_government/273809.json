        "additional_details": "In almost all other sectors of employment, one would be rewarded bonus of some sort to appreciate the job they do for their company. As a doctor or another NHS employee, if you get sick, you have to wait months to be seen by your colleagues to help with diagnosis and treatment. If we were provided with a rapid care, our quick recovery back to the NHS, means that patients won\u2019t suffer the consequences of their practitioner\u2019s absence.",
        "background": "As a GP, I feel there is a huge lack of rapid care and treatment for the NHS staff who help everyone out but no one there for them to be referred to promptly and seen by, when they are in need of help. NHS staff have to go on the same waiting list, take time out of work and miss treating patients.",
