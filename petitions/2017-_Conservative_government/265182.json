        "action": "Make NHS take vitamin B12 deficiency seriously and standardise deficiency levels",
        "additional_details": "Every area has their own standards at which point they will consider a B12 deficiency. For one area below 191 is considered deficient, however another area can have a range from 115 to 1000. You then have neurologists saying anything below 800 is deficient. Those suffering with this condition for a significant period can have life long symptoms including nerve damage. Current NHS guidance says 1 injection every 3 months but the effects from this vary and for some only help for a few weeks.",
        "background": "Vitamin B12 deficiency is not currently taken seriously by the NHS and is blamed on various other conditions and are pawned off onto other doctors because they do not have sufficient training and knowledge. Plus every location has differing levels at which they will acknowledge levels of deficiency",

For example, you could start a petition calling for increased funding for research into or treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency."
