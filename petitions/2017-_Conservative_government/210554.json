        "additional_details": "Anne-Marie Waters has tried everything in her power to raise awareness of her new party, The For Britain Movement.  This is not a criminal offence in any way, and she has said herself that she has no intention to break any laws.  Promoting a political party image falls within freedom of speech; something that can never be taken away.  All she wants to do is get public support for those that believe in her...What is the problem with that?",
        "background": "Anne-Marie Waters has every right to create her own Political Party, because she wants to get her own views in politics, and that is her right to do so.  Why the police, among other group, are doing everything in their power to sabotage her party is unacceptable.  Tell them it will not be tolerated.",
