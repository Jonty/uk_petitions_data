        "action": "Hold a referendum for devolution in the North of England.",
        "additional_details": "With growing cases of the North not having their issues and needs fairly addressed in the Southern biased Parliament, it is time that a referendum is held to offer those citizens North of the River Trent an opportunity to vote on devolution. This will provide a platform for issues relevant to the North of England to be considered without an underlying London-centricity.",
        "background": "In 2004 the North East of England had a devolution referendum. Due to the small turnout the same referendum for the North West of England was never held. It is the opinion of many that the socio-economic divide between the North and the South of England has grown exponentially over the past decade.",
