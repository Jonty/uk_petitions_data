        "action": "Make it illegal for teachers to search students' phones without consent.",
        "additional_details": "Teachers can search through student\u2019s phones with little more information than someone saying something to the teacher. This is completely ridiculous and happened recently at a school - where boys were forced to hand over their phones for the teacher to go through, despite the fact that what the teacher was insinuating had not happened and they had no more evidence to go through the phone other than a meaningless accusation. This is a violation of our privacy - and should not be allowed.",
        "background": "Ever since 2011 it has been legal for teachers to search through students\u2019 phones without the consent of the student. Students are human as well, and just because we are on school grounds does not mean we should lose our rights - unconsented searches are a complete violation of our rights to privacy",
