Our school have put together a petition to our local council for the road to be gritted but Salford council have refused saying there had only been one incident. \r\nIf this incident had happened 10 minutes earlier that could have been my children or my friends granddaughter. That doesn\u2019t bare thinking about. \r\nIt then dawned on me that could happen outside other schools?? Why aren\u2019t roads outside schools gritted?? What has to happen for this to become a done thing??? Does a child have to be killed because the council can\u2019t stretch to some extra grit?",
